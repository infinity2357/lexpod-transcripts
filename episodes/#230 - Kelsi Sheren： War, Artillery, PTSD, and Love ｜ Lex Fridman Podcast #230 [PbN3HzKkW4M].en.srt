curious about why people do what they do

curious about why people do what they do
 

407
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,029
curious about why people do what they do
like deeply deeply curious about it i'm

408
00:07:07,029 --> 00:07:07,039
like deeply deeply curious about it i'm
 

409
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:08,469
like deeply deeply curious about it i'm
not sure who's more interesting the

410
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:08,479
not sure who's more interesting the
 

411
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:10,309
not sure who's more interesting the
people that follow hitler or hitler

412
00:07:10,309 --> 00:07:10,319
people that follow hitler or hitler
 

413

himself
so i mean that the

416
00:07:13,749 --> 00:07:13,759
so i mean that the
 

417
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:15,510
so i mean that the
the question that's coupled with that is

418
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:15,520
the question that's coupled with that is
 

419
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,510
the question that's coupled with that is
uh would history roll out in similar

420
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:17,520
uh would history roll out in similar
 

421
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,749
uh would history roll out in similar
ways even if there wasn't a hitler you

422
00:07:19,749 --> 00:07:19,759
ways even if there wasn't a hitler you
 

423
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:22,150
ways even if there wasn't a hitler you
know it's the people that created the

424
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:22,160
know it's the people that created the
 

425
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,550
know it's the people that created the
hitler or did hit or create the events

426
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:24,560
hitler or did hit or create the events
 

427
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,230
hitler or did hit or create the events
of world war ii

that seems to be the that the
 

435
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:34,150
that seems to be the that the
charismatic leaders are all out there

why it's fascinating to kind of look

612
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:51,920
why it's fascinating to kind of look
 

613
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,150
why it's fascinating to kind of look
back at that time in history it's like

614
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:54,160
back at that time in history it's like
 

615
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,509
back at that time in history it's like
and think

616

are these the same humans
 

619
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:00,230
are these the same humans
and also are there echoes of that now

620
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:00,240
and also are there echoes of that now
 

621
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,110
and also are there echoes of that now
yes

yes
 

623
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,509
yes
and and are we is that going to happen

624
00:11:03,509 --> 00:11:03,519
and and are we is that going to happen
 

625
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,990
and and are we is that going to happen
again is there going to be a world war 3

again is there going to be a world war 3
this in some other kind of way is there

628
00:11:08,949 --> 00:11:08,959
this in some other kind of way is there
 

629
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,110
this in some other kind of way is there
going to be some mass scale injustice in

630
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:11,120
going to be some mass scale injustice in
 

631
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,509
going to be some mass scale injustice in
some other kind of way which uh we're

632
00:11:13,509 --> 00:11:13,519
some other kind of way which uh we're
 

633
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:17,670
some other kind of way which uh we're
not uh yet like because of our blindness

634
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:17,680
not uh yet like because of our blindness
 

635
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,750
not uh yet like because of our blindness
uh and maybe not learning the lessons of

636
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:19,760
uh and maybe not learning the lessons of
 

637
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,150
uh and maybe not learning the lessons of
history will will allow to happen again

638
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:22,160
history will will allow to happen again
 

639
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,110
history will will allow to happen again
and

640
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:23,120
and
 

641
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,190
and
and then obviously it's a very common

642
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:25,200
and then obviously it's a very common
 

643
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,269
and then obviously it's a very common
thing to whatever political leader you

644
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:27,279
thing to whatever political leader you
 

645
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:30,550
thing to whatever political leader you

differently
but there's no way there's not something

768
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:31,680
but there's no way there's not something
 

769
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,509
but there's no way there's not something
going on there deeply

going on there deeply
 

771
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,910

complexity in her case because um
i mean this is what just looking at

776
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:43,920
i mean this is what just looking at
 

777
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,910
i mean this is what just looking at
history about family

778
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:45,920
history about family
 

779
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:50,230
history about family
is she spent much of her early life

780
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:50,240
is she spent much of her early life
 

781
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,590
is she spent much of her early life
loving

783
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,189
loving
the dictator

784
00:13:53,189 --> 00:13:53,199
the dictator
 

785
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:55,350
the dictator
right we like the water or something

786
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:55,360
right we like the water or something
 

787

right we like the water or something
like we like water or we like this

788
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:57,120
like we like water or we like this
 

789
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,189
like we like water or we like this
because there is no like individual like

790
00:13:59,189 --> 00:13:59,199
because there is no like individual like
 

791
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:01,110
because there is no like individual like
when they said there was no love or

792
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:01,120
when they said there was no love or
 

793
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,430
when they said there was no love or
anything but there is a love for the

794
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:03,440
anything but there is a love for the
 

795
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,269
anything but there is a love for the
just that individual for that individual

796
00:14:05,269 --> 00:14:05,279
just that individual for that individual
 

797
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:07,990
just that individual for that individual
and so i mean it's like the ultimate

798
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:08,000
and so i mean it's like the ultimate
 

799
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,269
and so i mean it's like the ultimate
abusive relationship oh yeah and

800
00:14:11,269 --> 00:14:11,279
abusive relationship oh yeah and
 

801
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:13,750
abusive relationship oh yeah and
but but it's still love the experience

802
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:13,760
but but it's still love the experience
 

803
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,509
but but it's still love the experience
like you don't know the alternative so

804
00:14:15,509 --> 00:14:15,519
like you don't know the alternative so
 

805
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,110
like you don't know the alternative so
it's not even

806
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:17,120
it's not even
 

807
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,230
it's not even
it's complicated because like

808
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:20,240
it's complicated because like
 

809
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,629
it's complicated because like
i i wonder if she truly explored it what

810
00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:22,639
i i wonder if she truly explored it what
 

811
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:24,629
i i wonder if she truly explored it what
you would find because uh

00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,590
the trauma much of her trauma i think
comes from when she was escaping north

816
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:29,600
comes from when she was escaping north
 

817
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,350
comes from when she was escaping north
korea

818
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:31,360
korea
 

819
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,189
korea
treatment by china

820
00:14:33,189 --> 00:14:33,199
treatment by china
 

821
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:36,069
treatment by china
uh it's like the mom and what she had to

822
00:14:36,069 --> 00:14:36,079
uh it's like the mom and what she had to
 

823
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:38,230
uh it's like the mom and what she had to
witness within that and being helpless

824
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:38,240
witness within that and being helpless
 

825
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,590
witness within that and being helpless
with that on yeah

826
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:39,600
with that on yeah
 

827
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,910
with that on yeah
so it's like evil men essentially

828
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:41,920
so it's like evil men essentially
 

829
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,310
so it's like evil men essentially
abusing her trading her you know and and

830
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:44,320
abusing her trading her you know and and
 

831
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,389
abusing her trading her you know and and
doing so nonchalantly like it's part of

doing so nonchalantly like it's part of
 

833
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,710
doing so nonchalantly like it's part of
just the way of of life

834
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:48,720
just the way of of life
 

835
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,350
just the way of of life
that i wonder if she sees kind of

836
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:51,360
that i wonder if she sees kind of
 

837
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,430
that i wonder if she sees kind of
yeah it's so complicated because

838
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:53,440
yeah it's so complicated because
 

839
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,350
yeah it's so complicated because
childhood it would be normal to her

840
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:55,360
childhood it would be normal to her
 

841
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,030
childhood it would be normal to her
because she didn't know any different

842
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:57,040
because she didn't know any different
 

843
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,870
because she didn't know any different
exactly and there's

844
00:14:58,870 --> 00:14:58,880
exactly and there's
 

845
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,470
exactly and there's
like uh i grew up poor but i i never

846
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:02,480
like uh i grew up poor but i i never
 

847
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,829
like uh i grew up poor but i i never
sensed that

sensed that
because parents didn't make you well and

850
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:06,560
because parents didn't make you well and
 

851
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,470
because parents didn't make you well and
everyone else around was too right and

00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,550
everyone else around was too right and
so you don't notice it i mean it's a

854
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:10,560
so you don't notice it i mean it's a

00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:14,480
you only start to notice it when you
 

859
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,230
you only start to notice it when you
compare yourself to others

860
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:16,240
compare yourself to others
 

861
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,230
compare yourself to others
when you learn of the alternative that's

862
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:18,240
when you learn of the alternative that's
 

863
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,629
when you learn of the alternative that's
a dark reality when you're abused you um

two ways to look at this i'd argue on

890
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:53,360
two ways to look at this i'd argue on
 

891
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,269
two ways to look at this i'd argue on
one side that's suffering

892
00:15:55,269 --> 00:15:55,279
one side that's suffering
 

893
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,509
one side that's suffering
and suffering till you die

894
00:15:57,509 --> 00:15:57,519
and suffering till you die
 

895
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:59,509
and suffering till you die
you know no different so you can't have

896
00:15:59,509 --> 00:15:59,519
you know no different so you can't have
 

897
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,829
you know no different so you can't have
hope you can't have

898
00:16:01,829 --> 00:16:01,839
hope you can't have
 

899
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:03,430
hope you can't have
this idea that there's better and

900
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:03,440
this idea that there's better and
 

901
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,590
this idea that there's better and
sometimes that's

902
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:05,600
sometimes that's
 

903
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,590
sometimes that's
keep that in its box but then if you

904
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:07,600
keep that in its box but then if you
 

905
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,949
keep that in its box but then if you
have kind of what you have with park

where she
 

909
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,550
where she
she knows now that there's different she

910
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:12,560
she knows now that there's different she

there's
there's a positive to looking at

928
00:16:31,269 --> 00:16:31,279
there's a positive to looking at
 

929
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:33,189
there's a positive to looking at
both i would say and i know that sounds

930
00:16:33,189 --> 00:16:33,199
both i would say and i know that sounds
 

931
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:35,509
both i would say and i know that sounds
horrible for the living and trauma your

932
00:16:35,509 --> 00:16:35,519
horrible for the living and trauma your
 

933
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:36,629
horrible for the living and trauma your
whole life and just not knowing any

00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:36,639
whole life and just not knowing any
 

935
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:37,670
whole life and just not knowing any
better

936
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:37,680
better
 

937
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,829
better
but there's

938
00:16:39,829 --> 00:16:39,839
but there's
 

939
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:42,550
but there's
i don't know if that saves the brain

940
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:42,560
i don't know if that saves the brain
 

941
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,350
i don't know if that saves the brain
and the body and just just that overall

942
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:45,360
and the body and just just that overall
 

943
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,189
and the body and just just that overall
or if it actually

944
00:16:47,189 --> 00:16:47,199
or if it actually
 

945
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:48,710
or if it actually
would be better because there's no way

946
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:48,720
would be better because there's no way
 

947
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,550
would be better because there's no way
to really find that out i don't think

948
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:50,560
to really find that out i don't think
 

949
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,189
to really find that out i don't think
yeah i think but the reality is when you

950
00:16:53,189 --> 00:16:53,199
yeah i think but the reality is when you
 

951
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:54,790
yeah i think but the reality is when you
give people hope and you make them

952
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:54,800
give people hope and you make them
 

953
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,389
give people hope and you make them
realize that they're

954
00:16:56,389 --> 00:16:56,399
realize that they're
 

955
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:57,910
realize that they're
suffering you're putting a burden on

we did an exhibition game and

00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:23,200
we did an exhibition game and
 

1351
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,870
we did an exhibition game and
the team ahead was winning the team we

1352
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:24,880
the team ahead was winning the team we
 

1353

annoying
 

1357
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,110
annoying
and so

1358
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:29,120
and so
 

1359
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,870
and so
there was an opportunity to take out a

1360
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:30,880
there was an opportunity to take out a
 

1361
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:31,830
there was an opportunity to take out a
girl

1362
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:31,840
girl
 

1363
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,750
girl
that was going one end of the field to

1364
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:33,760
that was going one end of the field to
 

1365
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,190
that was going one end of the field to
the other and she just kept hitting

1366
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:35,200
the other and she just kept hitting
 

1367
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,669
the other and she just kept hitting
tries left right and center she was fast

1368
00:23:37,669 --> 00:23:37,679
tries left right and center she was fast
 

1369
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:40,070
tries left right and center she was fast
so i figured if i just aimed her up like

1370
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:40,080
so i figured if i just aimed her up like
 

1371
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,549
so i figured if i just aimed her up like
she's a target and i just run full force

1372
00:23:42,549 --> 00:23:42,559
she's a target and i just run full force

1375
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,950
at her because she was really she was a
tall individual if i just if i do that

1376
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:46,960
tall individual if i just if i do that
 

1377
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,710
tall individual if i just if i do that
i'll take her out of the knees so i did

yeah but tanks still look badass they
look great but they don't last but so

2074
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:29,520
look great but they don't last but so
 

2075
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,109
look great but they don't last but so
much of the military like we said with

2076
00:35:31,109 --> 00:35:31,119
much of the military like we said with
 

2077
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:33,430
much of the military like we said with
the recruiting videos it's a display of

2078
00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:33,440
the recruiting videos it's a display of
 

2079
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,510
the recruiting videos it's a display of
power versus the actual

2080
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:35,520
power versus the actual
 

2081
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,670
power versus the actual
implementation of power fair

2082
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:37,680
implementation of power fair
 

2083
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:40,230
implementation of power fair
okay artillery so i'm doing my best here

2084
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:40,240
okay artillery so i'm doing my best here
 

2085
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,910
okay artillery so i'm doing my best here
yeah i don't even know what double tap

2086
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:41,920
yeah i don't even know what double tap
 

2087
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,990
yeah i don't even know what double tap
means which you said earlier so double

2088
00:35:43,990 --> 00:35:44,000
means which you said earlier so double
 

2089
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,990
means which you said earlier so double
top is like two shots to the face why

2090
00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:46,000
top is like two shots to the face why
 

2091
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:46,950
top is like two shots to the face why
two

2092
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:46,960
two
 

2093
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,950
two
to be sure okay

2094
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:48,960
to be sure okay
 

2095
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,710
to be sure okay
all right you guys the taxpayers pay for

2096
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:50,720
all right you guys the taxpayers pay for
 

2097
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,470
all right you guys the taxpayers pay for
the ammo it's fine but you don't want to

2098
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:52,480
the ammo it's fine but you don't want to
 

2099
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,829
the ammo it's fine but you don't want to
do three because that's wasting money

2100
00:35:53,829 --> 00:35:53,839
do three because that's wasting money
 

2101
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:55,750
do three because that's wasting money
well that's now that's a waste okay

2102
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:55,760
well that's now that's a waste okay
 

2103
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,510
well that's now that's a waste okay
double tap the face there's so much

2104
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:57,520
double tap the face there's so much
 

2105
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,990
double tap the face there's so much
awesome terminology here or uh gruesome

2106
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:00,000
awesome terminology here or uh gruesome
 

2107
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,270
awesome terminology here or uh gruesome
terminology depending on your

2108
00:36:01,270 --> 00:36:01,280
terminology depending on your
 

2109
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:04,630
terminology depending on your
perspective okay so artillery yeah

2110
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:04,640
perspective okay so artillery yeah
 

2111
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:08,310
perspective okay so artillery yeah
so that's the hand of god

2112
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:08,320

 

2113
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,310

sorry no i

2114
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:10,320
sorry no i
 

2115
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,270
sorry no i
that's

2116
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:11,280
that's
 

2117
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,750
that's
that's intensely uh romanticized version

2118
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:13,760
that's intensely uh romanticized version
 

2119
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,230
that's intensely uh romanticized version
but okay artillery the hand of god so

2120
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:16,240
but okay artillery the hand of god so
 

2121
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,829
but okay artillery the hand of god so
because it will reach out and touch you

2122
00:36:17,829 --> 00:36:17,839
because it will reach out and touch you
 

2123
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:19,510
because it will reach out and touch you
from wherever we want

2124
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:19,520
from wherever we want
 

2125
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,990
from wherever we want
it's like it's like f um

2126
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:22,000
it's like it's like f um
 

2127
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,150
it's like it's like f um
f 18 pilots or bombers

2128
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:24,160
f 18 pilots or bombers
 

2129
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,150
f 18 pilots or bombers
they'll you won't know they're there

2130
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:26,160
they'll you won't know they're there
 

2131
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:29,910
they'll you won't know they're there
until they're there and so for artillery

2132
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:29,920
until they're there and so for artillery
 

2133
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,910
until they're there and so for artillery
i i really honestly didn't think

2134
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:31,920
i i really honestly didn't think
 

2135
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,990
i i really honestly didn't think
artillery would be a fit for me i didn't

2136
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:34,000
artillery would be a fit for me i didn't
 

2137
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,910
artillery would be a fit for me i didn't
know much about it they were just like

2138
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:35,920
know much about it they were just like
 

2139
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:38,310
know much about it they were just like
these are what you can pick from and i

2140
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:38,320
these are what you can pick from and i
 

2141
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,950
these are what you can pick from and i
was like i'll go here so

2142
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:40,960
was like i'll go here so
 

2143
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,190
was like i'll go here so
in world war ii they used much closer

2144
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:43,200
in world war ii they used much closer
 

2145
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,950
in world war ii they used much closer
artillery so it's the we were called the

2146
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:44,960
artillery so it's the we were called the
 

2147
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,630
artillery so it's the we were called the
royal canadian horse artillery because

2148
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:46,640
royal canadian horse artillery because
 

2149
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,310
royal canadian horse artillery because
the queen made us royal

2150
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:48,320
the queen made us royal
 

2151
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:51,430
the queen made us royal
canadian artillery and um we we shoot

2152
00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:51,440
canadian artillery and um we we shoot
 

2153
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,190
canadian artillery and um we we shoot
these rounds when you're in training you

2154
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:53,200
these rounds when you're in training you
 

2155
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,030
these rounds when you're in training you
shoot smaller smaller ammunition they're

2156
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:55,040
shoot smaller smaller ammunition they're
 

2157
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,430
shoot smaller smaller ammunition they're
about 40 pounds they go

2158
00:36:57,430 --> 00:36:57,440
about 40 pounds they go
 

2159
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,030
about 40 pounds they go
i'm gonna get this wrong

2160
00:36:59,030 --> 00:36:59,040
i'm gonna get this wrong
 

2161
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,270
i'm gonna get this wrong
20k 20 kilometers so whatever that is in

2162
00:37:01,270 --> 00:37:01,280
20k 20 kilometers so whatever that is in
 

2163
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,470
20k 20 kilometers so whatever that is in
your

2164
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:02,480
your
 

2165
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,750
your
mile things

2166
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:03,760
mile things
 

2167
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,349
mile things
and um

2168
00:37:05,349 --> 00:37:05,359
and um
 

2169
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:07,750
and um
they have a casing on them and

2170
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:07,760
they have a casing on them and
 

2171
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,270
they have a casing on them and
they're much easier they're easier to

2172
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:09,280
they're much easier they're easier to
 

2173
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,150
they're much easier they're easier to
handle

2174
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:10,160
handle
 

2175
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,589
handle
the guns are smaller you need less

2176
00:37:11,589 --> 00:37:11,599
the guns are smaller you need less
 

2177
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:13,190
the guns are smaller you need less
people for them they're basically what

2178
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:13,200
people for them they're basically what
 

2179
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,710
people for them they're basically what
you train on nowadays it's not what we

2180
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:14,720
you train on nowadays it's not what we
 

2181
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:17,829
you train on nowadays it's not what we
use overseas what we use overseas

2182
00:37:17,829 --> 00:37:17,839
use overseas what we use overseas
 

2183
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:20,150
use overseas what we use overseas
now those things are beautiful those are

2184
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:20,160
now those things are beautiful those are
 

2185
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,550
now those things are beautiful those are
just a sheer work of

2186
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:22,560
just a sheer work of
 

2187
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,230
just a sheer work of
the engineering behind them just makes

2188
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:24,240
the engineering behind them just makes
 

2189
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,750
the engineering behind them just makes
my heart skip a beat yeah the

2190
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:25,760
my heart skip a beat yeah the
 

2191
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,430
my heart skip a beat yeah the
engineering on modern guns is amazing so

2192
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:27,440
engineering on modern guns is amazing so
 

2193
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,790
engineering on modern guns is amazing so
are we talking about machine guns here

2194
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:28,800
are we talking about machine guns here
 

2195
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,470
are we talking about machine guns here
so no you're talking fully automatic no

2196
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:30,480
so no you're talking fully automatic no
 

2197
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,670
so no you're talking fully automatic no
you're talking about an artillery gun so

2198
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:31,680
you're talking about an artillery gun so
 

2199
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,829
you're talking about an artillery gun so
what it is it's a 155 millimeter

2200
00:37:33,829 --> 00:37:33,839
what it is it's a 155 millimeter
 

2201
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:36,390
what it is it's a 155 millimeter
howitzer that shoots up to up to 40

2202
00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:36,400
howitzer that shoots up to up to 40
 

2203
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,670
howitzer that shoots up to up to 40
kilometers accurately 45

2204
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:39,680
kilometers accurately 45
 

2205
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:42,230
kilometers accurately 45
unrecorded and it shoots a hundred pound

2206
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:42,240
unrecorded and it shoots a hundred pound
 

2207
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,670
unrecorded and it shoots a hundred pound
round

2208
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:43,680
round
 

2209
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:44,030
round
oh

2210
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:44,040
oh

okay
 

2215
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:50,069
okay
so that but there is still precision

2216
00:37:50,069 --> 00:37:50,079
so that but there is still precision
 

2217
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:52,550
so that but there is still precision
accurate as hell accurate okay accurate

2218
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:52,560
accurate as hell accurate okay accurate
 

2219
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,069
accurate as hell accurate okay accurate
if the people behind it that are

2220
00:37:54,069 --> 00:37:54,079
if the people behind it that are
 

2221
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:56,390
if the people behind it that are
shooting it and aiming it are accurate

2222
00:37:56,390 --> 00:37:56,400
shooting it and aiming it are accurate
 

2223
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,230
shooting it and aiming it are accurate
okay uh so

2224
00:37:58,230 --> 00:37:58,240
okay uh so
 

2225
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,349
okay uh so
so how

2226
00:37:59,349 --> 00:37:59,359
so how
 

2227
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:01,349
so how
at which stage of the warfare do they

2228
00:38:01,349 --> 00:38:01,359
at which stage of the warfare do they
 

2229
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:03,829
at which stage of the warfare do they
come in are they saving you like say a

2230
00:38:03,829 --> 00:38:03,839
come in are they saving you like say a
 

2231
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:06,310
come in are they saving you like say a
bunch of people get uh raided a bunch of

2557
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:38,150
nerves were numb if that makes sense
what what were the nerves like are we

what what were the nerves like are we
 

2559
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:40,550
what what were the nerves like are we
talking about fear or is it just

2560
00:43:40,550 --> 00:43:40,560
talking about fear or is it just
 

2561
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:43,270
talking about fear or is it just
anxious excitement anxious excitement

00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:45,040
hopeful that they wouldn't blow it up on
 

2565
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:48,710
hopeful that they wouldn't blow it up on
us and there was this

2566
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:48,720
us and there was this
 

2567
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,630
us and there was this
there was this excitement that's hard to

2568
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:50,640
there was this excitement that's hard to
 

2569
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:52,790
there was this excitement that's hard to
describe because you don't want to be

2570
00:43:52,790 --> 00:43:52,800
describe because you don't want to be

people
 

2575
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:57,190
people
but when you just saw their faces and

2576
00:43:57,190 --> 00:43:57,200
but when you just saw their faces and
 

2577
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,109
but when you just saw their faces and
they're shooting at you there's this

00:43:59,109 --> 00:43:59,119
they're shooting at you there's this
 

2579
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:01,670
they're shooting at you there's this
overwhelming feeling of

2580
00:44:01,670 --> 00:44:01,680
overwhelming feeling of
 

2581
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:04,790
overwhelming feeling of
got you [\h__\h] yeah yeah

2582
00:44:04,790 --> 00:44:04,800
got you [\h__\h] yeah yeah
 

2583
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,150
got you [\h__\h] yeah yeah
well we'll talk about that because

2584
00:44:06,150 --> 00:44:06,160
well we'll talk about that because
 

2585
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:09,109
well we'll talk about that because
that's such a difficult thing

2586
00:44:09,109 --> 00:44:09,119
that's such a difficult thing
 

2587
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:11,510
that's such a difficult thing
about wars you forget that it's other

2588
00:44:11,510 --> 00:44:11,520
about wars you forget that it's other
 

2589
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:13,829
about wars you forget that it's other
human beings yeah because those other

2590
00:44:13,829 --> 00:44:13,839
human beings yeah because those other
 

2591
00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:16,230
human beings yeah because those other
human beings are doing really bad things

2592
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:16,240
human beings are doing really bad things
 

2593
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:19,430
human beings are doing really bad things
to you and so the very basic anger takes

2594
00:44:19,430 --> 00:44:19,440
to you and so the very basic anger takes
 

2595
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:20,790
to you and so the very basic anger takes
over

2596
00:44:20,790 --> 00:44:20,800
over
 

2597
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:23,190
over
um hate can take over

2598
00:44:23,190 --> 00:44:23,200
um hate can take over
 

2599
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:25,510
um hate can take over
and then also just the excitement of

2600
00:44:25,510 --> 00:44:25,520
and then also just the excitement of
 

2601
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:29,109
and then also just the excitement of
almost like video game like

2602
00:44:29,109 --> 00:44:29,119
almost like video game like
 

2603
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:30,150
almost like video game like
you know

2604
00:44:30,150 --> 00:44:30,160
you know
 

2605
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:32,630
you know
aspect of war like sport it's it's like

2606
00:44:32,630 --> 00:44:32,640
aspect of war like sport it's it's like
 

2607
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:34,870
aspect of war like sport it's it's like
sport that all of those elements are all

2608
00:44:34,870 --> 00:44:34,880
sport that all of those elements are all
 

2609
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:37,829
sport that all of those elements are all
baked in it's hard to be philosophical

2610
00:44:37,829 --> 00:44:37,839
baked in it's hard to be philosophical
 

2611
00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:39,829
baked in it's hard to be philosophical
in that situation it seems like

2612
00:44:39,829 --> 00:44:39,839
in that situation it seems like
 

2613
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:42,069
in that situation it seems like
i've never played video games so i can't

2614
00:44:42,069 --> 00:44:42,079
i've never played video games so i can't
 

2615
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:43,670
i've never played video games so i can't
compare it to that but like from from

2616
00:44:43,670 --> 00:44:43,680
compare it to that but like from from
 

2617
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,670
compare it to that but like from from
like a sports perspective yeah i could i

2618
00:44:45,670 --> 00:44:45,680
like a sports perspective yeah i could i
 

2619
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,349
like a sports perspective yeah i could i
could argue that like i felt like we won

2620
00:44:47,349 --> 00:44:47,359
could argue that like i felt like we won
 

2621
00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:48,870
could argue that like i felt like we won
there for a second

2622
00:44:48,870 --> 00:44:48,880
there for a second
 

2623
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,309
there for a second
and it's

2624
00:44:50,309 --> 00:44:50,319
and it's
 

2625
00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:52,150
and it's
it's not just like a heat from outside

2626
00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:52,160
it's not just like a heat from outside
 

2627
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:54,630
it's not just like a heat from outside
it's like this radiation within you

2628
00:44:54,630 --> 00:44:54,640
it's like this radiation within you
 

2629
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:59,589
it's like this radiation within you
that is something i've never felt since

2630
00:44:59,589 --> 00:44:59,599

 

2631
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:01,670

you uh just to take a small step back to

2632
00:45:01,670 --> 00:45:01,680
you uh just to take a small step back to
 

2633
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,430
you uh just to take a small step back to
the weapons training

2634
00:45:03,430 --> 00:45:03,440
the weapons training
 

2635
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,670
the weapons training
what uh what kind of guns did you train

2636
00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:05,680
what uh what kind of guns did you train
 

2637
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:07,349
what uh what kind of guns did you train
on because you also mentioned a rocket

2638
00:45:07,349 --> 00:45:07,359
on because you also mentioned a rocket
 

2639
00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:08,390
on because you also mentioned a rocket
launcher

2640
00:45:08,390 --> 00:45:08,400
launcher
 

2641
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:10,230

all discussed i haven't seen that yet

2656
00:45:22,710 --> 00:45:22,720
all discussed i haven't seen that yet
 

2657
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:23,829
all discussed i haven't seen that yet
and i've heard about it and people have

2658
00:45:23,829 --> 00:45:23,839
and i've heard about it and people have
 

2659
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:25,430
and i've heard about it and people have
made me tell yeah i know i feel like you

2663
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:30,470
haven't seen a single movie that's
relevant to war military because every

2664
00:45:30,470 --> 00:45:30,480
relevant to war military because every
 

2665
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,150

scientist how do you have the time i'm
 

2675
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:43,430
scientist how do you have the time i'm
not a scientist i just play one on tv

2676
00:45:43,430 --> 00:45:43,440
not a scientist i just play one on tv
 

2677
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:46,630
not a scientist i just play one on tv
okay sure so uh what can you talk about

2678
00:45:46,630 --> 00:45:46,640
okay sure so uh what can you talk about
 

2679
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:48,870
okay sure so uh what can you talk about
the rocket launcher yeah and maybe any

2680
00:45:48,870 --> 00:45:48,880
the rocket launcher yeah and maybe any
 

2681
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:51,430
the rocket launcher yeah and maybe any
other yeah for both engineering actually

2682
00:45:51,430 --> 00:45:51,440
other yeah for both engineering actually
 

2683
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:53,190
other yeah for both engineering actually
to me those guns are very interesting

2684
00:45:53,190 --> 00:45:53,200
to me those guns are very interesting
 

2685
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:55,430
to me those guns are very interesting
from an engineering perspective too well

2686
00:45:55,430 --> 00:45:55,440
from an engineering perspective too well
 

2687
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:56,710
from an engineering perspective too well
they should be they're fascinating when

2688
00:45:56,710 --> 00:45:56,720
they should be they're fascinating when
 

2689
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,230
they should be they're fascinating when
you take them apart and you see how

2690
00:45:58,230 --> 00:45:58,240
you take them apart and you see how
 

2691
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:01,030
you take them apart and you see how
small the parts get down to and how how

2692
00:46:01,030 --> 00:46:01,040
small the parts get down to and how how
 

2693
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:02,790
small the parts get down to and how how
necessary every single little piece is

2694
00:46:02,790 --> 00:46:02,800
necessary every single little piece is
 

2695
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:04,710
necessary every single little piece is
to make that thing run and even without

2696
00:46:04,710 --> 00:46:04,720
to make that thing run and even without
 

2697
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,710
to make that thing run and even without
the tiniest little bb smaller than a

2698
00:46:06,710 --> 00:46:06,720
the tiniest little bb smaller than a
 

2699
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:08,870

3137
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:14,790
whether or not that's right i mean you
could argue that's the similar thing to

could argue that's the similar thing to

is it the best it could be could it be

3144
00:53:21,829 --> 00:53:21,839
is it the best it could be could it be
 

3145
00:53:21,839 --> 00:53:22,630
is it the best it could be could it be
better

3146
00:53:22,630 --> 00:53:22,640
better
 

3147
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:25,109
better
could it do more things sure probably

3148
00:53:25,109 --> 00:53:25,119
could it do more things sure probably
 

3149
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:26,950
could it do more things sure probably
but with the time that we had we did the

3150
00:53:26,950 --> 00:53:26,960
but with the time that we had we did the
 

3151
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:28,950
but with the time that we had we did the
best that we could

3152
00:53:28,950 --> 00:53:28,960
best that we could
 

3153
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:31,990
best that we could
that's my logic on that for me

then depending on the position i was
 

3435
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:18,230
then depending on the position i was
running the gun in if i was running the

running the gun in if i was running the
 

3437
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:20,549
running the gun in if i was running the
side that had the charge bags

side that had the charge bags
 

3439
00:58:20,559 --> 00:58:22,230
side that had the charge bags
i'll explain that in a second but if i

3440
00:58:22,230 --> 00:58:22,240
i'll explain that in a second but if i
 

3441
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:23,510
i'll explain that in a second but if i
was running the side that had the charge

bags
 

3445
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:26,870
bags
i could step up

3446
00:58:26,870 --> 00:58:26,880
i could step up
 

3447
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:28,710
i could step up
onto the gun

3448
00:58:28,710 --> 00:58:28,720
onto the gun
 

3449
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:29,910
onto the gun
and if i

the end till towards the end so that was
 

3971
01:06:51,839 --> 01:06:54,309
the end till towards the end so that was
fortunate so we would fire live fire we

3972
01:06:54,309 --> 01:06:54,319
fortunate so we would fire live fire we
 

3973
01:06:54,319 --> 01:06:56,230
fortunate so we would fire live fire we
would go out to the middle of nowhere

3974
01:06:56,230 --> 01:06:56,240
would go out to the middle of nowhere
 

3975
01:06:56,240 --> 01:06:57,990
would go out to the middle of nowhere
the guns would be there

3976
01:06:57,990 --> 01:06:58,000
the guns would be there
 

3977
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,910
the guns would be there
and we would get uh offload a truck of

3978
01:06:59,910 --> 01:06:59,920
and we would get uh offload a truck of
 

3979
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:01,990
and we would get uh offload a truck of
uh rounds and we would do live fire and

3980
01:07:01,990 --> 01:07:02,000
uh rounds and we would do live fire and
 

3981
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,470
uh rounds and we would do live fire and
we would practice just constant practice

3982
01:07:04,470 --> 01:07:04,480
we would practice just constant practice
 

3983
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:06,309
we would practice just constant practice
what's that saying perfect practice

3984
01:07:06,309 --> 01:07:06,319
what's that saying perfect practice
 

3985
01:07:06,319 --> 01:07:08,870
what's that saying perfect practice
makes perfect yeah so this is a sensory

3986
01:07:08,870 --> 01:07:08,880
makes perfect yeah so this is a sensory
 

3987
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:09,670
makes perfect yeah so this is a sensory
uh

3988
01:07:09,670 --> 01:07:09,680
uh
 

3989
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:12,390
uh
like a shooting range for artillery for

3990
01:07:12,390 --> 01:07:12,400
like a shooting range for artillery for
 

3991
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:14,390
like a shooting range for artillery for
artillery for long range so what does

3992
01:07:14,390 --> 01:07:14,400
artillery for long range so what does
 

3993
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:16,069
artillery for long range so what does
practice look like

3994
01:07:16,069 --> 01:07:16,079
practice look like
 

3995
01:07:16,079 --> 01:07:17,990
practice look like
so you roll up in your trucks and you're

3996
01:07:17,990 --> 01:07:18,000
so you roll up in your trucks and you're
 

3997
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,230
so you roll up in your trucks and you're
you're you know you've got uh each group

3998
01:07:20,230 --> 01:07:20,240
you're you know you've got uh each group
 

3999
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:21,349
you're you know you've got uh each group
of people

4000
01:07:21,349 --> 01:07:21,359
of people
 

4001
01:07:21,359 --> 01:07:22,950
of people
you've got two trucks and then you've

4002
01:07:22,950 --> 01:07:22,960
you've got two trucks and then you've
 

4003
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:24,390
you've got two trucks and then you've
got like a medic vehicle and then you've

4004
01:07:24,390 --> 01:07:24,400
got like a medic vehicle and then you've
 

4005
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:26,710
got like a medic vehicle and then you've
got like an officer vehicle and a coms

got like an officer vehicle and a coms
vehicle and you you go to your

4008
01:07:29,190 --> 01:07:29,200
vehicle and you you go to your
 

4009
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:30,870
vehicle and you you go to your
perspective guns and then you offload

4010
01:07:30,870 --> 01:07:30,880
perspective guns and then you offload
 

4011
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:32,309
perspective guns and then you offload
your ammo and then you basically wait

4012
01:07:32,309 --> 01:07:32,319
your ammo and then you basically wait
 

4013
01:07:32,319 --> 01:07:34,230
your ammo and then you basically wait
for them to send you

4014
01:07:34,230 --> 01:07:34,240
for them to send you
 

4015
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:35,270
for them to send you
like a

4016
01:07:35,270 --> 01:07:35,280
like a
 

4017
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:36,069
like a
uh

4018
01:07:36,069 --> 01:07:36,079
uh
 

4019
01:07:36,079 --> 01:07:38,069
uh
a fire mission wow get that together

4020
01:07:38,069 --> 01:07:38,079
a fire mission wow get that together
 

4021
01:07:38,079 --> 01:07:39,510
a fire mission wow get that together
they would call they would say and miss

4022
01:07:39,510 --> 01:07:39,520
they would call they would say and miss
 

4023
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:41,430
they would call they would say and miss
y'all sit so it'd be a fire mission so

4024
01:07:41,430 --> 01:07:41,440
y'all sit so it'd be a fire mission so
 

4025
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:43,029
y'all sit so it'd be a fire mission so
we'd wait for that and once we got that

4026
01:07:43,029 --> 01:07:43,039
we'd wait for that and once we got that
 

4027
01:07:43,039 --> 01:07:44,710
we'd wait for that and once we got that
then you all run like a bunch of

4028
01:07:44,710 --> 01:07:44,720
then you all run like a bunch of
 

4029
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:47,109
then you all run like a bunch of
scattered rats to the gun like it's like

4030
01:07:47,109 --> 01:07:47,119
scattered rats to the gun like it's like
 

4031
01:07:47,119 --> 01:07:49,029
scattered rats to the gun like it's like
the greatest thing you've ever seen

4032
01:07:49,029 --> 01:07:49,039
the greatest thing you've ever seen

the call for the sergeants to say and
 

4037
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:54,150
the call for the sergeants to say and
then you'll hear it because it's not

4038
01:07:54,150 --> 01:07:54,160
then you'll hear it because it's not
 

4039
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:56,870
then you'll hear it because it's not
headphones you can hear it on a speaker

4040
01:07:56,870 --> 01:07:56,880
headphones you can hear it on a speaker
 

4041
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:58,549
headphones you can hear it on a speaker
and it'd be like i'm not gonna do it in

4042
01:07:58,549 --> 01:07:58,559
and it'd be like i'm not gonna do it in
 

4043
01:07:58,559 --> 01:08:00,789
and it'd be like i'm not gonna do it in
french don't ask it'd be like

4044
01:08:00,789 --> 01:08:00,799
french don't ask it'd be like
 

4045
01:08:00,799 --> 01:08:03,349
french don't ask it'd be like
um

4046
01:08:03,349 --> 01:08:03,359

 

4047
01:08:03,359 --> 01:08:06,309

uh so and so 10 rounds

4048
01:08:06,309 --> 01:08:06,319
uh so and so 10 rounds
 

4049
01:08:06,319 --> 01:08:07,910
uh so and so 10 rounds
fire when ready

4050
01:08:07,910 --> 01:08:07,920
fire when ready
 

4051
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:09,349
fire when ready
and then you'd get your rounds ready and

4052
01:08:09,349 --> 01:08:09,359
and then you'd get your rounds ready and
 

4053
01:08:09,359 --> 01:08:10,470
and then you'd get your rounds ready and
everyone would have them writer would be

4054
01:08:10,470 --> 01:08:10,480
everyone would have them writer would be
 

4055
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:12,309
everyone would have them writer would be
in their perspective um respected

4056
01:08:12,309 --> 01:08:12,319
in their perspective um respected
 

4057
01:08:12,319 --> 01:08:14,150
in their perspective um respected
positions and then you would wait and

4058
01:08:14,150 --> 01:08:14,160
positions and then you would wait and
 

4059
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:15,750
positions and then you would wait and
then they would say

4060
01:08:15,750 --> 01:08:15,760
then they would say
 

4061
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:17,110
then they would say
fire when ready and as soon as i say

4062
01:08:17,110 --> 01:08:17,120
fire when ready and as soon as i say
 

4063
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:18,550
fire when ready and as soon as i say
fire when ready that means just start

4064
01:08:18,550 --> 01:08:18,560
fire when ready that means just start
 

4065
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:19,430
fire when ready that means just start
going

4066
01:08:19,430 --> 01:08:19,440
going
 

4067
01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:21,030
going
just start and then that's when the

4068
01:08:21,030 --> 01:08:21,040
just start and then that's when the
 

4069
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:23,669
just start and then that's when the
magic starts you go like the loop like

4070
01:08:23,669 --> 01:08:23,679
magic starts you go like the loop like
 

4071
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:25,430
magic starts you go like the loop like
you you shoot one or whatever there's a

4072
01:08:25,430 --> 01:08:25,440
you you shoot one or whatever there's a
 

4073
01:08:25,440 --> 01:08:27,349
you you shoot one or whatever there's a
reloading process there's a loop so what

4074
01:08:27,349 --> 01:08:27,359
reloading process there's a loop so what
 

4075
01:08:27,359 --> 01:08:28,709
reloading process there's a loop so what
you would do you get the fire mission

4076
01:08:28,709 --> 01:08:28,719
you would do you get the fire mission
 

4077
01:08:28,719 --> 01:08:30,870
you would do you get the fire mission
you would find out the rounds the two ic

4078
01:08:30,870 --> 01:08:30,880
you would find out the rounds the two ic
 

4079
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:32,070
you would find out the rounds the two ic
would be standing by the rounds and it

4080
01:08:32,070 --> 01:08:32,080
would be standing by the rounds and it
 

4081
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:33,990
would be standing by the rounds and it
was his job to make sure the amount of

4082
01:08:33,990 --> 01:08:34,000
was his job to make sure the amount of
 

4083
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:35,669
was his job to make sure the amount of
rounds that was told would be the only

4084
01:08:35,669 --> 01:08:35,679
rounds that was told would be the only
 

4085
01:08:35,679 --> 01:08:37,430
rounds that was told would be the only
rounds that would go downrange

4086
01:08:37,430 --> 01:08:37,440
rounds that would go downrange
 

4087
01:08:37,440 --> 01:08:39,590
rounds that would go downrange
and so he'd stand there and on each

4088
01:08:39,590 --> 01:08:39,600
and so he'd stand there and on each
 

4089
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:41,430
and so he'd stand there and on each
round depending on the type of round is

4090
01:08:41,430 --> 01:08:41,440
round depending on the type of round is
 

4091
01:08:41,440 --> 01:08:43,910
round depending on the type of round is
a fuse which gets screwed onto the top

4092
01:08:43,910 --> 01:08:43,920
a fuse which gets screwed onto the top
 

4093
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:45,030
a fuse which gets screwed onto the top
of the round

4094
01:08:45,030 --> 01:08:45,040
of the round
 

4095
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:45,829
of the round
so

4096
01:08:45,829 --> 01:08:45,839
so
 

4097
01:08:45,839 --> 01:08:46,789
so
they're

4098
01:08:46,789 --> 01:08:46,799
they're
 

4099
01:08:46,799 --> 01:08:48,870
they're
about that big and it's just a point and

4100
01:08:48,870 --> 01:08:48,880
about that big and it's just a point and
 

4101
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:51,510
about that big and it's just a point and
then you would have to put it on

4102
01:08:51,510 --> 01:08:51,520
then you would have to put it on
 

4103
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:52,950
then you would have to put it on
give it a spin

4104
01:08:52,950 --> 01:08:52,960
give it a spin
 

4105
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:55,189
give it a spin
and depending if it was the time release

release or not you would take this
little thing and you would move it the

4154
01:09:37,349 --> 01:09:37,359
little thing and you would move it the

any of them we all kind of got split up
and so

4674
01:18:29,110 --> 01:18:29,120
and so
 

4675
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:30,709
and so
there was an understanding that we were

4676
01:18:30,709 --> 01:18:30,719
there was an understanding that we were
 

4677
01:18:30,719 --> 01:18:33,350
there was an understanding that we were
going to always be deploying

4678
01:18:33,350 --> 01:18:33,360
going to always be deploying
 

4679
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:35,110
going to always be deploying
next year it was like 2009 you're

4680
01:18:35,110 --> 01:18:35,120
next year it was like 2009 you're
 

4681
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:37,270
next year it was like 2009 you're
deploying whether you left in may or

4682
01:18:37,270 --> 01:18:37,280
deploying whether you left in may or
 

4683
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:38,149
deploying whether you left in may or
april

4684
01:18:38,149 --> 01:18:38,159
april
 

4685
01:18:38,159 --> 01:18:39,750
april
we were deploying because that was the

4686
01:18:39,750 --> 01:18:39,760
we were deploying because that was the
 

4687
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:42,550
we were deploying because that was the
rotation time so each canadian unit did

4688
01:18:42,550 --> 01:18:42,560
rotation time so each canadian unit did
 

4689
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:44,630
rotation time so each canadian unit did
between six and nine months and then you

4690
01:18:44,630 --> 01:18:44,640
between six and nine months and then you
 

4691
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:46,390
between six and nine months and then you
knew right around that point another

4692
01:18:46,390 --> 01:18:46,400
knew right around that point another
 

4693
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:49,270
knew right around that point another
base of individuals would then deploy so

4694
01:18:49,270 --> 01:18:49,280
base of individuals would then deploy so
 

4695
01:18:49,280 --> 01:18:51,110
base of individuals would then deploy so
you would go on these rotations

4696
01:18:51,110 --> 01:18:51,120
you would go on these rotations
 

4697
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:53,189
you would go on these rotations
and so even when i was on my deployment

4698
01:18:53,189 --> 01:18:53,199
and so even when i was on my deployment
 

4699
01:18:53,199 --> 01:18:55,350
and so even when i was on my deployment
then i was slated to go again the

4700
01:18:55,350 --> 01:18:55,360
then i was slated to go again the
 

4701
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:57,270
then i was slated to go again the
following year but towards the end of

4702
01:18:57,270 --> 01:18:57,280
following year but towards the end of
 

4703
01:18:57,280 --> 01:18:59,830
following year but towards the end of
the year so there was always a rotation

4704
01:18:59,830 --> 01:18:59,840
the year so there was always a rotation
 

4705
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:01,750
the year so there was always a rotation

sirens would go off
 

5049
01:24:43,679 --> 01:24:45,510
sirens would go off
so you would hear though

5050
01:24:45,510 --> 01:24:45,520
so you would hear though
 

5051
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:47,270

01:24:50,629 --> 01:24:50,639
clear and then got back up
 

5057
01:24:50,639 --> 01:24:52,390
clear and then got back up
i didn't hear any

5058
01:24:52,390 --> 01:24:52,400

until
 

5063
01:24:56,239 --> 01:24:59,189
until
i got to the fob it was more

5064
01:24:59,189 --> 01:24:59,199
i got to the fob it was more
 

5065
01:24:59,199 --> 01:25:00,629
i got to the fob it was more
just a lot of noise you would hear a lot

5066
01:25:00,629 --> 01:25:00,639
just a lot of noise you would hear a lot
 

5067
01:25:00,639 --> 01:25:02,550
just a lot of noise you would hear a lot
of helicopters a lot of planes

of helicopters a lot of planes
 

5069
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:04,390
of helicopters a lot of planes
going in and out of the base so there

5070
01:25:04,390 --> 01:25:04,400
going in and out of the base so there
 

5071
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:05,669
going in and out of the base so there
was that sense you could feel the ground

5072
01:25:05,669 --> 01:25:05,679
was that sense you could feel the ground
 

5073
01:25:05,679 --> 01:25:07,430
was that sense you could feel the ground
shake when they took off but there was

5074
01:25:07,430 --> 01:25:07,440
shake when they took off but there was
 

5075
01:25:07,440 --> 01:25:08,629
shake when they took off but there was
that sense you know things were going

5076
01:25:08,629 --> 01:25:08,639
that sense you know things were going
 

5077
01:25:08,639 --> 01:25:10,390
that sense you know things were going
around things were happening you just

5078
01:25:10,390 --> 01:25:10,400
around things were happening you just
 

5079
01:25:10,400 --> 01:25:13,189
around things were happening you just
weren't far enough you were not close

5080
01:25:13,189 --> 01:25:13,199
weren't far enough you were not close
 

5081
01:25:13,199 --> 01:25:16,709
weren't far enough you were not close
enough to the edges of calf to see it

5082
01:25:16,709 --> 01:25:16,719
enough to the edges of calf to see it
 

5083
01:25:16,719 --> 01:25:18,790
enough to the edges of calf to see it
what's uh what's the fob

5084
01:25:18,790 --> 01:25:18,800
what's uh what's the fob
 

5085
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:21,350
what's uh what's the fob
fob is a forward observation base which

5086
01:25:21,350 --> 01:25:21,360
fob is a forward observation base which
 

5087
01:25:21,360 --> 01:25:23,189
fob is a forward observation base which
is a small little base out in the middle

5088
01:25:23,189 --> 01:25:23,199
is a small little base out in the middle
 

5089
01:25:23,199 --> 01:25:24,870
is a small little base out in the middle
of wherever

5090
01:25:24,870 --> 01:25:24,880
of wherever
 

5091
01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:27,750
of wherever
and that's that's uh specific to our

5092
01:25:27,750 --> 01:25:27,760
and that's that's uh specific to our
 

5093
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:29,510
and that's that's uh specific to our
artillery

5094
01:25:29,510 --> 01:25:29,520
artillery
 

5095
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:31,510
artillery
that's in general just an observation

5096
01:25:31,510 --> 01:25:31,520
that's in general just an observation
 

5097
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:33,270
that's in general just an observation
base from which cramping tree to go in

5098
01:25:33,270 --> 01:25:33,280
base from which cramping tree to go in
 

5099
01:25:33,280 --> 01:25:35,350
base from which cramping tree to go in
and out of um for armor to go in and out

5100
01:25:35,350 --> 01:25:35,360
and out of um for armor to go in and out
 

5101
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:37,270
and out of um for armor to go in and out
of special ops go in and out of them

5102
01:25:37,270 --> 01:25:37,280
of special ops go in and out of them
 

5103
01:25:37,280 --> 01:25:38,790
of special ops go in and out of them
they fly they'll stop there they'll pick

5104
01:25:38,790 --> 01:25:38,800
they fly they'll stop there they'll pick
 

5105
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:40,149
they fly they'll stop there they'll pick
people up or do whatever then they'll go

5106
01:25:40,149 --> 01:25:40,159
people up or do whatever then they'll go
 

5107
01:25:40,159 --> 01:25:40,870
people up or do whatever then they'll go
out

5108
01:25:40,870 --> 01:25:40,880
out
 

5109
01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:43,110
out
so it's a forward observation basis is

5110
01:25:43,110 --> 01:25:43,120
so it's a forward observation basis is
 

5111
01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:44,950
so it's a forward observation basis is
is used essentially to have eyes in that

5112
01:25:44,950 --> 01:25:44,960
is used essentially to have eyes in that
 

5113
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:47,189
is used essentially to have eyes in that
area without having to be doing patrols

5114
01:25:47,189 --> 01:25:47,199
area without having to be doing patrols
 

5115
01:25:47,199 --> 01:25:49,110
area without having to be doing patrols
every five seconds but there's not is it

5116
01:25:49,110 --> 01:25:49,120
every five seconds but there's not is it
 

5117
01:25:49,120 --> 01:25:50,870
every five seconds but there's not is it
like is there like medics there is oh

5118
01:25:50,870 --> 01:25:50,880
like is there like medics there is oh
 

5119
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:52,950
like is there like medics there is oh
yeah yeah yeah so it was actual base

5120
01:25:52,950 --> 01:25:52,960
yeah yeah yeah so it was actual base
 

5121
01:25:52,960 --> 01:25:54,390
yeah yeah yeah so it was actual base
yeah i was a it's a

5122
01:25:54,390 --> 01:25:54,400
yeah i was a it's a
 

5123
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:56,070
yeah i was a it's a
i don't call it an actual base you sleep

5124
01:25:56,070 --> 01:25:56,080
i don't call it an actual base you sleep
 

5125
01:25:56,080 --> 01:25:58,709
i don't call it an actual base you sleep
in tents and cots and it is

5126
01:25:58,709 --> 01:25:58,719
in tents and cots and it is
 

5127
01:25:58,719 --> 01:26:01,189
in tents and cots and it is
the walls are this mesh material that

5128
01:26:01,189 --> 01:26:01,199
the walls are this mesh material that
 

5129
01:26:01,199 --> 01:26:02,870
the walls are this mesh material that
are filled with gravel

5130
01:26:02,870 --> 01:26:02,880
are filled with gravel
 

5131
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:04,950
are filled with gravel
and that's the walls

5132
01:26:04,950 --> 01:26:04,960
and that's the walls
 

5133
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:07,430
and that's the walls
and then you have towers you had five i

5134
01:26:07,430 --> 01:26:07,440
and then you have towers you had five i
 

5135
01:26:07,440 --> 01:26:08,550
and then you have towers you had five i
think we had five towers because the

5136
01:26:08,550 --> 01:26:08,560
think we had five towers because the
 

5137
01:26:08,560 --> 01:26:10,950
think we had five towers because the
americans ran four and we ran one and so

5138
01:26:10,950 --> 01:26:10,960
americans ran four and we ran one and so
 

5139
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:13,030
americans ran four and we ran one and so
it was an american fob it's called

5140
01:26:13,030 --> 01:26:13,040
it was an american fob it's called
 

5141
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:14,149
it was an american fob it's called
ramrod

5142
01:26:14,149 --> 01:26:14,159
ramrod
 

5143
01:26:14,159 --> 01:26:15,189
ramrod
and

5144
01:26:15,189 --> 01:26:15,199
and
 

5145
01:26:15,199 --> 01:26:16,950
and
there was a

5146
01:26:16,950 --> 01:26:16,960
there was a
 

5147
01:26:16,960 --> 01:26:18,950
there was a
were they marines no i think they were

5148
01:26:18,950 --> 01:26:18,960
were they marines no i think they were
 

5149
01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:21,750
were they marines no i think they were
the 101st they were out of their

5150
01:26:21,750 --> 01:26:21,760
the 101st they were out of their
 

5151
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:23,830
the 101st they were out of their
this is where i get dicey because i was

5152
01:26:23,830 --> 01:26:23,840
this is where i get dicey because i was
 

5153
01:26:23,840 --> 01:26:25,350
this is where i get dicey because i was
moved a lot so when people are like who

are you with i'm like
i know what their patches looked like

5158
01:26:29,030 --> 01:26:29,040
i know what their patches looked like
 

5159
01:26:29,040 --> 01:26:30,870
i know what their patches looked like
i don't know the full ins and outs so

5160
01:26:30,870 --> 01:26:30,880
i don't know the full ins and outs so
 

5161
01:26:30,880 --> 01:26:32,550
i don't know the full ins and outs so
i'm working on getting that back so that

5162
01:26:32,550 --> 01:26:32,560
i'm working on getting that back so that
 

5163
01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:33,830
i'm working on getting that back so that
i can tell it accurately because i

5164
01:26:33,830 --> 01:26:33,840
i can tell it accurately because i
 

5165
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:35,590
i can tell it accurately because i
believe it deserves that type of respect

5166
01:26:35,590 --> 01:26:35,600
believe it deserves that type of respect
 

5167
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:37,750
believe it deserves that type of respect
but that being said i'm still trying to

5168
01:26:37,750 --> 01:26:37,760
but that being said i'm still trying to
 

5169
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:39,750
but that being said i'm still trying to
you know wrap my brain around all of

5170
01:26:39,750 --> 01:26:39,760
you know wrap my brain around all of
 

5171
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:40,550
you know wrap my brain around all of
this

5172
01:26:40,550 --> 01:26:40,560
this
 

5173
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:42,390
this
yeah you almost have to go back and do

5174
01:26:42,390 --> 01:26:42,400
yeah you almost have to go back and do
 

5175
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:43,189
yeah you almost have to go back and do
like

5176
01:26:43,189 --> 01:26:43,199
like
 

5177
01:26:43,199 --> 01:26:44,629
like
research

5178
01:26:44,629 --> 01:26:44,639
research
 

5179
01:26:44,639 --> 01:26:46,550
research
to understand the full details of all

5180
01:26:46,550 --> 01:26:46,560
to understand the full details of all
 

5181

the things you were experiencing and so
i reached out to actually a bunch of

5184
01:26:49,270 --> 01:26:49,280
i reached out to actually a bunch of
 

5185
01:26:49,280 --> 01:26:50,629
i reached out to actually a bunch of
people even before i wrote the book and

5186
01:26:50,629 --> 01:26:50,639
people even before i wrote the book and
 

5187
01:26:50,639 --> 01:26:52,070
people even before i wrote the book and
i didn't get a lot of answers well once

5188
01:26:52,070 --> 01:26:52,080
i didn't get a lot of answers well once
 

5189
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:53,590
i didn't get a lot of answers well once
i did jocko all the people have reached

5190
01:26:53,590 --> 01:26:53,600
i did jocko all the people have reached
 

5191
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:55,189
i did jocko all the people have reached

5445
01:30:59,120 --> 01:31:00,229
there i believe the entry got there was
an attempt

5446
01:31:00,229 --> 01:31:00,239
an attempt
 

5447
01:31:00,239 --> 01:31:02,070
an attempt
there was an attempt at some point in a

there was an attempt at some point in a
 

5449
01:31:02,080 --> 01:31:04,790
there was an attempt at some point in a
past but i i wasn't privy to that

5450
01:31:04,790 --> 01:31:04,800
past but i i wasn't privy to that
 

5451
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:06,390
past but i i wasn't privy to that
but we were in the op towers so we had

5452
01:31:06,390 --> 01:31:06,400
but we were in the op towers so we had
 

5453
01:31:06,400 --> 01:31:08,870
but we were in the op towers so we had
to do our own security but because we

5454
01:31:08,870 --> 01:31:08,880
to do our own security but because we
 

5455
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:10,229
to do our own security but because we
were such a small subset of canadians

5456
01:31:10,229 --> 01:31:10,239
were such a small subset of canadians
 

5457
01:31:10,239 --> 01:31:11,669
were such a small subset of canadians
and we always had to have

5458
01:31:11,669 --> 01:31:11,679
and we always had to have
 

5459
01:31:11,679 --> 01:31:13,030
and we always had to have
people running the guns and ready to run

5463
01:31:14,480 --> 01:31:16,550
the guns at all times
we only had to man one tower so you

5464
01:31:16,550 --> 01:31:16,560
we only had to man one tower so you
 

5465
01:31:16,560 --> 01:31:18,229
we only had to man one tower so you
would do four hour shifts with a fire

5466
01:31:18,229 --> 01:31:18,239
would do four hour shifts with a fire
 

5467
01:31:18,239 --> 01:31:20,310
would do four hour shifts with a fire
team partner in the tower depending on

because it's too much space it's too

6246
01:44:23,990 --> 01:44:24,000
because it's too much space it's too
 

6247

because there's too much
 

6257
01:44:30,800 --> 01:44:32,790
because there's too much
line of sight line of sight could be

6258
01:44:32,790 --> 01:44:32,800
line of sight line of sight could be
 

6259
01:44:32,800 --> 01:44:34,870
line of sight line of sight could be
ieds it could be it could be it could be

6260
01:44:34,870 --> 01:44:34,880
ieds it could be it could be it could be

and so
uh

6266
01:44:39,510 --> 01:44:39,520
uh
 

6267
01:44:39,520 --> 01:44:42,709
uh
when i was leaning up against the wall

6268
01:44:42,709 --> 01:44:42,719
when i was leaning up against the wall
 

6269
01:44:42,719 --> 01:44:45,830
when i was leaning up against the wall
we'd send a couple people ahead to go

6270
01:44:45,830 --> 01:44:45,840
we'd send a couple people ahead to go
 

6271
01:44:45,840 --> 01:44:48,229
we'd send a couple people ahead to go
and clear the road so that we could all

6272
01:44:48,229 --> 01:44:48,239
and clear the road so that we could all
 

6273
01:44:48,239 --> 01:44:49,990
and clear the road so that we could all
go along it and then clear the gray pup

6274
01:44:49,990 --> 01:44:50,000
go along it and then clear the gray pup
 

6275
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,149
go along it and then clear the gray pup
off to the left hand side

6276
01:44:52,149 --> 01:44:52,159
off to the left hand side
 

6277
01:44:52,159 --> 01:44:54,070
off to the left hand side
we are doing that because

6278
01:44:54,070 --> 01:44:54,080
we are doing that because
 

6279
01:44:54,080 --> 01:44:56,790
we are doing that because
they use those locations to put ieds so

6280
01:44:56,790 --> 01:44:56,800
they use those locations to put ieds so
 

6281
01:44:56,800 --> 01:44:58,790
they use those locations to put ieds so
that when you're going to search it

6282
01:44:58,790 --> 01:44:58,800
that when you're going to search it
 

6283
01:44:58,800 --> 01:45:01,430
that when you're going to search it
it's just it's a better chance of you

6284
01:45:01,430 --> 01:45:01,440
it's just it's a better chance of you
 

6285
01:45:01,440 --> 01:45:02,629
it's just it's a better chance of you
blowing into a million pieces

6286
01:45:02,629 --> 01:45:02,639
blowing into a million pieces
 

6287
01:45:02,639 --> 01:45:04,390
blowing into a million pieces
essentially why they love that

6288
01:45:04,390 --> 01:45:04,400
essentially why they love that
 

6289
01:45:04,400 --> 01:45:06,149
essentially why they love that

a metal detector the brits carry them
 

6537
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:13,430

6541
01:49:14,560 --> 01:49:15,589
have them but i've only ever seen them
use it

6542
01:49:15,589 --> 01:49:15,599
use it
 

6543
01:49:15,599 --> 01:49:17,750

then you when you have to come back or

6692
01:51:43,910 --> 01:51:43,920
then you when you have to come back or
 

6693

it's a weird noise when they're coming
 

7149
01:59:40,560 --> 01:59:41,830
it's a weird noise when they're coming
at you then when you're leave they're

7150
01:59:41,830 --> 01:59:41,840
at you then when you're leave they're

and
so they

7156
01:59:45,430 --> 01:59:45,440
so they
 

7157
01:59:45,440 --> 01:59:46,470
so they
that

7158
01:59:46,470 --> 01:59:46,480

edge of the stretcher and everything
fell off into the ditch and then we had

although
it has echoes of that because that's

7342
02:02:47,589 --> 02:02:47,599
it has echoes of that because that's
 

7343
02:02:47,599 --> 02:02:49,510
it has echoes of that because that's
also absurd and

couldn't beat them this is why we
 

7793
02:11:01,520 --> 02:11:03,189
couldn't beat them this is why we
couldn't [\h__\h] beat them

no qualms with wiping a kid off the face

7804
02:11:13,669 --> 02:11:13,679
no qualms with wiping a kid off the face
 

7805
02:11:13,679 --> 02:11:15,589
no qualms with wiping a kid off the face
of the earth if it means they can get

7806
02:11:15,589 --> 02:11:15,599
of the earth if it means they can get
 

7807
02:11:15,599 --> 02:11:17,350
of the earth if it means they can get
close enough to a soldier to throw a

7808
02:11:17,350 --> 02:11:17,360
close enough to a soldier to throw a
 

7809
02:11:17,360 --> 02:11:19,990
close enough to a soldier to throw a
[\h__\h] bomb into their tank

7810

[\h__\h] bomb into their tank
 

7811
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:22,390
[\h__\h] bomb into their tank
this is why they're affected how do you

7812
02:11:22,390 --> 02:11:22,400
this is why they're affected how do you
 

7813
02:11:22,400 --> 02:11:24,629
this is why they're affected how do you
beat them then is this there's no

7814
02:11:24,629 --> 02:11:24,639
beat them then is this there's no
 

7815
02:11:24,639 --> 02:11:27,669
beat them then is this there's no
winning that you just basically do

7816
02:11:27,669 --> 02:11:27,679
winning that you just basically do
 

7817
02:11:27,679 --> 02:11:31,030
winning that you just basically do
policeman type work or you do your best

7818
02:11:31,030 --> 02:11:31,040
policeman type work or you do your best
 

7819

02:11:33,030 --> 02:11:33,040
i mean that's one way
 

7821
02:11:33,040 --> 02:11:35,030
i mean that's one way
so the other

7822
02:11:35,030 --> 02:11:35,040
so the other
 

7823
02:11:35,040 --> 02:11:37,750
so the other
is uh you come from the artillery

7824
02:11:37,750 --> 02:11:37,760
is uh you come from the artillery
 

7825
02:11:37,760 --> 02:11:39,830
is uh you come from the artillery
background a [\h__\h] hellfire missile

7826
02:11:39,830 --> 02:11:39,840
background a [\h__\h] hellfire missile
 

7827
02:11:39,840 --> 02:11:42,310
background a [\h__\h] hellfire missile
yeah the whole place off the face there

7828
02:11:42,310 --> 02:11:42,320
yeah the whole place off the face there
 

7829
02:11:42,320 --> 02:11:44,229
yeah the whole place off the face there
you can't beat radicalism like that

7830
02:11:44,229 --> 02:11:44,239
you can't beat radicalism like that
 

7831
02:11:44,239 --> 02:11:47,350
you can't beat radicalism like that
right now the problem is is we've

7832
02:11:47,350 --> 02:11:47,360
right now the problem is is we've
 

7833
02:11:47,360 --> 02:11:49,830
right now the problem is is we've
we've let it go unchecked we had it

7834
02:11:49,830 --> 02:11:49,840
we've let it go unchecked we had it
 

7835
02:11:49,840 --> 02:11:52,629
we've let it go unchecked we had it
kind of in check for 20 years we just

7836
02:11:52,629 --> 02:11:52,639
kind of in check for 20 years we just
 

7837
02:11:52,639 --> 02:11:54,950
kind of in check for 20 years we just
shot ourselves in the foot the chest and

7838
02:11:54,950 --> 02:11:54,960
shot ourselves in the foot the chest and
 

7839
02:11:54,960 --> 02:11:56,629
shot ourselves in the foot the chest and
the face

7840
02:11:56,629 --> 02:11:56,639
the face
 

7841
02:11:56,639 --> 02:11:58,629
the face
so the the problem

7842
02:11:58,629 --> 02:11:58,639
so the the problem
 

7843
02:11:58,639 --> 02:12:00,550
so the the problem
with uh force

7844
02:12:00,550 --> 02:12:00,560
with uh force
 

7845
02:12:00,560 --> 02:12:03,669
with uh force
is it creates long-term hate

9695
02:43:12,800 --> 02:43:15,110
brilliant yeah so uh what i mean i
suppose this is a

9696
02:43:15,110 --> 02:43:15,120
suppose this is a
 

9697
02:43:15,120 --> 02:43:16,389
suppose this is a
lazy

9698
02:43:16,389 --> 02:43:16,399
lazy
 

9699
02:43:16,399 --> 02:43:19,269
lazy
way of dealing with trauma yeah and it's

9700
02:43:19,269 --> 02:43:19,279
way of dealing with trauma yeah and it's
 

9701
02:43:19,279 --> 02:43:21,590
way of dealing with trauma yeah and it's
for the military in some sense if you

9702
02:43:21,590 --> 02:43:21,600
for the military in some sense if you
 

9703
02:43:21,600 --> 02:43:23,510
for the military in some sense if you
don't have a good program in place this

9704
02:43:23,510 --> 02:43:23,520
don't have a good program in place this
 

9705
02:43:23,520 --> 02:43:24,630
don't have a good program in place this
makes sense

9706
02:43:24,630 --> 02:43:24,640
makes sense
 

9707
02:43:24,640 --> 02:43:25,990
makes sense
but you should have a good program in

9708
02:43:25,990 --> 02:43:26,000
but you should have a good program in
 

9709
02:43:26,000 --> 02:43:28,389
but you should have a good program in
place just like you said on the prep on

9710
02:43:28,389 --> 02:43:28,399
place just like you said on the prep on
 

9711
02:43:28,399 --> 02:43:30,070
place just like you said on the prep on
the mental prep side

9712
02:43:30,070 --> 02:43:30,080
the mental prep side
 

9713
02:43:30,080 --> 02:43:32,950
the mental prep side
like just any prep like training people

9714
02:43:32,950 --> 02:43:32,960
like just any prep like training people
 

9715
02:43:32,960 --> 02:43:34,630
like just any prep like training people
training people on the

9716
02:43:34,630 --> 02:43:34,640
training people on the
 

9717
02:43:34,640 --> 02:43:36,389
training people on the
as opposed to

9718
02:43:36,389 --> 02:43:36,399
as opposed to
 

9719
02:43:36,399 --> 02:43:38,550
as opposed to
i guess train the fact that you're going

9720
02:43:38,550 --> 02:43:38,560
i guess train the fact that you're going
 

9721
02:43:38,560 --> 02:43:40,150
i guess train the fact that you're going
to have

9722
02:43:40,150 --> 02:43:40,160
to have
 

9723
02:43:40,160 --> 02:43:42,950
to have
somebody close to you blow up

9724
02:43:42,950 --> 02:43:42,960
somebody close to you blow up
 

9725
02:43:42,960 --> 02:43:44,790
somebody close to you blow up
like you have to probably visualize that

9726
02:43:44,790 --> 02:43:44,800
like you have to probably visualize that
 

9727
02:43:44,800 --> 02:43:46,469
like you have to probably visualize that
you have to think to that you have to

9728
02:43:46,469 --> 02:43:46,479
you have to think to that you have to
 

9729
02:43:46,479 --> 02:43:48,469
you have to think to that you have to
have a process of how to deal with

9730
02:43:48,469 --> 02:43:48,479
have a process of how to deal with
 

9731
02:43:48,479 --> 02:43:50,550
have a process of how to deal with
something like that with that kind of

9732
02:43:50,550 --> 02:43:50,560
something like that with that kind of
 

9733
02:43:50,560 --> 02:43:54,070
something like that with that kind of
trauma and then that's it

9734
02:43:54,070 --> 02:43:54,080

 

9735
02:43:54,080 --> 02:43:56,389

exactly i mean and it's not like

9736
02:43:56,389 --> 02:43:56,399
exactly i mean and it's not like
 

9737
02:43:56,399 --> 02:43:59,510
exactly i mean and it's not like
weakness it's actually strength it's uh

9738
02:43:59,510 --> 02:43:59,520
weakness it's actually strength it's uh
 

9739
02:43:59,520 --> 02:44:00,389
weakness it's actually strength it's uh
like

9740
02:44:00,389 --> 02:44:00,399
like
 

9741
02:44:00,399 --> 02:44:02,309
like
you have to be mentally strong enough to

9742
02:44:02,309 --> 02:44:02,319
you have to be mentally strong enough to
 

9743
02:44:02,319 --> 02:44:03,670
you have to be mentally strong enough to
process that

9744
02:44:03,670 --> 02:44:03,680
process that
 

9745
02:44:03,680 --> 02:44:05,670
process that
that probably takes

9746
02:44:05,670 --> 02:44:05,680
that probably takes
 

9747
02:44:05,680 --> 02:44:07,830
that probably takes
a lot of training but it's a great

9748
02:44:07,830 --> 02:44:07,840
a lot of training but it's a great
 

9749
02:44:07,840 --> 02:44:10,950
a lot of training but it's a great
training right well worth it to to

9750
02:44:10,950 --> 02:44:10,960
training right well worth it to to
 

9751
02:44:10,960 --> 02:44:13,670
training right well worth it to to
protect your investment training right

9752
02:44:13,670 --> 02:44:13,680
protect your investment training right
 

9753

sometimes people are really struggling
like really struggling in a way they're

9928

like really struggling in a way they're
 

9929
02:47:32,880 --> 02:47:35,990
like really struggling in a way they're
being they're like it's the the goggins

9930
02:47:35,990 --> 02:47:36,000
being they're like it's the the goggins
 

9931
02:47:36,000 --> 02:47:37,670
being they're like it's the the goggins
thing is like

9932
02:47:37,670 --> 02:47:37,680
thing is like
 

9933
02:47:37,680 --> 02:47:39,190
thing is like
where's the line to where you're

9934
02:47:39,190 --> 02:47:39,200
where's the line to where you're
 

9935
02:47:39,200 --> 02:47:41,910
where's the line to where you're
actually breaking the human being versus

9936
02:47:41,910 --> 02:47:41,920
actually breaking the human being versus
 

9937
02:47:41,920 --> 02:47:43,110
actually breaking the human being versus
where you're

9938
02:47:43,110 --> 02:47:43,120
where you're
 

9939
02:47:43,120 --> 02:47:45,510
where you're
breaking them at the places where they

9940
02:47:45,510 --> 02:47:45,520
breaking them at the places where they
 

9941
02:47:45,520 --> 02:47:47,510
breaking them at the places where they
will grow back stronger

9942
02:47:47,510 --> 02:47:47,520
will grow back stronger
 

9943
02:47:47,520 --> 02:47:51,349
will grow back stronger
like so and that line is tricky uh to

9944
02:47:51,349 --> 02:47:51,359
like so and that line is tricky uh to
 

9945
02:47:51,359 --> 02:47:53,190
like so and that line is tricky uh to
truly understand i think the military

9946
02:47:53,190 --> 02:47:53,200
truly understand i think the military
 

9947
02:47:53,200 --> 02:47:55,910
truly understand i think the military

9949
02:47:55,920 --> 02:47:58,630

you need to be aware so i don't know if

14308
04:02:15,830 --> 04:02:15,840
you need to be aware so i don't know if

afraid of like this irrational thing
 

14319
04:02:25,040 --> 04:02:26,790
afraid of like this irrational thing
and then i went overseas and then i

14320
04:02:26,790 --> 04:02:26,800
and then i went overseas and then i
 

14321
04:02:26,800 --> 04:02:28,229
and then i went overseas and then i
realized that i could just be literally

14322
04:02:28,229 --> 04:02:28,239
realized that i could just be literally
 

14323
04:02:28,239 --> 04:02:29,590
realized that i could just be literally
there talking you having a conversation

14324
04:02:29,590 --> 04:02:29,600
there talking you having a conversation
 

14325
04:02:29,600 --> 04:02:30,710
there talking you having a conversation
and i could just be taken off the face

14326
04:02:30,710 --> 04:02:30,720
and i could just be taken off the face
 

14327
04:02:30,720 --> 04:02:31,990
and i could just be taken off the face
of the earth

14328
04:02:31,990 --> 04:02:32,000
of the earth
 

14329
04:02:32,000 --> 04:02:34,550
of the earth
and there's nothing i can do about it

14330
04:02:34,550 --> 04:02:34,560
and there's nothing i can do about it
 

14331
04:02:34,560 --> 04:02:36,150
and there's nothing i can do about it
and then i adapted this idea that when

14332
04:02:36,150 --> 04:02:36,160
and then i adapted this idea that when
 

14333
04:02:36,160 --> 04:02:38,550
and then i adapted this idea that when
it's my time it'll be my time but

14334
04:02:38,550 --> 04:02:38,560
it's my time it'll be my time but
 

14335
04:02:38,560 --> 04:02:42,229
it's my time it'll be my time but
the difference is now

14336
04:02:42,229 --> 04:02:42,239
the difference is now
 

14337
04:02:42,239 --> 04:02:45,349
the difference is now
at least i know that

14338
