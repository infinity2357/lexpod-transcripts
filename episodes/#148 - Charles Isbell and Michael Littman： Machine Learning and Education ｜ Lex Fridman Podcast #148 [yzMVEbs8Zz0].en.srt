00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:48,000
so one thing that you sometimes mention
 

171
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,869
so one thing that you sometimes mention
is that and we did this one on air too

172
00:02:50,869 --> 00:02:50,879
is that and we did this one on air too
 

173
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:51,750
is that and we did this one on air too
as it were

174
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:51,760
as it were
 

175
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,910
as it were
whether or not machine learning is

176
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:53,920
whether or not machine learning is
 

177
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,190
whether or not machine learning is
computational statistics

178
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:55,200
computational statistics
 

179
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,390
computational statistics
it's not but it is well it's not

180
00:02:58,390 --> 00:02:58,400
it's not but it is well it's not
 

181
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,390
it's not but it is well it's not
and in particular and more importantly

182
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:00,400
and in particular and more importantly
 

183
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,710
and in particular and more importantly
it is not just computational statistics

184
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:02,720
it is not just computational statistics
 

185
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,470
it is not just computational statistics
so what's missing in the picture what

186
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:04,480
so what's missing in the picture what
 

187
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,710
so what's missing in the picture what
all the rest of it

188
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:06,720
all the rest of it
 

189
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,630
all the rest of it
what's missing that which is missing oh

190
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:08,640
what's missing that which is missing oh
 

191
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,390
what's missing that which is missing oh
because well you can't be wrong now well

192
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:10,400
because well you can't be wrong now well
 

193
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,830
because well you can't be wrong now well
it's not just the statistics he doesn't

194
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:11,840
it's not just the statistics he doesn't
 

195
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,630
it's not just the statistics he doesn't
even believe this

196
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:12,640
even believe this
 

197
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,470
even believe this
we've had this conversation before if it

198
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:14,480
we've had this conversation before if it
 

199
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,550
we've had this conversation before if it
were just the statistics then

200
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:16,560
were just the statistics then
 

201
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,869
were just the statistics then
we would be happy with where we are but

202
00:03:18,869 --> 00:03:18,879
we would be happy with where we are but
 

203
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:19,990
we would be happy with where we are but
it's not just the statistics that's why

204
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:20,000
it's not just the statistics that's why
 

205
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,670
it's not just the statistics that's why
it's computational statistics or if it

206
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:21,680
it's computational statistics or if it
 

207
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,110
it's computational statistics or if it
were just the computation i agree that

208
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:23,120
were just the computation i agree that
 

209
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,630
were just the computation i agree that
machine learning is not just statistics

210
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:24,640
machine learning is not just statistics
 

211
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,309
machine learning is not just statistics
it is not just this we can agree on that

212
00:03:26,309 --> 00:03:26,319
it is not just this we can agree on that
 

213
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:27,990
it is not just this we can agree on that
nor is it just computational statistics

214
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:28,000
nor is it just computational statistics
 

215
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,509
nor is it just computational statistics
it's computational statistics it is

216
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:29,519
it's computational statistics it is
 

217
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,270
it's computational statistics it is
computational what is the computational

218
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:31,280
computational what is the computational
 

219
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,949
computational what is the computational
and computational statistics

220
00:03:32,949 --> 00:03:32,959
and computational statistics
 

221
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,309
and computational statistics
does this take us into the realm of

222
00:03:34,309 --> 00:03:34,319
does this take us into the realm of
 

223
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,470
does this take us into the realm of
computing it does but i think

224
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:36,480
computing it does but i think
 

225
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,550
computing it does but i think
perhaps the way i can get him to admit

226
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:38,560
perhaps the way i can get him to admit
 

227
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,309
perhaps the way i can get him to admit
that uh he's wrong

228
00:03:40,309 --> 00:03:40,319
that uh he's wrong
 

229
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,670
that uh he's wrong
is that it's about rules it's about

230
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:43,680
is that it's about rules it's about
 

231
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,070
is that it's about rules it's about
rules

232
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:44,080
rules
 

233
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,509
rules
it's about symbols it's about all these

234
00:03:45,509 --> 00:03:45,519
it's about symbols it's about all these
 

235
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,110
it's about symbols it's about all these
other things statistics it's not about

236
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:47,120
other things statistics it's not about
 

237
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,390
other things statistics it's not about
rules i'm going to say statistics is

238
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:48,400
rules i'm going to say statistics is
 

239
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,430
rules i'm going to say statistics is
about rules but it's not just the

240
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:49,440
about rules but it's not just the
 

241
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,869
about rules but it's not just the
statistics right it's not just a random

242
00:03:50,869 --> 00:03:50,879
statistics right it's not just a random
 

243
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,070
statistics right it's not just a random
variable that you choose and you have a

244
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:52,080
variable that you choose and you have a
 

245
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,589
variable that you choose and you have a
probability i think you have a narrow

246
00:03:53,589 --> 00:03:53,599
probability i think you have a narrow
 

247
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:54,470
probability i think you have a narrow
view of statistics

248
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:54,480
view of statistics
 

249
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,070
view of statistics
okay well then what would be the broad

250
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:56,080
okay well then what would be the broad
 

251
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,270
okay well then what would be the broad
view of statistics that would still

252
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:57,280
view of statistics that would still
 

253
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,270
view of statistics that would still
allow it to be statistics and not say

254
00:03:59,270 --> 00:03:59,280
allow it to be statistics and not say
 

255
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,910
allow it to be statistics and not say
history that would make computational

256
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:01,920
history that would make computational
 

257
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,869
history that would make computational
statistics okay

258
00:04:02,869 --> 00:04:02,879
statistics okay
 

259
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:05,990
statistics okay
well okay so i i had my first sort of

260
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:06,000
well okay so i i had my first sort of
 

261
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,110
well okay so i i had my first sort of
research mentor

262
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:07,120
research mentor
 

263
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,070
research mentor
a guy named tom landauer taught me to do

264
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:10,080
a guy named tom landauer taught me to do
 

265
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,830
a guy named tom landauer taught me to do
some statistics

266
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:11,840
some statistics
 

267
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,630
some statistics
right sure and and i was annoyed all the

268
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:14,640
right sure and and i was annoyed all the
 

269
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,990
right sure and and i was annoyed all the
time because the statistics would say

270
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:16,000
time because the statistics would say
 

271
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,189
time because the statistics would say
that what i was doing was not

272
00:04:17,189 --> 00:04:17,199
that what i was doing was not
 

273
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:19,189
that what i was doing was not
statistically significant

274
00:04:19,189 --> 00:04:19,199
statistically significant
 

275
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:22,550
statistically significant
and i was like but but but and basically

276
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:22,560
and i was like but but but and basically
 

277
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,670
and i was like but but but and basically
what he said to me is

278
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:23,680
what he said to me is
 

279
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,030
what he said to me is
statistics is how you're going to keep

280
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:25,040
statistics is how you're going to keep
 

281
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,510
statistics is how you're going to keep
from lying to yourself

282
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:27,520
from lying to yourself
 

283
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,230
from lying to yourself
which i thought was really deep it is a

284
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:30,240
which i thought was really deep it is a
 

285
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:30,710
which i thought was really deep it is a
way

286
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:30,720
way
 

287
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,870
way
to keep yourself honest in a particular

288
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:32,880
to keep yourself honest in a particular
 

289
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,990
to keep yourself honest in a particular
way i agree with that

290
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:34,000
way i agree with that
 

291
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,790
way i agree with that
yeah and so you're trying to find rules

292
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:36,800
yeah and so you're trying to find rules
 

293
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,629
yeah and so you're trying to find rules
i'm just kind of bringing back to rules

294
00:04:38,629 --> 00:04:38,639
i'm just kind of bringing back to rules

00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,749
i'm just kind of bringing back to rules

i mean like hypothesis testing kind of

314
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:57,520
i mean like hypothesis testing kind of
 

315
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,749
i mean like hypothesis testing kind of
or like confidence intervals like

316
00:04:59,749 --> 00:04:59,759
or like confidence intervals like
 

317
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,670
or like confidence intervals like
like have like more like hypothesis like

318
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:01,680
like have like more like hypothesis like
 

319
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,350
like have like more like hypothesis like
i feel like the word statistic literally

320
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:03,360
i feel like the word statistic literally
 

321
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,550
i feel like the word statistic literally
means like a summary

322
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:04,560
means like a summary
 

323
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,990
means like a summary
like a number that summarizes other

324
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:06,000
like a number that summarizes other
 

325
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,670
like a number that summarizes other
numbers right but i think the field of

326
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:07,680
numbers right but i think the field of
 

327
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,070
numbers right but i think the field of
statistics actually applies that idea

328
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:10,080
statistics actually applies that idea
 

329
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,749
statistics actually applies that idea
to things like rules to understand

330
00:05:11,749 --> 00:05:11,759
to things like rules to understand
 

331
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,310
to things like rules to understand
whether or not a rule is

332
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:14,320

statistics

336
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:18,160
statistics
 

337
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,110
statistics
no programming languages statistics no

338
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:21,120
no programming languages statistics no
 

339
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,469
no programming languages statistics no
because i think there's a very it's

just if to put it in language that you

354
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:32,000
just if to put it in language that you
 

355
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,189
just if to put it in language that you
might understand

356
00:05:33,189 --> 00:05:33,199
might understand
 

357
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,029
might understand
in the hyper parameters beyond the

in the hyper parameters beyond the

00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,150
many syllables for me to understand
the hyperparameters of uh that's better

the hyperparameters of uh that's better
 

365
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,350
the hyperparameters of uh that's better
that goes around it right it's the

366
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:41,360
that goes around it right it's the
 

367
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,590
that goes around it right it's the
decisions you choose to make it's the

368
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:43,600
decisions you choose to make it's the
 

369
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,670

371
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,870
metrics you choose to use it's the loss
you want to say the practice

372
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:46,880
you want to say the practice
 

373
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,790
you want to say the practice
of machine learning is different than

374
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:48,800
of machine learning is different than
 

375
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,310
of machine learning is different than
the practice of statistics like the

376
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:50,320
the practice of statistics like the
 

377
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,749
the practice of statistics like the
things you have to worry about and how

378
00:05:51,749 --> 00:05:51,759
things you have to worry about and how
 

379
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:53,350
things you have to worry about and how
you worry about them are different

380
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:53,360
you worry about them are different
 

381
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,670
you worry about them are different
therefore they're different right at a

382
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:55,680
therefore they're different right at a
 

383
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,830
therefore they're different right at a
very little i mean at the very least

384
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:57,840
very little i mean at the very least
 

385
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,270
very little i mean at the very least
it's that that much is true it doesn't

386
00:05:59,270 --> 00:05:59,280
it's that that much is true it doesn't
 

387
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,870
it's that that much is true it doesn't
mean that statistics computational or

388
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:00,880
mean that statistics computational or
 

389
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,230
mean that statistics computational or
otherwise aren't important

390
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:02,240
otherwise aren't important
 

391
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,150
otherwise aren't important
i think they are i mean i do a lot of

392
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:04,160
i think they are i mean i do a lot of
 

393
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,590
i think they are i mean i do a lot of
that for example

394
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:05,600
that for example
 

395
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,110
that for example
but i think it goes beyond and i think

396
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:07,120
but i think it goes beyond and i think
 

397
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,189
but i think it goes beyond and i think
that we could think about game theory in

398
00:06:09,189 --> 00:06:09,199
that we could think about game theory in
 

399
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:10,469
that we could think about game theory in
terms of statistics but i don't think

400
00:06:10,469 --> 00:06:10,479
terms of statistics but i don't think
 

401
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:11,029
terms of statistics but i don't think
it's very

402
00:06:11,029 --> 00:06:11,039
it's very
 

403
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:13,430
it's very
as useful to do i mean the way i would

404
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:13,440
as useful to do i mean the way i would
 

405
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,790
as useful to do i mean the way i would
think about it or a way i would think

406
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:14,800
think about it or a way i would think
 

407
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,270
think about it or a way i would think
about it

408
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:15,280
about it
 

409
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,309
about it
is this way chemistry is just

410
00:06:18,309 --> 00:06:18,319
is this way chemistry is just
 

411
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,950
is this way chemistry is just
physics but i don't think it's as useful

412
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:20,960
physics but i don't think it's as useful
 

413
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,870
physics but i don't think it's as useful
to think about chemistry as being just

414
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:22,880
to think about chemistry as being just
 

415
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,550
to think about chemistry as being just
physics it's useful to think about it as

416
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:24,560
physics it's useful to think about it as
 

417
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,309
physics it's useful to think about it as
chemistry the level of abstraction

418
00:06:26,309 --> 00:06:26,319
chemistry the level of abstraction
 

419
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,469
chemistry the level of abstraction
really matters here so i think it is

420
00:06:28,469 --> 00:06:28,479
really matters here so i think it is
 

421
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:30,790
really matters here so i think it is
there are contexts in which it is useful

422
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:30,800
there are contexts in which it is useful
 

423
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,990
there are contexts in which it is useful
that way right so finding that

424
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:32,000
that way right so finding that
 

425
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,270
that way right so finding that
connection is actually helpful and i

426
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:33,280
connection is actually helpful and i
 

427
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,790
connection is actually helpful and i
think that's when i when i emphasize the

428
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:34,800
think that's when i when i emphasize the
 

429
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,950
think that's when i when i emphasize the
computational statistics thing i think

430
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:36,960
computational statistics thing i think
 

431
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,990
computational statistics thing i think
i think i want to befriend statistics

432
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:40,000
i think i want to befriend statistics
 

433
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,469
i think i want to befriend statistics
and not absorb them here's the here's

434
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:42,479
and not absorb them here's the here's
 

435
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,070
and not absorb them here's the here's
the a way to think about it beyond what

436
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:44,080
the a way to think about it beyond what
 

437
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,990
the a way to think about it beyond what
i just said right so

438
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:46,000
i just said right so
 

439
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,510
i just said right so
what would you say and i want you to

440
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:47,520
what would you say and i want you to
 

441
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,550
what would you say and i want you to
think back to a conversation we had a

442
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:48,560
think back to a conversation we had a
 

443
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,070
think back to a conversation we had a
very long time ago what would you say is

444
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:50,080
very long time ago what would you say is
 

445
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,070
very long time ago what would you say is
the difference between

446
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:52,080
the difference between
 

447
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,350
the difference between
say the early 2000's icml and what we

448
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:55,360
say the early 2000's icml and what we
 

449
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,029
say the early 2000's icml and what we
used to call nips nerfs

450
00:06:57,029 --> 00:06:57,039
used to call nips nerfs
 

451
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:58,790
used to call nips nerfs
was there a difference a lot of the

452
00:06:58,790 --> 00:06:58,800
was there a difference a lot of the
 

453
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,830
was there a difference a lot of the
particularly on the machine learning

454
00:06:59,830 --> 00:06:59,840
particularly on the machine learning
 

455
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,870
particularly on the machine learning
that was done there

456
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:00,880
that was done there
 

457
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,589
that was done there
icmo was around that long oh yeah so

458
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:03,599
icmo was around that long oh yeah so
 

459
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:05,189
icmo was around that long oh yeah so
iclear is the new conference

460
00:07:05,189 --> 00:07:05,199
iclear is the new conference
 

461
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,990
iclear is the new conference
newish uh yeah i guess so and i see him

462
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:08,000
newish uh yeah i guess so and i see him
 

463
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,390
newish uh yeah i guess so and i see him
i was

464
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:08,400
i was
 

465
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,029
i was
around the 2000 oh i see male predates

466
00:07:11,029 --> 00:07:11,039
around the 2000 oh i see male predates
 

467
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:11,510
around the 2000 oh i see male predates
that

468
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:11,520
that
 

469
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,990
that
i well i think my most cited icml paper

470
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:14,000
i well i think my most cited icml paper
 

471
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,350
i well i think my most cited icml paper
is from 94. yeah

472
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:15,360
is from 94. yeah
 

473
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,390
is from 94. yeah
michael knows this better than me

474
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:16,400
michael knows this better than me
 

475
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,430
michael knows this better than me
because of course he's significantly

476
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:17,440
because of course he's significantly
 

477
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,790
because of course he's significantly
older than i am but the point is

478
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:18,800
older than i am but the point is
 

479
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,230
older than i am but the point is
yeah what is the difference what was the

480
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:20,240
yeah what is the difference what was the
 

481
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,309
yeah what is the difference what was the
difference between icml and nureps

482
00:07:22,309 --> 00:07:22,319
difference between icml and nureps
 

483
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,629
difference between icml and nureps
in the late 90s early 2000s i don't know

484
00:07:24,629 --> 00:07:24,639
in the late 90s early 2000s i don't know
 

485
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,230
in the late 90s early 2000s i don't know
what everyone else's perspective would

486
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:26,240
what everyone else's perspective would
 

487
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,150
what everyone else's perspective would
be but i had a particular perspective at

488
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:28,160
be but i had a particular perspective at
 

489
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:28,790
be but i had a particular perspective at
that time

490
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:28,800
that time
 

491
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,589
that time
which is i felt like icml was more of a

492
00:07:31,589 --> 00:07:31,599
which is i felt like icml was more of a
 

493
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:32,950
which is i felt like icml was more of a
of a computer science

494
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:32,960
of a computer science
 

495
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,909
of a computer science
place and that nips nerfs was more of an

496
00:07:35,909 --> 00:07:35,919
place and that nips nerfs was more of an
 

497
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:37,029
place and that nips nerfs was more of an
engineering place

498
00:07:37,029 --> 00:07:37,039
engineering place
 

499
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,029
engineering place
like the kind of math that happened at

500
00:07:39,029 --> 00:07:39,039
like the kind of math that happened at
 

501
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:40,469
like the kind of math that happened at
the two places

502
00:07:40,469 --> 00:07:40,479
the two places
 

503
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:41,909
the two places
as a computer scientist i felt more

504
00:07:41,909 --> 00:07:41,919
as a computer scientist i felt more
 

505
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,390
as a computer scientist i felt more
comfortable with the icml math

506
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:44,400
comfortable with the icml math
 

507
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,790
comfortable with the icml math
and the nurbs people would say that

508
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:46,800
and the nurbs people would say that
 

509
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,790
and the nurbs people would say that
that's because i'm dumb

510
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:48,800
that's because i'm dumb
 

511
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,629
that's because i'm dumb
and that's such an engineering thing to

512
00:07:50,629 --> 00:07:50,639
and that's such an engineering thing to
 

513
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,550
and that's such an engineering thing to
say so i agree with that part of it but

514
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:52,560
say so i agree with that part of it but
 

515
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:52,790
say so i agree with that part of it but
i

516
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:52,800
i
 

517
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,990
i
do a little differently actually i had a

518
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:54,000
do a little differently actually i had a
 

519
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,270
do a little differently actually i had a
nice conversation with tom dietrich

520
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:55,280
nice conversation with tom dietrich
 

521
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,390
nice conversation with tom dietrich
about this

522
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:56,400
about this
 

523
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,230
about this
in public on twitter just a couple days

524
00:07:58,230 --> 00:07:58,240
in public on twitter just a couple days
 

525
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,589
in public on twitter just a couple days
ago i put it a little differently which

526
00:07:59,589 --> 00:07:59,599
ago i put it a little differently which
 

527
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:00,950
ago i put it a little differently which
is that icml was

528
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:00,960
is that icml was
 

529
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,510
is that icml was
machine learning done by uh computer

530
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:03,520
machine learning done by uh computer
 

531
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,550
machine learning done by uh computer
scientists

532
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:04,560
scientists
 

533
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,830
scientists
and uh nurbs was machine learning done

534
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:07,840
and uh nurbs was machine learning done
 

535
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,950
and uh nurbs was machine learning done
by computer scientists

536
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:08,960
by computer scientists
 

537
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,790
by computer scientists
trying to impress statisticians

538
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:12,800
trying to impress statisticians
 

539
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,230
trying to impress statisticians
which was weird because it's the same

540
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:14,240
which was weird because it's the same
 

541
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,309
which was weird because it's the same
people at least by the time i started

542
00:08:16,309 --> 00:08:16,319
people at least by the time i started
 

543
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:17,110
people at least by the time i started
paying attention

544
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:17,120
paying attention
 

545
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,950
paying attention
but it just felt very very different and

546
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:18,960
but it just felt very very different and
 

547
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,189
but it just felt very very different and
i think that that perspective of whether

548
00:08:21,189 --> 00:08:21,199
i think that that perspective of whether
 

549
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:21,990
i think that that perspective of whether
you're trying to impress the

550
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:22,000
you're trying to impress the
 

551
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,350
you're trying to impress the
statisticians or you're trying to

552
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:23,360
statisticians or you're trying to
 

553
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,710
statisticians or you're trying to
impress the programmers is actually very

554
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:24,720
impress the programmers is actually very
 

555
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,189
impress the programmers is actually very
different and has real impact on

556
00:08:27,189 --> 00:08:27,199
different and has real impact on
 

557
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:29,510
different and has real impact on
what yeah what you choose to worry about

558
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:29,520
what yeah what you choose to worry about
 

559
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,550
what yeah what you choose to worry about
and what kind of uh

560
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:30,560
and what kind of uh
 

561
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,070
and what kind of uh
outcomes you come to so i think it

562
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:32,080
outcomes you come to so i think it
 

563
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,110
outcomes you come to so i think it
really matters in computational

564
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:33,120
really matters in computational
 

565
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,550
really matters in computational
statistics is a means to an end it is

566
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:34,560
statistics is a means to an end it is
 

567
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,149
statistics is a means to an end it is
not an end in some sense

568
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:36,159
not an end in some sense
 

569
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,949
not an end in some sense
um and i think that really matters here

570
00:08:38,949 --> 00:08:38,959
um and i think that really matters here
 

571
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:40,070
um and i think that really matters here
in the same way that i don't think

572
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:40,080
in the same way that i don't think
 

573
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,509
in the same way that i don't think
computer science is just engineering or

574
00:08:41,509 --> 00:08:41,519
computer science is just engineering or
 

575
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:42,870
computer science is just engineering or
just science or just math or whatever

576
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:42,880
just science or just math or whatever
 

577
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,110
just science or just math or whatever
but

578
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:43,120
but
 

579
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,190
but
okay so i'd have to now agree that now

580
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:45,200
okay so i'd have to now agree that now
 

581
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,230
okay so i'd have to now agree that now
we agree on everything

582
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:46,240
we agree on everything
 

583
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,509
we agree on everything
yes yes the important thing here is that

584
00:08:49,509 --> 00:08:49,519
yes yes the important thing here is that
 

585
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,590
yes yes the important thing here is that
you know my opinions may have changed

586
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:51,600
you know my opinions may have changed
 

587
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,870
you know my opinions may have changed
but not the fact that i'm right

588
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:52,880
but not the fact that i'm right
 

589
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,470
but not the fact that i'm right
i think is what what we just came to

590
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:54,480
i think is what what we just came to
 

591
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,750
i think is what what we just came to
right now my opinions may have changed

592
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:55,760
right now my opinions may have changed
 

593
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,190
right now my opinions may have changed
and not the fact that i'm wrong

594
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:57,200
and not the fact that i'm wrong
 

595
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,550
and not the fact that i'm wrong
that's right i lost me i'm not i think i

596
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:00,560
that's right i lost me i'm not i think i
 

597
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,150
that's right i lost me i'm not i think i
lost myself there too but anyway

598
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:04,160

 

599
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,070

this happens to us sometimes we're sorry

600
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:06,080
this happens to us sometimes we're sorry
 

601
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,990
this happens to us sometimes we're sorry
how does neural networks change

602
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:08,000
how does neural networks change
 

603
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,030
how does neural networks change
this just to even linger on this topic

604
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:11,040
this just to even linger on this topic
 

605
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:15,509
this just to even linger on this topic
change this idea of statistics

606
00:09:15,509 --> 00:09:15,519
change this idea of statistics
 

607
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,910
change this idea of statistics
how big of a pi statistics is within the

608

how big of a pi statistics is within the
 

609
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,030
how big of a pi statistics is within the
machine learning thing

machine learning thing
 

611
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,829
machine learning thing
like because it sounds like hyper

like because it sounds like hyper
 

613
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:23,110
like because it sounds like hyper
parameters and also just the role of

um i would add one well but
 

651
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,550
um i would add one well but
that's true i'll force myself to i think

there's one thing i would add to your
 

657
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,310
there's one thing i would add to your
description which is the kind of

658
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:08,320
description which is the kind of
 

659
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,269
description which is the kind of
software engineering part is what does

660
00:10:09,269 --> 00:10:09,279
software engineering part is what does
 

661
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,790
software engineering part is what does
it mean to debug for example

662
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:10,800
it mean to debug for example
 

663
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,030
it mean to debug for example
but this is a difference between uh the

664
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:13,040
but this is a difference between uh the
 

665
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,710
but this is a difference between uh the
kind of computational statistics view

666
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:14,720
kind of computational statistics view
 

667
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,069
kind of computational statistics view
of machine learning and the

668
00:10:16,069 --> 00:10:16,079
of machine learning and the
 

669
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:17,910
of machine learning and the
computational view of machine learning

670
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:17,920
computational view of machine learning
 

671
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,590
computational view of machine learning
which is i think one is worried about

672
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:19,600
which is i think one is worried about
 

673
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,949
which is i think one is worried about
the equation as it were and

674
00:10:20,949 --> 00:10:20,959
the equation as it were and
 

675
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:23,030
the equation as it were and
by the way this is not a value judgment

676
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:23,040
by the way this is not a value judgment
 

677
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:23,990
by the way this is not a value judgment
i just think it's about

678
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:24,000
i just think it's about
 

679
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,829
i just think it's about
perspective but the kind of questions

680
00:10:25,829 --> 00:10:25,839
perspective but the kind of questions
 

681
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:26,949
perspective but the kind of questions
you would ask when you start asking

682
00:10:26,949 --> 00:10:26,959
you would ask when you start asking
 

683
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,230
you would ask when you start asking
yourself what does it mean to program

684
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:28,240
yourself what does it mean to program
 

685
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,590
yourself what does it mean to program
and develop and build the system

686
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:29,600
and develop and build the system
 

687
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,150
and develop and build the system
it's a very computer sciencey view of

688
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:32,160
it's a very computer sciencey view of
 

689
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:32,949
it's a very computer sciencey view of
the problem

690
00:10:32,949 --> 00:10:32,959
the problem
 

691
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:35,509
the problem
i mean when if you get on data science

692
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:35,519
i mean when if you get on data science
 

693
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:36,949
i mean when if you get on data science

you actually hear this a lot with the

696
00:10:40,069 --> 00:10:40,079
you actually hear this a lot with the
 

697
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:42,389
you actually hear this a lot with the
uh you know the economist and the data

00:10:42,389 --> 00:10:42,399
uh you know the economist and the data
 

699
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:43,910
uh you know the economist and the data
scientist complaining about the machine

700
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:43,920

learning people well
 

703
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,310
learning people well
you know it's just statistics and i

704
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:46,320
you know it's just statistics and i
 

705
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,590
you know it's just statistics and i
don't know why they don't don't see this

706
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:47,600
don't know why they don't don't see this
 

707
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,870
don't know why they don't don't see this
but they're not even asking the same

708
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:48,880
but they're not even asking the same
 

709
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,829
but they're not even asking the same
questions they're not

710
00:10:49,829 --> 00:10:49,839
questions they're not
 

711
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:51,350
questions they're not
thinking about it as a kind of

712
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:51,360
thinking about it as a kind of
 

713
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,030
thinking about it as a kind of
programming problem

714
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:53,040
programming problem
 

715
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,470
programming problem
and i think that that really matters

716
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:54,480
and i think that that really matters
 

717
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,150
and i think that that really matters
just asking this question i actually

718
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:56,160
just asking this question i actually
 

719
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,389
just asking this question i actually
think it's a little different from

720
00:10:58,389 --> 00:10:58,399
think it's a little different from
 

721
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,550
think it's a little different from
programming and hyper parameter space

722
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:00,560
programming and hyper parameter space
 

723
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,990
programming and hyper parameter space
and sort of collecting

724
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:02,000
and sort of collecting
 

725
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,790
and sort of collecting
the data but i do think that that

726
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:04,800
the data but i do think that that
 

727
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,389
the data but i do think that that
immersion really matters so i'll give

728
00:11:06,389 --> 00:11:06,399
immersion really matters so i'll give
 

729
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:07,110
immersion really matters so i'll give
you a quick

730

you a quick
 

731
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,389
you a quick
a quick example the way i think about

732
00:11:08,389 --> 00:11:08,399
a quick example the way i think about
 

733
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,069
a quick example the way i think about
this so i teach machine learning michael

what does it mean to be interesting well
 

795
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,470
what does it mean to be interesting well
data says interesting if it reveals

and you have to analyze them you have to

810
00:12:12,069 --> 00:12:12,079
and you have to analyze them you have to
 

811
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:13,350
and you have to analyze them you have to
justify their interestingness and you

812
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:13,360
justify their interestingness and you
 

813
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,030
justify their interestingness and you
have to analyze in a whole bunch of ways

814

have to analyze in a whole bunch of ways
 

815
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,870
have to analyze in a whole bunch of ways
but all i care about is the data in your

but all i care about is the data in your
 

817
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,790
but all i care about is the data in your
analysis not the programming and i

00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,990
occasionally end up in these long
discussions with students well

822
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:22,000
discussions with students well
 

823
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,750
discussions with students well
i don't really i copy and paste the

824
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:23,760
i don't really i copy and paste the
 

825
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,190
i don't really i copy and paste the
things that i've said the other 15

826
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:25,200
things that i've said the other 15
 

827
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,949
things that i've said the other 15
000 times it's come up which is they go

828
00:12:26,949 --> 00:12:26,959
000 times it's come up which is they go
 

829
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:28,949
000 times it's come up which is they go
but the only way to learn

830
00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:28,959
but the only way to learn
 

831
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:31,269
but the only way to learn
really understand is to code them up

832
00:12:31,269 --> 00:12:31,279
really understand is to code them up
 

833
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:32,790
really understand is to code them up
which is a very

834
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:32,800
which is a very
 

835
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,790
which is a very
programmer software engineering view of

836
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:34,800
programmer software engineering view of
 

837
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,990
programmer software engineering view of
the world if you don't program it you

838
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:36,000
the world if you don't program it you
 

839
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,190
the world if you don't program it you
don't understand it

840
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:37,200
don't understand it
 

841
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,110
don't understand it
which is by the way i think is wrong in

842
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:39,120
which is by the way i think is wrong in
 

843
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,550
which is by the way i think is wrong in
a very specific way

844
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:40,560
a very specific way
 

845
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,310
a very specific way
but it is a way that you come to

846
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:42,320
but it is a way that you come to
 

847
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,509
but it is a way that you come to
understand because then you have to

848
00:12:43,509 --> 00:12:43,519
understand because then you have to
 

849
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:44,710
understand because then you have to
wrestle with the algorithm

850
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:44,720
wrestle with the algorithm
 

851
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,990
wrestle with the algorithm
but the thing about machine learning is

852
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:46,000
but the thing about machine learning is
 

853
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,750
but the thing about machine learning is
it's not just sorting numbers where in

854
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:47,760
it's not just sorting numbers where in
 

855
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,269
it's not just sorting numbers where in
some sense the data doesn't matter what

856
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:49,279
some sense the data doesn't matter what
 

857
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:49,910
some sense the data doesn't matter what
matters is

858
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:49,920
matters is
 

859
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,110
matters is
well does algorithm work on these

860
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:51,120
well does algorithm work on these
 

861
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,470
well does algorithm work on these
abstract things and one less than the

862
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:52,480
abstract things and one less than the
 

863
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,750
abstract things and one less than the
other in machine learning

864
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:53,760
other in machine learning
 

865
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,509
other in machine learning
the data matters it does it matters more

866
00:12:55,509 --> 00:12:55,519
the data matters it does it matters more
 

867
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,110
the data matters it does it matters more
than almost anything

868
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:57,120
than almost anything
 

869
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,750
than almost anything
and not everything but almost anything

870
00:12:59,750 --> 00:12:59,760
and not everything but almost anything
 

871
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,230
and not everything but almost anything
and so

872
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:00,240
and so
 

873
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,670
and so
as a result you have to live with the

874
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:01,680
as a result you have to live with the
 

875
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,590
as a result you have to live with the
data and don't get distracted by

876
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:03,600
data and don't get distracted by
 

877
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,509
data and don't get distracted by
the algorithm per se and i think that

878
00:13:05,509 --> 00:13:05,519
the algorithm per se and i think that
 

879
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,750
the algorithm per se and i think that
that focus on the data

880
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:07,760
that focus on the data
 

881
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,350
that focus on the data
and what it can tell you and what

882
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:09,360
and what it can tell you and what
 

883
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,670
and what it can tell you and what
question it's actually answering for you

884
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:11,680
question it's actually answering for you
 

885
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,110
question it's actually answering for you
as opposed to the question you thought

886
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:13,120
as opposed to the question you thought
 

887
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,949
as opposed to the question you thought
you were asking is a key and important

888
00:13:14,949 --> 00:13:14,959
you were asking is a key and important
 

889
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:15,430
you were asking is a key and important
thing

890
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:15,440
thing
 

891
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,829
thing
about machine learning and is a way that

892
00:13:17,829 --> 00:13:17,839
about machine learning and is a way that
 

893
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,430
about machine learning and is a way that
computationalists as opposed to

00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,629
statisticians bring a particular
view about how to think about the

ultimately is saying about the data and
 

913
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,190
ultimately is saying about the data and
those are both important but they're

those are both important but they're
 

915
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,470
those are both important but they're
also different

also different

00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,790
also different
i didn't really think of it this way is

00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:40,800
i didn't really think of it this way is
 

919
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,110
i didn't really think of it this way is
to build intuition about

920
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:43,120
to build intuition about
 

921
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,790
to build intuition about
the role of data the different

data sets that are different
 

927
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:49,509
data sets that are different
and they reveal the differences in the

yeah

950
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:08,480
yeah
 

951
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,870
yeah
that uh you can't listen to students

952
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:10,880
that uh you can't listen to students
 

953
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:11,590
that uh you can't listen to students
about

954
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:11,600
about
 

955
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,990
about
whether what you're doing is the right

956
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:14,000
whether what you're doing is the right
 

957
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,990
whether what you're doing is the right
or the wrong thing

958
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:16,000
or the wrong thing
 

959
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,470

1113
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,990
that's productive i think that's really
helpful but it's struggling like if you

1114

1121
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:00,550
sure some people are gonna whatever lift
themselves up by their bootstraps but

1122
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:00,560
themselves up by their bootstraps but
 

1123
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:00,870
themselves up by their bootstraps but
like

1124
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:00,880
like
 

1125
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,389
like
mostly you give up and certainly it

1126
00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:02,399
mostly you give up and certainly it
 

1127
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:04,230
mostly you give up and certainly it
takes the joy out of it and

1128
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:04,240
takes the joy out of it and
 

1129
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,590
takes the joy out of it and
you're not going to spend a lot of time

1130
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:05,600
you're not going to spend a lot of time
 

1131
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,669
you're not going to spend a lot of time
on something that brings you no joy

1132
00:17:07,669 --> 00:17:07,679
on something that brings you no joy
 

1133
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:09,510
on something that brings you no joy
so it's it's it is a bit of a delicate

1134
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:09,520
so it's it's it is a bit of a delicate
 

1135
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,230
so it's it's it is a bit of a delicate
balance right you have to thwart people

1136
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:12,240
balance right you have to thwart people
 

1137
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,029
balance right you have to thwart people
in a way that they still believe that

1138
00:17:15,029 --> 00:17:15,039
in a way that they still believe that
 

1139
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:16,870
in a way that they still believe that
there's a way through

1140
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:16,880
there's a way through
 

1141
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,669
there's a way through
right so that's a that we strongly agree

1142
00:17:19,669 --> 00:17:19,679
right so that's a that we strongly agree
 

1143
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:20,470
right so that's a that we strongly agree
actually so i think

1144
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:20,480
actually so i think
 

1145
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,069
actually so i think
well first off struggling and suffering

1146
00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:22,079
well first off struggling and suffering
 

1147
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,390
well first off struggling and suffering
aren't the same thing right

1148
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:24,400
aren't the same thing right
 

1149
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,470
aren't the same thing right
being poetic oh no no i actually

1150
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:26,480
being poetic oh no no i actually
 

1151
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,990
being poetic oh no no i actually
appreciate the poetry and

1152
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:28,000
appreciate the poetry and
 

1153
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,750
appreciate the poetry and
i one of the reasons i appreciate it is

1154
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:29,760
i one of the reasons i appreciate it is
 

1155
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,830
i one of the reasons i appreciate it is
that they are often the same thing and

1156
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:31,840
that they are often the same thing and
 

1157
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,110
that they are often the same thing and
often quite different right so

1158
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:33,120
often quite different right so
 

1159
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,470
often quite different right so
you can struggle without suffering you

1160
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:34,480
you can struggle without suffering you
 

1161
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,310
you can struggle without suffering you
can certainly suffer and suffer

1162
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:36,320
can certainly suffer and suffer
 

1163
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,350
can certainly suffer and suffer
suffer pretty easily you don't

1164
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:37,360
suffer pretty easily you don't
 

1165
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,710
suffer pretty easily you don't
necessarily have to struggle to suffer

1166
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:38,720
necessarily have to struggle to suffer
 

1167
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,750
necessarily have to struggle to suffer
so i think that

1168
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:39,760
so i think that
 

1169
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,070
so i think that
you want people to struggle but that

1170
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:42,080
you want people to struggle but that
 

1171
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:42,870
you want people to struggle but that
hope matters

1172
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:42,880
hope matters
 

1173
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,630
hope matters
you have to they have to understand that

1174
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:44,640
you have to they have to understand that
 

1175
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,590
you have to they have to understand that
they're going to get through it on the

1176
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:45,600
they're going to get through it on the
 

1177
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,390
they're going to get through it on the
other side

1178
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:46,400
other side
 

1179
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,909
other side
and it's very easy to confuse the two

1180
00:17:49,909 --> 00:17:49,919
and it's very easy to confuse the two
 

1181
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:51,669
and it's very easy to confuse the two
i actually think brown university has a

1182
00:17:51,669 --> 00:17:51,679
i actually think brown university has a
 

1183
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:53,350
i actually think brown university has a
very just

1184
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:53,360
very just
 

1185
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,789
very just
philosophically has a very different

1186
00:17:54,789 --> 00:17:54,799
philosophically has a very different
 

1187
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:56,390
philosophically has a very different
take on the relationship with their

1188
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:56,400
take on the relationship with their
 

1189
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,590
take on the relationship with their
students particularly undergrads from

1190
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:57,600
students particularly undergrads from
 

1191
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,070
students particularly undergrads from
say

1192
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:58,080
say
 

1193
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,990
say
a place like georgia tech which is which

1194
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:00,000
a place like georgia tech which is which
 

1195
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,270
a place like georgia tech which is which
universities better

1196
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:01,280
universities better
 

1197
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,350
universities better
uh well i have my opinions on that i

1198
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:03,360
uh well i have my opinions on that i
 

1199
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,110
uh well i have my opinions on that i
mean remember charles said

1200
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:05,120
mean remember charles said
 

1201
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,549
mean remember charles said
it doesn't matter what the facts are i'm

1202
00:18:06,549 --> 00:18:06,559
it doesn't matter what the facts are i'm
 

1203
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,470
it doesn't matter what the facts are i'm
always right the correct thing

1204
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:08,480
always right the correct thing
 

1205
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,830
always right the correct thing
is that it doesn't matter they're

1206
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:09,840
is that it doesn't matter they're
 

1207
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,830
is that it doesn't matter they're
different um but

1208
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:12,840
different um but
 

1209
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,669
different um but
clearly he went to a school

1210
00:18:15,669 --> 00:18:15,679
clearly he went to a school
 

1211
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,669
clearly he went to a school
like the school where he is as an

1212
00:18:17,669 --> 00:18:17,679
like the school where he is as an
 

1213
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,350
like the school where he is as an
undergrad i went to a school

1214
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:19,360
undergrad i went to a school
 

1215
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,190
undergrad i went to a school
specifically the same school though it

1216
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:21,200
specifically the same school though it
 

1217
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,630
specifically the same school though it
was it changed a bit in the in the

1218
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:22,640
was it changed a bit in the in the
 

1219
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,350
was it changed a bit in the in the
intervening years

1220
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:23,360
intervening years
 

1221
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,470
intervening years
brown or georgia tech no i was talking

1222
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:24,480
brown or georgia tech no i was talking
 

1223
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,549
brown or georgia tech no i was talking
about georgia tech and i went yeah

1224
00:18:26,549 --> 00:18:26,559
about georgia tech and i went yeah
 

1225
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:28,230
about georgia tech and i went yeah
and i went to an undergrad place that's

1226
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:28,240
and i went to an undergrad place that's
 

1227
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,669
and i went to an undergrad place that's
a lot like the place where i work now

1228
00:18:29,669 --> 00:18:29,679
a lot like the place where i work now
 

1229
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:31,270
a lot like the place where i work now
and so it does seem

1230
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:31,280
and so it does seem
 

1231
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,630
and so it does seem
like we're more familiar with these

1232
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:32,640
like we're more familiar with these
 

1233
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,230
like we're more familiar with these
models there's a similarity between

1234
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:34,240
models there's a similarity between
 

1235
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,430
models there's a similarity between
brown and yellow

1236
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:35,440
brown and yellow
 

1237
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,029
brown and yellow
yeah there's a i think that i think

1238
00:18:37,029 --> 00:18:37,039
yeah there's a i think that i think
 

1239
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:39,110
yeah there's a i think that i think
they're quite similar yeah and duke

1240
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:39,120
they're quite similar yeah and duke
 

1241
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,029
they're quite similar yeah and duke
duke has some similarities too but it's

1242
00:18:41,029 --> 00:18:41,039
duke has some similarities too but it's
 

1243
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:42,390
duke has some similarities too but it's
got a little southern

00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:42,400
got a little southern
 

1245
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,150
got a little southern

1951
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,310
um uh my work is crap my work is crap my
work is crap my work is crap then you

1952
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:16,320
work is crap my work is crap then you
 

1953
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,669
work is crap my work is crap then you
like go to a conference or something

1954
00:29:17,669 --> 00:29:17,679
like go to a conference or something
 

1955
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:18,950
like go to a conference or something
like everybody else's work is crap

1956
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:18,960
like everybody else's work is crap

00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:23,669
feel better and better about it yeah
uh relatively speaking and then you sort

1962
00:29:23,669 --> 00:29:23,679
uh relatively speaking and then you sort
 

1963
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:25,029
uh relatively speaking and then you sort
of keep working on it

1964
00:29:25,029 --> 00:29:25,039
of keep working on it
 

1965
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:27,510
of keep working on it
i don't hate my work that resonates with

1966
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:27,520
i don't hate my work that resonates with
 

1967
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,190
i don't hate my work that resonates with
me yes i've never hated my work but i

1968
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:29,200
me yes i've never hated my work but i
 

1969
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,470
me yes i've never hated my work but i
have

1970
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:30,480
have
 

1971
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,510
have
i have been dissatisfied with it

1972
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:33,520
i have been dissatisfied with it
 

1973
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,230
i have been dissatisfied with it
and i think being dissatisfied being

1974
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:36,240
and i think being dissatisfied being
 

1975
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,909
and i think being dissatisfied being
okay with the fact that you've taken a

1976
00:29:37,909 --> 00:29:37,919
okay with the fact that you've taken a
 

1977
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:40,310
okay with the fact that you've taken a
positive step the derivative is positive

1978
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:40,320
positive step the derivative is positive
 

1979
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,510
positive step the derivative is positive
maybe even the second derivative is

1980
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:41,520
maybe even the second derivative is
 

1981
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,590
maybe even the second derivative is
positive that's important because that's

1982
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:43,600
positive that's important because that's
 

1983
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,029
positive that's important because that's
a part of the the hope right

1984
00:29:45,029 --> 00:29:45,039
a part of the the hope right
 

1985
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:46,870
a part of the the hope right
but you have to but i haven't gotten

1986
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:46,880
but you have to but i haven't gotten
 

1987
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,549
but you have to but i haven't gotten
there yet if that's not there that i

1988
00:29:48,549 --> 00:29:48,559
there yet if that's not there that i
 

1989
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:49,830
there yet if that's not there that i
haven't gotten there yet

1990
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:49,840
haven't gotten there yet
 

1991
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,389
haven't gotten there yet
then you know it's hard to it's hard to

1992
00:29:52,389 --> 00:29:52,399
then you know it's hard to it's hard to
 

1993
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:54,310
then you know it's hard to it's hard to
move forward i think so i buy that

1994
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:54,320
move forward i think so i buy that
 

1995
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,510
move forward i think so i buy that
which is a little different from hating

1996
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:55,520
which is a little different from hating
 

1997
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,190
which is a little different from hating
everything that you do yeah i mean

1998
00:29:57,190 --> 00:29:57,200
everything that you do yeah i mean
 

1999
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,070
everything that you do yeah i mean
there's

2000
00:29:58,070 --> 00:29:58,080
there's
 

2001
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,510
there's
there's things that i've done that i

2002
00:29:59,510 --> 00:29:59,520
there's things that i've done that i
 

2003
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,190
there's things that i've done that i
like better than i like myself

2004
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:01,200
like better than i like myself
 

2005
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,269
like better than i like myself
so it's separating me from the work

2006
00:30:03,269 --> 00:30:03,279
so it's separating me from the work
 

2007
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:05,190
so it's separating me from the work
essentially so i think i am very

2008
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:05,200
essentially so i think i am very
 

2009
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,710
essentially so i think i am very
critical of myself

2010
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:06,720
critical of myself
 

2011
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,990
critical of myself
but sometimes the work i'm really

2012
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:08,000
but sometimes the work i'm really
 

2013
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,070
but sometimes the work i'm really
excited about and sometimes i think it

2014
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:10,080
excited about and sometimes i think it
 

2015
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,990
excited about and sometimes i think it
doesn't happen right away so i found the

2016
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:12,000
doesn't happen right away so i found the
 

2017
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,110
doesn't happen right away so i found the
work that i've

2018
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:13,120
work that i've
 

2019
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:16,389
work that i've
liked that i've done most of it

2020
00:30:16,389 --> 00:30:16,399
liked that i've done most of it
 

2021
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:19,110
liked that i've done most of it
i liked it in retrospect more when i was

2022
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:19,120
i liked it in retrospect more when i was
 

2023
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,110
i liked it in retrospect more when i was
far away from it in time

2024
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:21,120
far away from it in time
 

2025
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,110
far away from it in time
i have to be fairly excited about it to

2026
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:23,120
i have to be fairly excited about it to
 

2027
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,230
i have to be fairly excited about it to
get done

2028
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:24,240
get done
 

2029
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,909
get done
no excited at the time but then happy

2030
00:30:25,909 --> 00:30:25,919
no excited at the time but then happy
 

2031
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:27,909
no excited at the time but then happy
with the result or but years later or

2032
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:27,919
with the result or but years later or
 

2033
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:29,510
with the result or but years later or
even i might go back you know what

2034
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:29,520
even i might go back you know what
 

2035
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,110
even i might go back you know what
that actually turned out to be yeah that

2036
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:31,120
that actually turned out to be yeah that
 

2037
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,789

2039
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:34,149
turned out to matter or oh gosh it turns
out i've been thinking about that

2040
00:30:34,149 --> 00:30:34,159
out i've been thinking about that
 

2041
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:35,269
out i've been thinking about that
it's actually influenced all the work

2042
00:30:35,269 --> 00:30:35,279
it's actually influenced all the work
 

2043
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:37,190
it's actually influenced all the work
that i've done since without realizing

2044
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:37,200
that i've done since without realizing
 

2045
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:37,750

oh wow there's so many brilliant lines

2094
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:20,960
oh wow there's so many brilliant lines
 

2095
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,070
oh wow there's so many brilliant lines
in this

2096
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:22,080
in this
 

2097
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,470
in this
there's levels uh so how did you

2098
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:24,480
there's levels uh so how did you
 

2099
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,830
there's levels uh so how did you
actually meet me

2100
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:25,840
actually meet me
 

2101
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:28,389
actually meet me
yeah so my the way i think about it is

2102
00:31:28,389 --> 00:31:28,399
yeah so my the way i think about it is
 

2103
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:29,590
yeah so my the way i think about it is
because we didn't do much

2104
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:29,600
because we didn't do much
 

2105
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:33,190
because we didn't do much
research together at 18t but um but then

2106
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:33,200
research together at 18t but um but then
 

2107
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,470
research together at 18t but um but then
we all got laid off

2108
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:34,480
we all got laid off
 

2109
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:37,269
we all got laid off
so so that was that by the way i decided

2110
00:31:37,269 --> 00:31:37,279
so so that was that by the way i decided
 

2111
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:38,630
so so that was that by the way i decided
to interrupt but that was like

2112
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:38,640
to interrupt but that was like
 

2113
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,389
to interrupt but that was like
one of the most magical places

2114
00:31:40,389 --> 00:31:40,399
one of the most magical places
 

2115
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:42,230
one of the most magical places
historically speaking

2116
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:42,240
historically speaking
 

2117
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:45,590
historically speaking
they did not appreciate what they had

2118
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:45,600
they did not appreciate what they had
 

2119
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,389
they did not appreciate what they had
and how do we uh i feel like there's a

2120
00:31:48,389 --> 00:31:48,399
and how do we uh i feel like there's a
 

2121
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:50,070
and how do we uh i feel like there's a
profound lesson in there too uh

2122
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:50,080
profound lesson in there too uh
 

2123
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,310
profound lesson in there too uh
how do we get it like what was why was

2124
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:52,320
how do we get it like what was why was
 

2125
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,070
how do we get it like what was why was
it so magical is just the coincidence of

2126
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:54,080
it so magical is just the coincidence of
 

2127
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:54,789
it so magical is just the coincidence of
history

2128
00:31:54,789 --> 00:31:54,799

machine learning as this is going to be
 

2137
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:02,630
machine learning as this is going to be
important

2138

um let's get the the people who are
thinking about this in creative and

2142
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:06,559
thinking about this in creative and
 

2143
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:08,870

00:33:49,669 --> 00:33:49,679
probably competitive i love hanging out
 

2263
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:50,950
probably competitive i love hanging out
with michael anyway but we were talking

2264
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:50,960
with michael anyway but we were talking
 

2265
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:51,990
with michael anyway but we were talking
about something else although i no

2266
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:52,000
about something else although i no
 

2267
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,110
about something else although i no
longer remember what it was what were we

2268
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:53,120
longer remember what it was what were we
 

2269
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,029
longer remember what it was what were we
talking about

2270
00:33:55,029 --> 00:33:55,039
talking about
 

2271
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:57,990
talking about
but also labs so so uh this was kind of

2272
00:33:57,990 --> 00:33:58,000
but also labs so so uh this was kind of
 

2273
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,070
but also labs so so uh this was kind of
cool about what was magical about it

2274
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:00,080
cool about what was magical about it
 

2275
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,590
cool about what was magical about it
the first thing you have to know is that

2276
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:01,600
the first thing you have to know is that
 

2277
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,190
the first thing you have to know is that
bell labs was an arm of the government

2278
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:03,200
bell labs was an arm of the government
 

2279
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,710
bell labs was an arm of the government
right because att was an army of

2280
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:04,720
right because att was an army of
 

2281
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:05,190
right because att was an army of

government
it was a monopoly uh and you know every

00:34:08,069 --> 00:34:08,079
it was a monopoly uh and you know every
 

2285
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:09,430
it was a monopoly uh and you know every
month you paid a little

2286
00:34:09,430 --> 00:34:09,440
month you paid a little
 

2287
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,190
month you paid a little
thing on your phone bill which turned

2288
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:11,200
thing on your phone bill which turned
 

2289
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:12,950
thing on your phone bill which turned
out was a tax for like all the research

2290
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:12,960
out was a tax for like all the research
 

2291
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,230
out was a tax for like all the research
that bell labs was doing

2292
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:14,240
that bell labs was doing
 

2293
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:15,909
that bell labs was doing
and you know they invented transistors

2294
00:34:15,909 --> 00:34:15,919
and you know they invented transistors
 

2295
00:34:15,919 --> 00:34:17,430
and you know they invented transistors
and the laser and whatever else is that

2296
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:17,440
and the laser and whatever else is that
 

2297
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,270
and the laser and whatever else is that
big bang or whatever the

2298
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:19,280
big bang or whatever the
 

2299
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,710
big bang or whatever the
cosmic background radiation yeah they

2300
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:20,720
cosmic background radiation yeah they
 

2301
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:22,069
cosmic background radiation yeah they
did all that stuff they had some amazing

2302
00:34:22,069 --> 00:34:22,079
did all that stuff they had some amazing
 

2303
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:23,430
did all that stuff they had some amazing
stuff with directional microphones by

2304
00:34:23,430 --> 00:34:23,440
stuff with directional microphones by
 

2305
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,790
stuff with directional microphones by
the way i got to go in this room

2306
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:24,800
the way i got to go in this room
 

2307
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,190
the way i got to go in this room
um where they they had all these panels

2308
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:27,200
um where they they had all these panels
 

2309
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:27,909
um where they they had all these panels
and everything

2310
00:34:27,909 --> 00:34:27,919
and everything
 

2311
00:34:27,919 --> 00:34:29,589
and everything
and we would talk and one another and he

2312
00:34:29,589 --> 00:34:29,599
and we would talk and one another and he
 

2313
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:31,349
and we would talk and one another and he
moved some panels around and then

2314
00:34:31,349 --> 00:34:31,359
moved some panels around and then
 

2315
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:33,109
moved some panels around and then
he would have me step two steps to the

2316
00:34:33,109 --> 00:34:33,119
he would have me step two steps to the
 

2317
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:34,790
he would have me step two steps to the
left and i couldn't hear a thing he was

2318
00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:34,800
left and i couldn't hear a thing he was
 

2319
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,310
left and i couldn't hear a thing he was
saying because nothing was bouncing off

2320
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:36,320
saying because nothing was bouncing off
 

2321
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,109
saying because nothing was bouncing off
the walls

2322
00:34:37,109 --> 00:34:37,119
the walls
 

2323
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:38,470
the walls
and then he would shut it all down and

2324
00:34:38,470 --> 00:34:38,480
and then he would shut it all down and
 

2325
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,710
and then he would shut it all down and
you could hear your heartbeat yeah

2326
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:40,720
you could hear your heartbeat yeah
 

2327
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:42,790
you could hear your heartbeat yeah
deeply disturbing to hear your heart

2328
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:42,800
deeply disturbing to hear your heart
 

2329
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,550
deeply disturbing to hear your heart
beat you can feel it i mean you can feel

2330
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:44,560
beat you can feel it i mean you can feel
 

2331
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,990
beat you can feel it i mean you can feel
it now there's so much all this sort of

2332
00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:46,000
it now there's so much all this sort of
 

2333
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,430
it now there's so much all this sort of
noise around anyway bill labs is about

2334
00:34:47,430 --> 00:34:47,440
noise around anyway bill labs is about
 

2335
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,230
noise around anyway bill labs is about
pure research

2336
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:48,240
pure research
 

2337
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:50,470
pure research
it was a university in some sense the

2338
00:34:50,470 --> 00:34:50,480
it was a university in some sense the
 

2339
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,990
it was a university in some sense the
purest sense of a university

2340
00:34:51,990 --> 00:34:52,000
purest sense of a university
 

2341
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,389
purest sense of a university
but without students so it was all the

2342
00:34:54,389 --> 00:34:54,399
but without students so it was all the
 

2343
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:56,230
but without students so it was all the
faculty working with one another

2344
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:56,240
faculty working with one another
 

2345
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:57,829
faculty working with one another
and students would come in to learn they

2346
00:34:57,829 --> 00:34:57,839
and students would come in to learn they
 

2347
00:34:57,839 --> 00:34:58,950
and students would come in to learn they
would come in for three or four months

2348
00:34:58,950 --> 00:34:58,960
would come in for three or four months
 

2349
00:34:58,960 --> 00:34:59,910
would come in for three or four months
you know during the summer and they

2350
00:34:59,910 --> 00:34:59,920
you know during the summer and they
 

2351
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:00,710
you know during the summer and they
would go away

2352
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:00,720
would go away
 

2353
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,230
would go away
but it was just this kind of wonderful

2354
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:02,240
but it was just this kind of wonderful
 

2355
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,550
but it was just this kind of wonderful
experience i could walk out my door

2356
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:04,560
experience i could walk out my door
 

2357
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,829
experience i could walk out my door
in fact i would often have to walk out

2358
00:35:05,829 --> 00:35:05,839
in fact i would often have to walk out
 

2359
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:07,589
in fact i would often have to walk out
my door and deal with rich sutton and

about
the proper way to prove something or

the proper way to prove something or

other people including

it was just a place where you could

2380
00:35:24,069 --> 00:35:24,079
it was just a place where you could
 

2381
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:24,550
it was just a place where you could
think

2382
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:24,560
think
 

2383
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:27,270
think
thoughts and it was okay because so long

2384
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:27,280
thoughts and it was okay because so long
 

2385
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,270
thoughts and it was okay because so long
as once every 25 years or so

2386
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:29,280
as once every 25 years or so

as once every 25 years or so
somebody invented a transistor it paid

2388
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:31,040
somebody invented a transistor it paid
 

2389
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,710
somebody invented a transistor it paid
for everything else you could afford to

2390
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:32,720
for everything else you could afford to
 

2391
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,069
for everything else you could afford to
take the risk

2392
00:35:34,069 --> 00:35:34,079
take the risk
 

2393
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:36,550
take the risk
and then when that all went away it

2394
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:36,560
and then when that all went away it
 

2395
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,510
and then when that all went away it
became harder

2396
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:37,520
became harder
 

2397
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,430
became harder
and harder and harder to justify it as

2398
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:39,440
and harder and harder to justify it as
 

2399
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,790
and harder and harder to justify it as
far as the folks who were very far away

2400
00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:40,800
far as the folks who were very far away
 

2401
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:41,510
far as the folks who were very far away
were concerned

2402
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:41,520
were concerned
 

2403
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,430
were concerned
and there was such a fast turnaround

2404
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:43,440
and there was such a fast turnaround
 

2405
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,950
and there was such a fast turnaround
among middle management

2406
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:44,960
among middle management
 

2407
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,030
among middle management
on the atnt side that you never had a

on the atnt side that you never had a
 

2409
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,230
on the atnt side that you never had a
chance to really build the relationship

2410
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:48,240
chance to really build the relationship

00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:37,200
useful
 

2731
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,589
useful
and uh the useful thing was we were

2732
00:40:39,589 --> 00:40:39,599
and uh the useful thing was we were
 

2733
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:40,550
and uh the useful thing was we were
going to make a

2734
00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:40,560
going to make a
 

2735
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,230
going to make a
basically an automated assistant that

2736
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:42,240
basically an automated assistant that
 

2737
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,910
basically an automated assistant that
could help you with your calendar you

2738
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:43,920
could help you with your calendar you
 

2739
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:44,710
could help you with your calendar you
could like

2740
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:44,720
could like
 

2741
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,630
could like
tell it things and it would it would

2742
00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:46,640
tell it things and it would it would
 

2743
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,150
tell it things and it would it would
respond appropriately it would just kind

2744
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:48,160
respond appropriately it would just kind
 

2745
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,589
respond appropriately it would just kind
of integrate across

2746
00:40:49,589 --> 00:40:49,599
of integrate across
 

2747
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:53,430
of integrate across
all sorts of your personal information

2748
00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:53,440
all sorts of your personal information
 

2749
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:56,550
all sorts of your personal information
and so me and charles and peter stone

2750
00:40:56,550 --> 00:40:56,560
and so me and charles and peter stone
 

2751
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,710
and so me and charles and peter stone
were this were set up as the crack team

2752
00:40:58,710 --> 00:40:58,720
were this were set up as the crack team
 

2753
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,630
were this were set up as the crack team
to actually solve this problem

2754
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:00,640
to actually solve this problem
 

2755
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:01,910
to actually solve this problem
uh other people maybe were too

2756
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:01,920
uh other people maybe were too
 

2757
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,670
uh other people maybe were too
theoretical that they thought and

2758
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:03,680
theoretical that they thought and
 

2759
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,270
theoretical that they thought and
and but we could actually get something

2760
00:41:05,270 --> 00:41:05,280
and but we could actually get something
 

2761
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,870
and but we could actually get something
done so we sat down to get something

2762
00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:06,880
done so we sat down to get something
 

2763
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,150
done so we sat down to get something
done and there wasn't time

2764
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:08,160
done and there wasn't time
 

2765
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,069
done and there wasn't time
and it wouldn't have saved us anyway and

2766
00:41:10,069 --> 00:41:10,079
and it wouldn't have saved us anyway and
 

2767
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:11,910
and it wouldn't have saved us anyway and
so it all kind of went downhill

2768
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:11,920
so it all kind of went downhill
 

2769
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:15,270
so it all kind of went downhill
but the interesting i think coda to that

2770
00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:15,280
but the interesting i think coda to that
 

2771
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,510
but the interesting i think coda to that
is that our boss's boss is a guy named

2772
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:17,520
is that our boss's boss is a guy named
 

2773
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:18,790
is that our boss's boss is a guy named
ron brockman

2774
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:18,800
ron brockman
 

2775
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,990
ron brockman
and he when he left at t

2776
00:41:21,990 --> 00:41:22,000
and he when he left at t
 

2777
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,230
and he when he left at t
because we were all laid off he went to

2778
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:24,240
because we were all laid off he went to
 

2779

charles landed at georgia tech which was

2840
00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:17,440
charles landed at georgia tech which was
 

2841
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:20,150
charles landed at georgia tech which was
uh what he always dreamed he would do

2842

prepared but charles like
like he'd wish something and then it

2856
00:42:33,109 --> 00:42:33,119
like he'd wish something and then it
 

2857
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:35,030
like he'd wish something and then it
would basically happen just the way he

2858
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:35,040
would basically happen just the way he
 

2859
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:35,910
would basically happen just the way he
wanted it was

2860
00:42:35,910 --> 00:42:35,920
wanted it was
 

2861
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,829
wanted it was
it was inspirational to see things go

2862
00:42:37,829 --> 00:42:37,839

so that he could text me more
efficiently i thought that was an

3128
00:46:40,950 --> 00:46:40,960
efficiently i thought that was an
 

3129
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:42,390
efficiently i thought that was an
interesting moment it works for me

3130

great and there's a couple of reasons
 

3139
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:49,430
great and there's a couple of reasons
for that by the way one is

3140
00:46:49,430 --> 00:46:49,440
for that by the way one is

00:47:18,550 --> 00:47:18,560
i guess but it's at the time it really
 

3177
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:19,990
i guess but it's at the time it really

00:47:27,750 --> 00:47:27,760
the course and i could just hang out
 

3187
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:29,270
the course and i could just hang out
yeah just kind of coast on that

3188
00:47:29,270 --> 00:47:29,280
yeah just kind of coast on that

well that's what the second class was

3190
00:47:30,630 --> 00:47:30,640
well that's what the second class was
 

3191
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:32,150
well that's what the second class was
more like that because the second time

3192
00:47:32,150 --> 00:47:32,160
more like that because the second time
 

3193
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:33,349
more like that because the second time
that was explicit because

3194
00:47:33,349 --> 00:47:33,359
that was explicit because
 

3195
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:36,710
that was explicit because
the first class it was at least half so

3196
00:47:36,710 --> 00:47:36,720
the first class it was at least half so
 

3197
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:46,309
the first class it was at least half so
the structure

3198
00:47:46,309 --> 00:47:46,319

 

3199
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:48,549

so that was that was kind of true yeah

3200
00:47:48,549 --> 00:47:48,559
so that was that was kind of true yeah
 

3201
00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:50,309
so that was that was kind of true yeah
that was sort of true for 7642 which is

3202
00:47:50,309 --> 00:47:50,319
that was sort of true for 7642 which is
 

3203
00:47:50,319 --> 00:47:51,430
that was sort of true for 7642 which is
the reinforcement learning class because

3204
00:47:51,430 --> 00:47:51,440
the reinforcement learning class because
 

3205
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:52,950
the reinforcement learning class because
that was really his class you started

3206
00:47:52,950 --> 00:47:52,960
that was really his class you started
 

3207
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:53,750
that was really his class you started

and the second class was based on
 

3241
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:17,430

teaching that class with him but he
 

3247
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:22,309
teaching that class with him but he
drove most of that but the first one i

3248
00:48:22,309 --> 00:48:22,319
drove most of that but the first one i
 

3249
00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:23,750
drove most of that but the first one i
drove most it was all my material

3250
00:48:23,750 --> 00:48:23,760
drove most it was all my material
 

3251
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,510
drove most it was all my material
although i had stolen that material

and he did actually a lot more with
 

3279
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:49,190

you know clustering and whatnot but we
 

3299
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,190
you know clustering and whatnot but we
took it all the way to a lot of it

3300

just comes from tom mitchell's book oh

3302
00:49:04,870 --> 00:49:04,880
just comes from tom mitchell's book oh
 

3303
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:06,549
just comes from tom mitchell's book oh
no yeah except well half of it comes

3304
00:49:06,549 --> 00:49:06,559
no yeah except well half of it comes
 

3305
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:07,990
no yeah except well half of it comes
from tom mitchell's book right i mean

3306
00:49:07,990 --> 00:49:08,000
from tom mitchell's book right i mean
 

3307
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,829
from tom mitchell's book right i mean
the other half doesn't

3308
00:49:09,829 --> 00:49:09,839
the other half doesn't
 

3309
00:49:09,839 --> 00:49:11,109
the other half doesn't
this is what this is why it's all

3310
00:49:11,109 --> 00:49:11,119
this is what this is why it's all
 

3311
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:12,870
this is what this is why it's all
readings right because certain things

readings right because certain things
 

3313
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:13,990

weren't invented when tom wrote

okay that's true right uh but it was it

3316
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:16,880
okay that's true right uh but it was it
 

3317
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:18,390
okay that's true right uh but it was it
was quite good but there's a reason for

was quite good but there's a reason for

you know just i wanted to do it i wanted
 

3323
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:22,309
you know just i wanted to do it i wanted
to do something new and i wanted to do

00:49:22,309 --> 00:49:22,319
to do something new and i wanted to do
 

3325
00:49:22,319 --> 00:49:23,270
to do something new and i wanted to do
something with him

3326
00:49:23,270 --> 00:49:23,280
something with him
 

3327
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:25,510
something with him
which is a realization which is despite

or i'm on the edge of it
 

3335
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:32,710
or i'm on the edge of it
or being an introvert anyway but both of

00:49:32,710 --> 00:49:32,720
or being an introvert anyway but both of
 

3337
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,230
or being an introvert anyway but both of
us i think

3338
00:49:34,230 --> 00:49:34,240
us i think
 

3339
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:37,109
us i think
um enjoy the energy of the crowd right

3340
00:49:37,109 --> 00:49:37,119
um enjoy the energy of the crowd right
 

3341
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:38,549
um enjoy the energy of the crowd right
there's something about

3342
00:49:38,549 --> 00:49:38,559
there's something about
 

3343
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:40,630
there's something about
talking to people and bringing them into

3344
00:49:40,630 --> 00:49:40,640
talking to people and bringing them into
 

3345
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:42,870
talking to people and bringing them into
whatever we find interesting that is

whatever we find interesting that is
 

3347
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:45,349
whatever we find interesting that is
empowering energy energizing or whatever

3348

empowering energy energizing or whatever
 

3349
00:49:45,359 --> 00:49:47,109
empowering energy energizing or whatever
and i found the idea

3350
00:49:47,109 --> 00:49:47,119
and i found the idea
 

3351
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:50,390
and i found the idea
of staring alone uh at a computer screen

3352
00:49:50,390 --> 00:49:50,400
of staring alone uh at a computer screen
 

3353
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:52,710
of staring alone uh at a computer screen
and then talking off of materials

3354
00:49:52,710 --> 00:49:52,720
and then talking off of materials
 

3355
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:55,190
and then talking off of materials
less inspiring than i wanted it to be

3356
00:49:55,190 --> 00:49:55,200
less inspiring than i wanted it to be
 

3357
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,950
less inspiring than i wanted it to be
and i had in fact done a mooc for

3358
00:49:56,950 --> 00:49:56,960
and i had in fact done a mooc for
 

3359
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:58,230
and i had in fact done a mooc for
udacity on

3360
00:49:58,230 --> 00:49:58,240
udacity on
 

3361
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:01,910
udacity on
algorithms and it was a week

3362
00:50:01,910 --> 00:50:01,920
algorithms and it was a week
 

3363
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:05,349
algorithms and it was a week
in a dark room talking at the screen

3364
00:50:05,349 --> 00:50:05,359
in a dark room talking at the screen
 

3365
00:50:05,359 --> 00:50:08,309
in a dark room talking at the screen
writing on the little pad and i didn't

3366
00:50:08,309 --> 00:50:08,319
writing on the little pad and i didn't
 

3367
00:50:08,319 --> 00:50:09,589
writing on the little pad and i didn't

by hannibal lecter that's true
they were so like what do you think is

3628
00:53:48,790 --> 00:53:48,800
they were so like what do you think is
 

3629

they were so like what do you think is
going to happen it's a bad thing

3630
00:53:50,390 --> 00:53:50,400
going to happen it's a bad thing

characters are being introduced and we

3634
00:53:53,109 --> 00:53:53,119
characters are being introduced and we
 

3635
00:53:53,119 --> 00:53:54,230

don't yet know anything
 

3637
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:57,190
don't yet know anything
but still i was just struck by how it's

3638
00:53:57,190 --> 00:53:57,200
but still i was just struck by how it's
 

3639
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:58,549
but still i was just struck by how it's
all driven by narrative and story and

3640
00:53:58,549 --> 00:53:58,559
all driven by narrative and story and
 

3641
00:53:58,559 --> 00:54:00,150
all driven by narrative and story and
there's all these implied things like

3642
00:54:00,150 --> 00:54:00,160
there's all these implied things like
 

3643
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:01,910
there's all these implied things like

00:54:08,710 --> 00:54:08,720
which is both i mean artistically it's
 

3651
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:10,150
which is both i mean artistically it's
probably useful to film it that way but

3652
00:54:10,150 --> 00:54:10,160
probably useful to film it that way but
 

3653
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:11,190
probably useful to film it that way but
think about how it would work in real

3654
00:54:11,190 --> 00:54:11,200
think about how it would work in real
 

3655
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:12,549
think about how it would work in real
life that just seems very crazy but

3656
00:54:12,549 --> 00:54:12,559
life that just seems very crazy but
 

3657
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:13,030
life that just seems very crazy but
there was

00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:14,470
there was
we saw in the second episode there's a

3660
00:54:14,470 --> 00:54:14,480
we saw in the second episode there's a
 

3661
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:15,829
we saw in the second episode there's a
screen you could see things they were

in the world it was quite interesting to
 

3667
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:20,309

so far i mean i assume it veers often to
 

3671
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:23,510
so far i mean i assume it veers often to
never neverland at some point

3672
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:23,520
never neverland at some point
 

3673

00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:39,190
was like this actually
is he like studies

3684
00:54:39,190 --> 00:54:39,200
is he like studies
 

3685
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:41,190
is he like studies
what would it take to program in ai

3686
00:54:41,190 --> 00:54:41,200
what would it take to program in ai
 

3687
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:43,109
what would it take to program in ai
systems like he's he's curious enough to

3688
00:54:43,109 --> 00:54:43,119
systems like he's he's curious enough to
 

3689
00:54:43,119 --> 00:54:44,950
systems like he's he's curious enough to
go into that direction

3690
00:54:44,950 --> 00:54:44,960
go into that direction
 

3691
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:47,829
go into that direction
on the west wall side i felt there was

3692
00:54:47,829 --> 00:54:47,839
on the west wall side i felt there was
 

3693
00:54:47,839 --> 00:54:49,430
on the west wall side i felt there was
more emphasis on the narratives than

3694
00:54:49,430 --> 00:54:49,440
more emphasis on the narratives than
 

3695
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:50,150
more emphasis on the narratives than
like actually

3696
00:54:50,150 --> 00:54:50,160
like actually
 

3697
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:52,230
like actually
asking like computer science questions

3698
00:54:52,230 --> 00:54:52,240
asking like computer science questions
 

3699
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:53,829
asking like computer science questions
yeah like how would you

3700
00:54:53,829 --> 00:54:53,839
yeah like how would you
 

3701
00:54:53,839 --> 00:54:56,950
yeah like how would you
build this how would you uh and how

3702
00:54:56,950 --> 00:54:56,960
build this how would you uh and how
 

3703
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,470
build this how would you uh and how
would you debug it i still think

3704
00:54:58,470 --> 00:54:58,480
would you debug it i still think
 

3705
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:01,190
would you debug it i still think
to me that's the key issue they were

3706
00:55:01,190 --> 00:55:01,200
to me that's the key issue they were
 

3707
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:02,230
to me that's the key issue they were
terrible debuggers

3708
00:55:02,230 --> 00:55:02,240
terrible debuggers
 

3709
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:04,309
terrible debuggers
yeah and well they said specifically so

3710
00:55:04,309 --> 00:55:04,319
yeah and well they said specifically so
 

3711
00:55:04,319 --> 00:55:05,430
yeah and well they said specifically so
we make a change and we put it out in

3712
00:55:05,430 --> 00:55:05,440
we make a change and we put it out in
 

3713
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:06,549
we make a change and we put it out in
the world and that's bad because

3714
00:55:06,549 --> 00:55:06,559
the world and that's bad because
 

3715
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:07,750
the world and that's bad because
something terrible could happen

3716
00:55:07,750 --> 00:55:07,760
something terrible could happen
 

3717
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:09,190
something terrible could happen
like if you're putting things out in the

3718
00:55:09,190 --> 00:55:09,200
like if you're putting things out in the
 

3719
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:10,390
like if you're putting things out in the
world and you're not sure whether

3720
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:10,400
world and you're not sure whether
 

3721
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:11,510
world and you're not sure whether
something terrible is going to happen

3722
00:55:11,510 --> 00:55:11,520
something terrible is going to happen
 

3723
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:13,190
something terrible is going to happen
you're probably your process is probably

3724
00:55:13,190 --> 00:55:13,200
you're probably your process is probably
 

3725
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:14,309
you're probably your process is probably
i just feel like there should have been

3726
00:55:14,309 --> 00:55:14,319
i just feel like there should have been
 

3727
00:55:14,319 --> 00:55:16,230
i just feel like there should have been
someone whose sole job it was to walk

3728
00:55:16,230 --> 00:55:16,240
someone whose sole job it was to walk
 

3729
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:17,270
someone whose sole job it was to walk
around and poke his head

3730
00:55:17,270 --> 00:55:17,280
around and poke his head
 

3731
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:19,109
around and poke his head
and say what could possibly go wrong

3732
00:55:19,109 --> 00:55:19,119
and say what could possibly go wrong
 

3733
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:20,549
and say what could possibly go wrong
just over and over again

3734
00:55:20,549 --> 00:55:20,559
just over and over again
 

3735
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:22,309
just over and over again
i would have loved if there was an and i

3736
00:55:22,309 --> 00:55:22,319
i would have loved if there was an and i
 

3737
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:23,829
i would have loved if there was an and i
did watch a lot more i'm not giving

3738
00:55:23,829 --> 00:55:23,839
did watch a lot more i'm not giving
 

3739
00:55:23,839 --> 00:55:24,710
did watch a lot more i'm not giving
anything away

3740
00:55:24,710 --> 00:55:24,720
anything away
 

3741
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:26,309
anything away
i would have loved it if there was like

3742
00:55:26,309 --> 00:55:26,319
i would have loved it if there was like
 

3743
00:55:26,319 --> 00:55:27,910
i would have loved it if there was like
an episode where like

3744
00:55:27,910 --> 00:55:27,920
an episode where like
 

3745
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:29,990
an episode where like
like the new intern is like debugging a

3746
00:55:29,990 --> 00:55:30,000
like the new intern is like debugging a
 

3747
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,750
like the new intern is like debugging a
new model or something and like it just

3748
00:55:31,750 --> 00:55:31,760
new model or something and like it just
 

3749
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:33,270
new model or something and like it just
keeps failing and

3750
00:55:33,270 --> 00:55:33,280
keeps failing and
 

3751
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:35,030
keeps failing and
they're like all right and then it's

3752
00:55:35,030 --> 00:55:35,040
they're like all right and then it's
 

3753
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:36,309
they're like all right and then it's
more turns into like a

3754
00:55:36,309 --> 00:55:36,319
more turns into like a
 

3755
00:55:36,319 --> 00:55:37,829
more turns into like a
episode of silicon valley or something

3756
00:55:37,829 --> 00:55:37,839
episode of silicon valley or something
 

3757
00:55:37,839 --> 00:55:39,910
episode of silicon valley or something
like that yes versus like

3758
00:55:39,910 --> 00:55:39,920
like that yes versus like
 

3759
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:42,150
like that yes versus like
all this ominous ai systems that are

3760
00:55:42,150 --> 00:55:42,160
all this ominous ai systems that are
 

3761
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:43,109
all this ominous ai systems that are
constantly like

3762
00:55:43,109 --> 00:55:43,119
constantly like
 

3763
00:55:43,119 --> 00:55:46,230
constantly like
threatening the the fabric of this world

3764
00:55:46,230 --> 00:55:46,240
threatening the the fabric of this world
 

3765
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:47,190
threatening the the fabric of this world
that's been created

3766
00:55:47,190 --> 00:55:47,200
that's been created
 

3767
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:48,950
that's been created
yeah yeah and you know the other the

3768
00:55:48,950 --> 00:55:48,960
yeah yeah and you know the other the
 

3769
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:50,950
yeah yeah and you know the other the
this this reminds me of something that

3770
00:55:50,950 --> 00:55:50,960
this this reminds me of something that
 

3771
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:52,069
this this reminds me of something that
so i agree with that that actually be

3772
00:55:52,069 --> 00:55:52,079
so i agree with that that actually be
 

3773
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:53,829
so i agree with that that actually be
very cool at least well for the small

3774
00:55:53,829 --> 00:55:53,839
very cool at least well for the small
 

3775
00:55:53,839 --> 00:55:55,270
very cool at least well for the small
percentage of people who care about

3776
00:55:55,270 --> 00:55:55,280
percentage of people who care about
 

3777
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:56,150
percentage of people who care about
debugging

3778
00:55:56,150 --> 00:55:56,160
debugging
 

3779
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:58,390
debugging
systems but the other thing is debugging

3780
00:55:58,390 --> 00:55:58,400
systems but the other thing is debugging
 

3781
00:55:58,400 --> 00:55:59,510
systems but the other thing is debugging
the series

3782
00:55:59,510 --> 00:55:59,520
the series
 

3783
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:01,510
the series
it falls into think of the sequels fear

3784
00:56:01,510 --> 00:56:01,520
it falls into think of the sequels fear
 

3785
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:02,870
it falls into think of the sequels fear
of the debate oh my gosh

3786
00:56:02,870 --> 00:56:02,880
of the debate oh my gosh
 

3787
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:05,910
of the debate oh my gosh
and anyway so a nightmare show it's a

3788
00:56:05,910 --> 00:56:05,920
and anyway so a nightmare show it's a
 

3789
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:07,349
and anyway so a nightmare show it's a
it's a horror movie

3790
00:56:07,349 --> 00:56:07,359
it's a horror movie
 

3791
00:56:07,359 --> 00:56:08,549
it's a horror movie
i think that's where we lose people by

3792
00:56:08,549 --> 00:56:08,559
i think that's where we lose people by
 

3793
00:56:08,559 --> 00:56:09,910
i think that's where we lose people by
the way early on is the people who

3794
00:56:09,910 --> 00:56:09,920
the way early on is the people who
 

3795
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:11,109
the way early on is the people who
either decide either figure out

3796
00:56:11,109 --> 00:56:11,119
either decide either figure out
 

3797
00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:12,870
either decide either figure out
debugging or think debugging is terrible

3798
00:56:12,870 --> 00:56:12,880
debugging or think debugging is terrible
 

3799
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:14,309
debugging or think debugging is terrible
this is where we lose people in computer

3800
00:56:14,309 --> 00:56:14,319
this is where we lose people in computer
 

3801
00:56:14,319 --> 00:56:15,589
this is where we lose people in computer
science this is part of the struggle

3802
00:56:15,589 --> 00:56:15,599
science this is part of the struggle
 

3803
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:15,990
science this is part of the struggle
versus

3804
00:56:15,990 --> 00:56:16,000
versus
 

3805
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,069
versus
suffering right you you get through it

3806
00:56:18,069 --> 00:56:18,079
suffering right you you get through it
 

3807
00:56:18,079 --> 00:56:19,670
suffering right you you get through it
and you kind of get the skills of it or

3808
00:56:19,670 --> 00:56:19,680
and you kind of get the skills of it or
 

3809
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:20,950
and you kind of get the skills of it or
you're just like this is dumb and this

3810
00:56:20,950 --> 00:56:20,960
you're just like this is dumb and this
 

3811
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:22,230
you're just like this is dumb and this
is a dumb way to do anything and

3812
00:56:22,230 --> 00:56:22,240
is a dumb way to do anything and
 

3813
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:23,829
is a dumb way to do anything and
i think that's when we lose people but

3814
00:56:23,829 --> 00:56:23,839
i think that's when we lose people but
 

3815
00:56:23,839 --> 00:56:25,829
i think that's when we lose people but
um i

3816
00:56:25,829 --> 00:56:25,839
um i
 

3817
00:56:25,839 --> 00:56:27,030
um i
well i'll leave it at that but i think

3818
00:56:27,030 --> 00:56:27,040
well i'll leave it at that but i think
 

3819
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:29,990
well i'll leave it at that but i think
that i think that that there's something

3820
00:56:29,990 --> 00:56:30,000
that i think that that there's something
 

3821
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,829
that i think that that there's something
really really neat about framing it that

3822
00:56:33,829 --> 00:56:33,839
really really neat about framing it that
 

3823
00:56:33,839 --> 00:56:34,710
really really neat about framing it that
way but what i

3824
00:56:34,710 --> 00:56:34,720
way but what i
 

3825
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:36,950
way but what i
don't like about all of these pro all of

don't like about all of these pro all of
 

3827
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:38,390
don't like about all of these pro all of
these things and i love text mocking and

00:56:38,390 --> 00:56:38,400
these things and i love text mocking and
 

3829
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:39,430
these things and i love text mocking and
by the way i thought the

3830
00:56:39,430 --> 00:56:39,440
by the way i thought the
 

3831
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:42,870
by the way i thought the
ending was very depressing um but again

3832
00:56:42,870 --> 00:56:42,880
ending was very depressing um but again
 

3833

the actual experience
 

3873
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:30,230
the actual experience
and just like take it in i don't know he

3874
00:57:30,230 --> 00:57:30,240
and just like take it in i don't know he
 

3875
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:31,589
and just like take it in i don't know he
said like nobody noticed

3880
00:57:35,270 --> 00:57:35,280
feeling that i remember the smile but
 

3881
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:36,710
feeling that i remember the smile but
now you now you just put the memory in

3882
00:57:36,710 --> 00:57:36,720
now you now you just put the memory in
 

3883
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:38,630
now you now you just put the memory in
my head so probably not but i do think

3884
00:57:38,630 --> 00:57:38,640
my head so probably not but i do think
 

3885
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:39,190
my head so probably not but i do think
that

3886
00:57:39,190 --> 00:57:39,200
that
 

3887
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:40,950
that
that's interesting although by looking

3888
00:57:40,950 --> 00:57:40,960
that's interesting although by looking
 

3889
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:42,950
that's interesting although by looking
at the camera you are smiling for the

3890
00:57:42,950 --> 00:57:42,960
at the camera you are smiling for the
 

3891
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:44,069
at the camera you are smiling for the
audience right you're breaking the

3892
00:57:44,069 --> 00:57:44,079
audience right you're breaking the
 

3893
00:57:44,079 --> 00:57:44,789
audience right you're breaking the
fourth wall

3894
00:57:44,789 --> 00:57:44,799
fourth wall
 

3895
00:57:44,799 --> 00:57:47,270
fourth wall
it seems i mean well that's a that's a

3896
00:57:47,270 --> 00:57:47,280
it seems i mean well that's a that's a
 

3897
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:48,630
it seems i mean well that's a that's a
limitation in the medium but i

3898
00:57:48,630 --> 00:57:48,640
limitation in the medium but i
 

3899
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:50,230
limitation in the medium but i
i like that idea but here's the problem

3900
00:57:50,230 --> 00:57:50,240
i like that idea but here's the problem
 

3901
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:51,750
i like that idea but here's the problem
i have with all of those movies all of

3902
00:57:51,750 --> 00:57:51,760
i have with all of those movies all of
 

3903
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:52,230
i have with all of those movies all of
them

3904
00:57:52,230 --> 00:57:52,240
them
 

3905
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:54,630
them
um is that but i know why it's this way

3906
00:57:54,630 --> 00:57:54,640
um is that but i know why it's this way
 

3907
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:55,990
um is that but i know why it's this way
and i enjoy those movies

3908
00:57:55,990 --> 00:57:56,000
and i enjoy those movies
 

3909
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:59,589
and i enjoy those movies
um and westworld is uh it sets up the

3910
00:57:59,589 --> 00:57:59,599
um and westworld is uh it sets up the
 

3911
00:57:59,599 --> 00:58:01,270
um and westworld is uh it sets up the
problem of ai

3912
00:58:01,270 --> 00:58:01,280
problem of ai
 

3913
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:03,670
problem of ai
as succeeding and then having something

3914
00:58:03,670 --> 00:58:03,680
as succeeding and then having something
 

3915
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:05,270
as succeeding and then having something
we cannot control

3916
00:58:05,270 --> 00:58:05,280
we cannot control
 

3917
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:08,309
we cannot control
but it's that's not the bad part of ai

3918
00:58:08,309 --> 00:58:08,319
but it's that's not the bad part of ai
 

3919
00:58:08,319 --> 00:58:10,069
but it's that's not the bad part of ai
the bad part of ai is the stuff we're

3920
00:58:10,069 --> 00:58:10,079
the bad part of ai is the stuff we're
 

3921
00:58:10,079 --> 00:58:11,589
the bad part of ai is the stuff we're
living through now right it's the

3922
00:58:11,589 --> 00:58:11,599
living through now right it's the
 

3923
00:58:11,599 --> 00:58:13,190
living through now right it's the
using the data to make decisions that

3924
00:58:13,190 --> 00:58:13,200
using the data to make decisions that
 

3925
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:14,950
using the data to make decisions that
are terrible it's not the intelligence

3926
00:58:14,950 --> 00:58:14,960
are terrible it's not the intelligence
 

3927
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:16,309
are terrible it's not the intelligence
that's going to go out there and surpass

3928
00:58:16,309 --> 00:58:16,319
that's going to go out there and surpass
 

3929
00:58:16,319 --> 00:58:18,230
that's going to go out there and surpass
us and you know take over the world or

3930
00:58:18,230 --> 00:58:18,240
us and you know take over the world or
 

3931
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:19,990
us and you know take over the world or
you know lock us into a room to starve

3932
00:58:19,990 --> 00:58:20,000
you know lock us into a room to starve
 

3933
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,510
you know lock us into a room to starve
to death slowly

3934
00:58:21,510 --> 00:58:21,520
to death slowly
 

3935
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:24,710
to death slowly
over multiple days it's instead uh the

3936
00:58:24,710 --> 00:58:24,720
over multiple days it's instead uh the
 

3937
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:27,030
over multiple days it's instead uh the
the tools that we're building that are

3938
00:58:27,030 --> 00:58:27,040
the tools that we're building that are
 

3939
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:28,390
the tools that we're building that are
allowing us

3940
00:58:28,390 --> 00:58:28,400
allowing us
 

3941
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:30,549
allowing us
to make the terrible decisions we would

3942
00:58:30,549 --> 00:58:30,559
to make the terrible decisions we would
 

3943
00:58:30,559 --> 00:58:32,069
to make the terrible decisions we would
have less efficiently made before

3944
00:58:32,069 --> 00:58:32,079
have less efficiently made before
 

3945
00:58:32,079 --> 00:58:33,670
have less efficiently made before
right you know computers are very good

3946
00:58:33,670 --> 00:58:33,680
right you know computers are very good
 

3947
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:35,589
right you know computers are very good
at making us more efficient

3948
00:58:35,589 --> 00:58:35,599
at making us more efficient
 

3949
00:58:35,599 --> 00:58:37,109
at making us more efficient
including being more efficient at doing

3950
00:58:37,109 --> 00:58:37,119
including being more efficient at doing
 

3951
00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:38,950
including being more efficient at doing
terrible things and and that's the part

3952
00:58:38,950 --> 00:58:38,960
terrible things and and that's the part
 

3953
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:40,309
terrible things and and that's the part
of the ai we have to worry about it's

3954
00:58:40,309 --> 00:58:40,319
of the ai we have to worry about it's
 

3955
00:58:40,319 --> 00:58:41,510
of the ai we have to worry about it's
not the

3956
00:58:41,510 --> 00:58:41,520
not the
 

3957
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:43,030
not the
you know true intelligence that we're

3958
00:58:43,030 --> 00:58:43,040
you know true intelligence that we're
 

3959
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:45,109
you know true intelligence that we're
going to build sometime in the future

3960
00:58:45,109 --> 00:58:45,119
going to build sometime in the future
 

3961
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:47,030
going to build sometime in the future
probably long after we're around

3962
00:58:47,030 --> 00:58:47,040
probably long after we're around
 

3963
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:50,710
probably long after we're around
um but you know i i i i just

3964
00:58:50,710 --> 00:58:50,720
um but you know i i i i just
 

3965
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:52,309
um but you know i i i i just
i think that whole framing of it sort of

3966
00:58:52,309 --> 00:58:52,319
i think that whole framing of it sort of
 

3967
00:58:52,319 --> 00:58:53,829
i think that whole framing of it sort of
misses

3968
00:58:53,829 --> 00:58:53,839
misses
 

3969
00:58:53,839 --> 00:58:55,910
misses
the point even though it is inspiring

3970
00:58:55,910 --> 00:58:55,920
the point even though it is inspiring
 

3971
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:57,430
the point even though it is inspiring
and i was inspired by those ideas right

3972
00:58:57,430 --> 00:58:57,440
and i was inspired by those ideas right
 

3973
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:59,109
and i was inspired by those ideas right
that i got into this in part because i

3974
00:58:59,109 --> 00:58:59,119
that i got into this in part because i
 

3975
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:00,710
that i got into this in part because i
wanted to build something like that

3976
00:59:00,710 --> 00:59:00,720
wanted to build something like that
 

3977
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:01,910
wanted to build something like that
philosophical questions were interesting

3978
00:59:01,910 --> 00:59:01,920
philosophical questions were interesting
 

3979
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:03,990
philosophical questions were interesting
me but but you know that's not where the

3980
00:59:03,990 --> 00:59:04,000
me but but you know that's not where the

but you know i i feel like cal 9000 came
a little bit closer to that when it's

4002
00:59:22,470 --> 00:59:22,480
a little bit closer to that when it's
 

4003
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:24,950
a little bit closer to that when it's
in 2001 space odyssey because it felt

4004
00:59:24,950 --> 00:59:24,960
in 2001 space odyssey because it felt
 

4005
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:26,230
in 2001 space odyssey because it felt
like

4006
00:59:26,230 --> 00:59:26,240
like
 

4007
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:29,190
like
uh a personal assistant you know it felt

4008
00:59:29,190 --> 00:59:29,200
uh a personal assistant you know it felt
 

4009
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:30,789
uh a personal assistant you know it felt
like closer to the ai systems we have

4010
00:59:30,789 --> 00:59:30,799
like closer to the ai systems we have
 

4011
00:59:30,799 --> 00:59:31,670
like closer to the ai systems we have
today and

4012
00:59:31,670 --> 00:59:31,680
today and
 

4013
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:35,190
today and
and the real things we might actually

4014
00:59:35,190 --> 00:59:35,200
and the real things we might actually
 

4015
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:37,109
and the real things we might actually
encounter which is

4016
00:59:37,109 --> 00:59:37,119
encounter which is
 

4017
00:59:37,119 --> 00:59:41,030
encounter which is
over relying uh on in some fundamental

4018
00:59:41,030 --> 00:59:41,040
over relying uh on in some fundamental
 

4019
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:42,150
over relying uh on in some fundamental
way on our

4020
00:59:42,150 --> 00:59:42,160
way on our
 

4021
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:44,309
way on our
like dumb assistance or on social

4022
00:59:44,309 --> 00:59:44,319
like dumb assistance or on social
 

4023
00:59:44,319 --> 00:59:45,510
like dumb assistance or on social
networks like over

4024
00:59:45,510 --> 00:59:45,520
networks like over
 

4025
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:49,670
networks like over
offloading too much of us onto uh

4026
00:59:49,670 --> 00:59:49,680
offloading too much of us onto uh
 

4027
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:53,109
offloading too much of us onto uh
you know onto things that require

4028
00:59:53,109 --> 00:59:53,119
you know onto things that require
 

4029
00:59:53,119 --> 00:59:55,990
you know onto things that require
internet and power and so on and thereby

4030
00:59:55,990 --> 00:59:56,000
internet and power and so on and thereby
 

4031
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,270
internet and power and so on and thereby
becoming powerless

4032
00:59:57,270 --> 00:59:57,280
becoming powerless
 

4033
00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:00,150
becoming powerless
as a stand-alone entity and then when

4034
01:00:00,150 --> 01:00:00,160
as a stand-alone entity and then when
 

4035
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:02,230
as a stand-alone entity and then when
that thing starts to misbehave

4036
01:00:02,230 --> 01:00:02,240
that thing starts to misbehave
 

4037
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:04,870
that thing starts to misbehave
in some subtle way it creates a lot of

4038
01:00:04,870 --> 01:00:04,880
in some subtle way it creates a lot of
 

4039
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:05,510
in some subtle way it creates a lot of
problems

4040
01:00:05,510 --> 01:00:05,520
problems
 

4041
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:07,510
problems
and those problems are dramatized when

4042
01:00:07,510 --> 01:00:07,520
and those problems are dramatized when
 

4043
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:09,109
and those problems are dramatized when
you're in space because

4044
01:00:09,109 --> 01:00:09,119
you're in space because
 

4045
01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:11,430
you're in space because
you don't have a way to walk away well

4046
01:00:11,430 --> 01:00:11,440
you don't have a way to walk away well
 

4047
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:12,390
you don't have a way to walk away well
as the man said

4048
01:00:12,390 --> 01:00:12,400
as the man said
 

4049
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:14,390
as the man said
um once you once we started making the

4050
01:00:14,390 --> 01:00:14,400
um once you once we started making the
 

4051
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:16,069
um once you once we started making the
decisions for you it stopped being your

4052
01:00:16,069 --> 01:00:16,079
decisions for you it stopped being your
 

4053
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:16,630
decisions for you it stopped being your
world

4054
01:00:16,630 --> 01:00:16,640
world
 

4055
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:18,309
world
right that's the matrix michael in case

4056
01:00:18,309 --> 01:00:18,319
right that's the matrix michael in case
 

4057
01:00:18,319 --> 01:00:19,670
right that's the matrix michael in case
you don't i didn't generally i don't

4058
01:00:19,670 --> 01:00:19,680
you don't i didn't generally i don't
 

4059
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:20,309
you don't i didn't generally i don't
remember

4060
01:00:20,309 --> 01:00:20,319
remember
 

4061
01:00:20,319 --> 01:00:23,109
remember
but on the other hand i could say no

4062
01:00:23,109 --> 01:00:23,119
but on the other hand i could say no
 

4063
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:24,230
but on the other hand i could say no
because isn't that what we do with

4064
01:00:24,230 --> 01:00:24,240
because isn't that what we do with
 

4065
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:25,430
because isn't that what we do with
people anyway

4066
01:00:25,430 --> 01:00:25,440
people anyway
 

4067
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:26,549
people anyway
you know this kind of the shared

4068
01:00:26,549 --> 01:00:26,559
you know this kind of the shared
 

4069
01:00:26,559 --> 01:00:28,710
you know this kind of the shared
intelligence that is humanity is relying

4070
01:00:28,710 --> 01:00:28,720
intelligence that is humanity is relying
 

4071
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:30,710
intelligence that is humanity is relying
on other people constantly to i mean we

4072
01:00:30,710 --> 01:00:30,720
on other people constantly to i mean we
 

4073
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:32,230
on other people constantly to i mean we
hyper-specialize right

4074
01:00:32,230 --> 01:00:32,240
hyper-specialize right
 

4075
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:33,990
hyper-specialize right
as individuals we're still generally

4076
01:00:33,990 --> 01:00:34,000
as individuals we're still generally
 

4077
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,430
as individuals we're still generally
intelligent we make our own decisions in

4078
01:00:35,430 --> 01:00:35,440
intelligent we make our own decisions in
 

4079
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:36,789
intelligent we make our own decisions in
a lot of ways but we leave most of this

4080
01:00:36,789 --> 01:00:36,799
a lot of ways but we leave most of this
 

4081
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:37,990
a lot of ways but we leave most of this
up to other people and

4082
01:00:37,990 --> 01:00:38,000
up to other people and
 

4083
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,950
up to other people and
that's perfectly fine and by the way

4084
01:00:40,950 --> 01:00:40,960
that's perfectly fine and by the way
 

4085
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:42,150
that's perfectly fine and by the way
everyone doesn't necessarily

4086
01:00:42,150 --> 01:00:42,160
everyone doesn't necessarily
 

4087
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:43,990
everyone doesn't necessarily
share our goals sometimes they seem to

4088
01:00:43,990 --> 01:00:44,000
share our goals sometimes they seem to
 

4089
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,150
share our goals sometimes they seem to
be quite against us sometimes we

4090
01:00:46,150 --> 01:00:46,160
be quite against us sometimes we
 

4091
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:47,910
be quite against us sometimes we
make decisions that others would see as

4092
01:00:47,910 --> 01:00:47,920
make decisions that others would see as
 

4093
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:49,430
make decisions that others would see as
against our own interests and yet we

4094
01:00:49,430 --> 01:00:49,440
against our own interests and yet we
 

4095
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:50,470
against our own interests and yet we
somehow manage it

4096
01:00:50,470 --> 01:00:50,480
somehow manage it
 

4097
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:52,549
somehow manage it
manage to survive i'm not entirely sure

4098
01:00:52,549 --> 01:00:52,559
manage to survive i'm not entirely sure
 

4099
01:00:52,559 --> 01:00:54,150
manage to survive i'm not entirely sure
why an ai

4100
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:54,160
why an ai
 

4101
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:57,670
why an ai
would actually make that worse

4102
01:00:57,670 --> 01:00:57,680
would actually make that worse
 

4103
01:00:57,680 --> 01:01:00,630
would actually make that worse
or even different really you mentioned

4104
01:01:00,630 --> 01:01:00,640
or even different really you mentioned
 

4105
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:01,990
or even different really you mentioned
the matrix

4106
01:01:01,990 --> 01:01:02,000
the matrix
 

4107
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,030
the matrix
do you think we're living in a

4108
01:01:03,030 --> 01:01:03,040
do you think we're living in a
 

4109
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:05,030
do you think we're living in a
simulation it does

4110
01:01:05,030 --> 01:01:05,040
simulation it does
 

4111
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:08,950
simulation it does
feel like a thought game more than a

4112
01:01:08,950 --> 01:01:08,960
feel like a thought game more than a
 

4113
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:11,030
feel like a thought game more than a
real scientific question well i'll tell

4114
01:01:11,030 --> 01:01:11,040
real scientific question well i'll tell
 

4115
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:12,789
real scientific question well i'll tell
you why like i think it's an interesting

4116
01:01:12,789 --> 01:01:12,799
you why like i think it's an interesting
 

4117
01:01:12,799 --> 01:01:13,990
you why like i think it's an interesting
thought experiment see what you think

4118
01:01:13,990 --> 01:01:14,000
thought experiment see what you think
 

4119
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,069
thought experiment see what you think
from a computer science perspective

4120
01:01:16,069 --> 01:01:16,079
from a computer science perspective
 

4121
01:01:16,079 --> 01:01:19,349
from a computer science perspective
it's a good experiment of how difficult

4122
01:01:19,349 --> 01:01:19,359
it's a good experiment of how difficult
 

4123
01:01:19,359 --> 01:01:20,069
it's a good experiment of how difficult
would it be

4124
01:01:20,069 --> 01:01:20,079
would it be
 

4125
01:01:20,079 --> 01:01:22,710
would it be
to create a sufficiently realistic world

4126
01:01:22,710 --> 01:01:22,720
to create a sufficiently realistic world
 

4127
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:25,990
to create a sufficiently realistic world
that us humans would enjoy being in

4128
01:01:25,990 --> 01:01:26,000
that us humans would enjoy being in
 

4129
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,990
that us humans would enjoy being in
it that that's almost like if we're

4130
01:01:27,990 --> 01:01:28,000
it that that's almost like if we're
 

4131
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,510
it that that's almost like if we're
living in a simulation then i don't

4132
01:01:29,510 --> 01:01:29,520
living in a simulation then i don't
 

4133
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:30,870
living in a simulation then i don't
believe that we were put in the

4134
01:01:30,870 --> 01:01:30,880
believe that we were put in the
 

4135
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:32,390
believe that we were put in the
simulation i believe that

4136
01:01:32,390 --> 01:01:32,400
simulation i believe that
 

4137
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:35,030
simulation i believe that
it's just physics playing out and we

4138
01:01:35,030 --> 01:01:35,040
it's just physics playing out and we
 

4139
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:36,230
it's just physics playing out and we
came out of that

4140
01:01:36,230 --> 01:01:36,240
came out of that
 

4141
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:39,270
came out of that
like i don't i don't i don't think so

4142
01:01:39,270 --> 01:01:39,280
like i don't i don't i don't think so
 

4143
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:40,710
like i don't i don't i don't think so
you think you have to build the universe

4144
01:01:40,710 --> 01:01:40,720
you think you have to build the universe
 

4145
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:41,510
you think you have to build the universe
yeah i think

4146
01:01:41,510 --> 01:01:41,520
yeah i think
 

4147
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:42,950
yeah i think
the universe itself we can think of that

4148
01:01:42,950 --> 01:01:42,960
the universe itself we can think of that
 

4149
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:44,549
the universe itself we can think of that
as a simulation and in fact

4150
01:01:44,549 --> 01:01:44,559
as a simulation and in fact
 

4151
01:01:44,559 --> 01:01:46,390
as a simulation and in fact
what i try sometimes i try to think

4152
01:01:46,390 --> 01:01:46,400
what i try sometimes i try to think
 

4153
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:47,750
what i try sometimes i try to think
about to understand

4154
01:01:47,750 --> 01:01:47,760
about to understand
 

4155
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:51,109
about to understand
what it's like for a computer to

4156
01:01:51,109 --> 01:01:51,119
what it's like for a computer to
 

4157
01:01:51,119 --> 01:01:53,109
what it's like for a computer to
start to think about the world i try to

4158
01:01:53,109 --> 01:01:53,119
start to think about the world i try to
 

4159
01:01:53,119 --> 01:01:54,950
start to think about the world i try to
think about the world

4160
01:01:54,950 --> 01:01:54,960
think about the world
 

4161
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:57,430
think about the world
things like quantum mechanics where it

4162
01:01:57,430 --> 01:01:57,440
things like quantum mechanics where it
 

4163
01:01:57,440 --> 01:02:00,390
things like quantum mechanics where it
doesn't feel very natural to me at all

4164
01:02:00,390 --> 01:02:00,400
doesn't feel very natural to me at all
 

4165
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:03,109
doesn't feel very natural to me at all
and it really strikes me as i don't

4166
01:02:03,109 --> 01:02:03,119
and it really strikes me as i don't
 

4167
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:04,870
and it really strikes me as i don't
understand this thing that we're living

4168
01:02:04,870 --> 01:02:04,880
understand this thing that we're living
 

4169
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:05,349
understand this thing that we're living
in

4170
01:02:05,349 --> 01:02:05,359
in
 

4171
01:02:05,359 --> 01:02:07,430
in
it has there's weird things happening in

4172
01:02:07,430 --> 01:02:07,440
it has there's weird things happening in
 

4173
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:09,589
it has there's weird things happening in
it that don't feel natural to me at all

4174
01:02:09,589 --> 01:02:09,599
it that don't feel natural to me at all
 

4175
01:02:09,599 --> 01:02:11,430
it that don't feel natural to me at all
now if you want to call that as the

4176
01:02:11,430 --> 01:02:11,440
now if you want to call that as the
 

4177
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:12,950
now if you want to call that as the
result of a simulator

4178
01:02:12,950 --> 01:02:12,960
result of a simulator
 

4179
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:14,630
result of a simulator
okay i'm fine with that but like i don't

4180
01:02:14,630 --> 01:02:14,640
okay i'm fine with that but like i don't
 

4181
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:16,789
okay i'm fine with that but like i don't
know the bugs in the simulation

4182
01:02:16,789 --> 01:02:16,799
know the bugs in the simulation
 

4183
01:02:16,799 --> 01:02:18,470
know the bugs in the simulation
there's the bugs i mean the interesting

4184
01:02:18,470 --> 01:02:18,480
there's the bugs i mean the interesting
 

4185
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:19,990
there's the bugs i mean the interesting
thing about the simulation is that it

4186
01:02:19,990 --> 01:02:20,000
thing about the simulation is that it
 

4187
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,829
thing about the simulation is that it
might have bugs i mean that that's the

4188
01:02:21,829 --> 01:02:21,839
might have bugs i mean that that's the
 

4189
01:02:21,839 --> 01:02:23,829
might have bugs i mean that that's the
thing that i the but there would be bugs

4190
01:02:23,829 --> 01:02:23,839
thing that i the but there would be bugs
 

4191
01:02:23,839 --> 01:02:25,190
thing that i the but there would be bugs
for the people in the simulation they're

4192
01:02:25,190 --> 01:02:25,200
for the people in the simulation they're
 

4193
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:26,069
for the people in the simulation they're
just that's just

4194
01:02:26,069 --> 01:02:26,079
just that's just
 

4195
01:02:26,079 --> 01:02:28,230
just that's just
reality unless you were fair enough to

4196
01:02:28,230 --> 01:02:28,240
reality unless you were fair enough to
 

4197
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:29,190
reality unless you were fair enough to
know that there was a bug

4198
01:02:29,190 --> 01:02:29,200
know that there was a bug
 

4199
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:31,510
know that there was a bug
but i i think back to the matrix yeah

4200
01:02:31,510 --> 01:02:31,520
but i i think back to the matrix yeah
 

4201
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:32,230
but i i think back to the matrix yeah
the way you put this

4202
01:02:32,230 --> 01:02:32,240
the way you put this
 

4203
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:33,589
the way you put this
i don't think that we live in a in a

4204
01:02:33,589 --> 01:02:33,599
i don't think that we live in a in a
 

4205
01:02:33,599 --> 01:02:35,270
i don't think that we live in a in a
simulation created for us

4206
01:02:35,270 --> 01:02:35,280
simulation created for us
 

4207
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:36,630
simulation created for us
okay i would say that i think that's

4208
01:02:36,630 --> 01:02:36,640
okay i would say that i think that's
 

4209
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:37,510
okay i would say that i think that's
interesting i've actually never thought

4210
01:02:37,510 --> 01:02:37,520
interesting i've actually never thought
 

4211
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:38,390
interesting i've actually never thought
about it that way i mean

4212
01:02:38,390 --> 01:02:38,400
about it that way i mean
 

4213
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:39,589
about it that way i mean
you the way you asked the question

4214
01:02:39,589 --> 01:02:39,599
you the way you asked the question
 

4215
01:02:39,599 --> 01:02:41,109
you the way you asked the question
though is could you create a world that

4216
01:02:41,109 --> 01:02:41,119
though is could you create a world that
 

4217
01:02:41,119 --> 01:02:41,589
though is could you create a world that
is

4218
01:02:41,589 --> 01:02:41,599
is
 

4219
01:02:41,599 --> 01:02:43,430
is
enough for us humans it's an

4220
01:02:43,430 --> 01:02:43,440
enough for us humans it's an
 

4221
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:45,109
enough for us humans it's an
interestingly sort of self-referential

4222
01:02:45,109 --> 01:02:45,119
interestingly sort of self-referential
 

4223
01:02:45,119 --> 01:02:48,150
interestingly sort of self-referential
question because

4224
01:02:48,150 --> 01:02:48,160
question because
 

4225
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:49,829
question because
the beings that created the simulation

4226
01:02:49,829 --> 01:02:49,839
the beings that created the simulation
 

4227
01:02:49,839 --> 01:02:51,270
the beings that created the simulation
probably have not created a simulation

4228
01:02:51,270 --> 01:02:51,280
probably have not created a simulation
 

4229
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:53,109
probably have not created a simulation
that's realistic for them

4230
01:02:53,109 --> 01:02:53,119
that's realistic for them
 

4231
01:02:53,119 --> 01:02:54,630
that's realistic for them
but we're in the simulation and so it's

4232
01:02:54,630 --> 01:02:54,640
but we're in the simulation and so it's
 

4233
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:56,150
but we're in the simulation and so it's
realistic for us

4234
01:02:56,150 --> 01:02:56,160
realistic for us
 

4235
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:58,789
realistic for us
so we could create a simulation that is

4236
01:02:58,789 --> 01:02:58,799
so we could create a simulation that is
 

4237
01:02:58,799 --> 01:02:59,589
so we could create a simulation that is
fine for the

4238
01:02:59,589 --> 01:02:59,599
fine for the
 

4239
01:02:59,599 --> 01:03:02,150
fine for the
people in the simulation as it were that

4240
01:03:02,150 --> 01:03:02,160
people in the simulation as it were that
 

4241
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:03,670
people in the simulation as it were that
would not necessarily be fine for us as

4242
01:03:03,670 --> 01:03:03,680
would not necessarily be fine for us as
 

4243
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:05,109
would not necessarily be fine for us as
the creators of the simulation

4244
01:03:05,109 --> 01:03:05,119
the creators of the simulation
 

4245
01:03:05,119 --> 01:03:07,670
the creators of the simulation
but well you can you can forget i mean

4246
01:03:07,670 --> 01:03:07,680
but well you can you can forget i mean
 

4247
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:08,710
but well you can you can forget i mean
when you go into the

4248
01:03:08,710 --> 01:03:08,720
when you go into the
 

4249
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:10,309
when you go into the
if you play video games in virtual

4250
01:03:10,309 --> 01:03:10,319
if you play video games in virtual
 

4251
01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:11,829
if you play video games in virtual
reality you can

4252
01:03:11,829 --> 01:03:11,839
reality you can
 

4253
01:03:11,839 --> 01:03:14,829
reality you can
if with some suspension of disbelief or

4254
01:03:14,829 --> 01:03:14,839
if with some suspension of disbelief or
 

4255
01:03:14,839 --> 01:03:16,230
if with some suspension of disbelief or
whatever yeah uh

4256
01:03:16,230 --> 01:03:16,240
whatever yeah uh
 

4257
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:18,470
whatever yeah uh
it becomes a world it becomes the world

4258
01:03:18,470 --> 01:03:18,480
it becomes a world it becomes the world
 

4259
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:20,069
it becomes a world it becomes the world
even like in brief moments

4260
01:03:20,069 --> 01:03:20,079
even like in brief moments
 

4261
01:03:20,079 --> 01:03:22,309
even like in brief moments
you forget that another world exists i

4262
01:03:22,309 --> 01:03:22,319
you forget that another world exists i
 

4263
01:03:22,319 --> 01:03:24,150
you forget that another world exists i
mean that's what like good stories do

4264
01:03:24,150 --> 01:03:24,160
mean that's what like good stories do
 

4265
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:26,470
mean that's what like good stories do
they pull you in and the question is is

4266
01:03:26,470 --> 01:03:26,480
they pull you in and the question is is
 

4267
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:27,910
they pull you in and the question is is
it possible to pull

4268
01:03:27,910 --> 01:03:27,920
it possible to pull
 

4269
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:29,510
it possible to pull
you know our brains are limited is it

4270
01:03:29,510 --> 01:03:29,520
you know our brains are limited is it
 

4271
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:31,109
you know our brains are limited is it
possible to pull the brain in

4272
01:03:31,109 --> 01:03:31,119
possible to pull the brain in
 

4273
01:03:31,119 --> 01:03:32,630
possible to pull the brain in
to where we actually stay in that world

4274
01:03:32,630 --> 01:03:32,640
to where we actually stay in that world
 

4275
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:34,710
to where we actually stay in that world
longer and longer longer and longer

4276
01:03:34,710 --> 01:03:34,720
longer and longer longer and longer
 

4277
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:38,069
longer and longer longer and longer
and like not only that but we don't want

4278
01:03:38,069 --> 01:03:38,079
and like not only that but we don't want
 

4279
01:03:38,079 --> 01:03:38,950
and like not only that but we don't want
to leave

4280
01:03:38,950 --> 01:03:38,960
to leave
 

4281
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:41,430
to leave
and so especially this is the key thing

4282
01:03:41,430 --> 01:03:41,440
and so especially this is the key thing
 

4283
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:42,309
and so especially this is the key thing
about the

4284
01:03:42,309 --> 01:03:42,319
about the
 

4285
01:03:42,319 --> 01:03:45,510
about the
developing brain is if we journey into

4286
01:03:45,510 --> 01:03:45,520
developing brain is if we journey into
 

4287
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:47,430
developing brain is if we journey into
that world early on in life

4288
01:03:47,430 --> 01:03:47,440
that world early on in life
 

4289
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:49,910
that world early on in life
often how would you even know yeah yeah

4290
01:03:49,910 --> 01:03:49,920
often how would you even know yeah yeah
 

4291
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:50,710
often how would you even know yeah yeah
so i

4292
01:03:50,710 --> 01:03:50,720
so i
 

4293
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:52,549
so i
but like from a video game design

4294
01:03:52,549 --> 01:03:52,559
but like from a video game design
 

4295
01:03:52,559 --> 01:03:53,829
but like from a video game design
perspective from a west world

4296
01:03:53,829 --> 01:03:53,839
perspective from a west world
 

4297
01:03:53,839 --> 01:03:54,789
perspective from a west world
perspective it's

4298
01:03:54,789 --> 01:03:54,799
perspective it's
 

4299
01:03:54,799 --> 01:03:57,510
perspective it's
i think i think it's an important thing

4300
01:03:57,510 --> 01:03:57,520
i think i think it's an important thing
 

4301
01:03:57,520 --> 01:03:58,309
i think i think it's an important thing
for even

4302
01:03:58,309 --> 01:03:58,319
for even
 

4303
01:03:58,319 --> 01:04:00,710
for even
uh computer scientists to think about

4304
01:04:00,710 --> 01:04:00,720
uh computer scientists to think about
 

4305
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:02,549
uh computer scientists to think about
because it's clear that video games

4306
01:04:02,549 --> 01:04:02,559
because it's clear that video games
 

4307
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:05,750
because it's clear that video games
are getting much better and virtual

4308
01:04:05,750 --> 01:04:05,760
are getting much better and virtual
 

4309
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:06,470
are getting much better and virtual
reality

4310
01:04:06,470 --> 01:04:06,480
reality
 

4311
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:08,470
reality
although it's been ups and downs just

4312
01:04:08,470 --> 01:04:08,480
although it's been ups and downs just
 

4313
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:09,829
although it's been ups and downs just
like artificial intelligence

4314
01:04:09,829 --> 01:04:09,839
like artificial intelligence
 

4315
01:04:09,839 --> 01:04:14,230
like artificial intelligence
it feels like virtual reality will be

4316
01:04:14,230 --> 01:04:14,240
it feels like virtual reality will be
 

4317
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:16,470
it feels like virtual reality will be
here in a very impressive form if we

4318
01:04:16,470 --> 01:04:16,480
here in a very impressive form if we
 

4319
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:18,150
here in a very impressive form if we
were to fast forward 100 years into the

4320
01:04:18,150 --> 01:04:18,160
were to fast forward 100 years into the
 

4321
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:18,950
were to fast forward 100 years into the
future

4322
01:04:18,950 --> 01:04:18,960

the college experience
 

4703
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:21,350
the college experience
and that's very difficult for us to

4704
01:10:21,350 --> 01:10:21,360
and that's very difficult for us to
 

4705
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:23,750
and that's very difficult for us to
accept even though we behaved that way

accept even though we behaved that way

most of us when we were undergrads you

most of us when we were undergrads you
 

4709
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:27,669
most of us when we were undergrads you
know a lot of us didn't go to every

know a lot of us didn't go to every
 

4711

know a lot of us didn't go to every
single class

we learned and we got it and we look

4714
01:10:30,070 --> 01:10:30,080
we learned and we got it and we look
 

4715
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:31,189
we learned and we got it and we look
back on it and we're happy we had the

4716
01:10:31,189 --> 01:10:31,199
back on it and we're happy we had the
 

4717
01:10:31,199 --> 01:10:32,550
back on it and we're happy we had the
learning experience as well obviously

4718
01:10:32,550 --> 01:10:32,560
learning experience as well obviously
 

4719
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:33,990
learning experience as well obviously
particularly us because this is

4720
01:10:33,990 --> 01:10:34,000
particularly us because this is
 

4721
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,750
particularly us because this is
the kind of thing that we do and my

4722
01:10:35,750 --> 01:10:35,760
the kind of thing that we do and my
 

4723
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:37,350
the kind of thing that we do and my
guess is that's true of

4724
01:10:37,350 --> 01:10:37,360
guess is that's true of
 

4725
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:39,910
guess is that's true of
the vast majority of your audience but

4726
01:10:39,910 --> 01:10:39,920
the vast majority of your audience but
 

4727
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:41,430
the vast majority of your audience but
that doesn't mean the

4728
01:10:41,430 --> 01:10:41,440
that doesn't mean the
 

4729
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:43,030
that doesn't mean the
i'm standing in front of you telling you

4730
01:10:43,030 --> 01:10:43,040
i'm standing in front of you telling you
 

4731
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:45,430
i'm standing in front of you telling you
this is the thing that people are

4732
01:10:45,430 --> 01:10:45,440
this is the thing that people are
 

4733
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:48,390
this is the thing that people are
excited about um and that's why they

4734
01:10:48,390 --> 01:10:48,400
excited about um and that's why they
 

4735
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:50,070
excited about um and that's why they
want to be there primarily why they want

4736
01:10:50,070 --> 01:10:50,080
want to be there primarily why they want
 

4737
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:50,790
want to be there primarily why they want
to be there

4738
01:10:50,790 --> 01:10:50,800
to be there
 

4739
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:52,709
to be there
so to me that's what coveted has forced

4740
01:10:52,709 --> 01:10:52,719
so to me that's what coveted has forced
 

4741
01:10:52,719 --> 01:10:53,830
so to me that's what coveted has forced
us to deal with

4742
01:10:53,830 --> 01:10:53,840
us to deal with
 

4743
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:55,590
us to deal with
um even though i think we're still all

4744
01:10:55,590 --> 01:10:55,600
um even though i think we're still all
 

4745
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:57,189
um even though i think we're still all
in deep denial about it

4746
01:10:57,189 --> 01:10:57,199
in deep denial about it
 

4747
01:10:57,199 --> 01:10:59,830
in deep denial about it
and hoping that it'll go back to that

4748
01:10:59,830 --> 01:10:59,840
and hoping that it'll go back to that
 

4749
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:01,110
and hoping that it'll go back to that
and i think about 85

4750
01:11:01,110 --> 01:11:01,120
and i think about 85
 

4751
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:02,390
and i think about 85
of it will we'll be able to pretend that

4752
01:11:02,390 --> 01:11:02,400
of it will we'll be able to pretend that
 

4753
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:03,590
of it will we'll be able to pretend that
that's really the way it is again and

4754
01:11:03,590 --> 01:11:03,600
that's really the way it is again and
 

4755
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:05,189
that's really the way it is again and
we'll forget the lessons of this

4756
01:11:05,189 --> 01:11:05,199
we'll forget the lessons of this
 

4757
01:11:05,199 --> 01:11:07,350
we'll forget the lessons of this
but technically what will come out of it

4758
01:11:07,350 --> 01:11:07,360
but technically what will come out of it
 

4759
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:08,950
but technically what will come out of it
or technologically will come out of it

4760
01:11:08,950 --> 01:11:08,960
or technologically will come out of it
 

4761
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:09,350
or technologically will come out of it
is

4762
01:11:09,350 --> 01:11:09,360
is
 

4763
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:12,070
is
a way of providing a more dispersed

4764
01:11:12,070 --> 01:11:12,080
a way of providing a more dispersed
 

4765
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:13,750
a way of providing a more dispersed
experience through online education and

4766
01:11:13,750 --> 01:11:13,760
experience through online education and
 

4767
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:14,709
experience through online education and
these kinds of

01:11:14,709 --> 01:11:14,719
these kinds of
 

4769
01:11:14,719 --> 01:11:15,990
these kinds of
remote things that we've learned and

4770
01:11:15,990 --> 01:11:16,000
remote things that we've learned and
 

4771
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:17,430
remote things that we've learned and
we'll have to come up with new ways to

4772
01:11:17,430 --> 01:11:17,440
we'll have to come up with new ways to
 

4773
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:17,990
we'll have to come up with new ways to
engage

4774
01:11:17,990 --> 01:11:18,000
engage
 

4775
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,630
engage
them in the experience of college which

4776
01:11:20,630 --> 01:11:20,640
them in the experience of college which
 

4777
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:22,149
them in the experience of college which
includes not just the parties or

4778
01:11:22,149 --> 01:11:22,159
includes not just the parties or
 

4779
01:11:22,159 --> 01:11:25,030
includes not just the parties or
whatever kids do but the learning part

4780
01:11:25,030 --> 01:11:25,040
whatever kids do but the learning part
 

4781
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:26,709
whatever kids do but the learning part
of it so that they actually come out for

4782
01:11:26,709 --> 01:11:26,719
of it so that they actually come out for
 

4783
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:27,990
of it so that they actually come out for
five or six years later

4784
01:11:27,990 --> 01:11:28,000
five or six years later
 

4785
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:29,830
five or six years later
with having actually having actually

4786
01:11:29,830 --> 01:11:29,840
with having actually having actually
 

4787
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:31,430
with having actually having actually
learned something so

4788
01:11:31,430 --> 01:11:31,440
learned something so
 

4789
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:33,110
learned something so
um i think the world will be radically

4790
01:11:33,110 --> 01:11:33,120
um i think the world will be radically
 

4791
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:34,310
um i think the world will be radically
different afterwards and i think

4792
01:11:34,310 --> 01:11:34,320
different afterwards and i think
 

4793
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:35,030
different afterwards and i think
technology

4794
01:11:35,030 --> 01:11:35,040
technology
 

4795
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:37,510
technology
will matter for that just not in the way

4796
01:11:37,510 --> 01:11:37,520
will matter for that just not in the way
 

4797
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:39,030
will matter for that just not in the way
that the people who are building the

4798
01:11:39,030 --> 01:11:39,040
that the people who are building the
 

4799
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:40,630
that the people who are building the
technology originally

4800
01:11:40,630 --> 01:11:40,640
technology originally
 

4801
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:42,550
technology originally
imagined it would be and i think this

4802
01:11:42,550 --> 01:11:42,560
imagined it would be and i think this
 

4803
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:43,750
imagined it would be and i think this
would have been true

4804
01:11:43,750 --> 01:11:43,760
would have been true
 

4805
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:45,830
would have been true
even without covid but covet has

4806
01:11:45,830 --> 01:11:45,840
even without covid but covet has
 

4807
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:47,189
even without covid but covet has
accelerated that

4808
01:11:47,189 --> 01:11:47,199
accelerated that
 

4809
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:48,790
accelerated that
reality so it's happening in two or

4810
01:11:48,790 --> 01:11:48,800
reality so it's happening in two or
 

4811
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:50,550
reality so it's happening in two or
three years or five years as opposed to

4812
01:11:50,550 --> 01:11:50,560
three years or five years as opposed to
 

4813
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:52,070
three years or five years as opposed to
10 or 15.

4814
01:11:52,070 --> 01:11:52,080
10 or 15.
 

4815
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:54,310
10 or 15.
that was an amazing answer that i did

4816
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:54,320
that was an amazing answer that i did
 

4817
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:56,070
that was an amazing answer that i did
not understand

4818
01:11:56,070 --> 01:11:56,080
not understand
 

4819
01:11:56,080 --> 01:11:59,270
not understand
so it was passionate and and i but i

4820
01:11:59,270 --> 01:11:59,280
so it was passionate and and i but i
 

4821
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:00,229
so it was passionate and and i but i
don't know i just didn't

4822
01:12:00,229 --> 01:12:00,239
don't know i just didn't
 

4823
01:12:00,239 --> 01:12:01,510
don't know i just didn't
no i'm not trying to criticize it i

4824
01:12:01,510 --> 01:12:01,520
no i'm not trying to criticize it i
 

4825
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:03,189
no i'm not trying to criticize it i
think i'm i don't think i'm getting it

4826
01:12:03,189 --> 01:12:03,199
think i'm i don't think i'm getting it
 

4827
01:12:03,199 --> 01:12:03,750
think i'm i don't think i'm getting it
so

4828
01:12:03,750 --> 01:12:03,760
so
 

4829
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:05,669
so
you mentioned disaggregation so what's

4830
01:12:05,669 --> 01:12:05,679
you mentioned disaggregation so what's
 

4831
01:12:05,679 --> 01:12:07,030
you mentioned disaggregation so what's
that well so

4832
01:12:07,030 --> 01:12:07,040
that well so
 

4833
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:08,709
that well so
you know the power the power of

4834
01:12:08,709 --> 01:12:08,719
you know the power the power of
 

4835
01:12:08,719 --> 01:12:10,310
you know the power the power of
technology that if you go on the west

4836
01:12:10,310 --> 01:12:10,320
technology that if you go on the west
 

4837
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:11,669
technology that if you go on the west
coast and hang out long enough is all

4838
01:12:11,669 --> 01:12:11,679
coast and hang out long enough is all
 

4839
01:12:11,679 --> 01:12:12,950
coast and hang out long enough is all
about we're going to disaggregate these

4840
01:12:12,950 --> 01:12:12,960
about we're going to disaggregate these
 

4841
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:14,070
about we're going to disaggregate these
things together the books from the

4842
01:12:14,070 --> 01:12:14,080
things together the books from the
 

4843
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:15,750
things together the books from the
bookstore you know that kind of a thing

4844
01:12:15,750 --> 01:12:15,760
bookstore you know that kind of a thing
 

4845
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:17,189
bookstore you know that kind of a thing
and then suddenly amazon controls the

4846
01:12:17,189 --> 01:12:17,199
and then suddenly amazon controls the
 

4847
01:12:17,199 --> 01:12:18,390
and then suddenly amazon controls the
universe right and technology is a

4848
01:12:18,390 --> 01:12:18,400
universe right and technology is a
 

4849
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:19,110
universe right and technology is a
disrupter

4850
01:12:19,110 --> 01:12:19,120
disrupter
 

4851
01:12:19,120 --> 01:12:20,470
disrupter
right and people have been predicting

4852
01:12:20,470 --> 01:12:20,480
right and people have been predicting
 

4853
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:22,470
right and people have been predicting
that for uh higher education for a long

4854
01:12:22,470 --> 01:12:22,480
that for uh higher education for a long
 

4855
01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:23,430
that for uh higher education for a long
time but certainly

4856
01:12:23,430 --> 01:12:23,440
time but certainly
 

4857
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:26,709
time but certainly
so is this is this the sort of idea like

4858
01:12:26,709 --> 01:12:26,719
so is this is this the sort of idea like
 

4859
01:12:26,719 --> 01:12:29,510
so is this is this the sort of idea like
students can aggregate on a campus

4860
01:12:29,510 --> 01:12:29,520
students can aggregate on a campus
 

4861
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:31,830
students can aggregate on a campus
someplace and then take classes

4862
01:12:31,830 --> 01:12:31,840
someplace and then take classes
 

4863
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:33,669
someplace and then take classes
over the network anywhere yeah this is

4864
01:12:33,669 --> 01:12:33,679
over the network anywhere yeah this is
 

4865
01:12:33,679 --> 01:12:34,790
over the network anywhere yeah this is
what people thought was going to happen

4866
01:12:34,790 --> 01:12:34,800
what people thought was going to happen
 

4867
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:35,990
what people thought was going to happen
or at least people claimed it was going

4868
01:12:35,990 --> 01:12:36,000
or at least people claimed it was going
 

4869
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:37,350
or at least people claimed it was going
to happen right that you know because my

4870
01:12:37,350 --> 01:12:37,360
to happen right that you know because my
 

4871
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:38,870
to happen right that you know because my
daughter is essentially doing that now

4872
01:12:38,870 --> 01:12:38,880
daughter is essentially doing that now
 

4873
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:40,470
daughter is essentially doing that now
she's on one campus but learning in a

4874
01:12:40,470 --> 01:12:40,480
she's on one campus but learning in a
 

4875
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:41,910
she's on one campus but learning in a
different campus sure and kobe makes

4876
01:12:41,910 --> 01:12:41,920
different campus sure and kobe makes
 

4877
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:42,630
different campus sure and kobe makes
that possible

4878
01:12:42,630 --> 01:12:42,640
that possible
 

4879
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:45,669
that possible
right um okovi makes that um league all

4880
01:12:45,669 --> 01:12:45,679
right um okovi makes that um league all
 

4881
01:12:45,679 --> 01:12:46,709
right um okovi makes that um league all
but avoidable

4882
01:12:46,709 --> 01:12:46,719
but avoidable
 

4883
01:12:46,719 --> 01:12:49,110
but avoidable
right but the idea originally was that

4884
01:12:49,110 --> 01:12:49,120
right but the idea originally was that
 

4885
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:50,070
right but the idea originally was that
you know you and i were going to create

4886
01:12:50,070 --> 01:12:50,080
you know you and i were going to create
 

4887
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:51,350
you know you and i were going to create
this machine learning class and it was

4888
01:12:51,350 --> 01:12:51,360
this machine learning class and it was
 

4889
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:52,470
this machine learning class and it was
going to be great and then no one else

4890
01:12:52,470 --> 01:12:52,480
going to be great and then no one else
 

4891
01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:52,790
going to be great and then no one else
would

4892
01:12:52,790 --> 01:12:52,800
would
 

4893
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:53,990
would
be the machine learning class everyone

4894
01:12:53,990 --> 01:12:54,000
be the machine learning class everyone
 

4895
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:55,750
be the machine learning class everyone
takes right that was never going to

4896
01:12:55,750 --> 01:12:55,760
takes right that was never going to
 

4897
01:12:55,760 --> 01:12:56,390
takes right that was never going to
happen but

4898
01:12:56,390 --> 01:12:56,400
happen but
 

4899
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:57,590
happen but
you know something like that but i feel

4900
01:12:57,590 --> 01:12:57,600
you know something like that but i feel
 

4901
01:12:57,600 --> 01:12:59,590
you know something like that but i feel
like you didn't address that so why why

4902
01:12:59,590 --> 01:12:59,600
like you didn't address that so why why
 

4903
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:02,709
like you didn't address that so why why
why is it that why cue why i don't think

4904
01:13:02,709 --> 01:13:02,719
why is it that why cue why i don't think
 

4905
01:13:02,719 --> 01:13:04,310
why is it that why cue why i don't think
that will be the thing that happens the

4906
01:13:04,310 --> 01:13:04,320
that will be the thing that happens the
 

4907
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:05,910
that will be the thing that happens the
college experience maybe i maybe i

4908
01:13:05,910 --> 01:13:05,920
college experience maybe i maybe i
 

4909
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:07,270
college experience maybe i maybe i
missed what the college experience was i

4910
01:13:07,270 --> 01:13:07,280
missed what the college experience was i
 

4911
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:08,310
missed what the college experience was i
thought it was

4912
01:13:08,310 --> 01:13:08,320
thought it was
 

4913
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:10,310
thought it was
peers like people hanging around a large

4914
01:13:10,310 --> 01:13:10,320
peers like people hanging around a large
 

4915
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:11,510
peers like people hanging around a large
part of it is peers

4916
01:13:11,510 --> 01:13:11,520
part of it is peers
 

4917
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:13,830
part of it is peers
well it's peers and independence yeah

4918
01:13:13,830 --> 01:13:13,840
well it's peers and independence yeah
 

4919
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:14,950
well it's peers and independence yeah
but none of that

4920
01:13:14,950 --> 01:13:14,960
but none of that
 

4921
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:16,630
but none of that
you can do classes online for all of

4922
01:13:16,630 --> 01:13:16,640
you can do classes online for all of
 

4923
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:18,390
you can do classes online for all of
that no no no no

4924
01:13:18,390 --> 01:13:18,400
that no no no no
 

4925
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:19,830
that no no no no
because no definitely we're social

4926
01:13:19,830 --> 01:13:19,840
because no definitely we're social
 

4927
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:21,430
because no definitely we're social
people right so you want to be able to

4928
01:13:21,430 --> 01:13:21,440
people right so you want to be able to
 

4929
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:23,270
people right so you want to be able to
take the classes that also has to be

4930
01:13:23,270 --> 01:13:23,280
take the classes that also has to be
 

4931
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:25,110
take the classes that also has to be
part of an experience

4932
01:13:25,110 --> 01:13:25,120
part of an experience
 

4933
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:26,790
part of an experience
it's in a context in the context of the

it's in a context in the context of the
 

4935
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:28,390
it's in a context in the context of the
university and by the way it actually

4936
01:13:28,390 --> 01:13:28,400
university and by the way it actually
 

4937
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:29,510
university and by the way it actually
matters

4938
01:13:29,510 --> 01:13:29,520
matters
 

4939
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:31,270
matters
that georgia tech really is different

4940
01:13:31,270 --> 01:13:31,280
that georgia tech really is different
 

4941

i see because then students can choose

4944
01:13:35,990 --> 01:13:36,000
i see because then students can choose
 

4945
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:37,270
i see because then students can choose
the kind of experience they think is

4946
01:13:37,270 --> 01:13:37,280
the kind of experience they think is
 

4947
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:38,229
the kind of experience they think is
going to be best for them

4948
01:13:38,229 --> 01:13:38,239
going to be best for them
 

4949
01:13:38,239 --> 01:13:39,830
going to be best for them
okay i think we're giving too much

4950
01:13:39,830 --> 01:13:39,840
okay i think we're giving too much
 

4951
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:41,510
okay i think we're giving too much

okay but the truth but yes they will
 

4957
01:13:44,719 --> 01:13:45,830
okay but the truth but yes they will

had an impact
 

5113
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:58,870
had an impact

but importantly we gave a set of people
 

5115
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:00,470
but importantly we gave a set of people
opportunities they otherwise didn't feel

5116
01:16:00,470 --> 01:16:00,480
opportunities they otherwise didn't feel
 

5117
01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:02,070
opportunities they otherwise didn't feel
they had so i think people feel very

5118
01:16:02,070 --> 01:16:02,080
they had so i think people feel very
 

5119
01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:03,510
they had so i think people feel very
loyal about that my biggest piece of

5120
01:16:03,510 --> 01:16:03,520
loyal about that my biggest piece of
 

5121
01:16:03,520 --> 01:16:05,270
loyal about that my biggest piece of
evidence for that besides the surveys

5122
01:16:05,270 --> 01:16:05,280
evidence for that besides the surveys
 

5123
01:16:05,280 --> 01:16:07,750
evidence for that besides the surveys
is that we have somewhere north of 80

5124
01:16:07,750 --> 01:16:07,760
is that we have somewhere north of 80
 

5125
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:08,550
is that we have somewhere north of 80
students

5126
01:16:08,550 --> 01:16:08,560
students
 

5127
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:12,149
students
might be 100 at this point who graduated

5128
01:16:12,149 --> 01:16:12,159
might be 100 at this point who graduated
 

5129
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:15,189
might be 100 at this point who graduated
but come back in ta for this class for

5130
01:16:15,189 --> 01:16:15,199
but come back in ta for this class for
 

5131
01:16:15,199 --> 01:16:16,709
but come back in ta for this class for
basically minimum wage

5132
01:16:16,709 --> 01:16:16,719
basically minimum wage
 

5133
01:16:16,719 --> 01:16:17,910
basically minimum wage
even though they're working full-time

5134

because they believe they believe
 

5137
01:16:20,239 --> 01:16:21,910
because they believe they believe
in sort of having that opportunity and

01:16:21,910 --> 01:16:21,920
in sort of having that opportunity and
 

5139
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:23,350
in sort of having that opportunity and
they want to be a part of something now

01:16:23,350 --> 01:16:23,360
they want to be a part of something now
 

5141

will they
 

5143
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:26,390
will they
will generation 3 feel this way 15 years

5144
01:16:26,390 --> 01:16:26,400
will generation 3 feel this way 15 years
 

5145
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:27,669
will generation 3 feel this way 15 years
from now will people have that same

5146
01:16:27,669 --> 01:16:27,679
from now will people have that same

tribal
 

5159
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:39,669
tribal
yeah right um and i think there's

5160
01:16:39,669 --> 01:16:39,679
yeah right um and i think there's
 

5161
01:16:39,679 --> 01:16:40,630
yeah right um and i think there's
something

5162
01:16:40,630 --> 01:16:40,640
something
 

5163
01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:43,030

something
 

5167
01:16:43,679 --> 01:16:45,270
something
like that being on campus makes that

5168
01:16:45,270 --> 01:16:45,280
like that being on campus makes that
 

5169
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:46,709
like that being on campus makes that
easier going through a shared experience

5170
01:16:46,709 --> 01:16:46,719
easier going through a shared experience
 

5171
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:47,350
easier going through a shared experience
makes it

5172
01:16:47,350 --> 01:16:47,360
makes it
 

5173
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:49,270
makes it
easier it's harder to have that shared

5174
01:16:49,270 --> 01:16:49,280
easier it's harder to have that shared
 

5175
01:16:49,280 --> 01:16:50,630
easier it's harder to have that shared
experience if you're alone

5176
01:16:50,630 --> 01:16:50,640
experience if you're alone
 

5177
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:52,229
experience if you're alone
looking at a computer screen we can

5178
01:16:52,229 --> 01:16:52,239
looking at a computer screen we can
 

5179
01:16:52,239 --> 01:16:54,229
looking at a computer screen we can
create ways to make that is it possible

5180
01:16:54,229 --> 01:16:54,239
create ways to make that is it possible
 

5181
01:16:54,239 --> 01:16:56,550
create ways to make that is it possible
it is that's the question is it still is

5182
01:16:56,550 --> 01:16:56,560
it is that's the question is it still is
 

5183
01:16:56,560 --> 01:16:58,229
it is that's the question is it still is
the intuition to me

5184
01:16:58,229 --> 01:16:58,239
the intuition to me
 

5185
01:16:58,239 --> 01:17:00,790
the intuition to me
and it was at the beginning when i saw

5186
01:17:00,790 --> 01:17:00,800
and it was at the beginning when i saw
 

5187
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:02,310
and it was at the beginning when i saw
something like

5188
01:17:02,310 --> 01:17:02,320
something like
 

5189
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:05,350
something like
the online master's program is

5190
01:17:05,350 --> 01:17:05,360
the online master's program is
 

5191
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:06,630
the online master's program is
that this is going to replace

5192
01:17:06,630 --> 01:17:06,640
that this is going to replace
 

5193
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:08,630
that this is going to replace
universities and it won't replace

5194
01:17:08,630 --> 01:17:08,640
universities and it won't replace
 

5195
01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:10,149
universities and it won't replace
universities better but like where is it

5196
01:17:10,149 --> 01:17:10,159
universities better but like where is it
 

5197
01:17:10,159 --> 01:17:12,229
universities better but like where is it
why because it's living in a different

5198
01:17:12,229 --> 01:17:12,239
why because it's living in a different
 

5199
01:17:12,239 --> 01:17:13,510
why because it's living in a different
part of the ecosystem

5200
01:17:13,510 --> 01:17:13,520
part of the ecosystem
 

5201
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:14,870
part of the ecosystem
right the people who are taking it are

5202
01:17:14,870 --> 01:17:14,880
right the people who are taking it are
 

5203
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:16,630
right the people who are taking it are
already adults they've gone through

5204
01:17:16,630 --> 01:17:16,640
already adults they've gone through
 

5205
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:18,310
already adults they've gone through
their undergrad experience

5206
01:17:18,310 --> 01:17:18,320
their undergrad experience
 

5207
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:19,830
their undergrad experience
their i think their their goals have

5208
01:17:19,830 --> 01:17:19,840
their i think their their goals have
 

5209
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:21,430
their i think their their goals have
shifted from when they were 17.

5210
01:17:21,430 --> 01:17:21,440
shifted from when they were 17.
 

5211
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:22,950
shifted from when they were 17.
um they have other things that that are

5212
01:17:22,950 --> 01:17:22,960
um they have other things that that are
 

5213
01:17:22,960 --> 01:17:24,950
um they have other things that that are
going right but it does do something

5214
01:17:24,950 --> 01:17:24,960
going right but it does do something
 

5215
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:26,310
going right but it does do something
really important something very social

5216
01:17:26,310 --> 01:17:26,320
really important something very social
 

5217

01:17:38,709 --> 01:17:38,719
yeah um their architects apparently
 

5233
01:17:38,719 --> 01:17:39,750
yeah um their architects apparently
believe that's the right way to do

5234

things
the metaphor here is that we

5238
01:17:43,750 --> 01:17:43,760
the metaphor here is that we
 

5239
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:45,510
the metaphor here is that we
we created this environment we didn't

5240
01:17:45,510 --> 01:17:45,520
we created this environment we didn't
 

5241
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:47,110
we created this environment we didn't
quite know how to think about

5242
01:17:47,110 --> 01:17:47,120
quite know how to think about
 

5243

way to do it
 

5299
01:18:32,080 --> 01:18:36,070
way to do it
right and i think they had other

5300
01:18:36,070 --> 01:18:36,080
right and i think they had other
 

5301

it scratched an itch that they had but

5302
01:18:38,149 --> 01:18:38,159
it scratched an itch that they had but
 

5303
01:18:38,159 --> 01:18:39,990
it scratched an itch that they had but
they had scratched some of that itch

5304
01:18:39,990 --> 01:18:40,000
they had scratched some of that itch
 

5305
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:41,110
they had scratched some of that itch
that might have required they'd be

5306
01:18:41,110 --> 01:18:41,120
that might have required they'd be
 

5307
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:42,310
that might have required they'd be
physically in the same place

5308
01:18:42,310 --> 01:18:42,320
physically in the same place
 

5309
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:45,830
physically in the same place
long before right so i think

5310
01:18:45,830 --> 01:18:45,840
long before right so i think
 

5311
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:47,750
long before right so i think
yes it's possible and it's more than

5312
01:18:47,750 --> 01:18:47,760
yes it's possible and it's more than
 

5313
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:49,510
yes it's possible and it's more than
possible it's necessary

5314
01:18:49,510 --> 01:18:49,520
possible it's necessary
 

5315
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:52,870
possible it's necessary
but i don't think it's going to replace

5316
01:18:52,870 --> 01:18:52,880
but i don't think it's going to replace
 

5317
01:18:52,880 --> 01:18:55,189
but i don't think it's going to replace
the university as we know it the

5318
01:18:55,189 --> 01:18:55,199
the university as we know it the
 

5319
01:18:55,199 --> 01:18:57,510
the university as we know it the
university as we know it will change

5320
01:18:57,510 --> 01:18:57,520
university as we know it will change
 

5321
01:18:57,520 --> 01:18:59,270
university as we know it will change
but there's just a lot of power and the

5322
01:18:59,270 --> 01:18:59,280
but there's just a lot of power and the
 

5323
01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:00,870
but there's just a lot of power and the
kind of rite of passage kind of going

5324
01:19:00,870 --> 01:19:00,880
kind of rite of passage kind of going
 

5325
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:02,070
kind of rite of passage kind of going
off to yourself now maybe there'll be

5326
01:19:02,070 --> 01:19:02,080
off to yourself now maybe there'll be
 

5327
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:03,350
off to yourself now maybe there'll be
some other rite of passage that will

5328
01:19:03,350 --> 01:19:03,360
some other rite of passage that will
 

5329
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:03,669
some other rite of passage that will
happen

5330
01:19:03,669 --> 01:19:03,679
happen
 

5331
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:05,110
happen
right that's the best drive or somewhere

5332
01:19:05,110 --> 01:19:05,120
right that's the best drive or somewhere
 

5333
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:06,870
right that's the best drive or somewhere
else you can separate so the university

5334
01:19:06,870 --> 01:19:06,880
else you can separate so the university
 

5335
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:09,110
else you can separate so the university
is such a fascinating

5336
01:19:09,110 --> 01:19:09,120
is such a fascinating
 

5337
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:11,910
is such a fascinating
uh mess of things so just even the

5338
01:19:11,910 --> 01:19:11,920
uh mess of things so just even the
 

5339
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:13,350
uh mess of things so just even the
faculty position

5340
01:19:13,350 --> 01:19:13,360
faculty position
 

5341
01:19:13,360 --> 01:19:14,950
faculty position
is a fascinating mess like it doesn't

5342
01:19:14,950 --> 01:19:14,960
is a fascinating mess like it doesn't
 

5343
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:18,149
is a fascinating mess like it doesn't
make any sense it it stabilizes itself

5344
01:19:18,149 --> 01:19:18,159
make any sense it it stabilizes itself
 

5345
01:19:18,159 --> 01:19:20,830
make any sense it it stabilizes itself
but like why are the world-class

5346
01:19:20,830 --> 01:19:20,840
but like why are the world-class
 

5347
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:22,149
but like why are the world-class
researchers

5348
01:19:22,149 --> 01:19:22,159
researchers
 

5349
01:19:22,159 --> 01:19:25,510
researchers
spending a huge amount of time of their

5350
01:19:25,510 --> 01:19:25,520
spending a huge amount of time of their
 

5351
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:26,630
spending a huge amount of time of their
time teaching

time teaching
 

5353
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:28,950
time teaching
and service like you're doing like three

5354
01:19:28,950 --> 01:19:28,960
and service like you're doing like three
 

5355
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:30,149
and service like you're doing like three
jobs yeah

5356
01:19:30,149 --> 01:19:30,159
jobs yeah
 

5357
01:19:30,159 --> 01:19:33,270
jobs yeah
and and i mean it turns

5358
01:19:33,270 --> 01:19:33,280
and and i mean it turns
 

5359
01:19:33,280 --> 01:19:35,030
and and i mean it turns
it's maybe an accident of history or

5360
01:19:35,030 --> 01:19:35,040
it's maybe an accident of history or
 

5361
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:36,709
it's maybe an accident of history or
human evolution i don't know it seems

5362
01:19:36,709 --> 01:19:36,719
human evolution i don't know it seems
 

5363
01:19:36,719 --> 01:19:37,910
human evolution i don't know it seems
like the people who are really good at

01:19:37,910 --> 01:19:37,920
like the people who are really good at

are often really good at research there

5368
01:19:40,550 --> 01:19:40,560
are often really good at research there
 

5369
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:41,830

seems to be a parallel

5370
01:19:41,830 --> 01:19:41,840
seems to be a parallel
 

5371
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:44,390
seems to be a parallel
there but like it doesn't make any sense

5372
01:19:44,390 --> 01:19:44,400
there but like it doesn't make any sense
 

5373
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:45,430
there but like it doesn't make any sense
that you should be doing that

5374
01:19:45,430 --> 01:19:45,440
that you should be doing that
 

5375
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:47,350
that you should be doing that
at the same time it also doesn't seem to

01:19:48,709 --> 01:19:48,719
make sense
 

5379
01:19:48,719 --> 01:19:53,750
make sense
that your place where you party

5380
01:19:53,750 --> 01:19:53,760
that your place where you party
 

5381
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:55,590
that your place where you party
is the same place where you go to learn

calculus or whatever the
 

5385
01:19:57,440 --> 01:19:59,910

but it's a safe space safe space for
 

5387

a safe space now by the way i feel
the need very strongly to point out that

01:20:43,830 --> 01:20:43,840
a decade or two or three or four
 

5435
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:45,830
a decade or two or three or four

i don't think that will change my

concern
 

5441
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:50,629
concern
which i think is kind of implicit in

5442
01:20:50,629 --> 01:20:50,639
which i think is kind of implicit in
 

5443
01:20:50,639 --> 01:20:51,990
which i think is kind of implicit in
some of these questions is that

5444
01:20:51,990 --> 01:20:52,000
some of these questions is that
 

5445
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:53,750
some of these questions is that
somehow we will divide the world up

5446
01:20:53,750 --> 01:20:53,760
somehow we will divide the world up
 

5447
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:55,350
somehow we will divide the world up
further uh

5448
01:20:55,350 --> 01:20:55,360
further uh

get to have that experience and there'll
 

5473
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:13,910
get to have that experience and there'll
be a small group of people who do who

worry a lot about that

5480

worry a lot about that

01:21:18,159 --> 01:21:21,430
worry a lot about that
which is why for me um and by the way

5482
01:21:21,430 --> 01:21:21,440
which is why for me um and by the way

01:21:21,440 --> 01:21:22,390
which is why for me um and by the way
here's an answer to your question about

5484
01:21:22,390 --> 01:21:22,400
here's an answer to your question about
 

5485
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:23,910
here's an answer to your question about
faculty which is why to me that you have

5486
01:21:23,910 --> 01:21:23,920
faculty which is why to me that you have
 

5487
01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:24,790
faculty which is why to me that you have
to focus on

5488
01:21:24,790 --> 01:21:24,800
to focus on
 

5489
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:26,470
to focus on
access and the mission i think the

5490
01:21:26,470 --> 01:21:26,480
access and the mission i think the
 

5491
01:21:26,480 --> 01:21:28,149
access and the mission i think the
reason whether it's good bad or strong i

5492
01:21:28,149 --> 01:21:28,159
reason whether it's good bad or strong i
 

5493
01:21:28,159 --> 01:21:29,590
reason whether it's good bad or strong i
mean i agree it's strange

5494
01:21:29,590 --> 01:21:29,600
mean i agree it's strange
 

5495
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:31,189
mean i agree it's strange
but i think it's useful to have the

5496
01:21:31,189 --> 01:21:31,199
but i think it's useful to have the
 

5497
01:21:31,199 --> 01:21:33,189
but i think it's useful to have the
faculty member particularly large r1

5498
01:21:33,189 --> 01:21:33,199
faculty member particularly large r1
 

5499

universities where

01:21:34,239 --> 01:21:38,149
universities where
we've all had experiences uh that

we've all had experiences uh that

we've all had experiences uh that
you tie what they get to do and with the

you tie what they get to do and with the

you tie what they get to do and with the
fundamental

faculty is

5512
01:21:46,950 --> 01:21:46,960
faculty is
 

5513
01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:48,870
faculty is
they love their phd students because

5514
01:21:48,870 --> 01:21:48,880
they love their phd students because
 

5515
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:50,390
they love their phd students because
they're creating they're reproducing

5516
01:21:50,390 --> 01:21:50,400
they're creating they're reproducing
 

5517
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:51,590
they're creating they're reproducing
basically right and it lets them do

5518
01:21:51,590 --> 01:21:51,600
basically right and it lets them do
 

5519
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:53,510
basically right and it lets them do
their research and multiply

5520
01:21:53,510 --> 01:21:53,520
their research and multiply
 

5521
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:55,990
their research and multiply
but they understand that the mission is

5522
01:21:55,990 --> 01:21:56,000
but they understand that the mission is
 

5523
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:57,189
but they understand that the mission is
the undergrads

5524
01:21:57,189 --> 01:21:57,199
the undergrads
 

5525
01:21:57,199 --> 01:21:59,430
the undergrads
and so they will do it without complaint

5526
01:21:59,430 --> 01:21:59,440
and so they will do it without complaint
 

5527
01:21:59,440 --> 01:22:00,310
and so they will do it without complaint
mostly

5528
01:22:00,310 --> 01:22:00,320
mostly
 

5529
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:01,750
mostly
because it's a part of the mission and

5530
01:22:01,750 --> 01:22:01,760
because it's a part of the mission and
 

5531
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:02,790
because it's a part of the mission and
why they're here and they have

5532
01:22:02,790 --> 01:22:02,800
why they're here and they have
 

5533
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:04,390
why they're here and they have
experiences with it themselves and that

5534
01:22:04,390 --> 01:22:04,400
experiences with it themselves and that
 

5535
01:22:04,400 --> 01:22:06,229
experiences with it themselves and that
it was important to get them get them

5536
01:22:06,229 --> 01:22:06,239
it was important to get them get them
 

5537
01:22:06,239 --> 01:22:07,830
it was important to get them get them
where they were going the people tend to

5538
01:22:07,830 --> 01:22:07,840
where they were going the people tend to
 

5539
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:09,270
where they were going the people tend to
get squeezed in that by the way are the

5540
01:22:09,270 --> 01:22:09,280
get squeezed in that by the way are the
 

5541
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:09,990
get squeezed in that by the way are the
master students

5542
01:22:09,990 --> 01:22:10,000
master students
 

5543
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:11,669
master students
right who are neither the phds who are

5544
01:22:11,669 --> 01:22:11,679
right who are neither the phds who are
 

5545
01:22:11,679 --> 01:22:13,270
right who are neither the phds who are
like us nor the undergrads we

5546
01:22:13,270 --> 01:22:13,280
like us nor the undergrads we
 

5547
01:22:13,280 --> 01:22:14,709
like us nor the undergrads we
we have already bought into the idea

5548
01:22:14,709 --> 01:22:14,719
we have already bought into the idea
 

5549
01:22:14,719 --> 01:22:16,390
we have already bought into the idea
that we we have to teach though

5550
01:22:16,390 --> 01:22:16,400
that we we have to teach though
 

5551
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:18,870
that we we have to teach though
that's increasingly changing anyway i

5552
01:22:18,870 --> 01:22:18,880
that's increasingly changing anyway i
 

5553
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:20,390
that's increasingly changing anyway i
think tying that mission in really

5554
01:22:20,390 --> 01:22:20,400
think tying that mission in really
 

5555
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:22,310
think tying that mission in really
matters and it gives you a way to

5556
01:22:22,310 --> 01:22:22,320
matters and it gives you a way to
 

5557
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:24,950
matters and it gives you a way to
unify people around making it an actual

5558
01:22:24,950 --> 01:22:24,960
unify people around making it an actual
 

5559
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:25,990
unify people around making it an actual
higher calling

5560
01:22:25,990 --> 01:22:26,000
higher calling
 

5561
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:27,430
higher calling
education feels like more of a higher

5562
01:22:27,430 --> 01:22:27,440
education feels like more of a higher
 

5563
01:22:27,440 --> 01:22:30,629
education feels like more of a higher
calling to me than than even research

5564
01:22:30,629 --> 01:22:30,639
calling to me than than even research
 

5565
01:22:30,639 --> 01:22:32,229
calling to me than than even research
because education you cannot treat it as

5566
01:22:32,229 --> 01:22:32,239
because education you cannot treat it as
 

5567
01:22:32,239 --> 01:22:33,750
because education you cannot treat it as
a hobby

5568
01:22:33,750 --> 01:22:33,760
a hobby
 

5569
01:22:33,760 --> 01:22:35,189
a hobby
if you're going to do it well but but

5570
01:22:35,189 --> 01:22:35,199
if you're going to do it well but but
 

5571
01:22:35,199 --> 01:22:37,110
if you're going to do it well but but
that's the that's the pushback

5572
01:22:37,110 --> 01:22:37,120
that's the that's the pushback
 

5573
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:41,030
that's the that's the pushback
on this whole system is that you should

5574
01:22:41,030 --> 01:22:41,040
on this whole system is that you should
 

5575
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:44,470
on this whole system is that you should
education be a full-time job right and

5576
01:22:44,470 --> 01:22:44,480
education be a full-time job right and
 

5577
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:45,510
education be a full-time job right and
like it's almost like

5578
01:22:45,510 --> 01:22:45,520
like it's almost like
 

5579
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:48,950
like it's almost like
research is a distraction from that

5580
01:22:48,950 --> 01:22:48,960
research is a distraction from that
 

5581
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:50,629
research is a distraction from that
yes although i think most of our

5582
01:22:50,629 --> 01:22:50,639
yes although i think most of our
 

5583
01:22:50,639 --> 01:22:52,070
yes although i think most of our
colleagues many of our colleagues would

5584
01:22:52,070 --> 01:22:52,080
colleagues many of our colleagues would
 

5585
01:22:52,080 --> 01:22:53,910
colleagues many of our colleagues would
say that research is a job and education

5586
01:22:53,910 --> 01:22:53,920
say that research is a job and education
 

5587
01:22:53,920 --> 01:22:54,229
say that research is a job and education
is

5588
01:22:54,229 --> 01:22:54,239
is
 

5589
01:22:54,239 --> 01:22:55,830
is
the distraction right but that's the

5590
01:22:55,830 --> 01:22:55,840
the distraction right but that's the
 

5591
01:22:55,840 --> 01:22:57,430
the distraction right but that's the
beautiful dance it seems to be that

5592
01:22:57,430 --> 01:22:57,440
beautiful dance it seems to be that
 

5593
01:22:57,440 --> 01:23:01,350
beautiful dance it seems to be that

i think with charles's story

5916
01:27:49,590 --> 01:27:49,600
i think with charles's story
 

5917
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:52,629
i think with charles's story
is that people respond

5918
01:27:52,629 --> 01:27:52,639
is that people respond
 

5919
01:27:52,639 --> 01:27:55,750
is that people respond
to connection right they actually feel

5920
01:27:55,750 --> 01:27:55,760
to connection right they actually feel
 

5921
01:27:55,760 --> 01:27:57,510
to connection right they actually feel
if they're if they feel connected to the

5922
01:27:57,510 --> 01:27:57,520
if they're if they feel connected to the
 

5923
01:27:57,520 --> 01:27:58,950
if they're if they feel connected to the
person teaching the class

5924
01:27:58,950 --> 01:27:58,960
person teaching the class
 

5925
01:27:58,960 --> 01:28:00,550
person teaching the class
they're more likely to go along with it

5926
01:28:00,550 --> 01:28:00,560
they're more likely to go along with it
 

5927
01:28:00,560 --> 01:28:02,229
they're more likely to go along with it
they're more they're more able to retain

5928
01:28:02,229 --> 01:28:02,239
they're more they're more able to retain
 

5929
01:28:02,239 --> 01:28:04,550
they're more they're more able to retain
information they're more motivated to be

5930
01:28:04,550 --> 01:28:04,560
information they're more motivated to be
 

5931
01:28:04,560 --> 01:28:07,750
information they're more motivated to be
involved in the class in some way and

5932
01:28:07,750 --> 01:28:07,760
involved in the class in some way and
 

5933
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:10,149
involved in the class in some way and
and that really matters it people can

5934
01:28:10,149 --> 01:28:10,159
and that really matters it people can
 

5935
01:28:10,159 --> 01:28:11,270
and that really matters it people can
mean to the human

5936
01:28:11,270 --> 01:28:11,280
mean to the human
 

5937
01:28:11,280 --> 01:28:14,070

themselves yeah so can't you do that

5938
01:28:14,070 --> 01:28:14,080
themselves yeah so can't you do that
 

5939
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:17,350

actually perhaps more effectively

5940
01:28:17,350 --> 01:28:17,360
actually perhaps more effectively
 

5941
01:28:17,360 --> 01:28:19,270
actually perhaps more effectively

there's no difference between how they

is the situation they're in and i think

is the situation they're in and i think
 

5993
01:29:07,280 --> 01:29:09,350
is the situation they're in and i think
the last lack of connection it's not

01:29:09,350 --> 01:29:09,360
the last lack of connection it's not
 

5995
01:29:09,360 --> 01:29:10,550
the last lack of connection it's not
whether they're learning anything they

5996
01:29:10,550 --> 01:29:10,560
whether they're learning anything they
 

5997
01:29:10,560 --> 01:29:11,830
whether they're learning anything they
seem to think they're learning something

seem to think they're learning something
 

5999
01:29:11,840 --> 01:29:12,790
seem to think they're learning something
anyway

6000
01:29:12,790 --> 01:29:12,800
anyway
 

6001
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:14,390
anyway
right in fact they seem to think they're

6002
01:29:14,390 --> 01:29:14,400
right in fact they seem to think they're
 

6003
01:29:14,400 --> 01:29:15,910
right in fact they seem to think they're
learning it equally well

6004
01:29:15,910 --> 01:29:15,920
learning it equally well
 

6005
01:29:15,920 --> 01:29:19,350
learning it equally well
uh presumably because the faculty are

6006
01:29:19,350 --> 01:29:19,360
uh presumably because the faculty are
 

6007
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:20,470
uh presumably because the faculty are
putting in

6008
01:29:20,470 --> 01:29:20,480
putting in
 

6009
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:22,550
putting in
or the instructors more generally

speaking are putting in
 

6013
01:29:24,080 --> 01:29:26,709
speaking are putting in
uh the energy and effort to try to make

6014
01:29:26,709 --> 01:29:26,719
uh the energy and effort to try to make
 

6015
01:29:26,719 --> 01:29:27,830
uh the energy and effort to try to make
certain that they're

6016
01:29:27,830 --> 01:29:27,840
certain that they're

what they've curated can be expressed to

6018
01:29:29,510 --> 01:29:29,520
what they've curated can be expressed to
 

6019
01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:31,270
what they've curated can be expressed to
them in a useful way but the connection

6020
01:29:31,270 --> 01:29:31,280
them in a useful way but the connection
 

6021
01:29:31,280 --> 01:29:32,470
them in a useful way but the connection
is missing and so there's huge

6022
01:29:32,470 --> 01:29:32,480
is missing and so there's huge
 

6023
01:29:32,480 --> 01:29:33,270
is missing and so there's huge
differences in

6024
01:29:33,270 --> 01:29:33,280
differences in
 

6025
01:29:33,280 --> 01:29:34,709
differences in
what they prefer and as far as i can

6026
01:29:34,709 --> 01:29:34,719
what they prefer and as far as i can
 

6027
01:29:34,719 --> 01:29:36,470
what they prefer and as far as i can
tell what they prefer is more connection

6028
01:29:36,470 --> 01:29:36,480
tell what they prefer is more connection
 

6029
01:29:36,480 --> 01:29:38,229
tell what they prefer is more connection
not less that connection just doesn't

a machine learning class on campus you
 

6039
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:45,270
a machine learning class on campus you
know why

6040
01:29:45,270 --> 01:29:45,280
know why
 

6041
01:29:45,280 --> 01:29:48,629

01:32:58,639 --> 01:32:59,189
watching it and that there's value in
that

6252
01:32:59,189 --> 01:32:59,199
that
 

6253
01:32:59,199 --> 01:33:02,709
that
and then i think just but it scales

6254
01:33:02,709 --> 01:33:02,719
and then i think just but it scales
 

6255
01:33:02,719 --> 01:33:03,189
and then i think just but it scales
better on

6256
01:33:03,189 --> 01:33:03,199
better on
 

6257
01:33:03,199 --> 01:33:05,510
better on
right i feel like we're having a

were well into adulthood by the time
 

6311
01:33:54,080 --> 01:33:54,870
were well into adulthood by the time
this was true right

this was true right
 

6313
01:33:54,880 --> 01:33:56,390
this was true right
so it's just a very different it was

6314
01:33:56,390 --> 01:33:56,400
so it's just a very different it was
 

6315
01:33:56,400 --> 01:33:57,669
so it's just a very different it was
it's very different so what the what

it's very different so what the what
 

6317
01:33:57,679 --> 01:33:58,790
it's very different so what the what
we're we've been experiencing in the

6318
01:33:58,790 --> 01:33:58,800
we're we've been experiencing in the
 

6319
01:33:58,800 --> 01:34:00,149
we're we've been experiencing in the
last 10 years is not like

01:34:00,149 --> 01:34:00,159
last 10 years is not like
 

6321
01:34:00,159 --> 01:34:01,990
last 10 years is not like
the majority of human history but more

importantly concerts right

6324
01:34:03,430 --> 01:34:03,440

6325
01:34:03,440 --> 01:34:04,950
importantly concerts right
concerts mean something different most

6326
01:34:04,950 --> 01:34:04,960
concerts mean something different most
 

6327
01:34:04,960 --> 01:34:07,030
concerts mean something different most
people don't go to concerts

6328
01:34:07,030 --> 01:34:07,040

6329
01:34:07,040 --> 01:34:08,870
people don't go to concerts
anymore like there's an age where you

6330
01:34:08,870 --> 01:34:08,880
anymore like there's an age where you
 

6331
01:34:08,880 --> 01:34:10,390
anymore like there's an age where you
care about it you sort of stop doing it

6332
01:34:10,390 --> 01:34:10,400
care about it you sort of stop doing it

so i think that's a
 

6337
01:34:16,960 --> 01:34:21,030
so i think that's a
painful way of saying that um

6338
01:34:21,030 --> 01:34:21,040

 

6339
01:34:21,040 --> 01:34:23,270

uh
it's it's possible to argue that uh if

6368
01:34:49,830 --> 01:34:49,840
it's it's possible to argue that uh if
 

6369
01:34:49,840 --> 01:34:51,189
it's it's possible to argue that uh if
you look at the data

6370
01:34:51,189 --> 01:34:51,199
you look at the data
 

6371
01:34:51,199 --> 01:34:54,390
you look at the data
uh that it just expanded the pie of what

6372

pie
 

6389
01:35:09,600 --> 01:35:11,510
pie

sort of pursue it for a little while the
 

6859
01:42:17,280 --> 01:42:18,390
sort of pursue it for a little while the
worst thing that will happen is you took

6860
01:42:18,390 --> 01:42:18,400
worst thing that will happen is you took
 

6861
01:42:18,400 --> 01:42:19,910
worst thing that will happen is you took
a left turn instead of a right turn

6862

a left turn instead of a right turn
 

6863

and you ended up merely happy beautiful
 

6865
01:42:23,520 --> 01:42:26,629

i'm quite happy but there was a reason
 

6901
01:43:06,800 --> 01:43:08,709
i'm quite happy but there was a reason
for that too right like i wasn't wearing

6902
01:43:08,709 --> 01:43:08,719
for that too right like i wasn't wearing

for that too right like i wasn't wearing
something right there was a reason for

something right there was a reason for
 

6905
01:43:10,080 --> 01:43:11,030
something right there was a reason for
that i can't remember what it was no i

anyway the right thing happened
 

6913
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:17,750
anyway the right thing happened
exactly you took the left turn and then

6914
01:43:17,750 --> 01:43:17,760
exactly you took the left turn and then
 

6915
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:18,870
exactly you took the left turn and then
the third of the right ended up being

6916
01:43:18,870 --> 01:43:18,880
the third of the right ended up being
 

6917
01:43:18,880 --> 01:43:19,430
the third of the right ended up being
the right thing

6918
01:43:19,430 --> 01:43:19,440
the right thing
 

6919
01:43:19,440 --> 01:43:21,750
the right thing

and start small learn the building

6990
01:44:27,350 --> 01:44:27,360
and start small learn the building
 

6991
01:44:27,360 --> 01:44:28,870
and start small learn the building
blocks and hours take the time

6992
01:44:28,870 --> 01:44:28,880
blocks and hours take the time
 

6993

rhythm game i was in grad school

6996
01:44:32,229 --> 01:44:32,239
rhythm game i was in grad school
 

6997
01:44:32,239 --> 01:44:34,390
rhythm game i was in grad school
when i suddenly woke up one day over the

royal east
um and i thought wait a minute i'm a

7002
01:44:37,270 --> 01:44:37,280
um and i thought wait a minute i'm a
 

7003
01:44:37,280 --> 01:44:38,310
um and i thought wait a minute i'm a
computer scientist i should be able to

7004
01:44:38,310 --> 01:44:38,320
computer scientist i should be able to
 

7005
01:44:38,320 --> 01:44:40,550
computer scientist i should be able to
write pac-man in an afternoon and i did

7006
01:44:40,550 --> 01:44:40,560
write pac-man in an afternoon and i did
 

7007
01:44:40,560 --> 01:44:42,229
write pac-man in an afternoon and i did
not with great graphics it was actually

7008
01:44:42,229 --> 01:44:42,239
not with great graphics it was actually
 

7009
01:44:42,239 --> 01:44:43,750
not with great graphics it was actually
a very cool game i had to figure out how

7010
01:44:43,750 --> 01:44:43,760
a very cool game i had to figure out how
 

7011
01:44:43,760 --> 01:44:45,350
a very cool game i had to figure out how
the ghost moved and everything and i did

7012
01:44:45,350 --> 01:44:45,360
the ghost moved and everything and i did
 

7013
01:44:45,360 --> 01:44:47,189
the ghost moved and everything and i did
it in an afternoon in pascal

7014
01:44:47,189 --> 01:44:47,199
it in an afternoon in pascal
 

7015
01:44:47,199 --> 01:44:50,470
it in an afternoon in pascal
on an old apple 2gs um but if i had

7016
01:44:50,470 --> 01:44:50,480
on an old apple 2gs um but if i had
 

7017
01:44:50,480 --> 01:44:52,390
on an old apple 2gs um but if i had
started out trying to build pac-man

7018
01:44:52,390 --> 01:44:52,400
started out trying to build pac-man
 

7019
01:44:52,400 --> 01:44:54,149
started out trying to build pac-man
i think it probably would have ended

7020
01:44:54,149 --> 01:44:54,159
i think it probably would have ended
 

7021
01:44:54,159 --> 01:44:55,910
i think it probably would have ended
very poorly for me luckily back then

7022
01:44:55,910 --> 01:44:55,920
very poorly for me luckily back then
 

7023
01:44:55,920 --> 01:44:57,590

7091
01:45:50,880 --> 01:45:52,790

but if you have to pick a programming

7092
01:45:52,790 --> 01:45:52,800
but if you have to pick a programming
 

7093
01:45:52,800 --> 01:45:53,910
but if you have to pick a programming
language i guess

7094

better syntax blasphemy yeah
 

7101
01:46:01,679 --> 01:46:03,830
better syntax blasphemy yeah
see with c syntax how about that so

7102
01:46:03,830 --> 01:46:03,840
see with c syntax how about that so
 

7103
01:46:03,840 --> 01:46:05,270
see with c syntax how about that so
you're going to argue that c syntax is

01:46:05,270 --> 01:46:05,280
you're going to argue that c syntax is
 

7105
01:46:05,280 --> 01:46:06,229
you're going to argue that c syntax is
better than

01:47:16,229 --> 01:47:16,239
and figure out what it is or do you
 

7185
01:47:16,239 --> 01:47:17,990
and figure out what it is or do you
already know what you want

7186
01:47:17,990 --> 01:47:18,000
already know what you want
 

7187
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:19,109
already know what you want
and that's why i asked you what stage of

7188
01:47:19,109 --> 01:47:19,119
and that's why i asked you what stage of
 

7189
01:47:19,119 --> 01:47:20,229
and that's why i asked you what stage of
life people are in because if you're

7190
01:47:20,229 --> 01:47:20,239
life people are in because if you're
 

7191
01:47:20,239 --> 01:47:21,510
life people are in because if you're
different stages of life you

7192
01:47:21,510 --> 01:47:21,520
different stages of life you
 

7193
01:47:21,520 --> 01:47:22,550
different stages of life you
you would you would attack it

7194
01:47:22,550 --> 01:47:22,560
you would you would attack it
 

7195
01:47:22,560 --> 01:47:24,149
you would you would attack it
differently the the answer to that

7196
01:47:24,149 --> 01:47:24,159
differently the the answer to that
 

7197
01:47:24,159 --> 01:47:25,590
differently the the answer to that
question of which language keeps

7198
01:47:25,590 --> 01:47:25,600
question of which language keeps
 

7199
01:47:25,600 --> 01:47:27,430
question of which language keeps
changing i mean there's some

7200
01:47:27,430 --> 01:47:27,440
changing i mean there's some
 

7201
01:47:27,440 --> 01:47:31,030
changing i mean there's some
value to exploring uh a lot of people

7202
01:47:31,030 --> 01:47:31,040
value to exploring uh a lot of people
 

7203
01:47:31,040 --> 01:47:33,189
value to exploring uh a lot of people
write to me about julia there's there's

7204
01:47:33,189 --> 01:47:33,199
write to me about julia there's there's
 

7205
01:47:33,199 --> 01:47:35,270
write to me about julia there's there's
these like more modern languages they

7206
01:47:35,270 --> 01:47:35,280
these like more modern languages they
 

7207
01:47:35,280 --> 01:47:37,350
these like more modern languages they
keep being invented rust and

7208
01:47:37,350 --> 01:47:37,360
keep being invented rust and
 

7209
01:47:37,360 --> 01:47:41,189
keep being invented rust and
and kotlin and there's stuff that uh

7210
01:47:41,189 --> 01:47:41,199
and kotlin and there's stuff that uh
 

7211
01:47:41,199 --> 01:47:43,189
and kotlin and there's stuff that uh
for people who love functional languages

7212
01:47:43,189 --> 01:47:43,199
for people who love functional languages
 

7213
01:47:43,199 --> 01:47:45,030
for people who love functional languages
like lisp

7214
01:47:45,030 --> 01:47:45,040
like lisp
 

7215
01:47:45,040 --> 01:47:46,790
like lisp
there apparently there's echoes of that

7216
01:47:46,790 --> 01:47:46,800
there apparently there's echoes of that
 

7217
01:47:46,800 --> 01:47:48,149
there apparently there's echoes of that
but much better

7218
01:47:48,149 --> 01:47:48,159
but much better
 

7219
01:47:48,159 --> 01:47:49,830
but much better
in the modern languages and it's

7220
01:47:49,830 --> 01:47:49,840
in the modern languages and it's
 

7221
01:47:49,840 --> 01:47:51,750
in the modern languages and it's
worthwhile to uh

7222
01:47:51,750 --> 01:47:51,760
worthwhile to uh
 

7223
01:47:51,760 --> 01:47:52,790
worthwhile to uh
especially when you're learning

7224
01:47:52,790 --> 01:47:52,800
especially when you're learning
 

7225
01:47:52,800 --> 01:47:55,030
especially when you're learning
languages it feels like it's okay to try

7226
01:47:55,030 --> 01:47:55,040
languages it feels like it's okay to try
 

7227
01:47:55,040 --> 01:47:56,470
languages it feels like it's okay to try
one that's not

7228
01:47:56,470 --> 01:47:56,480
one that's not
 

7229
01:47:56,480 --> 01:47:58,470
one that's not
like the popular one oh yeah but you

7230
01:47:58,470 --> 01:47:58,480
like the popular one oh yeah but you
 

7231
01:47:58,480 --> 01:47:59,910
like the popular one oh yeah but you
know you i think you get that

7232
01:47:59,910 --> 01:47:59,920
know you i think you get that
 

7233
01:47:59,920 --> 01:48:02,550
know you i think you get that
you get that way of thinking almost no

7234
01:48:02,550 --> 01:48:02,560
you get that way of thinking almost no
 

7235
01:48:02,560 --> 01:48:04,470
you get that way of thinking almost no
matter what language

7236
01:48:04,470 --> 01:48:04,480
matter what language
 

7237
01:48:04,480 --> 01:48:06,550
matter what language
and if you if you push far enough like

7238
01:48:06,550 --> 01:48:06,560
and if you if you push far enough like
 

7239
01:48:06,560 --> 01:48:07,910
and if you if you push far enough like
it can be assembly language

7240
01:48:07,910 --> 01:48:07,920
it can be assembly language
 

7241
01:48:07,920 --> 01:48:09,750
it can be assembly language
but you need to push pretty far before

7242
01:48:09,750 --> 01:48:09,760
but you need to push pretty far before
 

7243
01:48:09,760 --> 01:48:10,950
but you need to push pretty far before
you start to hit the really deep

7244
01:48:10,950 --> 01:48:10,960
you start to hit the really deep
 

7245
01:48:10,960 --> 01:48:12,470
you start to hit the really deep
concepts that you would get sooner in

7246
01:48:12,470 --> 01:48:12,480
concepts that you would get sooner in
 

7247
01:48:12,480 --> 01:48:13,270
concepts that you would get sooner in
other languages

7248
01:48:13,270 --> 01:48:13,280
other languages
 

7249
01:48:13,280 --> 01:48:15,350
other languages
but like i don't know computation is

7250
01:48:15,350 --> 01:48:15,360
but like i don't know computation is
 

7251
01:48:15,360 --> 01:48:16,550
but like i don't know computation is
kind of computation

7252
01:48:16,550 --> 01:48:16,560
kind of computation
 

7253
01:48:16,560 --> 01:48:18,629
kind of computation
it's kind of touring equivalent is kind

7254
01:48:18,629 --> 01:48:18,639
it's kind of touring equivalent is kind
 

7255
01:48:18,639 --> 01:48:20,629
it's kind of touring equivalent is kind
of computation and so it's so

7256
01:48:20,629 --> 01:48:20,639
of computation and so it's so
 

7257
01:48:20,639 --> 01:48:22,229
of computation and so it's so
it matters how you express things but

7258
01:48:22,229 --> 01:48:22,239
it matters how you express things but
 

7259
01:48:22,239 --> 01:48:23,830
it matters how you express things but
you have to build out that mental

7260
01:48:23,830 --> 01:48:23,840
you have to build out that mental
 

7261
01:48:23,840 --> 01:48:24,390
you have to build out that mental
structure

7262
01:48:24,390 --> 01:48:24,400
structure
 

7263
01:48:24,400 --> 01:48:26,870
structure
in your mind and you i don't i don't

7264
01:48:26,870 --> 01:48:26,880
in your mind and you i don't i don't
 

7265
01:48:26,880 --> 01:48:28,709
in your mind and you i don't i don't
think it super matters which language

7266
01:48:28,709 --> 01:48:28,719
think it super matters which language
 

7267
01:48:28,719 --> 01:48:30,310
think it super matters which language
i mean it matters a little because some

7268
01:48:30,310 --> 01:48:30,320
i mean it matters a little because some
 

7269
01:48:30,320 --> 01:48:31,669
i mean it matters a little because some
things are just at the wrong level of

7270
01:48:31,669 --> 01:48:31,679
things are just at the wrong level of
 

7271
01:48:31,679 --> 01:48:32,870
things are just at the wrong level of
abstraction i think assembly's at the

7272
01:48:32,870 --> 01:48:32,880
abstraction i think assembly's at the
 

7273
01:48:32,880 --> 01:48:34,149
abstraction i think assembly's at the
wrong level abstraction for someone

7274
01:48:34,149 --> 01:48:34,159
wrong level abstraction for someone

quite a bit um you got to get to the

7284
01:48:43,350 --> 01:48:43,360
quite a bit um you got to get to the
 

7285
01:48:43,360 --> 01:48:44,790
quite a bit um you got to get to the
point where i want to learn any language

7286
01:48:44,790 --> 01:48:44,800
point where i want to learn any language
 

7287
01:48:44,800 --> 01:48:46,070
point where i want to learn any language
means i just pick up a reference book

7288
01:48:46,070 --> 01:48:46,080
means i just pick up a reference book
 

7289
01:48:46,080 --> 01:48:46,390
means i just pick up a reference book
and

7290
01:48:46,390 --> 01:48:46,400
and
 

7291
01:48:46,400 --> 01:48:48,310
and
i think of a project and i go through it

7292
01:48:48,310 --> 01:48:48,320
i think of a project and i go through it
 

7293
01:48:48,320 --> 01:48:49,830
i think of a project and i go through it
in the weekend right you got it you got

7294
01:48:49,830 --> 01:48:49,840
in the weekend right you got it you got
 

7295
01:48:49,840 --> 01:48:51,189
in the weekend right you got it you got
to get there you're right though

7296
01:48:51,189 --> 01:48:51,199
to get there you're right though
 

7297
01:48:51,199 --> 01:48:52,629
to get there you're right though
the languages that are designed for that

7298
01:48:52,629 --> 01:48:52,639
the languages that are designed for that
 

7299
01:48:52,639 --> 01:48:55,189
the languages that are designed for that
are it almost doesn't matter pick the

7300
01:48:55,189 --> 01:48:55,199
are it almost doesn't matter pick the
 

7301
01:48:55,199 --> 01:48:56,470
are it almost doesn't matter pick the
ones that people have

7302
01:48:56,470 --> 01:48:56,480
ones that people have
 

7303
01:48:56,480 --> 01:48:58,310
ones that people have
built tutorials and infrastructure

7304
01:48:58,310 --> 01:48:58,320
built tutorials and infrastructure
 

7305
01:48:58,320 --> 01:48:59,669
built tutorials and infrastructure
around to help you get kind of

7306
01:48:59,669 --> 01:48:59,679
around to help you get kind of
 

7307
01:48:59,679 --> 01:49:01,270
around to help you get kind of
kind of eased into it because it's hard

7308
01:49:01,270 --> 01:49:01,280
kind of eased into it because it's hard
 

7309
01:49:01,280 --> 01:49:02,550
kind of eased into it because it's hard
i mean we i did this little experiment

7310
01:49:02,550 --> 01:49:02,560
i mean we i did this little experiment
 

7311
01:49:02,560 --> 01:49:03,910
i mean we i did this little experiment
once

7312
01:49:03,910 --> 01:49:03,920
once
 

7313
01:49:03,920 --> 01:49:07,189
once
um i was teaching intro to cs in the

7314
01:49:07,189 --> 01:49:07,199
um i was teaching intro to cs in the
 

7315
01:49:07,199 --> 01:49:08,790
um i was teaching intro to cs in the
summer as a favor

7316
01:49:08,790 --> 01:49:08,800
summer as a favor
 

7317
01:49:08,800 --> 01:49:12,629
summer as a favor
uh which is anyway i was using

7318
01:49:12,629 --> 01:49:12,639
uh which is anyway i was using
 

7319
01:49:12,639 --> 01:49:14,629
uh which is anyway i was using
memories i was teaching introduces a

7320
01:49:14,629 --> 01:49:14,639
memories i was teaching introduces a
 

7321
01:49:14,639 --> 01:49:16,070
memories i was teaching introduces a
favor it was very funny because i'd go

7322
01:49:16,070 --> 01:49:16,080
favor it was very funny because i'd go
 

7323
01:49:16,080 --> 01:49:17,510
favor it was very funny because i'd go
in every single time and i would think

7324
01:49:17,510 --> 01:49:17,520
in every single time and i would think
 

7325
01:49:17,520 --> 01:49:18,709
in every single time and i would think
to myself

7326
01:49:18,709 --> 01:49:18,719
to myself
 

7327
01:49:18,719 --> 01:49:20,149
to myself
how am i possibly going to fill up an

7328
01:49:20,149 --> 01:49:20,159
how am i possibly going to fill up an
 

7329
01:49:20,159 --> 01:49:22,470
how am i possibly going to fill up an
hour and a half talking about for loops

7330
01:49:22,470 --> 01:49:22,480
hour and a half talking about for loops
 

7331
01:49:22,480 --> 01:49:22,950
hour and a half talking about for loops
right

7332
01:49:22,950 --> 01:49:22,960
right
 

7333
01:49:22,960 --> 01:49:25,350
right
and there wasn't enough time it took me

7334
01:49:25,350 --> 01:49:25,360
and there wasn't enough time it took me
 

7335
01:49:25,360 --> 01:49:26,550
and there wasn't enough time it took me
a while to realize this right

7336
01:49:26,550 --> 01:49:26,560
a while to realize this right
 

7337
01:49:26,560 --> 01:49:27,750
a while to realize this right
there are only three things right

7338
01:49:27,750 --> 01:49:27,760
there are only three things right
 

7339
01:49:27,760 --> 01:49:29,270
there are only three things right
there's reading from a variable writing

7340
01:49:29,270 --> 01:49:29,280
there's reading from a variable writing
 

7341
01:49:29,280 --> 01:49:31,430
there's reading from a variable writing
to a variable in conditional branching

7342
01:49:31,430 --> 01:49:31,440
to a variable in conditional branching
 

7343
01:49:31,440 --> 01:49:33,910
to a variable in conditional branching
everything else is syntactic sugar right

7344
01:49:33,910 --> 01:49:33,920
everything else is syntactic sugar right
 

7345
01:49:33,920 --> 01:49:35,589
everything else is syntactic sugar right
the syntactic sugar matters but that's

7346
01:49:35,589 --> 01:49:35,599
the syntactic sugar matters but that's
 

7347
01:49:35,599 --> 01:49:35,990
the syntactic sugar matters but that's
it

7348
01:49:35,990 --> 01:49:36,000
it
 

7349
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,070
it
and when i say that's it i don't mean

7350
01:49:38,070 --> 01:49:38,080
and when i say that's it i don't mean
 

7351
01:49:38,080 --> 01:49:39,990
and when i say that's it i don't mean
it's simple i mean it's hard

7352
01:49:39,990 --> 01:49:40,000
it's simple i mean it's hard
 

7353
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,550
it's simple i mean it's hard

those are really hard concepts so you
 

7359
01:49:45,440 --> 01:49:47,270
those are really hard concepts so you
shouldn't be discouraged by this here's

right i thought

7422
01:50:52,390 --> 01:50:52,400
right i thought
 

7423
01:50:52,400 --> 01:50:54,310
right i thought
and i kind of asked the question and i i

7424
01:50:54,310 --> 01:50:54,320
and i kind of asked the question and i i
 

7425
01:50:54,320 --> 01:50:55,589
and i kind of asked the question and i i
think had some evidence for this

7426
01:50:55,589 --> 01:50:55,599
think had some evidence for this

7483
01:51:40,639 --> 01:51:44,330
equal eq
and equal in lisp yeah i know you do

7484
01:51:44,330 --> 01:51:44,340
and equal in lisp yeah i know you do
 

7485
01:51:44,340 --> 01:51:45,910
and equal in lisp yeah i know you do
[Laughter]

7486
01:51:45,910 --> 01:51:45,920
[Laughter]
 

7487
01:51:45,920 --> 01:51:47,510
[Laughter]
but you know you could do that it's this

7488
01:51:47,510 --> 01:51:47,520
but you know you could do that it's this
 

7489
01:51:47,520 --> 01:51:49,030
but you know you could do that it's this
is actually really hard stuff

7490
01:51:49,030 --> 01:51:49,040
is actually really hard stuff
 

7491
01:51:49,040 --> 01:51:51,669
is actually really hard stuff
so you shouldn't be it's not too hard we

7492
01:51:51,669 --> 01:51:51,679
so you shouldn't be it's not too hard we
 

7493
01:51:51,679 --> 01:51:52,950
so you shouldn't be it's not too hard we
all do it but you shouldn't be

7494
01:51:52,950 --> 01:51:52,960
all do it but you shouldn't be
 

7495
01:51:52,960 --> 01:51:54,629
all do it but you shouldn't be
discouraged it's why you should start

7496
01:51:54,629 --> 01:51:54,639
discouraged it's why you should start
 

7497
01:51:54,639 --> 01:51:55,189
discouraged it's why you should start

01:51:55,199 --> 01:51:56,470
small
so that you can figure out these things

7500
01:51:56,470 --> 01:51:56,480
so that you can figure out these things
 

7501
01:51:56,480 --> 01:51:58,229
so that you can figure out these things
you have the right model in your head

01:51:58,229 --> 01:51:58,239
you have the right model in your head
 

7503
01:51:58,239 --> 01:51:59,990
you have the right model in your head
so that when you write the language you

7504
01:51:59,990 --> 01:52:00,000
so that when you write the language you
 

7505
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:01,910
so that when you write the language you
can execute it and build the machine

7506
01:52:01,910 --> 01:52:01,920
can execute it and build the machine
 

7507
01:52:01,920 --> 01:52:03,430
can execute it and build the machine
that you you want to build right yeah

7508
01:52:03,430 --> 01:52:03,440
that you you want to build right yeah
 

7509
01:52:03,440 --> 01:52:05,030
that you you want to build right yeah
the funny thing about programming

7510
01:52:05,030 --> 01:52:05,040
the funny thing about programming
 

7511
01:52:05,040 --> 01:52:07,990
the funny thing about programming
on those very basic things is the the

7512
01:52:07,990 --> 01:52:08,000
on those very basic things is the the
 

7513
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:09,830
on those very basic things is the the
the very basics are not often made

7514
01:52:09,830 --> 01:52:09,840
the very basics are not often made
 

7515
01:52:09,840 --> 01:52:11,030
the very basics are not often made
explicit

7516
01:52:11,030 --> 01:52:11,040
explicit
 

7517
01:52:11,040 --> 01:52:13,510
explicit
which is actually what drives everybody

7518
01:52:13,510 --> 01:52:13,520
which is actually what drives everybody
 

7519
01:52:13,520 --> 01:52:14,149
which is actually what drives everybody
away from

7520
01:52:14,149 --> 01:52:14,159
away from
 

7521
01:52:14,159 --> 01:52:15,830
away from
basically any discipline but program is

7522
01:52:15,830 --> 01:52:15,840
basically any discipline but program is
 

7523
01:52:15,840 --> 01:52:17,910
basically any discipline but program is
just another one like even a simpler

7524
01:52:17,910 --> 01:52:17,920
just another one like even a simpler
 

7525
01:52:17,920 --> 01:52:20,070
just another one like even a simpler
version of the equal sign that i kind of

7526
01:52:20,070 --> 01:52:20,080
version of the equal sign that i kind of
 

7527
01:52:20,080 --> 01:52:21,350
version of the equal sign that i kind of
forget

7528
01:52:21,350 --> 01:52:21,360
forget
 

7529
01:52:21,360 --> 01:52:24,470
forget
is in mathematics equals is not

7530
01:52:24,470 --> 01:52:24,480
is in mathematics equals is not
 

7531
01:52:24,480 --> 01:52:25,350
is in mathematics equals is not
assignment

7532
01:52:25,350 --> 01:52:25,360
assignment
 

7533
01:52:25,360 --> 01:52:29,030
assignment
yeah right like i think basically every

7534
01:52:29,030 --> 01:52:29,040
yeah right like i think basically every
 

7535
01:52:29,040 --> 01:52:31,189
yeah right like i think basically every
single programming language with just a

7536
01:52:31,189 --> 01:52:31,199
single programming language with just a
 

7537
01:52:31,199 --> 01:52:31,830
single programming language with just a
few

7538
01:52:31,830 --> 01:52:31,840
few
 

7539
01:52:31,840 --> 01:52:33,910
few
handful of exceptions equals his

7540
01:52:33,910 --> 01:52:33,920
handful of exceptions equals his
 

7541
01:52:33,920 --> 01:52:34,950
handful of exceptions equals his
assignment

7542
01:52:34,950 --> 01:52:34,960
assignment
 

7543
01:52:34,960 --> 01:52:37,350
assignment
and you have some other operator for uh

7544
01:52:37,350 --> 01:52:37,360
and you have some other operator for uh
 

7545
01:52:37,360 --> 01:52:38,149
and you have some other operator for uh
equality

7546
01:52:38,149 --> 01:52:38,159
equality
 

7547
01:52:38,159 --> 01:52:40,390
equality
yeah and you know even that like

7548
01:52:40,390 --> 01:52:40,400
yeah and you know even that like
 

7549
01:52:40,400 --> 01:52:42,550
yeah and you know even that like
everyone kind of knows it

7550
01:52:42,550 --> 01:52:42,560
everyone kind of knows it
 

7551
01:52:42,560 --> 01:52:45,350
everyone kind of knows it
once you started doing it but like you

7552
01:52:45,350 --> 01:52:45,360
once you started doing it but like you
 

7553
01:52:45,360 --> 01:52:47,830
once you started doing it but like you
need to say that explicitly or you just

7554
01:52:47,830 --> 01:52:47,840
need to say that explicitly or you just
 

7555
01:52:47,840 --> 01:52:51,109
need to say that explicitly or you just
realize it like yourself

7556
01:52:51,109 --> 01:52:51,119
realize it like yourself
 

7557
01:52:51,119 --> 01:52:52,790
realize it like yourself
otherwise you'll be you might be stuck

7558
01:52:52,790 --> 01:52:52,800
otherwise you'll be you might be stuck
 

7559
01:52:52,800 --> 01:52:54,709
otherwise you'll be you might be stuck
for you said like half a semester you

7560
01:52:54,709 --> 01:52:54,719
for you said like half a semester you
 

7561
01:52:54,719 --> 01:52:57,109
for you said like half a semester you
could be stuck for quite a long time

7562
01:52:57,109 --> 01:52:57,119
could be stuck for quite a long time
 

7563
01:52:57,119 --> 01:53:00,229
could be stuck for quite a long time
and i think also part of the programming

7564
01:53:00,229 --> 01:53:00,239
and i think also part of the programming
 

7565
01:53:00,239 --> 01:53:03,830
and i think also part of the programming
is being okay in that state of confusion

7566
01:53:03,830 --> 01:53:03,840
is being okay in that state of confusion
 

7567
01:53:03,840 --> 01:53:05,990
is being okay in that state of confusion
for a while it's it's to the debugging

7568
01:53:05,990 --> 01:53:06,000
for a while it's it's to the debugging
 

7569
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:07,189
for a while it's it's to the debugging
point it's like

7570
01:53:07,189 --> 01:53:07,199
point it's like
 

7571
01:53:07,199 --> 01:53:09,990
point it's like
i just wrote two lines of code why

7572
01:53:09,990 --> 01:53:10,000
i just wrote two lines of code why
 

7573
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:11,910
i just wrote two lines of code why
doesn't this work and staring at that

7574
01:53:11,910 --> 01:53:11,920
doesn't this work and staring at that
 

7575
01:53:11,920 --> 01:53:12,550
doesn't this work and staring at that
for like

7576
01:53:12,550 --> 01:53:12,560
for like
 

7577
01:53:12,560 --> 01:53:15,750
for like
hours and trying to figure out

7578
01:53:15,750 --> 01:53:15,760
hours and trying to figure out
 

7579
01:53:15,760 --> 01:53:17,109
hours and trying to figure out
and then every once in a while you just

7580
01:53:17,109 --> 01:53:17,119
and then every once in a while you just
 

7581
01:53:17,119 --> 01:53:18,470
and then every once in a while you just
have to restart your computer and

7582
01:53:18,470 --> 01:53:18,480
have to restart your computer and
 

7583
01:53:18,480 --> 01:53:19,510
have to restart your computer and
everything works again

7584
01:53:19,510 --> 01:53:19,520
everything works again
 

7585
01:53:19,520 --> 01:53:22,390
everything works again
and then and then you just kind of stare

7586
01:53:22,390 --> 01:53:22,400
and then and then you just kind of stare
 

7587
01:53:22,400 --> 01:53:23,589
and then and then you just kind of stare
into the

7588
01:53:23,589 --> 01:53:23,599
into the
 

7589
01:53:23,599 --> 01:53:25,910
into the
void with the tear slowly rolling down

7590
01:53:25,910 --> 01:53:25,920
void with the tear slowly rolling down
 

7591
01:53:25,920 --> 01:53:27,430
void with the tear slowly rolling down
your eye by the way the fact that they

7592
01:53:27,430 --> 01:53:27,440
your eye by the way the fact that they
 

7593
01:53:27,440 --> 01:53:28,149
your eye by the way the fact that they
didn't get this

7594
01:53:28,149 --> 01:53:28,159
didn't get this
 

7595
01:53:28,159 --> 01:53:30,390
didn't get this
actually had no impact on i mean they

7596
01:53:30,390 --> 01:53:30,400
actually had no impact on i mean they
 

7597
01:53:30,400 --> 01:53:31,350
actually had no impact on i mean they
were still able to redo their

7598
01:53:31,350 --> 01:53:31,360
were still able to redo their
 

7599
01:53:31,360 --> 01:53:32,229
were still able to redo their
assignments right

7600
01:53:32,229 --> 01:53:32,239
assignments right
 

7601
01:53:32,239 --> 01:53:33,270
assignments right
because it turns out their

7602
01:53:33,270 --> 01:53:33,280
because it turns out their
 

7603
01:53:33,280 --> 01:53:36,310
because it turns out their
misunderstanding wasn't being revealed

7604
01:53:36,310 --> 01:53:36,320
misunderstanding wasn't being revealed
 

7605
01:53:36,320 --> 01:53:36,790
misunderstanding wasn't being revealed
to them

7606
01:53:36,790 --> 01:53:36,800
to them
 

7607
01:53:36,800 --> 01:53:40,229
to them
yes by the problem sets we were

7608
01:53:40,229 --> 01:53:40,239
yes by the problem sets we were
 

7609
01:53:40,239 --> 01:53:43,109
yes by the problem sets we were
found actually yeah i wrote a um a

7610
01:53:43,109 --> 01:53:43,119
found actually yeah i wrote a um a
 

7611
01:53:43,119 --> 01:53:44,310
found actually yeah i wrote a um a
program a long time ago

7612
01:53:44,310 --> 01:53:44,320
program a long time ago
 

7613
01:53:44,320 --> 01:53:46,709
program a long time ago
actually for my master's thesis and uh

7614
01:53:46,709 --> 01:53:46,719
actually for my master's thesis and uh
 

7615
01:53:46,719 --> 01:53:47,350
actually for my master's thesis and uh
in c

7616
01:53:47,350 --> 01:53:47,360
in c
 

7617
01:53:47,360 --> 01:53:49,430
in c
plus i think or c i guess we'll see and

7618
01:53:49,430 --> 01:53:49,440
plus i think or c i guess we'll see and
 

7619
01:53:49,440 --> 01:53:51,109
plus i think or c i guess we'll see and
it was uh all memory management and

7620
01:53:51,109 --> 01:53:51,119
it was uh all memory management and
 

7621
01:53:51,119 --> 01:53:51,750
it was uh all memory management and
terrible

7622
01:53:51,750 --> 01:53:51,760
terrible
 

7623
01:53:51,760 --> 01:53:56,310
terrible
um and it wouldn't work for a while

7624
01:53:56,310 --> 01:53:56,320
um and it wouldn't work for a while
 

7625
01:53:56,320 --> 01:53:58,070
um and it wouldn't work for a while
and it was some kind of it was clear to

7626
01:53:58,070 --> 01:53:58,080
and it was some kind of it was clear to
 

7627
01:53:58,080 --> 01:53:59,589
and it was some kind of it was clear to
me that it was overwriting memory

7628
01:53:59,589 --> 01:53:59,599
me that it was overwriting memory
 

7629
01:53:59,599 --> 01:54:01,750
me that it was overwriting memory
and i just couldn't i was like look i

7630
01:54:01,750 --> 01:54:01,760
and i just couldn't i was like look i
 

7631
01:54:01,760 --> 01:54:02,629
and i just couldn't i was like look i
got a paper

7632
01:54:02,629 --> 01:54:02,639
got a paper
 

7633
01:54:02,639 --> 01:54:05,430
got a paper
time for this so i basically declared a

7634
01:54:05,430 --> 01:54:05,440
time for this so i basically declared a
 

7635
01:54:05,440 --> 01:54:06,470
time for this so i basically declared a
variable

7636
01:54:06,470 --> 01:54:06,480
variable
 

7637
01:54:06,480 --> 01:54:09,030
variable
at the front in the main that was like

7638
01:54:09,030 --> 01:54:09,040
at the front in the main that was like
 

7639
01:54:09,040 --> 01:54:10,070
at the front in the main that was like
400k

7640
01:54:10,070 --> 01:54:10,080
400k
 

7641
01:54:10,080 --> 01:54:12,550
400k
just an array and it worked because

7642
01:54:12,550 --> 01:54:12,560
just an array and it worked because
 

7643
01:54:12,560 --> 01:54:14,229
just an array and it worked because
wherever i was scribbling over memory

7644
01:54:14,229 --> 01:54:14,239
wherever i was scribbling over memory
 

7645
01:54:14,239 --> 01:54:15,669
wherever i was scribbling over memory
it would scribble into that space and it

7646
01:54:15,669 --> 01:54:15,679
it would scribble into that space and it
 

7647
01:54:15,679 --> 01:54:17,990
it would scribble into that space and it
didn't matter and so i never figured out

7648
01:54:17,990 --> 01:54:18,000
didn't matter and so i never figured out
 

7649
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:19,510
didn't matter and so i never figured out
what the bug was

7650
01:54:19,510 --> 01:54:19,520
what the bug was
 

7651
01:54:19,520 --> 01:54:21,189
what the bug was
but i did create something to sort of

7652
01:54:21,189 --> 01:54:21,199
but i did create something to sort of
 

7653
01:54:21,199 --> 01:54:22,629
but i did create something to sort of
deal with it to work around it

7654
01:54:22,629 --> 01:54:22,639
deal with it to work around it
 

7655
01:54:22,639 --> 01:54:25,109
deal with it to work around it
and it you know that's crazy that's

7656
01:54:25,109 --> 01:54:25,119
and it you know that's crazy that's
 

7657
01:54:25,119 --> 01:54:26,550
and it you know that's crazy that's
crazy it was okay because that's what i

7658
01:54:26,550 --> 01:54:26,560
crazy it was okay because that's what i
 

7659
01:54:26,560 --> 01:54:27,109
crazy it was okay because that's what i
wanted

7660
01:54:27,109 --> 01:54:27,119
wanted
 

7661
01:54:27,119 --> 01:54:28,870
wanted
but i knew enough about memory managed

7662
01:54:28,870 --> 01:54:28,880
but i knew enough about memory managed
 

7663
01:54:28,880 --> 01:54:30,709
but i knew enough about memory managed
