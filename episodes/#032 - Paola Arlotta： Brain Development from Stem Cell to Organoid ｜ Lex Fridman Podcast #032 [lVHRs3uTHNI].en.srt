00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:11,720
and out-of-the-box question first how
 

57
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,960

once so that simply tells you that it

74
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:38,360
once so that simply tells you that it
 

75
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:41,499
once so that simply tells you that it
could of course happen again other

places is only a matter of probability

78

places is only a matter of probability
 

79
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:45,940
places is only a matter of probability
what the probability that you would get

80
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:45,950
what the probability that you would get

a brain like the ones that we have like

82
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:49,550
a brain like the ones that we have like
 

83
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:52,389
a brain like the ones that we have like
like the human brain so how difficult is

84
00:01:52,389 --> 00:01:52,399
like the human brain so how difficult is
 

85
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,340
like the human brain so how difficult is
it to make the human brain it's pretty

86
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:54,350
it to make the human brain it's pretty
 

87
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:59,410
it to make the human brain it's pretty
difficult but most importantly I guess

88
00:01:59,410 --> 00:01:59,420
difficult but most importantly I guess
 

89
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:02,109
difficult but most importantly I guess
we know very little about how this

90
00:02:02,109 --> 00:02:02,119
we know very little about how this
 

91
00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:05,020
we know very little about how this
process really happens and there is a

92
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:05,030
process really happens and there is a
 

93
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:07,150
process really happens and there is a
reason for that actually multiple

94
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:07,160
reason for that actually multiple
 

95
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:10,330
reason for that actually multiple
reasons for that most of what we know

96
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:10,340
reasons for that most of what we know
 

97
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:13,570
reasons for that most of what we know
about how the mammalian brain so the

98
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:13,580
about how the mammalian brain so the
 

99
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:16,180
about how the mammalian brain so the
brain of mammals developed comes from

100
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:16,190
brain of mammals developed comes from
 

101
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:19,390
brain of mammals developed comes from
studying in labs other brains not our

102
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:19,400

own brain the brain of mice for example

104
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:22,069
own brain the brain of mice for example
 

105
00:02:22,069 --> 00:02:24,850
own brain the brain of mice for example
but if I showed you a picture of a mouse

106
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:24,860
but if I showed you a picture of a mouse
 

107
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:26,559
but if I showed you a picture of a mouse
brain and then you put it next to a

108
00:02:26,559 --> 00:02:26,569
brain and then you put it next to a
 

109
00:02:26,569 --> 00:02:28,869
brain and then you put it next to a
picture of a human brain they don't look

110
00:02:28,869 --> 00:02:28,879
picture of a human brain they don't look
 

111
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:31,780
picture of a human brain they don't look
at all like each other so they're very

112
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:31,790
at all like each other so they're very
 

113
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:34,479
at all like each other so they're very
different and and therefore there is a

114
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:34,489
different and and therefore there is a
 

115
00:02:34,489 --> 00:02:36,760
different and and therefore there is a
limit to what you can learn about how

116
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:36,770
limit to what you can learn about how
 

117
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:38,710
limit to what you can learn about how
the human brain is made by studying the

118
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:38,720
the human brain is made by studying the
 

119
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,680
the human brain is made by studying the
mouse brain the region there is a huge

120
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:41,690
mouse brain the region there is a huge
 

121
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:43,420
mouse brain the region there is a huge
value and studying the mouse brain there

122
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:43,430
value and studying the mouse brain there
 

123
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,190
value and studying the mouse brain there
are many things that we have learned but

124
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:45,200
are many things that we have learned but
 

125
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,240
are many things that we have learned but
it's not the same thing

126
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:46,250
it's not the same thing
 

127
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,820
it's not the same thing
so in having studied the human brain or

128
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:48,830
so in having studied the human brain or
 

129
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:50,650
so in having studied the human brain or
through the mouse and through other

130
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:50,660
through the mouse and through other
 

131
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:53,680
through the mouse and through other
methodologies that we'll talk about do

132
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:53,690
methodologies that we'll talk about do
 

133
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:55,570
methodologies that we'll talk about do
you have a sense I mean you're one of

134
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:55,580
you have a sense I mean you're one of
 

135
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:58,390
you have a sense I mean you're one of
the experts in the world how much do you

136
00:02:58,390 --> 00:02:58,400
the experts in the world how much do you
 

137
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,790
the experts in the world how much do you
feel you know about the brain and how

138
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:02,800
feel you know about the brain and how
 

139
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,440
feel you know about the brain and how
much how often do you find yourself in

140
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:05,450
much how often do you find yourself in
 

141
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:08,770
much how often do you find yourself in
awe of this mysterious thing yeah you

142
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:08,780
awe of this mysterious thing yeah you
 

143
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:10,540
awe of this mysterious thing yeah you
pretty much find yourself you know all

144
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:10,550
pretty much find yourself you know all
 

145
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:15,550
pretty much find yourself you know all
the time it's an amazing process it's a

146
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:15,560
the time it's an amazing process it's a
 

147
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,690
the time it's an amazing process it's a
process

148
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:16,700
process
 

149
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:19,270
process
which by means that we don't fully

can it has the potential to make many
many different types of other cells and

322
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:16,860
many different types of other cells and
 

323
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:20,180
many different types of other cells and
then with time these progenitors become

324
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:20,190
then with time these progenitors become
 

325
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,159
then with time these progenitors become
more heterogeneous which means more

326
00:07:22,159 --> 00:07:22,169
more heterogeneous which means more
 

327
00:07:22,169 --> 00:07:23,630
more heterogeneous which means more
diverse there are going to be many

328
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:23,640
diverse there are going to be many
 

329
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:26,030
diverse there are going to be many
different types of the stem cells and

330
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:26,040
different types of the stem cells and
 

331
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,670
different types of the stem cells and
also they will give rise to progeny to

332
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:28,680
also they will give rise to progeny to
 

333
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,880
also they will give rise to progeny to
other cells that are not themselves that

334
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:31,890
other cells that are not themselves that
 

335
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:33,500
other cells that are not themselves that
are specific cells of the brain that are

336
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:33,510
are specific cells of the brain that are
 

337
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:34,760
are specific cells of the brain that are
very different from the mothers

338
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:34,770
very different from the mothers
 

339
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:37,159
very different from the mothers
themselves and now you think about this

340
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:37,169
themselves and now you think about this
 

341
00:07:37,169 --> 00:07:39,500
themselves and now you think about this
process of making cells from the stem

342
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:39,510
process of making cells from the stem
 

343
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:41,600
process of making cells from the stem
cells over many many months of

344
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:41,610
cells over many many months of
 

345
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:43,410
cells over many many months of
development for humans and

346
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:43,420
development for humans and
 

347
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:45,270
development for humans and
and what you're doing you're building

348
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:45,280
and what you're doing you're building
 

349
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,700
and what you're doing you're building
the cells they physically make the brain

350
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:47,710
the cells they physically make the brain
 

351
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:50,720
the cells they physically make the brain
and then you arrange them in specific

352
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:50,730
and then you arrange them in specific
 

353
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:54,720
and then you arrange them in specific
structures that are present in the final

354
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:54,730
structures that are present in the final
 

355
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:57,420
structures that are present in the final
brain so you can think about the

356
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:57,430
brain so you can think about the
 

357
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:59,370
brain so you can think about the
embryonic development of the brain as

358
00:07:59,370 --> 00:07:59,380
embryonic development of the brain as
 

359
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:01,050
embryonic development of the brain as
the time where you're building the

360
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:01,060
the time where you're building the
 

361
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:03,150
the time where you're building the
bricks you're putting a bricks together

362
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:03,160
bricks you're putting a bricks together
 

363
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:07,140
bricks you're putting a bricks together
to form buildings structures regions of

364
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:07,150
to form buildings structures regions of
 

365
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:09,270
to form buildings structures regions of
the brain and where you make the

366
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:09,280
the brain and where you make the
 

367
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,300
the brain and where you make the
connections between these many different

368
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:12,310
connections between these many different
 

369
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:14,280
connections between these many different
type of cells especially nerve cells

370
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:14,290
type of cells especially nerve cells
 

371
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:17,070
type of cells especially nerve cells
neurons right that transmit action

372
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:17,080
neurons right that transmit action
 

373
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,620
neurons right that transmit action
potentials and electricity I've heard

374
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:19,630
potentials and electricity I've heard
 

375
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:21,630
potentials and electricity I've heard
you also says somewhere I think correct

376
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:21,640
you also says somewhere I think correct
 

377
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,640
you also says somewhere I think correct
me if I'm wrong that the order of the

378
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:23,650
me if I'm wrong that the order of the
 

379
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:26,310
me if I'm wrong that the order of the
way this builds matters oh yes if you

380
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:26,320
way this builds matters oh yes if you
 

381
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,610
way this builds matters oh yes if you
are an engineer and you think about

382
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:28,620
are an engineer and you think about
 

383
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:31,410
are an engineer and you think about
development you can think of it as well

384
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:31,420
development you can think of it as well
 

385
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:34,770
development you can think of it as well
I could also take all the cells and

386
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:34,780
I could also take all the cells and
 

387
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:37,380
I could also take all the cells and
bring them all together into a brain in

388
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:37,390
bring them all together into a brain in
 

389
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:39,270
bring them all together into a brain in
the end but development is much more

390
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:39,280
the end but development is much more
 

391
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,850
the end but development is much more
than that so the cells are made in a

392
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:41,860
than that so the cells are made in a
 

393
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:44,970
than that so the cells are made in a
very specific order that subserve the

394
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:44,980
very specific order that subserve the
 

395
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:47,220
very specific order that subserve the
final product that you need to get and

396
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:47,230
final product that you need to get and
 

397
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:49,770
final product that you need to get and
so for example all of the nerve cells

398
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:49,780
so for example all of the nerve cells
 

399
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:52,590
so for example all of the nerve cells
the neurons are made first and all of

400
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:52,600
the neurons are made first and all of
 

401
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,570
the neurons are made first and all of
the supportive cells of the neurons like

402
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:54,580
the supportive cells of the neurons like
 

403
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:57,540
the supportive cells of the neurons like
the glia is made later and there is a

404
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:57,550
the glia is made later and there is a
 

405
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:59,040
the glia is made later and there is a
reason for that because they have to

406
00:08:59,040 --> 00:08:59,050
reason for that because they have to
 

407
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:02,250
reason for that because they have to
assemble together in specific ways but

408
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:02,260
assemble together in specific ways but
 

409
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:03,870
assemble together in specific ways but
you also may say well why don't we just

410
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:03,880
you also may say well why don't we just
 

411
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,880
you also may say well why don't we just
put them all together in the end it's

412
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:05,890
put them all together in the end it's
 

413
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:08,250
put them all together in the end it's
because as they develop next to each

414
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:08,260
because as they develop next to each
 

415
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:10,380
because as they develop next to each
other they influence their own

416
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:10,390
other they influence their own
 

417
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:12,420
other they influence their own
development so it's a different thing

418
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:12,430
development so it's a different thing
 

419
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:14,880
development so it's a different thing
for a glia to be made alone in a dish

420
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:14,890
for a glia to be made alone in a dish
 

421
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:17,400
for a glia to be made alone in a dish
then a glia be made in a glial cell be

422
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:17,410
then a glia be made in a glial cell be
 

423
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:19,650
then a glia be made in a glial cell be
made in a developing embryo with all

424
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:19,660
made in a developing embryo with all
 

425
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:21,450
made in a developing embryo with all
these other cells surrounded they

426
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:21,460
these other cells surrounded they
 

427
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:24,000
these other cells surrounded they
produce all these other signals first of

428
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,010
produce all these other signals first of
 

429
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:26,070
produce all these other signals first of
all that's mind-blowing that this

430
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:26,080
all that's mind-blowing that this
 

431
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,350
all that's mind-blowing that this
development process from my perspective

432
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:28,360
development process from my perspective
 

433
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,120
development process from my perspective
in artificial intelligence you often

434
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:30,130
in artificial intelligence you often
 

435
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:32,190
in artificial intelligence you often
think of how incredible the final

436
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:32,200
think of how incredible the final
 

437
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,560
think of how incredible the final
product is the final product the brain

438
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:34,570
product is the final product the brain
 

439
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:36,660
product is the final product the brain
but you just you're making me realize

440
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:36,670
but you just you're making me realize
 

441
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:41,130
but you just you're making me realize
that the final product is just is the

442
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:41,140
that the final product is just is the
 

443
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:42,630
that the final product is just is the
the beautiful thing is the actual

444
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:42,640
the beautiful thing is the actual
 

445
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,580
the beautiful thing is the actual
development and development process do

446
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:44,590
development and development process do
 

447
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:48,750
development and development process do
we know the code that drives that

448
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:48,760
we know the code that drives that
 

449
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:51,380
we know the code that drives that
development

450
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:51,390
development
 

451
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:54,620
development
do we have any sense first of all thank

452
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:54,630
do we have any sense first of all thank
 

453
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:56,300
do we have any sense first of all thank
you for saying that

454
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:56,310
you for saying that
 

455
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:59,090
you for saying that
it's really the formation of the brain

456
00:09:59,090 --> 00:09:59,100
it's really the formation of the brain
 

457
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,150
it's really the formation of the brain
it's really its development this

458
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:01,160
it's really its development this
 

459
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:05,240
it's really its development this
incredibly choreograph dance that

460
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:05,250
incredibly choreograph dance that
 

461
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,819
incredibly choreograph dance that
happens the same way every time each one

462
00:10:07,819 --> 00:10:07,829
happens the same way every time each one
 

463
00:10:07,829 --> 00:10:11,030
happens the same way every time each one
of us builds the brain right and that

464
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:11,040
of us builds the brain right and that
 

465
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,889
of us builds the brain right and that
builds an organ that allows us to do

466
00:10:12,889 --> 00:10:12,899
builds an organ that allows us to do
 

467
00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:15,050
builds an organ that allows us to do
what we're doing today right yeah that

468
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:15,060
what we're doing today right yeah that
 

469
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,970
what we're doing today right yeah that
is mind blowing and this is why

470
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:16,980
is mind blowing and this is why
 

471
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:19,340
is mind blowing and this is why
developmental neurobiologists never get

472
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:19,350
developmental neurobiologists never get
 

473
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:22,730
developmental neurobiologists never get
tired in that now you're asking about

474
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:22,740
tired in that now you're asking about
 

475
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:25,550
tired in that now you're asking about
the code what drives this how is this

476
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:25,560
the code what drives this how is this
 

477
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,370
the code what drives this how is this
done well it's you know millions of

478
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:28,380
done well it's you know millions of
 

479
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:30,829
done well it's you know millions of
years of evolution of really fine-tuning

480
00:10:30,829 --> 00:10:30,839
years of evolution of really fine-tuning
 

481

years of evolution of really fine-tuning
gene expression programs that allow

482
00:10:33,769 --> 00:10:33,779
gene expression programs that allow
 

483
00:10:33,779 --> 00:10:36,949
gene expression programs that allow
certain cells to be made at a certain

you know cell type but also mechanical

488
00:10:43,699 --> 00:10:43,709
you know cell type but also mechanical

00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:47,900
you know cell type but also mechanical
forces of pressure bending this embryo

490
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:47,910
forces of pressure bending this embryo
 

491
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:50,449
forces of pressure bending this embryo
is not just it will not stay a tube this

492
00:10:50,449 --> 00:10:50,459
is not just it will not stay a tube this
 

493
00:10:50,459 --> 00:10:52,519
is not just it will not stay a tube this
this brain for very long at some point

494
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:52,529
this brain for very long at some point
 

495
00:10:52,529 --> 00:10:54,530
this brain for very long at some point
is tube in the front of the of the

00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:54,540
is tube in the front of the of the
 

497
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:56,420
is tube in the front of the of the
embryo will expand to make the

498
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:56,430
embryo will expand to make the
 

499
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:58,579
embryo will expand to make the
primordium of the brain right now they

500
00:10:58,579 --> 00:10:58,589
primordium of the brain right now they
 

501
00:10:58,589 --> 00:11:01,819
primordium of the brain right now they
the forces that control that these cells

502
00:11:01,819 --> 00:11:01,829
the forces that control that these cells
 

503
00:11:01,829 --> 00:11:04,310
the forces that control that these cells
feel and this is another beautiful thing

504
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:04,320
feel and this is another beautiful thing
 

505
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,980
feel and this is another beautiful thing
at the very force that they feel which

506
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:06,990
at the very force that they feel which
 

507
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:09,530
at the very force that they feel which
is different from a week before a week

508
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:09,540
is different from a week before a week
 

509
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:11,720
is different from a week before a week
ago will tell the cell oh you're being

510
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:11,730
ago will tell the cell oh you're being
 

511
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:14,300
ago will tell the cell oh you're being
squished in a certain way begin to

512
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:14,310
squished in a certain way begin to
 

513
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:17,210
squished in a certain way begin to
produce these new genes because now you

514
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:17,220
produce these new genes because now you
 

515
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:20,300
produce these new genes because now you
are at the corner or you are you know in

516
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:20,310
are at the corner or you are you know in
 

517
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:23,000
are at the corner or you are you know in
a stretch of cells or whatever it is and

518
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:23,010
a stretch of cells or whatever it is and
 

519
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:25,819
a stretch of cells or whatever it is and
there so that mechanical physical force

520
00:11:25,819 --> 00:11:25,829
there so that mechanical physical force
 

521
00:11:25,829 --> 00:11:29,689
there so that mechanical physical force
shapes the fate of the cell as well so

522
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:29,699
shapes the fate of the cell as well so
 

523
00:11:29,699 --> 00:11:32,569
shapes the fate of the cell as well so
nala chemical is also mechana mechanical

524
00:11:32,569 --> 00:11:32,579
nala chemical is also mechana mechanical
 

525
00:11:32,579 --> 00:11:35,889
nala chemical is also mechana mechanical
so from my perspective biology is this

526
00:11:35,889 --> 00:11:35,899
so from my perspective biology is this
 

527
00:11:35,899 --> 00:11:40,610
so from my perspective biology is this
incredibly complex mess gooey mess so

528
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:40,620
incredibly complex mess gooey mess so
 

529
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:44,090
incredibly complex mess gooey mess so
you're seeing mechanical forces how

530
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:44,100
you're seeing mechanical forces how
 

531
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:48,139
you're seeing mechanical forces how
different is a like a computer or any

532
00:11:48,139 --> 00:11:48,149
different is a like a computer or any
 

533
00:11:48,149 --> 00:11:50,329
different is a like a computer or any
kind of mechanical machine that we

534
00:11:50,329 --> 00:11:50,339
kind of mechanical machine that we
 

535
00:11:50,339 --> 00:11:53,540
kind of mechanical machine that we
humans build and the biological systems

536
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:53,550
humans build and the biological systems
 

537
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:55,250
humans build and the biological systems
have you been because you've worked a

538
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:55,260
have you been because you've worked a
 

539
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:57,530
have you been because you've worked a
lot with biological systems are they as

540
00:11:57,530 --> 00:11:57,540
lot with biological systems are they as
 

541
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:00,920
lot with biological systems are they as
much of a mess as it seems from a

542
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:00,930
much of a mess as it seems from a
 

543
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:03,019
much of a mess as it seems from a
perspective of an engineer mechanical

544
00:12:03,019 --> 00:12:03,029
perspective of an engineer mechanical
 

545
00:12:03,029 --> 00:12:04,160
perspective of an engineer mechanical
engineer yeah

546
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:04,170
engineer yeah
 

547
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:09,580
engineer yeah
they are much more prone to taking

548
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:09,590
they are much more prone to taking
 

549
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:14,330
they are much more prone to taking
alternative routes right so if you we go

550
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:14,340
alternative routes right so if you we go
 

551
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:16,430
alternative routes right so if you we go
back to printing a brain versus

552
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:16,440
back to printing a brain versus
 

553
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,980
back to printing a brain versus
developing a brain of course if you

554
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:18,990
developing a brain of course if you
 

555
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:21,650
developing a brain of course if you
print a brain given that you start with

556
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:21,660
print a brain given that you start with
 

557
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:23,750
print a brain given that you start with
the same building blocks the same cells

558
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:23,760
the same building blocks the same cells
 

559
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,300
the same building blocks the same cells
you could potentially print it the same

560
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:26,310
you could potentially print it the same
 

561
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:30,710
you could potentially print it the same
way every time but that final brain may

562
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:30,720
way every time but that final brain may
 

563
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,380
way every time but that final brain may
not work the same way as a brain built

564
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:33,390
not work the same way as a brain built
 

565
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:35,000
not work the same way as a brain built
during development does because the

566
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:35,010
during development does because the
 

567
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:36,860
during development does because the
build very build very same building

568
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:36,870
build very build very same building
 

569
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:39,560
build very build very same building
blocks that you're using developed in a

570
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:39,570
blocks that you're using developed in a
 

571
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:41,420
blocks that you're using developed in a
completely different environment right

572
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:41,430
completely different environment right
 

573
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:42,740
completely different environment right
there was not the environment of the

574
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:42,750
there was not the environment of the
 

575
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:43,850
there was not the environment of the
brain therefore they're going to be

576
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:43,860
brain therefore they're going to be
 

577
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:48,020
brain therefore they're going to be
different just by definition so if you

578
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:48,030
different just by definition so if you
 

579
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:50,630
different just by definition so if you
instead use development to be able to

580
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:50,640
instead use development to be able to
 

581
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:53,480
instead use development to be able to
say a brain organoid which maybe we'll

582
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:53,490
say a brain organoid which maybe we'll
 

583
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:56,000
say a brain organoid which maybe we'll
be talking about in a future those

584
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:56,010
be talking about in a future those
 

585
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:58,790
be talking about in a future those
things are fascinating yes so if you if

586
00:12:58,790 --> 00:12:58,800
things are fascinating yes so if you if
 

587
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,180
things are fascinating yes so if you if
you use processes of development then

588
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:02,190
you use processes of development then
 

589
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:04,070
you use processes of development then
you when you watch it you can see that

590
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:04,080
you when you watch it you can see that
 

591
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,800
you when you watch it you can see that
sometime things can go wrong in some

592
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:06,810
sometime things can go wrong in some
 

593
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:08,390
sometime things can go wrong in some
organ weights and by wrong I mean

594
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:08,400
organ weights and by wrong I mean
 

595
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,430
organ weights and by wrong I mean
different one organ way from the next

596
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:10,440
different one organ way from the next
 

597
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:13,190
different one organ way from the next
well if you think about that embryo it

598
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:13,200
well if you think about that embryo it
 

599
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,590
well if you think about that embryo it
always goes right so it's this

600
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:15,600
always goes right so it's this
 

601
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,140
always goes right so it's this
development it's for as complexity as it

602
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:18,150
development it's for as complexity as it
 

603
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:21,620
development it's for as complexity as it
is every time a baby is born has you

604
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:21,630
is every time a baby is born has you
 

605
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:23,840
is every time a baby is born has you
know with very few exceptions so the

606
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:23,850
know with very few exceptions so the
 

607
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:26,870
know with very few exceptions so the
brain is like the next baby but it's not

608
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:26,880
brain is like the next baby but it's not
 

609
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:31,400
brain is like the next baby but it's not
the same if you develop it in a dish and

610
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:31,410
the same if you develop it in a dish and
 

611
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:33,590
the same if you develop it in a dish and
first of all is we don't even develop a

612
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:33,600
first of all is we don't even develop a
 

613
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,030
first of all is we don't even develop a
brain you develop something much simpler

614
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:35,040
brain you develop something much simpler
 

615
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,520
brain you develop something much simpler
in the dish but there are more options

616
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:37,530
in the dish but there are more options
 

617
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:39,800
in the dish but there are more options
for building things differently which

618
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:39,810
for building things differently which
 

619
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:43,580
for building things differently which
really tells you the evolution as has

620
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:43,590
really tells you the evolution as has
 

621
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:49,070
really tells you the evolution as has
played a really tight game here for how

622
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:49,080
played a really tight game here for how
 

623
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:53,450
played a really tight game here for how
in the end the brain is built in vivo so

624
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:53,460
in the end the brain is built in vivo so
 

625
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:55,670
in the end the brain is built in vivo so
just a quick may be dumb question but it

626
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:55,680
just a quick may be dumb question but it
 

627
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,850
just a quick may be dumb question but it
seems like this is not the building

628
00:13:58,850 --> 00:13:58,860
seems like this is not the building
 

629
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:01,400
seems like this is not the building
process is not a dictatorship it seems

630
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:01,410
process is not a dictatorship it seems
 

631
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:05,110
process is not a dictatorship it seems
like there's not a centralized like

632
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:05,120
like there's not a centralized like
 

633
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,300
like there's not a centralized like
high-level mechanism that says ok this

634
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:08,310
high-level mechanism that says ok this
 

635
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:10,340
high-level mechanism that says ok this
cell built itself the wrong way I'm

636
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:10,350
cell built itself the wrong way I'm
 

637
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,140
cell built itself the wrong way I'm
going to kill it it seems like it's

638
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:12,150
going to kill it it seems like it's
 

639
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:14,000
going to kill it it seems like it's
there's a really strong distributed

640
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:14,010
there's a really strong distributed
 

641
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:15,330
there's a really strong distributed
mechanism

642
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:15,340
mechanism
 

643
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:17,700
mechanism
is that is that in your sense for there

00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:17,710
is that is that in your sense for there
 

645
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:19,080
is that is that in your sense for there
are a lot of there are a lot of

00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:19,090
are a lot of there are a lot of
 

647
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:22,230
are a lot of there are a lot of
possibilities right and if you think

648
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:22,240
possibilities right and if you think
 

649
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,410
possibilities right and if you think
about for example different species

650
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:24,420
about for example different species
 

651
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:27,630
about for example different species
building their brain each brain is a

652
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:27,640
building their brain each brain is a
 

653
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,730
building their brain each brain is a
little bit different so the brain of a

654
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:29,740
little bit different so the brain of a
 

655
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:31,500
little bit different so the brain of a
lizard is very different from that of a

656
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:31,510
lizard is very different from that of a
 

657
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:34,530
lizard is very different from that of a
chicken from that of a you know one of

658
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:34,540
chicken from that of a you know one of
 

659
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,170
chicken from that of a you know one of
us and so on and so forth and still is a

660
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:37,180
us and so on and so forth and still is a
 

661
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:40,769
us and so on and so forth and still is a
brain but it was built differently if

662
00:14:40,769 --> 00:14:40,779
brain but it was built differently if
 

663
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:43,740
brain but it was built differently if
starting from stem cells that pretty

664
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:43,750
starting from stem cells that pretty
 

665
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,420
starting from stem cells that pretty
much had the same potential

666
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:45,430
much had the same potential
 

667
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:48,390
much had the same potential
but in the end evolution builds

668
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:48,400
but in the end evolution builds
 

669
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,160
but in the end evolution builds
different brains in different species

670
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:50,170
different brains in different species
 

671
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:53,040
different brains in different species
because that serves in a way the purpose

672
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:53,050
because that serves in a way the purpose
 

673
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:54,840
because that serves in a way the purpose
of the species and the well-being of

674
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:54,850
of the species and the well-being of
 

675
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:59,700
of the species and the well-being of
that organism and so there are many

676
00:14:59,700 --> 00:14:59,710
that organism and so there are many
 

677
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:02,610
that organism and so there are many
possibilities but then there is a way

678
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:02,620
possibilities but then there is a way
 

679
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:05,160
possibilities but then there is a way
and you were talking about a code nobody

00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:05,170
and you were talking about a code nobody
 

681
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:06,690
and you were talking about a code nobody

structure that we might know but the

696
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:21,730
structure that we might know but the
 

697
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:24,120
structure that we might know but the
entirety of it oh it's so well control

698
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:24,130
entirety of it oh it's so well control
 

699
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:26,760
entirety of it oh it's so well control
it's really mind-blowing so in the first

700
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:26,770
it's really mind-blowing so in the first
 

701
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:29,910
it's really mind-blowing so in the first
two months in the embryo or whatever the

702
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:29,920
two months in the embryo or whatever the
 

703
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,520
two months in the embryo or whatever the

first few months
 

705
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:35,190
first few months
so yeah the the building blocks are

706
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:35,200
so yeah the the building blocks are
 

707
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:39,120
so yeah the the building blocks are
constructed the actual the different

well this continuous way longer than
 

715
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:47,430
well this continuous way longer than
just the first few months so over the

716
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:47,440
just the first few months so over the
 

717
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,880
just the first few months so over the
the very first in a few months you build

718
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:50,890
the very first in a few months you build
 

719
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:53,310
the very first in a few months you build
a lot of the cells but then there is a

720
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:53,320
a lot of the cells but then there is a
 

721
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,820
a lot of the cells but then there is a
continuous building of new cell types

722
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:55,830
continuous building of new cell types
 

723
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:59,160
continuous building of new cell types
all the way through birth and then even

00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:10,330
cable some of the neurons so that the
 

733
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:12,150
cable some of the neurons so that the

734
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:12,160
electricity can go really fast the front

you know a six-year-old kid has barely

742
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:27,700
you know a six-year-old kid has barely
 

743
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,070
you know a six-year-old kid has barely
started

744
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:29,080
started
 

745
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,350
started
so making the mature oligodendrocytes

746
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:31,360
so making the mature oligodendrocytes
 

747
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,780
so making the mature oligodendrocytes
which are the cells then eventually will

748
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:33,790
which are the cells then eventually will
 

749
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:36,360
which are the cells then eventually will
wrap with the axons in to myelin and

750
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:36,370
wrap with the axons in to myelin and
 

751
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:38,670
wrap with the axons in to myelin and
this will continue believe it or not

752
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:38,680
this will continue believe it or not
 

753
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:41,670
this will continue believe it or not
until we are about you know 2530 years

754
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:41,680
until we are about you know 2530 years
 

755
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,640
until we are about you know 2530 years
old so there is a continuous process of

756
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:44,650
old so there is a continuous process of
 

757
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:46,470
old so there is a continuous process of
maturation and tweaking and additions

758
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:46,480
maturation and tweaking and additions
 

759
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,490
maturation and tweaking and additions
and and also in response to what we do I

760
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:50,500
and and also in response to what we do I
 

761
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,340
and and also in response to what we do I
remember taking ap biology in high

762
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:53,350
remember taking ap biology in high
 

763
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:56,370
remember taking ap biology in high
school and in the textbook it said that

764
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:56,380
school and in the textbook it said that
 

765
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:59,700
school and in the textbook it said that
I'm going by memory here that scientists

766
00:16:59,700 --> 00:16:59,710
I'm going by memory here that scientists
 

767
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:03,690
I'm going by memory here that scientists
disagree on the purpose of myelin in in

768
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:03,700
disagree on the purpose of myelin in in
 

769
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:05,850
disagree on the purpose of myelin in in
the brain is that is that's totally

770
00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:05,860
the brain is that is that's totally
 

771
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:09,300
the brain is that is that's totally
wrong so like it I guess it speeds up

772
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:09,310
wrong so like it I guess it speeds up
 

773
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:13,380
wrong so like it I guess it speeds up
the book okay might be wrong here but I

774
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:13,390
the book okay might be wrong here but I
 

775
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:14,460
the book okay might be wrong here but I
guess it speeds up the electricity

776
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:14,470
guess it speeds up the electricity
 

777
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:17,449
guess it speeds up the electricity
traveling down the axon or something

778
00:17:17,449 --> 00:17:17,459
traveling down the axon or something
 

779
00:17:17,459 --> 00:17:20,160
traveling down the axon or something
that's the most sort of canonical and

780
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:20,170
that's the most sort of canonical and
 

781
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:23,070
that's the most sort of canonical and
definitely that's the case so you have

782
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:23,080
definitely that's the case so you have
 

783
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:25,500
definitely that's the case so you have
to imagine an axon and you can think

784
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:25,510
to imagine an axon and you can think
 

785
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:27,810
to imagine an axon and you can think
about it as a cable or some type with

786
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:27,820
about it as a cable or some type with
 

787
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:29,790
about it as a cable or some type with
electricity going through and what

788
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:29,800
electricity going through and what
 

789
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:33,750
electricity going through and what
myelin does by insulating the outside I

790
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:33,760
myelin does by insulating the outside I
 

791
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,240
myelin does by insulating the outside I
should say there are tracks of myelin

792
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:36,250
should say there are tracks of myelin
 

793
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:38,160
should say there are tracks of myelin
and pieces of axons that are naked

794
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:38,170
and pieces of axons that are naked
 

795
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:41,040
and pieces of axons that are naked
without my Elaine and so by having the

796
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:41,050
without my Elaine and so by having the
 

797
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:42,690
without my Elaine and so by having the
insulation the electricity instead of

798
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:42,700
insulation the electricity instead of
 

799
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,070
insulation the electricity instead of
going straight through the cable it

800
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:44,080
going straight through the cable it
 

801
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,740
going straight through the cable it
would jump over a piece of myelin right

802
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:46,750
would jump over a piece of myelin right
 

803
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:49,470
would jump over a piece of myelin right
to the next naked little piece and jump

804
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:49,480
to the next naked little piece and jump
 

805
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,150
to the next naked little piece and jump
again and therefore you you know that's

806
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:51,160
again and therefore you you know that's
 

807
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:54,450
again and therefore you you know that's
the idea that you go faster and it was

808
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:54,460
the idea that you go faster and it was
 

809
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:58,470
the idea that you go faster and it was
always thought that in order to build a

big brain a big nervous system in order
 

813
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,620
big brain a big nervous system in order
to have a nervous system it can do very

00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:04,630
to have a nervous system it can do very

00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:06,870
to have a nervous system it can do very
complex the type of things then you need

00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:06,880
complex the type of things then you need
 

817
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,490
complex the type of things then you need
a lot of myelin because you want to go

818
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:08,500
a lot of myelin because you want to go

823
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:18,990
to point B well a few years ago maybe
five years ago or so we discovered that

824
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:19,000
five years ago or so we discovered that
 

825
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,240
five years ago or so we discovered that

the top of our cerebral cortex which
 

833
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:31,080

those F axons that have very little
 

839
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:40,610
those F axons that have very little
myelin and they have very interesting

00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:54,849

at all so now you have to explain where

852
00:18:54,849 --> 00:18:54,859
at all so now you have to explain where
 

853
00:18:54,859 --> 00:18:58,419
at all so now you have to explain where
we're going with evolution and if you

854
00:18:58,419 --> 00:18:58,429
we're going with evolution and if you
 

855
00:18:58,429 --> 00:19:00,519
we're going with evolution and if you
think about it perhaps as an electrical

856
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:00,529
think about it perhaps as an electrical
 

857
00:19:00,529 --> 00:19:05,109
think about it perhaps as an electrical

00:19:05,109 --> 00:19:05,119
engineer when I looked at it I initially
 

859
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:06,639
engineer when I looked at it I initially
thought and I'm a developmental

00:19:06,639 --> 00:19:06,649
thought and I'm a developmental

00:19:06,649 --> 00:19:09,940
thought and I'm a developmental
neurobiology I thought maybe this is

862
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:09,950
neurobiology I thought maybe this is
 

863
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:11,919
neurobiology I thought maybe this is
what we see now but if we give evolution

864
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:11,929
what we see now but if we give evolution
 

865
00:19:11,929 --> 00:19:14,619
what we see now but if we give evolution
another few million years we see a lot

866
00:19:14,619 --> 00:19:14,629
another few million years we see a lot
 

867
00:19:14,629 --> 00:19:16,839
another few million years we see a lot
of myelin on these neurons - but I

868
00:19:16,839 --> 00:19:16,849
of myelin on these neurons - but I
 

869
00:19:16,849 --> 00:19:18,729
of myelin on these neurons - but I
actually think now that that's instead

870
00:19:18,729 --> 00:19:18,739
actually think now that that's instead
 

871
00:19:18,739 --> 00:19:22,659
actually think now that that's instead
the future brain less myelin am i allow

for more flexibility on what you do with

874
00:19:25,509 --> 00:19:25,519
for more flexibility on what you do with
 

875
00:19:25,519 --> 00:19:27,729
for more flexibility on what you do with
your actions and therefore more

876
00:19:27,729 --> 00:19:27,739
your actions and therefore more
 

877
00:19:27,739 --> 00:19:30,729
your actions and therefore more
complicated and unpredictable type of

878
00:19:30,729 --> 00:19:30,739
complicated and unpredictable type of
 

879
00:19:30,739 --> 00:19:33,489
complicated and unpredictable type of
functions which is also a bit

880
00:19:33,489 --> 00:19:33,499
functions which is also a bit
 

881
00:19:33,499 --> 00:19:36,070
functions which is also a bit
mind-blowing so it seems like it's

882
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:36,080
mind-blowing so it seems like it's
 

883
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,619
mind-blowing so it seems like it's
controlling the timing of the signal so

884
00:19:38,619 --> 00:19:38,629
controlling the timing of the signal so
 

885
00:19:38,629 --> 00:19:40,149
controlling the timing of the signal so
they're in the timing

886
00:19:40,149 --> 00:19:40,159
they're in the timing
 

887
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:42,820
they're in the timing
you can encode a lot of yes information

888
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:42,830
you can encode a lot of yes information
 

889
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:45,459
you can encode a lot of yes information
yeah and so the brain I mean the

890
00:19:45,459 --> 00:19:45,469
yeah and so the brain I mean the
 

891
00:19:45,469 --> 00:19:47,909
yeah and so the brain I mean the
chemistry of that little piece of axon

892
00:19:47,909 --> 00:19:47,919
chemistry of that little piece of axon
 

893
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:50,529
chemistry of that little piece of axon
perhaps is a dynamic process where the

894
00:19:50,529 --> 00:19:50,539
perhaps is a dynamic process where the
 

895
00:19:50,539 --> 00:19:53,379
perhaps is a dynamic process where the
myelin can move now you see how many

896
00:19:53,379 --> 00:19:53,389
myelin can move now you see how many
 

897
00:19:53,389 --> 00:19:57,249
myelin can move now you see how many
layers of variability you can add and

898
00:19:57,249 --> 00:19:57,259
layers of variability you can add and
 

899
00:19:57,259 --> 00:19:58,869
layers of variability you can add and
that's actually really good

900
00:19:58,869 --> 00:19:58,879
that's actually really good
 

901
00:19:58,879 --> 00:20:01,329
that's actually really good
if you're trying to to come up with a

902
00:20:01,329 --> 00:20:01,339
if you're trying to to come up with a
 

903
00:20:01,339 --> 00:20:04,060
if you're trying to to come up with a
new function or a new capability or

904
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:04,070
new function or a new capability or
 

905
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:06,759
new function or a new capability or
something unpredictable in a way so

906
00:20:06,759 --> 00:20:06,769
something unpredictable in a way so
 

907
00:20:06,769 --> 00:20:08,409
something unpredictable in a way so
we're gonna jump around a little bit but

908
00:20:08,409 --> 00:20:08,419
we're gonna jump around a little bit but
 

909
00:20:08,419 --> 00:20:12,789
we're gonna jump around a little bit but
the old question of how much is nature

910
00:20:12,789 --> 00:20:12,799
the old question of how much is nature
 

911
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:15,999
the old question of how much is nature
and how much is nurture in terms of this

912
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:16,009
and how much is nurture in terms of this
 

913
00:20:16,009 --> 00:20:18,310
and how much is nurture in terms of this
incredible thing after the development

914
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:18,320
incredible thing after the development
 

915
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:23,039
incredible thing after the development
is over we seem to be kind of somewhat

916
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:23,049
is over we seem to be kind of somewhat
 

917
00:20:23,049 --> 00:20:26,769
is over we seem to be kind of somewhat
smart intelligent cognition

918

smart intelligent cognition
 

919
00:20:26,779 --> 00:20:28,570
smart intelligent cognition
consciousness all these things are just

00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:31,460
incredible ability reasons so on emerge
 

923
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:33,519
incredible ability reasons so on emerge
in your sense how much is in the

924
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:33,529
in your sense how much is in the
 

925
00:20:33,529 --> 00:20:36,669
in your sense how much is in the
hardware in the nature and how much is

00:20:36,669 --> 00:20:36,679
hardware in the nature and how much is
 

927
00:20:36,679 --> 00:20:40,539
hardware in the nature and how much is
in the nurture has learned through with

00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:40,549
in the nurture has learned through with
 

929
00:20:40,549 --> 00:20:41,619
in the nurture has learned through with
our parents to interact in the

00:20:41,619 --> 00:20:41,629
our parents to interact in the
 

931
00:20:41,629 --> 00:20:43,659
our parents to interact in the
environment so on it's really both right

932
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:43,669
environment so on it's really both right
 

933
00:20:43,669 --> 00:20:45,849
environment so on it's really both right
if you think about it so we are born

934
00:20:45,849 --> 00:20:45,859
if you think about it so we are born
 

935
00:20:45,859 --> 00:20:49,239
if you think about it so we are born
with the brain as babies there has most

936
00:20:49,239 --> 00:20:49,249
with the brain as babies there has most
 

937
00:20:49,249 --> 00:20:54,060
with the brain as babies there has most
of his South and most of structures and

938
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:54,070
of his South and most of structures and
 

939
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:57,150
of his South and most of structures and
we'll take a few years to you know to

940
00:20:57,150 --> 00:20:57,160
we'll take a few years to you know to
 

941
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:01,250
we'll take a few years to you know to
grow to add more to be better but really

942
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:01,260
grow to add more to be better but really
 

943
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:04,340
grow to add more to be better but really
then we have this 20 years of

944
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:04,350
then we have this 20 years of
 

945
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:06,420
then we have this 20 years of
interacting with the environment around

946
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:06,430
interacting with the environment around
 

947
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:08,790
interacting with the environment around
us and so what that brain that was so

948
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:08,800
us and so what that brain that was so
 

949
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,730
us and so what that brain that was so
you know perfectly built or imperfectly

950
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:11,740
you know perfectly built or imperfectly
 

951
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:16,920
you know perfectly built or imperfectly
built due to our genetic cues will then

952
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:16,930
built due to our genetic cues will then
 

953
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:19,770
built due to our genetic cues will then
be used to incorporate the environment

954
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:19,780
be used to incorporate the environment
 

955
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:21,870
be used to incorporate the environment
in its further maturation and

956
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:21,880
in its further maturation and
 

957
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:25,080
in its further maturation and
development and so your experiences do

958
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:25,090
development and so your experiences do
 

959
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:27,420
development and so your experiences do
shape your your brain I mean we know

960
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:27,430
shape your your brain I mean we know
 

961
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:29,790
shape your your brain I mean we know
that like if you know you and I may have

962
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:29,800
that like if you know you and I may have
 

963
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:32,850
that like if you know you and I may have
had a different childhood or a different

964
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:32,860
had a different childhood or a different
 

965
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:34,710
had a different childhood or a different
we have been going to different schools

966
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:34,720
we have been going to different schools
 

967
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,150
we have been going to different schools
we have been learning different things

968
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:36,160
we have been learning different things
 

969
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,070
we have been learning different things
and our brain is a little bit different

970
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:38,080
and our brain is a little bit different
 

971
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,780
and our brain is a little bit different
because of that we behave differently

972
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:39,790
because of that we behave differently
 

973
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:42,440
because of that we behave differently
because of that and and so especially

974
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:42,450
because of that and and so especially
 

975
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:44,910
because of that and and so especially
postnatally experience is extremely

976
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:44,920
postnatally experience is extremely
 

977
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:48,240
postnatally experience is extremely
important we are born with a plastic

978
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:48,250
important we are born with a plastic
 

979
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:50,430
important we are born with a plastic
brain what that means it's a brain it is

00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:50,440
brain what that means it's a brain it is
 

981
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:53,420

able to change in response to stimuli

982
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:53,430
able to change in response to stimuli
 

983
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:57,660
able to change in response to stimuli
they can be sensory so perhaps some of

984
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:57,670
they can be sensory so perhaps some of
 

985
00:21:57,670 --> 00:22:01,380
they can be sensory so perhaps some of
the most illuminating studies that were

986
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:01,390
the most illuminating studies that were
 

987
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:04,140
the most illuminating studies that were
done were studies in which the sensory

988
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:04,150
done were studies in which the sensory
 

989
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:07,410
done were studies in which the sensory
organs were now working right if you are

can you talk about organoids

1012
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:38,400
can you talk about organoids
 

1013
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,480
can you talk about organoids
what are they yes and how can you use

1014
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:42,490
what are they yes and how can you use
 

1015
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:44,400
what are they yes and how can you use
them to help us understand the brain and

1016
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:44,410
them to help us understand the brain and
 

1017
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:45,870
them to help us understand the brain and
the development of the brain this is

1018
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:45,880
the development of the brain this is
 

1019
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:48,000
the development of the brain this is
very very important so the first thing

1020
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:48,010
very very important so the first thing
 

1021
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:50,820
very very important so the first thing
I'd like to say please keep this in the

video the first thing I'd like to say is
 

1025
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:57,870
video the first thing I'd like to say is
that an organ or a brain organoid is not

that an organ or a brain organoid is not
the same as a brain okay it's a

00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:01,870
the same as a brain okay it's a
 

1029
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:04,799
the same as a brain okay it's a
fundamental distinction it's

00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:04,809
fundamental distinction it's
 

1031
00:23:04,809 --> 00:23:09,269
fundamental distinction it's
a system a cellular system that one can

a process of human brain development
unfold and by watch I mean study it

1054
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:44,460
unfold and by watch I mean study it
 

1055
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:46,919
unfold and by watch I mean study it
remember when I told you that we can't

1056
00:23:46,919 --> 00:23:46,929
remember when I told you that we can't
 

1057
00:23:46,929 --> 00:23:49,259
remember when I told you that we can't
understand everything about development

1058
00:23:49,259 --> 00:23:49,269
understand everything about development
 

1059
00:23:49,269 --> 00:23:51,659
understand everything about development
our own brain by studying a mouse well

1060
00:23:51,659 --> 00:23:51,669
our own brain by studying a mouse well
 

1061
00:23:51,669 --> 00:23:53,609
our own brain by studying a mouse well
we can study the actual process of

1062
00:23:53,609 --> 00:23:53,619
we can study the actual process of
 

1063
00:23:53,619 --> 00:23:54,989
we can study the actual process of
development of the human brain because

1064
00:23:54,989 --> 00:23:54,999
development of the human brain because
 

1065
00:23:54,999 --> 00:23:56,879
development of the human brain because
it all happens in utero so we will never

1066
00:23:56,879 --> 00:23:56,889
it all happens in utero so we will never
 

1067
00:23:56,889 --> 00:23:59,960
it all happens in utero so we will never
have access to that process ever and

1068
00:23:59,960 --> 00:23:59,970
have access to that process ever and
 

1069
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:03,409
have access to that process ever and
therefore this is our next best thing

1070
00:24:03,409 --> 00:24:03,419
therefore this is our next best thing
 

1071
00:24:03,419 --> 00:24:07,680
therefore this is our next best thing
like a a bunch of stem cells that can be

like a a bunch of stem cells that can be
 

1073
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:10,799
like a a bunch of stem cells that can be
coaxed into starting a process of neural

tube formation remember that cube that

1076
00:24:13,109 --> 00:24:13,119
tube formation remember that cube that
 

1077
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:14,970
tube formation remember that cube that
is made by the embryo early on and from

is made by the embryo early on and from
 

1079
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:17,310
is made by the embryo early on and from
there a lot of the cell types that are

1080
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:17,320
there a lot of the cell types that are
 

1081
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:21,210
there a lot of the cell types that are
present within within the brain and you

1082
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:21,220
present within within the brain and you
 

1083
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:25,169
present within within the brain and you
can simply watch it and study but you

1084
00:24:25,169 --> 00:24:25,179
can simply watch it and study but you
 

1085
00:24:25,179 --> 00:24:28,830
can simply watch it and study but you
can also think about diseases where

1086
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:28,840
can also think about diseases where
 

1087
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:31,049
can also think about diseases where
development of the brain does not

1088
00:24:31,049 --> 00:24:31,059
development of the brain does not
 

1089
00:24:31,059 --> 00:24:34,289
development of the brain does not
proceed normally right properly think

1090
00:24:34,289 --> 00:24:34,299
proceed normally right properly think
 

1091
00:24:34,299 --> 00:24:35,970
proceed normally right properly think
about neurodevelopmental diseases there

1092
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:35,980
about neurodevelopmental diseases there
 

1093
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:38,430
about neurodevelopmental diseases there
are many many different types think

1094
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:38,440
are many many different types think
 

1095
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,989
are many many different types think
about all these own spectrum disorders

1096
00:24:39,989 --> 00:24:39,999
about all these own spectrum disorders
 

1097
00:24:39,999 --> 00:24:41,609
about all these own spectrum disorders
there are also many different types of

1098
00:24:41,609 --> 00:24:41,619
there are also many different types of
 

1099
00:24:41,619 --> 00:24:44,759
there are also many different types of
autism so there you could take a stem

1100
00:24:44,759 --> 00:24:44,769
autism so there you could take a stem
 

1101
00:24:44,769 --> 00:24:46,799
autism so there you could take a stem
cell which really means either a sample

1102
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:46,809
cell which really means either a sample
 

1103
00:24:46,809 --> 00:24:49,440
cell which really means either a sample
of blood or a sample of skin from the

1104
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:49,450
of blood or a sample of skin from the
 

1105
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:52,739
of blood or a sample of skin from the
patient make a stem cell and then with

1106
00:24:52,739 --> 00:24:52,749
patient make a stem cell and then with
 

1107
00:24:52,749 --> 00:24:55,440
patient make a stem cell and then with
that stem cell watch a process of

1108
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:55,450
that stem cell watch a process of
 

1109
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:57,899
that stem cell watch a process of
formation of a brain organ with of their

1110
00:24:57,899 --> 00:24:57,909
formation of a brain organ with of their
 

1111
00:24:57,909 --> 00:25:00,119
formation of a brain organ with of their
person the person with that genetics

1112
00:25:00,119 --> 00:25:00,129
person the person with that genetics
 

1113
00:25:00,129 --> 00:25:02,700
person the person with that genetics
with that genetic code in it and you can

1114
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:02,710
with that genetic code in it and you can
 

1115
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:05,970
with that genetic code in it and you can
ask what is this genetic code doing to

1116
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:05,980
ask what is this genetic code doing to
 

1117
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:08,580
ask what is this genetic code doing to
some aspects of development of the brain

1118
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:08,590
some aspects of development of the brain
 

1119
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:10,549
some aspects of development of the brain
for the first time you may come to

1120
00:25:10,549 --> 00:25:10,559
for the first time you may come to
 

1121
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:13,740
for the first time you may come to
solutions like what cells are involved

1122
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:13,750
solutions like what cells are involved
 

1123
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:16,919
solutions like what cells are involved
in autism so right so many questions

1124
00:25:16,919 --> 00:25:16,929
in autism so right so many questions
 

1125
00:25:16,929 --> 00:25:18,749
in autism so right so many questions
around this so if you take

1126
00:25:18,749 --> 00:25:18,759
around this so if you take
 

1127
00:25:18,759 --> 00:25:21,239
around this so if you take
this human stem cell for that particular

1128
00:25:21,239 --> 00:25:21,249
this human stem cell for that particular
 

1129
00:25:21,249 --> 00:25:24,060
this human stem cell for that particular
person with that genetic code how and

1130
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:24,070
person with that genetic code how and
 

1131
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:26,699
person with that genetic code how and
you try to build an organized yeah how

1132
00:25:26,699 --> 00:25:26,709
you try to build an organized yeah how
 

1133
00:25:26,709 --> 00:25:28,799
you try to build an organized yeah how
often will it look similar

1134
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:28,809
often will it look similar
 

1135
00:25:28,809 --> 00:25:34,319
often will it look similar
what's the produce ability yes or how

1136
00:25:34,319 --> 00:25:34,329
what's the produce ability yes or how
 

1137
00:25:34,329 --> 00:25:36,509
what's the produce ability yes or how
much variability its website of that

1138
00:25:36,509 --> 00:25:36,519
much variability its website of that
 

1139
00:25:36,519 --> 00:25:39,419
much variability its website of that
yeah so there is much more variability

1140
00:25:39,419 --> 00:25:39,429
yeah so there is much more variability
 

1141
00:25:39,429 --> 00:25:42,149
yeah so there is much more variability
in building organoids

1142
00:25:42,149 --> 00:25:42,159
in building organoids
 

1143
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:43,739
in building organoids
than there than there is in building

1144
00:25:43,739 --> 00:25:43,749
than there than there is in building
 

1145
00:25:43,749 --> 00:25:46,349
than there than there is in building
brain it's really true that the majority

1146
00:25:46,349 --> 00:25:46,359
brain it's really true that the majority
 

1147
00:25:46,359 --> 00:25:49,560
brain it's really true that the majority
of us when we are born as babies our

1148
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:49,570
of us when we are born as babies our
 

1149
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:52,559
of us when we are born as babies our
brains look a lot like each other this

1150
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:52,569
brains look a lot like each other this
 

1151
00:25:52,569 --> 00:25:55,049
brains look a lot like each other this
is the magic that the embryo does where

1152
00:25:55,049 --> 00:25:55,059
is the magic that the embryo does where
 

1153
00:25:55,059 --> 00:25:56,669
is the magic that the embryo does where
it builds a brain in the context of a

1154
00:25:56,669 --> 00:25:56,679
it builds a brain in the context of a
 

1155
00:25:56,679 --> 00:25:59,609
it builds a brain in the context of a
body and and there is very little

1156
00:25:59,609 --> 00:25:59,619
body and and there is very little
 

1157
00:25:59,619 --> 00:26:01,949
body and and there is very little
variability there there is disease of

1158
00:26:01,949 --> 00:26:01,959
variability there there is disease of
 

1159
00:26:01,959 --> 00:26:03,509
variability there there is disease of
course but in general little variability

1160
00:26:03,509 --> 00:26:03,519
course but in general little variability
 

1161
00:26:03,519 --> 00:26:07,109
course but in general little variability
when you build an organizer you know we

1162
00:26:07,109 --> 00:26:07,119
when you build an organizer you know we
 

1163
00:26:07,119 --> 00:26:09,029
when you build an organizer you know we
don't have the full code for how this is

1164
00:26:09,029 --> 00:26:09,039
don't have the full code for how this is
 

1165
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:11,069
don't have the full code for how this is
done and so in part the organoid

1166
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:11,079
done and so in part the organoid
 

1167
00:26:11,079 --> 00:26:14,129
done and so in part the organoid
somewhat built itself because there are

1168
00:26:14,129 --> 00:26:14,139
somewhat built itself because there are
 

1169
00:26:14,139 --> 00:26:15,779
somewhat built itself because there are
some structures of the brain that the

1170
00:26:15,779 --> 00:26:15,789
some structures of the brain that the
 

1171
00:26:15,789 --> 00:26:20,159
some structures of the brain that the
cells know how to make and another part

1172
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:20,169
cells know how to make and another part
 

1173
00:26:20,169 --> 00:26:21,719
cells know how to make and another part
comes from the investigator the

1174
00:26:21,719 --> 00:26:21,729
comes from the investigator the
 

1175
00:26:21,729 --> 00:26:25,919
comes from the investigator the
scientist add in to the media factors

1176
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:25,929
scientist add in to the media factors
 

1177
00:26:25,929 --> 00:26:27,509
scientist add in to the media factors
that we know in the mouse for example

1178
00:26:27,509 --> 00:26:27,519
that we know in the mouse for example
 

1179
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:29,609
that we know in the mouse for example
would foster a certain step of

1180
00:26:29,609 --> 00:26:29,619
would foster a certain step of
 

1181
00:26:29,619 --> 00:26:33,599
would foster a certain step of
development but it's very limited and so

1182
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:33,609
development but it's very limited and so
 

1183
00:26:33,609 --> 00:26:37,259
development but it's very limited and so
as a result the kind of product you get

1184
00:26:37,259 --> 00:26:37,269
as a result the kind of product you get
 

1185
00:26:37,269 --> 00:26:39,599
as a result the kind of product you get
in the end is much more reduction is

1186
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:39,609
in the end is much more reduction is
 

1187
00:26:39,609 --> 00:26:41,879
in the end is much more reduction is
this much more simple than what you get

1188
00:26:41,879 --> 00:26:41,889
this much more simple than what you get
 

1189
00:26:41,889 --> 00:26:44,219
this much more simple than what you get
in vivo it mimics early events of

1190
00:26:44,219 --> 00:26:44,229
in vivo it mimics early events of
 

1191
00:26:44,229 --> 00:26:47,189
in vivo it mimics early events of
development as of today and it doesn't

1192
00:26:47,189 --> 00:26:47,199
development as of today and it doesn't
 

1193
00:26:47,199 --> 00:26:49,139
development as of today and it doesn't
build very complex type of anatomy and

1194
00:26:49,139 --> 00:26:49,149
build very complex type of anatomy and
 

1195
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:52,709
build very complex type of anatomy and
structure does not as of today which

1196
00:26:52,709 --> 00:26:52,719
structure does not as of today which
 

1197
00:26:52,719 --> 00:26:56,549
structure does not as of today which
happens is that in in vivo and also the

1198
00:26:56,549 --> 00:26:56,559
happens is that in in vivo and also the
 

1199
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:59,819
happens is that in in vivo and also the
variability that you see one organ or to

1200
00:26:59,819 --> 00:26:59,829
variability that you see one organ or to
 

1201
00:26:59,829 --> 00:27:00,779
variability that you see one organ or to
the next

1202
00:27:00,779 --> 00:27:00,789
the next
 

1203
00:27:00,789 --> 00:27:03,749
the next
tends to be higher than we'll compare an

1204
00:27:03,749 --> 00:27:03,759
tends to be higher than we'll compare an
 

1205
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:06,509
tends to be higher than we'll compare an
embryo to the next so okay then the next

1206
00:27:06,509 --> 00:27:06,519
embryo to the next so okay then the next
 

1207
00:27:06,519 --> 00:27:09,629
embryo to the next so okay then the next
question is how hard and maybe another

1208
00:27:09,629 --> 00:27:09,639
question is how hard and maybe another
 

1209
00:27:09,639 --> 00:27:12,149
question is how hard and maybe another
flip side of that expensive is it to go

1210
00:27:12,149 --> 00:27:12,159
flip side of that expensive is it to go
 

1211
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:14,729
flip side of that expensive is it to go
from one stem cell to an organized yeah

1212
00:27:14,729 --> 00:27:14,739
from one stem cell to an organized yeah
 

1213
00:27:14,739 --> 00:27:16,919
from one stem cell to an organized yeah
how many can you build and like this

1214
00:27:16,919 --> 00:27:16,929
how many can you build and like this
 

1215
00:27:16,929 --> 00:27:17,969
how many can you build and like this
sounds very complicated

1216
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:17,979
sounds very complicated
 

1217
00:27:17,979 --> 00:27:21,539
sounds very complicated
it's work definitely and it's money

1218
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:21,549
it's work definitely and it's money
 

1219
00:27:21,549 --> 00:27:26,099
it's work definitely and it's money
definitely but you can really grow a

1220
00:27:26,099 --> 00:27:26,109
definitely but you can really grow a
 

1221
00:27:26,109 --> 00:27:29,940
definitely but you can really grow a
very high number of this organoids you

1222
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:29,950
very high number of this organoids you
 

1223
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:31,390
very high number of this organoids you
know can go

1224
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:31,400
know can go
 

1225
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,310
know can go
I told you the maximum they become about

1226
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:33,320
I told you the maximum they become about
 

1227
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,830
I told you the maximum they become about
five millimeters in diameter so this is

1228
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:35,840
five millimeters in diameter so this is
 

1229
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,980
five millimeters in diameter so this is
about the size of a of a tiny tiny you

1230
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:38,990
about the size of a of a tiny tiny you
 

1231
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:42,040
about the size of a of a tiny tiny you
know raising or perhaps the seed of an

1232
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:42,050
know raising or perhaps the seed of an
 

1233
00:27:42,050 --> 00:27:46,990
know raising or perhaps the seed of an
apple and so you can grow 50 to 100 of

1234
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:47,000
apple and so you can grow 50 to 100 of
 

1235
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,440
apple and so you can grow 50 to 100 of
those inside one big bioreactors which

1236
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:50,450
those inside one big bioreactors which
 

1237
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:52,030
those inside one big bioreactors which
are these flasks where the media

1238
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:52,040
are these flasks where the media
 

1239
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:54,660
are these flasks where the media
provides nutrients for the organoids

1240
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:54,670
provides nutrients for the organoids
 

1241
00:27:54,670 --> 00:27:59,020
provides nutrients for the organoids
so the problem is not to grow more or

1242
00:27:59,020 --> 00:27:59,030
so the problem is not to grow more or
 

1243
00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:04,030
so the problem is not to grow more or
less of them it it's really to figure

1244
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:04,040
less of them it it's really to figure
 

1245
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:06,940
less of them it it's really to figure
out how to grow them in a way that they

1246
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:06,950
out how to grow them in a way that they
 

1247
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:08,590
out how to grow them in a way that they
are more and more reproducible for

1248
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:08,600
are more and more reproducible for
 

1249
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,540
are more and more reproducible for
example orgonite organize so they can be

1250
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:10,550
example orgonite organize so they can be
 

1251
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:12,910
example orgonite organize so they can be
used to study a biological process

1252
00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:12,920
used to study a biological process
 

1253
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,950
used to study a biological process
because if you have too much variability

1254
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:14,960
because if you have too much variability
 

1255
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,260
because if you have too much variability
then you never know if what you see is

1256
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:17,270
then you never know if what you see is
 

1257
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:19,780
then you never know if what you see is
just an exception or really the rule so

1258
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:19,790
just an exception or really the rule so
 

1259
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:22,540
just an exception or really the rule so
what is an organize look like are there

1260
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:22,550
what is an organize look like are there
 

1261
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:25,210
what is an organize look like are there
different neurons already emerging is

1262
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:25,220
different neurons already emerging is
 

1263
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:27,850
different neurons already emerging is
there you know well first can you tell

1264
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:27,860
there you know well first can you tell
 

1265
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:30,160
there you know well first can you tell
me what kind of neurons are there yes

1266
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:30,170
me what kind of neurons are there yes
 

1267
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:35,890
me what kind of neurons are there yes
are they sort of all the same are they

1268
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:35,900
are they sort of all the same are they
 

1269
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:38,710
are they sort of all the same are they
not all the same as to how much do we

1270
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:38,720
not all the same as to how much do we
 

1271
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,770
not all the same as to how much do we
understand and how much of that variance

1272
00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:41,780
understand and how much of that variance
 

1273
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:47,890
understand and how much of that variance
if any can exist in organoids yes so you

1274
00:28:47,890 --> 00:28:47,900
if any can exist in organoids yes so you
 

1275
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:50,530
if any can exist in organoids yes so you
could grow I told you that the brain has

1276
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:50,540
could grow I told you that the brain has
 

1277
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:53,890
could grow I told you that the brain has
different parts so the cerebral cortex

1278
00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:53,900
different parts so the cerebral cortex
 

1279
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:55,810
different parts so the cerebral cortex
is on top at the top part of the brain

1280
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:55,820
is on top at the top part of the brain
 

1281
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:57,400
is on top at the top part of the brain
but there is another region called the

1282
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:57,410
but there is another region called the
 

1283
00:28:57,410 --> 00:28:59,320
but there is another region called the
striatum that is below the cortex and so

1284
00:28:59,320 --> 00:28:59,330
striatum that is below the cortex and so
 

1285
00:28:59,330 --> 00:29:00,970
striatum that is below the cortex and so
on and so forth all of these regions

1286
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:00,980
on and so forth all of these regions
 

1287
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:04,090
on and so forth all of these regions
have different types of cells in the

1288
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:04,100
have different types of cells in the
 

1289
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:07,150
have different types of cells in the
actual brain ok and so scientists have

1290
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:07,160
actual brain ok and so scientists have
 

1291
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:09,310
actual brain ok and so scientists have
been able to grow organoids that may

1292
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:09,320
been able to grow organoids that may
 

1293
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,530
been able to grow organoids that may
mimic some aspects of development of

1294
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:11,540
mimic some aspects of development of
 

1295
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:13,780
mimic some aspects of development of
these different regions of the brain and

1296
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:13,790
these different regions of the brain and
 

1297
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:15,550
these different regions of the brain and
so we are very interested in the

1298
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:15,560
so we are very interested in the
 

1299
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:20,670
so we are very interested in the
cerebral cortex that's the coolest part

1300
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:20,680

 

1301
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,750

you're talking if we didn't have a

1302
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:22,760
you're talking if we didn't have a
 

1303
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,640
you're talking if we didn't have a
cerebral cortex it's also I like to

1304
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:24,650
cerebral cortex it's also I like to
 

1305
00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:26,440
cerebral cortex it's also I like to
think the part of the brain that really

1306
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:26,450
think the part of the brain that really
 

1307
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:28,720
think the part of the brain that really
truly makes us human the most evolved in

1308
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:28,730
truly makes us human the most evolved in
 

1309
00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:31,690
truly makes us human the most evolved in
recent evolution and so in the attempt

1310
00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:31,700
recent evolution and so in the attempt
 

1311
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:34,030
recent evolution and so in the attempt
to make the cerebral cortex and by

1312
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:34,040
to make the cerebral cortex and by
 

1313
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:36,490
to make the cerebral cortex and by
figuring out a way to have this

1314
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:36,500
figuring out a way to have this
 

1315
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:38,500
figuring out a way to have this
organoids continue to grow and develop

1316
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:38,510
organoids continue to grow and develop
 

1317
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:40,810
organoids continue to grow and develop
for extended periods of times much like

1318
00:29:40,810 --> 00:29:40,820
for extended periods of times much like
 

1319
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:42,910
for extended periods of times much like
it happens in the real embryo months and

1320
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:42,920
it happens in the real embryo months and
 

1321
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,640
it happens in the real embryo months and
months in culture there

1322
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:44,650
months in culture there
 

1323
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:46,730
months in culture there
you can see that there many different

1324
00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:46,740
you can see that there many different
 

1325
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:49,920
you can see that there many different
types of neurons of the cortex appear

1326
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:49,930
types of neurons of the cortex appear
 

1327
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:52,320
types of neurons of the cortex appear
and at some point also the astrocytes to

1328
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:52,330
and at some point also the astrocytes to
 

1329
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:54,870
and at some point also the astrocytes to
the glia cells of the cerebral cortex

1330
00:29:54,870 --> 00:29:54,880
the glia cells of the cerebral cortex
 

1331
00:29:54,880 --> 00:30:00,510
the glia cells of the cerebral cortex
also appear what are these the

1332
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:00,520
also appear what are these the
 

1333
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,520
also appear what are these the
astrocytes are not neuron so they're not

1334
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:02,530
astrocytes are not neuron so they're not
 

1335
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:05,130
astrocytes are not neuron so they're not
nerve cells but they they play very

1336
00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:05,140
nerve cells but they they play very
 

1337
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:07,350
nerve cells but they they play very
important roles one important role is to

1338
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:07,360
important roles one important role is to
 

1339
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:10,230
important roles one important role is to
support the neuron but of course they

1340
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:10,240
support the neuron but of course they
 

1341
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,000
support the neuron but of course they
have much more active type of roles are

1342
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:12,010
have much more active type of roles are
 

1343
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:13,830
have much more active type of roles are
very important for example to make the

1344
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:13,840
very important for example to make the
 

1345
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,440
very important for example to make the
synapses which are the point of contacts

1346
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:16,450
synapses which are the point of contacts
 

1347
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:19,400
synapses which are the point of contacts
and communication between two neurons

1348
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:19,410
and communication between two neurons
 

1349
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:23,490
and communication between two neurons
they all that chemistry fun happens

1350
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:23,500
they all that chemistry fun happens
 

1351
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:27,600
they all that chemistry fun happens
between the synapses happens because of

1352
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:27,610
between the synapses happens because of
 

1353
00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:29,190
between the synapses happens because of
these cells are they the medium in which

1354
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:29,200
these cells are they the medium in which
 

1355
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,650
these cells are they the medium in which
it happens because of the interactions

1356
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:31,660
it happens because of the interactions
 

1357
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:33,840
it happens because of the interactions
happens because you are making the cells

1358
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:33,850
happens because you are making the cells
 

1359
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:36,240
happens because you are making the cells
and they have certain properties

1360
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:36,250
and they have certain properties
 

1361
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:39,390
and they have certain properties
including the ability to make you know

1362
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:39,400
including the ability to make you know
 

1363
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,799
including the ability to make you know
neurotransmitters which are the

1364
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:40,809
neurotransmitters which are the
 

1365
00:30:40,809 --> 00:30:42,210
neurotransmitters which are the
chemicals that are secreted to the

1366
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:42,220
chemicals that are secreted to the
 

1367
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:44,850
chemicals that are secreted to the
synapses including the ability of making

1368
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:44,860
synapses including the ability of making
 

1369
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:47,520
synapses including the ability of making
this axons grow with their growth cones

1370
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:47,530
this axons grow with their growth cones
 

1371
00:30:47,530 --> 00:30:49,890
this axons grow with their growth cones
and so on and so forth and then you have

1372
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:49,900
and so on and so forth and then you have
 

1373
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:52,020
and so on and so forth and then you have
other cells around there that release

1374
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:52,030
other cells around there that release
 

1375
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:55,380
other cells around there that release
chemicals or touch the neurons or

1376
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:55,390
chemicals or touch the neurons or
 

1377
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:57,360
chemicals or touch the neurons or
interact with them in different ways to

1378
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:57,370
interact with them in different ways to
 

1379
00:30:57,370 --> 00:31:00,000
interact with them in different ways to
really foster this perfect process in

1380
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:00,010
really foster this perfect process in
 

1381
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:03,210
really foster this perfect process in
this case of synaptogenesis and this

1382
00:31:03,210 --> 00:31:03,220
this case of synaptogenesis and this
 

1383
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:06,600
this case of synaptogenesis and this
does happen within within organized so

1384
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:06,610
does happen within within organized so
 

1385
00:31:06,610 --> 00:31:08,070
does happen within within organized so
the mechanical and the chemists and

1386
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:08,080
the mechanical and the chemists and
 

1387
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,900
the mechanical and the chemists and
chemical stuff happens yes the

1388
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:09,910
chemical stuff happens yes the
 

1389
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:12,090
chemical stuff happens yes the
connectivity between neurons this video

1390
00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:12,100
connectivity between neurons this video
 

1391
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:14,549
connectivity between neurons this video
why is not surprising because scientists

1392
00:31:14,549 --> 00:31:14,559
why is not surprising because scientists
 

1393
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:18,030
why is not surprising because scientists
have been culturing neurons forever and

1394
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:18,040
have been culturing neurons forever and
 

1395
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:20,070
have been culturing neurons forever and
when you take a new don't even a very

1396
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:20,080
when you take a new don't even a very
 

1397
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,990
when you take a new don't even a very
young one and you culture it eventually

1398
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:22,000
young one and you culture it eventually
 

1399
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,419
young one and you culture it eventually
finds another cell or another neuron to

1400
00:31:24,419 --> 00:31:24,429
finds another cell or another neuron to
 

1401
00:31:24,429 --> 00:31:27,210
finds another cell or another neuron to
talk to it will form a synapse are we

1402
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:27,220
talk to it will form a synapse are we
 

1403
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:29,610
talk to it will form a synapse are we
talking about Meisner on my human neuron

1404
00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:29,620
talking about Meisner on my human neuron
 

1405
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:31,020
talking about Meisner on my human neuron
it doesn't matter both so you can

1406
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:31,030
it doesn't matter both so you can
 

1407
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:32,940
it doesn't matter both so you can
culture and you out like a single neuron

1408
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:32,950
culture and you out like a single neuron
 

1409
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:35,790
culture and you out like a single neuron
and give it a little friend

1410
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:35,800
and give it a little friend
 

1411
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:39,120
and give it a little friend
and it starts interacting yes so neurons

1412
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:39,130
and it starts interacting yes so neurons
 

1413
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:41,970
and it starts interacting yes so neurons
are able to it sounds it's more simple

1414
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:41,980
are able to it sounds it's more simple
 

1415
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:45,030
are able to it sounds it's more simple
than what it may sound to you neurons

1416
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:45,040
than what it may sound to you neurons
 

1417
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,669
than what it may sound to you neurons
have molecular properties and structural

1418
00:31:47,669 --> 00:31:47,679
have molecular properties and structural
 

1419
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:49,320
have molecular properties and structural
properties allow them to really

1420
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:49,330
properties allow them to really
 

1421
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:51,600
properties allow them to really
communicate with other cells and so if

1422
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:51,610
communicate with other cells and so if
 

1423
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:53,790
communicate with other cells and so if
you put not one neuron but if you put

1424
00:31:53,790 --> 00:31:53,800
you put not one neuron but if you put
 

1425
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,860
you put not one neuron but if you put
several neurons together chances are

1426
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:55,870
several neurons together chances are
 

1427
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:58,409
several neurons together chances are

00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:17,609
the cerebral cortex for example so what
what can you understand about the brain

made think about that loop in a way it's
 

1471
00:32:55,659 --> 00:32:59,999
made think about that loop in a way it's
a little tiny rudimentary window into

developmental disease was being made and
 

1479
00:33:09,389 --> 00:33:12,200

I think that's unbelievably powerful

1480
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:12,210
I think that's unbelievably powerful
 

1481
00:33:12,210 --> 00:33:15,989
I think that's unbelievably powerful
because today we have no idea of what

00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:23,830
now we have an experimental system that
 

1489
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:26,039
now we have an experimental system that
we can study in the lab and we can ask

we can study in the lab and we can ask
 

1491
00:33:26,049 --> 00:33:29,399
we can study in the lab and we can ask
what are the cells affected when during

what are the cells affected when during
 

1493
00:33:29,409 --> 00:33:32,190
what are the cells affected when during
development things went wrong what are

00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:32,200
development things went wrong what are
 

1495
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,989
development things went wrong what are
the molecules among the many many

brain development which ones are the
 

1501
00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:39,509

ones they're really messed up here and
 

1503
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:42,659
ones they're really messed up here and
we want perhaps to fix and what is

00:33:42,659 --> 00:33:42,669
we want perhaps to fix and what is
 

1505
00:33:42,669 --> 00:33:45,450
we want perhaps to fix and what is
really the final product is it a less

1506
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:45,460
really the final product is it a less
 

1507
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:49,049
really the final product is it a less
strong kind of circuit and brain is it a

1508
00:33:49,049 --> 00:33:49,059
strong kind of circuit and brain is it a
 

1509
00:33:49,059 --> 00:33:51,210
strong kind of circuit and brain is it a
brain that lacks a cell type is it what

1510
00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:51,220
brain that lacks a cell type is it what
 

1511
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:53,539
brain that lacks a cell type is it what
is it because then we can think about

1512
00:33:53,539 --> 00:33:53,549
is it because then we can think about
 

1513
00:33:53,549 --> 00:33:57,090
is it because then we can think about
treatment and and care for these

1514
00:33:57,090 --> 00:33:57,100
treatment and and care for these
 

1515
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:59,879
treatment and and care for these

just based on current diagnostics so how

1518
00:34:02,369 --> 00:34:02,379
just based on current diagnostics so how
 

1519
00:34:02,379 --> 00:34:04,919
just based on current diagnostics so how
hard is it to detect through the

00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:04,929
hard is it to detect through the
 

1521
00:34:04,929 --> 00:34:06,330
hard is it to detect through the

1525
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:13,230
super-exciting mech tool
just to see how different conditions

1526
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:13,240
just to see how different conditions
 

1527
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:16,860
just to see how different conditions
develop how hard is it to detect it wait

1528
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:16,870
develop how hard is it to detect it wait
 

1529
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:19,970
develop how hard is it to detect it wait
a minute this is abnormal development

1530
00:34:19,970 --> 00:34:19,980
a minute this is abnormal development
 

1531
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:24,360
a minute this is abnormal development
yeah that's how hard is how much signal

1532
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:24,370
yeah that's how hard is how much signal
 

1533
00:34:24,370 --> 00:34:26,280
yeah that's how hard is how much signal
is there how much of it is is it a mess

1534
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:26,290
is there how much of it is is it a mess
 

1535
00:34:26,290 --> 00:34:28,320
is there how much of it is is it a mess
because things can go wrong multiple

1536
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:28,330
because things can go wrong multiple
 

1537
00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:31,890
because things can go wrong multiple
levels right you could have a cell that

1538
00:34:31,890 --> 00:34:31,900
levels right you could have a cell that
 

1539
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:35,220
levels right you could have a cell that
is born and built but then doesn't work

1540
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:35,230
is born and built but then doesn't work
 

1541
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:38,460
is born and built but then doesn't work
properly or a self is not even born or a

00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:38,470
properly or a self is not even born or a
 

1543
00:34:38,470 --> 00:34:40,140
properly or a self is not even born or a
cell does interact with other cell

1544
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:40,150
cell does interact with other cell
 

1545
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:42,080
cell does interact with other cell
differently and so on and so forth so

1546
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:42,090
differently and so on and so forth so
 

1547
00:34:42,090 --> 00:34:45,060
differently and so on and so forth so
today we have technology that we did not

1548
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:45,070
today we have technology that we did not
 

1549
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:48,600
today we have technology that we did not
have even five years ago that allows us

1550
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:48,610
have even five years ago that allows us
 

1551
00:34:48,610 --> 00:34:50,340
have even five years ago that allows us
to look for example at the molecular

1552
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:50,350
to look for example at the molecular
 

1553
00:34:50,350 --> 00:34:53,790
to look for example at the molecular
picture of a cell of a single cell in a

00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:53,800
picture of a cell of a single cell in a
 

1555
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:57,090
picture of a cell of a single cell in a
sea of cells with high precision and so

1556
00:34:57,090 --> 00:34:57,100
sea of cells with high precision and so
 

1557
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:59,160
sea of cells with high precision and so
that molecular information where you

1558
00:34:59,160 --> 00:34:59,170
that molecular information where you
 

1559
00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:02,130
that molecular information where you
compare many many single cells for the

1560
00:35:02,130 --> 00:35:02,140
compare many many single cells for the
 

1561
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:05,000
compare many many single cells for the
genes they produce between a control

1562
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:05,010
genes they produce between a control
 

1563
00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:07,950

1565
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:10,800
individual and an individual with and
your developmental disease that may tell

1566
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:10,810
your developmental disease that may tell
 

1567
00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:13,770
your developmental disease that may tell
you what is different molecular Li or

1568
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:13,780
you what is different molecular Li or
 

1569
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:16,950
you what is different molecular Li or
you could see that some cells are not

1570
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:16,960
you could see that some cells are not
 

1571
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,890
you could see that some cells are not
even made for example or that the

00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:19,900
even made for example or that the
 

1573
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:21,600
even made for example or that the
process of maturation of the cells may

00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:21,610
process of maturation of the cells may
 

1575
00:35:21,610 --> 00:35:24,000
process of maturation of the cells may
be wrong there are many different levels

1576
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:24,010
be wrong there are many different levels
 

1577
00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:28,860
be wrong there are many different levels
here and and we can study these cells at

1578
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:28,870
here and and we can study these cells at
 

1579
00:35:28,870 --> 00:35:30,720
here and and we can study these cells at
the molecular level but also we can use

1580
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:30,730
the molecular level but also we can use
 

1581
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:33,720
the molecular level but also we can use

00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:38,370
properties of the neurons the functional
properties how they communicate with

1586
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:38,380
properties how they communicate with
 

1587
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:39,840
properties how they communicate with
each other out they respond to a

1588
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:39,850
each other out they respond to a
 

1589
00:35:39,850 --> 00:35:41,670
each other out they respond to a
stimulus and so on and so forth and we

1590
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:41,680
stimulus and so on and so forth and we
 

1591
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:46,980
stimulus and so on and so forth and we
may get at abnormalities their detectors

1592
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:46,990
may get at abnormalities their detectors
 

1593
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:52,500
may get at abnormalities their detectors
so how early is this work in a maybe in

1594
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:52,510
so how early is this work in a maybe in
 

1595
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:58,320
so how early is this work in a maybe in
the history of science so I mean like so

1596
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:58,330
the history of science so I mean like so
 

1597
00:35:58,330 --> 00:36:01,920
the history of science so I mean like so
if you were to if you and I time travel

1598
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:01,930
if you were to if you and I time travel
 

1599
00:36:01,930 --> 00:36:04,970
if you were to if you and I time travel
a thousand years into the future

1600
00:36:04,970 --> 00:36:04,980
a thousand years into the future
 

1601
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:08,640
a thousand years into the future
organize seem to be maybe I'm

1602
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:08,650
organize seem to be maybe I'm
 

1603
00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:10,380
organize seem to be maybe I'm
romanticizing the notion but you're

1604
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:10,390
romanticizing the notion but you're
 

1605
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:14,190
romanticizing the notion but you're
building not a brain but something that

1606
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:14,200
building not a brain but something that
 

1607
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:16,200
building not a brain but something that
has properties of a brain so you it

1608
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:16,210
has properties of a brain so you it
 

1609
00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:18,350
has properties of a brain so you it
feels like you might be getting close to

1610
00:36:18,350 --> 00:36:18,360
feels like you might be getting close to
 

1611
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:21,510
feels like you might be getting close to
in the building process thought to build

1612
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:21,520
in the building process thought to build
 

1613
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,170
in the building process thought to build
us to understand

1614
00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:23,180
us to understand
 

1615
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:28,480
us to understand
so how how far are we in this

1616
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:28,490
so how how far are we in this
 

1617
00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:31,020
so how how far are we in this
understanding process of development

1618
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:31,030
understanding process of development
 

1619
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:33,280
understanding process of development
thousand years from now it's a long time

1620
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:33,290
thousand years from now it's a long time
 

1621
00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:35,500
thousand years from now it's a long time
from now so if this planet is still

1622
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:35,510
from now so if this planet is still
 

1623
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:37,360
from now so if this planet is still
gonna be here and a thousand years from

1624
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:37,370
gonna be here and a thousand years from
 

1625
00:36:37,370 --> 00:36:41,580
gonna be here and a thousand years from
now you know like they write a book

1626
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:41,590
now you know like they write a book
 

1627
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:43,900
now you know like they write a book
obviously you there'll be a chapter

1628
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:43,910
obviously you there'll be a chapter
 

1629
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:45,940
obviously you there'll be a chapter
about you that science fiction book

1630
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:45,950
about you that science fiction book
 

1631
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:50,080
about you that science fiction book
today today but I mean I guess where we

1632
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:50,090
today today but I mean I guess where we
 

1633
00:36:50,090 --> 00:36:51,670
today today but I mean I guess where we
really understood very little about the

1634
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:51,680
really understood very little about the
 

1635
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:55,600
really understood very little about the
brain a century ago was big fan in high

1636
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:55,610
brain a century ago was big fan in high
 

1637
00:36:55,610 --> 00:36:57,520
brain a century ago was big fan in high
school reading Freud and so on and still

1638
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:57,530
school reading Freud and so on and still
 

1639
00:36:57,530 --> 00:37:00,460
school reading Freud and so on and still
AM of Psychiatry I would say we still

1640
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:00,470
AM of Psychiatry I would say we still
 

1641
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:02,020
AM of Psychiatry I would say we still
understand very little about the

1642
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:02,030
understand very little about the
 

1643
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:05,740
understand very little about the
functional aspect of just yeah but how

1644
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:05,750
functional aspect of just yeah but how
 

1645
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:07,840
functional aspect of just yeah but how
in the history of understanding the

1646
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:07,850
in the history of understanding the
 

1647
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:09,880
in the history of understanding the
biology of the brain the development how

1648
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:09,890
biology of the brain the development how
 

1649
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:11,890
biology of the brain the development how
far are we alone it's a very good

1650
00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:11,900
far are we alone it's a very good
 

1651
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:13,990
far are we alone it's a very good
question and so this is just of course

1652
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:14,000
question and so this is just of course
 

1653
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,610
question and so this is just of course
my opinion I think that we did not have

1654
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:17,620
my opinion I think that we did not have
 

1655
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:21,070
my opinion I think that we did not have
technology even ten years ago or 20

1656
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:21,080
technology even ten years ago or 20
 

1657
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:24,310
technology even ten years ago or 20
certainly not 20 years ago to even think

1658
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:24,320
certainly not 20 years ago to even think
 

1659
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:27,910
certainly not 20 years ago to even think
about experimentally investigating the

1660
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:27,920
about experimentally investigating the
 

1661
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,520
about experimentally investigating the
development of the human brain so we've

1662
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:30,530
development of the human brain so we've
 

1663
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:32,350
development of the human brain so we've
done a lot of work in science to study

1664
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:32,360
done a lot of work in science to study
 

1665
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:36,190
done a lot of work in science to study
the brain or many other organisms now we

1666
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:36,200
the brain or many other organisms now we
 

1667
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,920
the brain or many other organisms now we
have some technologies which I'll spell

1668
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:38,930
have some technologies which I'll spell
 

1669
00:37:38,930 --> 00:37:42,100
have some technologies which I'll spell
out that allow us to actually look at

1670
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:42,110
out that allow us to actually look at
 

1671
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:43,990
out that allow us to actually look at
the real thing and look at the brain at

1672
00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:44,000
the real thing and look at the brain at
 

1673
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,790
the real thing and look at the brain at
the human brain so what are these

1674
00:37:45,790 --> 00:37:45,800
the human brain so what are these
 

1675
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:48,550
the human brain so what are these
technologies there is been huge progress

1676
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:48,560
technologies there is been huge progress
 

1677
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:51,220
technologies there is been huge progress
in stem cell biology the moment someone

1678
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:51,230
in stem cell biology the moment someone
 

1679
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:54,490
in stem cell biology the moment someone
figured out how to turn a skin cell into

1680
00:37:54,490 --> 00:37:54,500
figured out how to turn a skin cell into
 

1681
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:57,100
figured out how to turn a skin cell into
an embryonic stem cell basically and

1682
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:57,110
an embryonic stem cell basically and
 

1683
00:37:57,110 --> 00:38:00,340
an embryonic stem cell basically and
that out that embryonic stem cell could

1684
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:00,350
that out that embryonic stem cell could
 

1685
00:38:00,350 --> 00:38:02,620
that out that embryonic stem cell could
begin a process of development again to

1686
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:02,630
begin a process of development again to
 

1687
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:04,120
begin a process of development again to
correct for example make a brain there

1688
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:04,130
correct for example make a brain there
 

1689
00:38:04,130 --> 00:38:06,220
correct for example make a brain there
was a huge and you know advance and in

1690
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:06,230
was a huge and you know advance and in
 

1691
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:07,420
was a huge and you know advance and in
fact there was a Nobel Prize for that

1692
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:07,430
fact there was a Nobel Prize for that
 

1693
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:11,050
fact there was a Nobel Prize for that
that started the field really of using

1694
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:11,060
that started the field really of using
 

1695
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:14,770
that started the field really of using
stem cells to build organs now we can

1696
00:38:14,770 --> 00:38:14,780
stem cells to build organs now we can
 

1697
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:16,210
stem cells to build organs now we can
build on all the knowledge of

1698
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:16,220
build on all the knowledge of
 

1699
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:17,830
build on all the knowledge of
development that we build over the many

1700
00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:17,840
development that we build over the many
 

1701
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,600
development that we build over the many
many many years to say how do we make

1702
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:19,610
many many years to say how do we make
 

1703
00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:21,580
many many years to say how do we make
the stem cells now make more and more

1704
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:21,590
the stem cells now make more and more
 

1705
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:23,500
the stem cells now make more and more
complex aspects of development of the

1706
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:23,510
complex aspects of development of the
 

1707
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:27,070
complex aspects of development of the
human brain so this field is younger the

1708
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:27,080
human brain so this field is younger the
 

1709
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:29,050
human brain so this field is younger the
field of brain organics but is moving

1710
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:29,060
field of brain organics but is moving
 

1711
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:31,570
field of brain organics but is moving
faster and it's moving fast in a very

1712
00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:31,580
faster and it's moving fast in a very
 

1713
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:33,940
faster and it's moving fast in a very
serious way that is rooted in labs with

1714
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:33,950
serious way that is rooted in labs with
 

1715
00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:36,010
serious way that is rooted in labs with
the right ethical framework

1716
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:36,020
the right ethical framework
 

1717
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:39,520
the right ethical framework
and and really building on you know

1718
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:39,530
and and really building on you know
 

1719
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:42,370
and and really building on you know
solid science for reality is and what is

1720
00:38:42,370 --> 00:38:42,380
solid science for reality is and what is
 

1721
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:46,330
solid science for reality is and what is
not and but it will go faster and it

1722
00:38:46,330 --> 00:38:46,340
not and but it will go faster and it
 

1723
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:49,510
not and but it will go faster and it
will be more and more powerful we also

1724
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:49,520
will be more and more powerful we also
 

1725
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,430
will be more and more powerful we also
have technology that allows us to

1726
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:51,440
have technology that allows us to
 

1727
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,650
have technology that allows us to
basically study the properties of single

1728
00:38:53,650 --> 00:38:53,660
basically study the properties of single
 

1729
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:57,700
basically study the properties of single
cells across many many millions of

1730
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:57,710
cells across many many millions of
 

1731
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:59,980
cells across many many millions of
single cells which we didn't have

1732
00:38:59,980 --> 00:38:59,990
single cells which we didn't have
 

1733
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:02,820
single cells which we didn't have
perhaps five years ago so now with that

1734
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:02,830
perhaps five years ago so now with that
 

1735
00:39:02,830 --> 00:39:05,740
perhaps five years ago so now with that
even an organ or that has millions of

1736
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:05,750
even an organ or that has millions of
 

1737
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:09,000
even an organ or that has millions of
cells can be profiled in a way looked at

1738
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:09,010
cells can be profiled in a way looked at
 

1739
00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:11,740
cells can be profiled in a way looked at
very very high resolution the single

1740
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:11,750
very very high resolution the single
 

1741
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:14,170
very very high resolution the single
cell level to really understand what is

1742
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:14,180
cell level to really understand what is
 

1743
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:16,090
cell level to really understand what is
going on and you could do it in multiple

1744
00:39:16,090 --> 00:39:16,100
going on and you could do it in multiple
 

1745
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:17,920
going on and you could do it in multiple
stages of development and you can build

1746
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:17,930
stages of development and you can build
 

1747
00:39:17,930 --> 00:39:19,600
stages of development and you can build
your hypothesis and so on and so forth

1748
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:19,610
your hypothesis and so on and so forth
 

1749
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:22,270
your hypothesis and so on and so forth
so it's not going to be a thousand years

1750
00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:22,280
so it's not going to be a thousand years
 

1751
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:24,760
so it's not going to be a thousand years
it's gonna be a shorter amount of time

1752
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:24,770
it's gonna be a shorter amount of time
 

1753
00:39:24,770 --> 00:39:27,580
it's gonna be a shorter amount of time
and I see this as sort of a an

1754
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:27,590
and I see this as sort of a an
 

1755
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:31,030
and I see this as sort of a an
exponential growth of this field enabled

1756
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:31,040
exponential growth of this field enabled
 

1757
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:34,060
exponential growth of this field enabled
by these technologies that we didn't

1758
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:34,070
by these technologies that we didn't
 

1759
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:34,780
by these technologies that we didn't
have before

1760
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:34,790
have before
 

1761
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:36,040
have before
and so we're gonna see something

1762
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:36,050
and so we're gonna see something
 

1763
00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:38,770
and so we're gonna see something
transformative that we didn't see at all

1764
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:38,780
transformative that we didn't see at all
 

1765
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:42,340
transformative that we didn't see at all
in the prior thousand years so I

1766
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:42,350
in the prior thousand years so I
 

1767
00:39:42,350 --> 00:39:44,470
in the prior thousand years so I
apologize for the crazy sci-fi questions

1768
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:44,480
apologize for the crazy sci-fi questions
 

1769
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:47,530
apologize for the crazy sci-fi questions
but the developmental process is

1770
00:39:47,530 --> 00:39:47,540
but the developmental process is
 

1771
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:50,650
but the developmental process is
fascinating to watch and study but how

1772
00:39:50,650 --> 00:39:50,660
fascinating to watch and study but how
 

1773
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:55,090
fascinating to watch and study but how
far are we away from and maybe how

1774
00:39:55,090 --> 00:39:55,100
far are we away from and maybe how
 

1775
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:57,790
far are we away from and maybe how
difficult is it to build not just an

1776
00:39:57,790 --> 00:39:57,800
difficult is it to build not just an
 

1777
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:01,599
difficult is it to build not just an
organ or but a human brain okay from us

1778
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:01,609
organ or but a human brain okay from us
 

1779
00:40:01,609 --> 00:40:04,840
organ or but a human brain okay from us
themself yeah first of all that's not

1780
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:04,850
themself yeah first of all that's not
 

1781
00:40:04,850 --> 00:40:07,060
themself yeah first of all that's not
the goal for the majority of the serious

1782
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:07,070
the goal for the majority of the serious
 

1783
00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:10,420
the goal for the majority of the serious
scientists that work on this because you

1784
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:10,430
scientists that work on this because you
 

1785
00:40:10,430 --> 00:40:13,330
scientists that work on this because you
don't have to build the whole human

1786
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:13,340
don't have to build the whole human
 

1787
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:16,270
don't have to build the whole human
brain to make this model useful for

1788
00:40:16,270 --> 00:40:16,280
brain to make this model useful for
 

1789
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:18,090
brain to make this model useful for
understanding of the brain develops or

1790
00:40:18,090 --> 00:40:18,100
understanding of the brain develops or
 

1791
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:20,859
understanding of the brain develops or
understanding disease you don't have to

1792
00:40:20,859 --> 00:40:20,869
understanding disease you don't have to
 

1793
00:40:20,869 --> 00:40:22,120
understanding disease you don't have to
build the whole thing

1794
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:22,130
build the whole thing
 

1795
00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:24,010
build the whole thing
so let me is let me just comment on that

1796
00:40:24,010 --> 00:40:24,020
so let me is let me just comment on that
 

1797
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:26,859
so let me is let me just comment on that
it's fascinating it shows to me the

1798
00:40:26,859 --> 00:40:26,869
it's fascinating it shows to me the
 

1799
00:40:26,869 --> 00:40:29,950
it's fascinating it shows to me the
difference between you and I is you're

1800
00:40:29,950 --> 00:40:29,960
difference between you and I is you're
 

1801
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:32,050
difference between you and I is you're
actually trying to understand the beauty

1802
00:40:32,050 --> 00:40:32,060
actually trying to understand the beauty
 

1803
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:34,330
actually trying to understand the beauty
of the human brain and to use it to

1804
00:40:34,330 --> 00:40:34,340
of the human brain and to use it to
 

1805
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:36,460
of the human brain and to use it to
really help thousands or millions of

1806
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:36,470
really help thousands or millions of
 

1807
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:39,099
really help thousands or millions of
people disease and so on right from an

1808
00:40:39,099 --> 00:40:39,109
people disease and so on right from an
 

1809
00:40:39,109 --> 00:40:41,800
people disease and so on right from an
artificial intelligence but we're trying

1810
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:41,810
artificial intelligence but we're trying
 

1811
00:40:41,810 --> 00:40:44,380
artificial intelligence but we're trying
to build systems that we can put in

1812
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:44,390
to build systems that we can put in
 

1813
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:47,740
to build systems that we can put in
robots and try to create systems that

1814
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:47,750
robots and try to create systems that
 

1815
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:50,170
robots and try to create systems that
have echoes of the intelligence

1816
00:40:50,170 --> 00:40:50,180
have echoes of the intelligence
 

1817
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:52,270
have echoes of the intelligence
about reasoning about the world

1818
00:40:52,270 --> 00:40:52,280
about reasoning about the world
 

1819
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,830
about reasoning about the world
navigating the world its

1820
00:40:53,830 --> 00:40:53,840
navigating the world its
 

1821
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:58,900
navigating the world its
its different objectives I think we

1822
00:40:58,900 --> 00:40:58,910
its different objectives I think we
 

1823
00:40:58,910 --> 00:41:00,700
its different objectives I think we
operate in size fix a little bit but so

1824
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:00,710
operate in size fix a little bit but so
 

1825
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:03,340
operate in size fix a little bit but so
so on that point of building a brain

1826
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:03,350
so on that point of building a brain
 

1827
00:41:03,350 --> 00:41:05,350
so on that point of building a brain
even though that is not the focus or

1828
00:41:05,350 --> 00:41:05,360
even though that is not the focus or
 

1829
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:07,420
even though that is not the focus or
interest perhaps of the community how

1830
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:07,430
interest perhaps of the community how
 

1831
00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:09,430
interest perhaps of the community how
difficult is it is it truly science

1832
00:41:09,430 --> 00:41:09,440
difficult is it is it truly science
 

1833
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:12,040
difficult is it is it truly science
fiction at this point I think the field

1834
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:12,050
fiction at this point I think the field
 

1835
00:41:12,050 --> 00:41:15,280
fiction at this point I think the field
will progress like I said and that the

1836
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:15,290
will progress like I said and that the
 

1837
00:41:15,290 --> 00:41:17,380
will progress like I said and that the
system will be more and more complex in

1838
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:17,390
system will be more and more complex in
 

1839
00:41:17,390 --> 00:41:20,580
system will be more and more complex in
a way right but there are properties

1840
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:20,590
a way right but there are properties
 

1841
00:41:20,590 --> 00:41:23,980
a way right but there are properties
that emerge from the human brain they

1842
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:23,990
that emerge from the human brain they
 

1843
00:41:23,990 --> 00:41:25,810
that emerge from the human brain they
have to do with the mind they may have

1844
00:41:25,810 --> 00:41:25,820
have to do with the mind they may have
 

1845
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:27,370
have to do with the mind they may have
to do with conscious name I have to do

1846
00:41:27,370 --> 00:41:27,380
to do with conscious name I have to do
 

1847
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:30,100
to do with conscious name I have to do
with intelligence or whatever that we

1848
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:30,110
with intelligence or whatever that we
 

1849
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:32,290
with intelligence or whatever that we
don't really don't don't understand even

1850
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:32,300
don't really don't don't understand even
 

1851
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:34,960
don't really don't don't understand even
now they can emerge from an actual real

1852
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:34,970
now they can emerge from an actual real
 

1853
00:41:34,970 --> 00:41:36,970
now they can emerge from an actual real
brain and therefore we cannot measure or

1854
00:41:36,970 --> 00:41:36,980
brain and therefore we cannot measure or
 

1855
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:41,080
brain and therefore we cannot measure or
study in an organized so so I think that

1856
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:41,090
study in an organized so so I think that
 

1857
00:41:41,090 --> 00:41:43,210
study in an organized so so I think that
this field many many years from now may

1858
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:43,220
this field many many years from now may
 

1859
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:46,180
this field many many years from now may
lead to the building of better neural

1860
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:46,190
lead to the building of better neural
 

1861
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:48,970
lead to the building of better neural
circuits of you know that really are

1862
00:41:48,970 --> 00:41:48,980
circuits of you know that really are
 

1863
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:50,770
circuits of you know that really are
built out of understanding about this

1864
00:41:50,770 --> 00:41:50,780
built out of understanding about this
 

1865
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:52,990
built out of understanding about this
process really works and it's hard to

1866
00:41:52,990 --> 00:41:53,000
process really works and it's hard to
 

1867
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,560
process really works and it's hard to
predict how complex this really will be

1868
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:56,570
predict how complex this really will be
 

1869
00:41:56,570 --> 00:41:59,440
predict how complex this really will be
I really don't think we're so far from

1870
00:41:59,440 --> 00:41:59,450
I really don't think we're so far from
 

1871
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:01,780
I really don't think we're so far from
it makes me laugh really it's really

1872
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:01,790
it makes me laugh really it's really
 

1873
00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:04,450
it makes me laugh really it's really
that far from building the human the

1874
00:42:04,450 --> 00:42:04,460
that far from building the human the
 

1875
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:06,520
that far from building the human the
human brain but you're gonna be building

1876
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:06,530
human brain but you're gonna be building
 

1877
00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:10,300
human brain but you're gonna be building
something that is you know always a bad

1878
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:10,310
something that is you know always a bad
 

1879
00:42:10,310 --> 00:42:13,390
something that is you know always a bad
version of it but that may have really

1880
00:42:13,390 --> 00:42:13,400
version of it but that may have really
 

1881
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:16,000
version of it but that may have really
powerful properties and might be able to

1882
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:16,010
powerful properties and might be able to
 

1883
00:42:16,010 --> 00:42:19,600
powerful properties and might be able to
you know respond to stimuli or or be

1884
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:19,610
you know respond to stimuli or or be
 

1885
00:42:19,610 --> 00:42:22,390
you know respond to stimuli or or be
used in in certain context and this is

1886
00:42:22,390 --> 00:42:22,400
used in in certain context and this is
 

1887
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,280
used in in certain context and this is
why I really think that there is no

1888
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:24,290
why I really think that there is no
 

1889
00:42:24,290 --> 00:42:26,170
why I really think that there is no
other way to do this science but within

1890
00:42:26,170 --> 00:42:26,180
other way to do this science but within
 

1891
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:28,480
other way to do this science but within
the right ethical framework because

1892
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:28,490
the right ethical framework because
 

1893
00:42:28,490 --> 00:42:31,390
the right ethical framework because
where you're going with this is also you

1894
00:42:31,390 --> 00:42:31,400
where you're going with this is also you
 

1895
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,040
where you're going with this is also you
know we can talk about science fiction

1896
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:33,050
know we can talk about science fiction
 

1897
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:35,850
know we can talk about science fiction
and write that book and we could today

1898
00:42:35,850 --> 00:42:35,860
and write that book and we could today
 

1899
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:40,210
and write that book and we could today
but this work happens in a specific

1900
00:42:40,210 --> 00:42:40,220
but this work happens in a specific
 

1901
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:42,310
but this work happens in a specific
ethical framework that we don't decide

1902
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:42,320
ethical framework that we don't decide
 

1903
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:44,070
ethical framework that we don't decide
just a scientist but also as a society

1904
00:42:44,070 --> 00:42:44,080
just a scientist but also as a society
 

1905
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:47,680
just a scientist but also as a society
so the ethical framework here is a

1906
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:47,690
so the ethical framework here is a
 

1907
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:50,310
so the ethical framework here is a
fascinating one is the complicated one

1908
00:42:50,310 --> 00:42:50,320
fascinating one is the complicated one
 

1909
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:53,650
fascinating one is the complicated one
do you have a sense a grasp of how we

1910
00:42:53,650 --> 00:42:53,660
do you have a sense a grasp of how we
 

1911
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:57,940
do you have a sense a grasp of how we
think about ethically of building

1912
00:42:57,940 --> 00:42:57,950
think about ethically of building
 

1913
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:59,910
think about ethically of building
organoids

1914
00:42:59,910 --> 00:42:59,920
organoids
 

1915
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:02,970
organoids
from human stem cells to understand the

00:43:02,970 --> 00:43:02,980
from human stem cells to understand the
 

1917
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:07,069
from human stem cells to understand the
brain it seems like a tool for helping

1918
00:43:07,069 --> 00:43:07,079
brain it seems like a tool for helping
 

1919
00:43:07,079 --> 00:43:10,019
brain it seems like a tool for helping
potentially millions of people cure

1920
00:43:10,019 --> 00:43:10,029
potentially millions of people cure
 

1921
00:43:10,029 --> 00:43:13,829
potentially millions of people cure
diseases are at least start the cure by

1922
00:43:13,829 --> 00:43:13,839
diseases are at least start the cure by
 

1923
00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:16,650
diseases are at least start the cure by
understanding it but is there more is

1924
00:43:16,650 --> 00:43:16,660
understanding it but is there more is
 

1925
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:21,120
understanding it but is there more is
there gray areas that are at the that we

1926
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:21,130
there gray areas that are at the that we
 

1927
00:43:21,130 --> 00:43:22,980
there gray areas that are at the that we
have to think about ethically absolutely

1928
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:22,990
have to think about ethically absolutely
 

1929
00:43:22,990 --> 00:43:26,000
have to think about ethically absolutely
we must think about that every

1930
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:26,010
we must think about that every
 

1931
00:43:26,010 --> 00:43:28,920
we must think about that every
discussion about the ethics of this

1932
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:28,930
discussion about the ethics of this
 

1933
00:43:28,930 --> 00:43:32,970
discussion about the ethics of this
needs to be based on actual data from

1934
00:43:32,970 --> 00:43:32,980
needs to be based on actual data from
 

1935
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:34,829
needs to be based on actual data from
the models that we have today and from

1936
00:43:34,829 --> 00:43:34,839
the models that we have today and from
 

1937
00:43:34,839 --> 00:43:36,509
the models that we have today and from
the ones that we will have tomorrow so

1938
00:43:36,509 --> 00:43:36,519
the ones that we will have tomorrow so
 

1939
00:43:36,519 --> 00:43:38,130
the ones that we will have tomorrow so
it's a continuous conversation it's not

1940
00:43:38,130 --> 00:43:38,140
it's a continuous conversation it's not
 

1941
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:40,170
it's a continuous conversation it's not
something that you decide now today

1942
00:43:40,170 --> 00:43:40,180
something that you decide now today
 

1943
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:42,599
something that you decide now today
there is no issue really very simple

1944
00:43:42,599 --> 00:43:42,609
there is no issue really very simple
 

1945
00:43:42,609 --> 00:43:45,870
there is no issue really very simple
models they that clearly can help you in

1946
00:43:45,870 --> 00:43:45,880
models they that clearly can help you in
 

1947
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:49,380
models they that clearly can help you in
many ways without much much think about

1948
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:49,390
many ways without much much think about
 

1949
00:43:49,390 --> 00:43:51,569
many ways without much much think about
but tomorrow we need to have another

1950
00:43:51,569 --> 00:43:51,579
but tomorrow we need to have another
 

1951
00:43:51,579 --> 00:43:53,130
but tomorrow we need to have another
conversation and so on and so forth and

1952
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:53,140
conversation and so on and so forth and
 

1953
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:55,309
conversation and so on and so forth and
so the way we do this is to actually

1954
00:43:55,309 --> 00:43:55,319
so the way we do this is to actually
 

1955
00:43:55,319 --> 00:43:58,289
so the way we do this is to actually
really bring together constantly a group

1956
00:43:58,289 --> 00:43:58,299
really bring together constantly a group
 

1957
00:43:58,299 --> 00:44:00,450
really bring together constantly a group
of people that are not only scientists

1958
00:44:00,450 --> 00:44:00,460
of people that are not only scientists
 

1959
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:02,339
of people that are not only scientists
but also bioethicists the lawyers

1960
00:44:02,339 --> 00:44:02,349
but also bioethicists the lawyers
 

1961
00:44:02,349 --> 00:44:04,710
but also bioethicists the lawyers
philosophers psychiatrist and so on as a

1962
00:44:04,710 --> 00:44:04,720
philosophers psychiatrist and so on as a
 

1963
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:07,190
philosophers psychiatrist and so on as a
psychologist and so on and so forth to

1964
00:44:07,190 --> 00:44:07,200
psychologist and so on and so forth to
 

1965
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:12,660
psychologist and so on and so forth to
decide as a society really what we

1966
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:12,670
decide as a society really what we
 

1967
00:44:12,670 --> 00:44:15,450
decide as a society really what we
should and what we should not do so

1968
00:44:15,450 --> 00:44:15,460
should and what we should not do so
 

1969
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:17,549
should and what we should not do so
that's the way to think about the ethics

1970
00:44:17,549 --> 00:44:17,559
that's the way to think about the ethics
 

1971
00:44:17,559 --> 00:44:19,980
that's the way to think about the ethics
now I also think though that as a

1972
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:19,990
now I also think though that as a
 

1973
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:22,880
now I also think though that as a
scientist I have a moral responsibility

1974
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:22,890
scientist I have a moral responsibility
 

1975
00:44:22,890 --> 00:44:26,460
scientist I have a moral responsibility
so if you if you think about how

1976
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:26,470
so if you if you think about how
 

1977
00:44:26,470 --> 00:44:29,759
so if you if you think about how
transformative it could be for

1978
00:44:29,759 --> 00:44:29,769
transformative it could be for
 

1979
00:44:29,769 --> 00:44:31,410
transformative it could be for
understanding and curing a

1980
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:31,420
understanding and curing a
 

1981
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:33,230
understanding and curing a
neuropsychiatrist

1982
00:44:33,230 --> 00:44:33,240
neuropsychiatrist
 

1983
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:36,599
neuropsychiatrist
to be able to actually watch and study

1984
00:44:36,599 --> 00:44:36,609
to be able to actually watch and study
 

1985
00:44:36,609 --> 00:44:39,980
to be able to actually watch and study
and treat with drugs the very brain of

1986
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:39,990
and treat with drugs the very brain of
 

1987
00:44:39,990 --> 00:44:42,539
and treat with drugs the very brain of
the patient that you are trying to study

1988
00:44:42,539 --> 00:44:42,549
the patient that you are trying to study
 

1989
00:44:42,549 --> 00:44:45,630
the patient that you are trying to study
how transformative at this moment in

1990
00:44:45,630 --> 00:44:45,640
how transformative at this moment in
 

1991
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:47,910
how transformative at this moment in
time this could be we couldn't do it

1992
00:44:47,910 --> 00:44:47,920
time this could be we couldn't do it
 

1993
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:50,160
time this could be we couldn't do it
five years ago we could do it now right

1994
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:50,170
five years ago we could do it now right
 

1995
00:44:50,170 --> 00:44:52,980
five years ago we could do it now right
if taking of a particular patient

1996
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:52,990
if taking of a particular patient
 

1997
00:44:52,990 --> 00:44:55,259
if taking of a particular patient
patient and make an organ or for a

1998
00:44:55,259 --> 00:44:55,269
patient and make an organ or for a
 

1999
00:44:55,269 --> 00:44:57,839
patient and make an organ or for a
simple and you know different from the

2000
00:44:57,839 --> 00:44:57,849
simple and you know different from the
 

2001
00:44:57,849 --> 00:45:00,059
simple and you know different from the
from the human brain he still is his

2002
00:45:00,059 --> 00:45:00,069
from the human brain he still is his
 

2003
00:45:00,069 --> 00:45:02,460
from the human brain he still is his
process of brain development with his

2004
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:02,470
process of brain development with his
 

2005
00:45:02,470 --> 00:45:05,700
process of brain development with his
with his or her genetics and we could

2006
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:05,710
with his or her genetics and we could
 

2007
00:45:05,710 --> 00:45:07,460
with his or her genetics and we could
understand perhaps what is going wrong

2008
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:07,470
understand perhaps what is going wrong
 

2009
00:45:07,470 --> 00:45:10,049
understand perhaps what is going wrong
perhaps we could use as a platform as a

2010
00:45:10,049 --> 00:45:10,059
perhaps we could use as a platform as a
 

2011
00:45:10,059 --> 00:45:12,269
perhaps we could use as a platform as a
cellular platform to screen for drugs to

2012
00:45:12,269 --> 00:45:12,279
cellular platform to screen for drugs to
 

2013
00:45:12,279 --> 00:45:13,680
cellular platform to screen for drugs to
fix a process

2014
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:13,690
fix a process
 

2015
00:45:13,690 --> 00:45:16,260
fix a process
and so on and so forth right so we could

2016
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:16,270
and so on and so forth right so we could
 

2017
00:45:16,270 --> 00:45:18,090
and so on and so forth right so we could
do it now we couldn't do it five years

2018
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:18,100
do it now we couldn't do it five years
 

2019
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:21,840
do it now we couldn't do it five years
ago should we not do it what is the

2020
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:21,850
ago should we not do it what is the
 

2021
00:45:21,850 --> 00:45:25,320
ago should we not do it what is the
downside of doing it I don't see a

2022
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:25,330
downside of doing it I don't see a
 

2023
00:45:25,330 --> 00:45:27,930
downside of doing it I don't see a
downside if you would but if we invited

2024
00:45:27,930 --> 00:45:27,940
downside if you would but if we invited
 

2025
00:45:27,940 --> 00:45:30,540
downside if you would but if we invited
a lot of people yes if I'm sure there

2026
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:30,550
a lot of people yes if I'm sure there
 

2027
00:45:30,550 --> 00:45:32,640
a lot of people yes if I'm sure there
would be somebody who would would argue

2028
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:32,650
would be somebody who would would argue
 

2029
00:45:32,650 --> 00:45:35,880
would be somebody who would would argue
against it what would be the devil's

2030
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:35,890
against it what would be the devil's
 

2031
00:45:35,890 --> 00:45:39,540
against it what would be the devil's
advocate argument yeah

2032
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:39,550
advocate argument yeah
 

2033
00:45:39,550 --> 00:45:42,540
advocate argument yeah
so it's exactly perhaps what you eluded

2034
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:42,550
so it's exactly perhaps what you eluded
 

2035
00:45:42,550 --> 00:45:45,030
so it's exactly perhaps what you eluded
it with your question that you are

2036
00:45:45,030 --> 00:45:45,040
it with your question that you are
 

2037
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:49,080
it with your question that you are
making as enabling you know some some

2038
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:49,090
making as enabling you know some some
 

2039
00:45:49,090 --> 00:45:51,810
making as enabling you know some some
process of formation of the brain that

2040
00:45:51,810 --> 00:45:51,820
process of formation of the brain that
 

2041
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:55,020
process of formation of the brain that
could be misused at some point or there

2042
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:55,030
could be misused at some point or there
 

2043
00:45:55,030 --> 00:45:59,420
could be misused at some point or there
could be showing properties that

2044
00:45:59,420 --> 00:45:59,430
could be showing properties that
 

2045
00:45:59,430 --> 00:46:02,760
could be showing properties that
ethically we don't want to see in a

2046
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:02,770
ethically we don't want to see in a
 

2047
00:46:02,770 --> 00:46:07,200
ethically we don't want to see in a
tissue so today today this is not an

2048
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:07,210
tissue so today today this is not an
 

2049
00:46:07,210 --> 00:46:09,480
tissue so today today this is not an
issue and so you you just gain

2050
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:09,490
issue and so you you just gain
 

2051
00:46:09,490 --> 00:46:11,610
issue and so you you just gain
dramatically from the science without

2052
00:46:11,610 --> 00:46:11,620
dramatically from the science without
 

2053
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:14,130
dramatically from the science without
because the system is so simple and and

2054
00:46:14,130 --> 00:46:14,140
because the system is so simple and and
 

2055
00:46:14,140 --> 00:46:16,290
because the system is so simple and and
so different in a way from from the

2056
00:46:16,290 --> 00:46:16,300
so different in a way from from the
 

2057
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:19,410
so different in a way from from the
actual brain but but because it is the

2058
00:46:19,410 --> 00:46:19,420
actual brain but but because it is the
 

2059
00:46:19,420 --> 00:46:21,480
actual brain but but because it is the
brain we have an obligation to really

2060
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:21,490
brain we have an obligation to really
 

2061
00:46:21,490 --> 00:46:24,450
brain we have an obligation to really
consider all of this right and again

2062
00:46:24,450 --> 00:46:24,460
consider all of this right and again
 

2063
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:27,360
consider all of this right and again
it's it's a balanced conversation where

2064
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:27,370
it's it's a balanced conversation where
 

2065
00:46:27,370 --> 00:46:29,640
it's it's a balanced conversation where
we should put disease and betterment of

2066
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:29,650
we should put disease and betterment of
 

2067
00:46:29,650 --> 00:46:33,000
we should put disease and betterment of
humanity also on that plate what do you

2068
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:33,010
humanity also on that plate what do you
 

2069
00:46:33,010 --> 00:46:35,730
humanity also on that plate what do you
think at least historically there were

2070
00:46:35,730 --> 00:46:35,740
think at least historically there were
 

2071
00:46:35,740 --> 00:46:43,470
think at least historically there were
some politicization of embryonic stem

2072
00:46:43,470 --> 00:46:43,480
some politicization of embryonic stem
 

2073
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:47,700
some politicization of embryonic stem
cells a stem cell research do you still

2074
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:47,710
cells a stem cell research do you still
 

2075
00:46:47,710 --> 00:46:50,310
cells a stem cell research do you still
see that out there is there is that

2076
00:46:50,310 --> 00:46:50,320
see that out there is there is that
 

2077
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:52,770
see that out there is there is that
still a force that we have to think

2078
00:46:52,770 --> 00:46:52,780
still a force that we have to think
 

2079
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:55,020
still a force that we have to think
about especially in this larger

2080
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:55,030
about especially in this larger
 

2081
00:46:55,030 --> 00:46:56,490
about especially in this larger
discourse that we're having about the

2082
00:46:56,490 --> 00:46:56,500
discourse that we're having about the
 

2083
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:59,360
discourse that we're having about the
role of science in at least American

2084
00:46:59,360 --> 00:46:59,370
role of science in at least American
 

2085
00:46:59,370 --> 00:47:02,970
role of science in at least American
society yeah this is a very good

2086
00:47:02,970 --> 00:47:02,980
society yeah this is a very good
 

2087
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:05,400
society yeah this is a very good
question it's very very important I see

2088
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:05,410
question it's very very important I see
 

2089
00:47:05,410 --> 00:47:08,610
question it's very very important I see
a very central role for scientist to

2090
00:47:08,610 --> 00:47:08,620
a very central role for scientist to
 

2091
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:12,120
a very central role for scientist to
inform decisions about what we should or

2092
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:12,130
inform decisions about what we should or
 

2093
00:47:12,130 --> 00:47:14,760
inform decisions about what we should or
should not do in society and this is

2094
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:14,770
should not do in society and this is
 

2095
00:47:14,770 --> 00:47:17,880
should not do in society and this is
because the scientists have the

2096
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:17,890
because the scientists have the
 

2097
00:47:17,890 --> 00:47:20,160
because the scientists have the
first-hand look and understanding of

2098
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:20,170
first-hand look and understanding of
 

2099
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:23,390
first-hand look and understanding of
really the work that they are doing and

2100
00:47:23,390 --> 00:47:23,400
really the work that they are doing and
 

2101
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:26,250
really the work that they are doing and
again this varies depending on what

2102
00:47:26,250 --> 00:47:26,260
again this varies depending on what
 

2103
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:27,510
again this varies depending on what
we're talking about here

2104
00:47:27,510 --> 00:47:27,520
we're talking about here
 

2105
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:29,490
we're talking about here
so now we're talking about Brian

2106
00:47:29,490 --> 00:47:29,500
so now we're talking about Brian
 

2107
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:32,820
so now we're talking about Brian
organoids I think the scientists need to

2108
00:47:32,820 --> 00:47:32,830
organoids I think the scientists need to
 

2109
00:47:32,830 --> 00:47:35,340
organoids I think the scientists need to
be part of that conversation about what

2110
00:47:35,340 --> 00:47:35,350
be part of that conversation about what
 

2111
00:47:35,350 --> 00:47:38,250
be part of that conversation about what
is will be allowed in the future or not

2112
00:47:38,250 --> 00:47:38,260
is will be allowed in the future or not
 

2113
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:39,810
is will be allowed in the future or not
allowed in the future to do with the

2114
00:47:39,810 --> 00:47:39,820
allowed in the future to do with the
 

2115
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:42,780
allowed in the future to do with the
system and I think it's that is very

2116
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:42,790
system and I think it's that is very
 

2117
00:47:42,790 --> 00:47:43,860
system and I think it's that is very
very important because they bring

2118
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:43,870
very important because they bring
 

2119
00:47:43,870 --> 00:47:48,840
very important because they bring
reality of data to the conversation and

2120
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:48,850
reality of data to the conversation and
 

2121
00:47:48,850 --> 00:47:51,690
reality of data to the conversation and
and and so they should have a voice so

2122
00:47:51,690 --> 00:47:51,700
and and so they should have a voice so
 

2123
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:53,370
and and so they should have a voice so
data should have a voice

2124
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:53,380
data should have a voice
 

2125
00:47:53,380 --> 00:47:56,460
data should have a voice
it needs to have a voice because a not

2126
00:47:56,460 --> 00:47:56,470
it needs to have a voice because a not
 

2127
00:47:56,470 --> 00:47:59,390
it needs to have a voice because a not
only data we should also be good at

2128
00:47:59,390 --> 00:47:59,400
only data we should also be good at
 

2129
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:03,360
only data we should also be good at
communicating with non scientists the

2130
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:03,370
communicating with non scientists the
 

2131
00:48:03,370 --> 00:48:06,900
communicating with non scientists the
data so there has been often time there

2132
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:06,910
data so there has been often time there
 

2133
00:48:06,910 --> 00:48:10,800
data so there has been often time there
is a lot of discussion and you know

2134
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:10,810
is a lot of discussion and you know
 

2135
00:48:10,810 --> 00:48:15,030
is a lot of discussion and you know
excitement and fights about certain

2136
00:48:15,030 --> 00:48:15,040
excitement and fights about certain
 

2137
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:18,000
excitement and fights about certain
topics just because of the way they are

2138
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:18,010
topics just because of the way they are
 

2139
00:48:18,010 --> 00:48:21,270
topics just because of the way they are
described I'll give you an example if I

2140
00:48:21,270 --> 00:48:21,280
described I'll give you an example if I
 

2141
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:23,460
described I'll give you an example if I
call that the same cellular system we

2142
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:23,470
call that the same cellular system we
 

2143
00:48:23,470 --> 00:48:27,330
call that the same cellular system we
just talked about a brain organoid or if

2144
00:48:27,330 --> 00:48:27,340
just talked about a brain organoid or if
 

2145
00:48:27,340 --> 00:48:30,510
just talked about a brain organoid or if
i called it a human mini brain your

2146
00:48:30,510 --> 00:48:30,520
i called it a human mini brain your
 

2147
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:32,610
i called it a human mini brain your
reaction is going to be very different

2148
00:48:32,610 --> 00:48:32,620
reaction is going to be very different
 

2149
00:48:32,620 --> 00:48:36,240
reaction is going to be very different
yes to this and so the way the systems

2150
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:36,250
yes to this and so the way the systems
 

2151
00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:39,080
yes to this and so the way the systems
are described I mean we and journalists

2152
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:39,090
are described I mean we and journalists
 

2153
00:48:39,090 --> 00:48:42,720
are described I mean we and journalists
alike need to be a bit careful that this

2154
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:42,730
alike need to be a bit careful that this
 

2155
00:48:42,730 --> 00:48:45,030
alike need to be a bit careful that this
debate is a real debate and inform

2156
00:48:45,030 --> 00:48:45,040
debate is a real debate and inform
 

2157
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:48,030
debate is a real debate and inform
burial data that's all I'm asking and

2158
00:48:48,030 --> 00:48:48,040
burial data that's all I'm asking and
 

2159
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:49,980
burial data that's all I'm asking and
yeah the language matters here so I work

2160
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:49,990
yeah the language matters here so I work
 

2161
00:48:49,990 --> 00:48:52,200
yeah the language matters here so I work
on autonomous vehicles and their the use

2162
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:52,210
on autonomous vehicles and their the use
 

2163
00:48:52,210 --> 00:48:54,270
on autonomous vehicles and their the use
of language could it could it could

2164
00:48:54,270 --> 00:48:54,280
of language could it could it could
 

2165
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:55,680
of language could it could it could
drastically change the interpretation

2166
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:55,690
drastically change the interpretation
 

2167
00:48:55,690 --> 00:48:58,800
drastically change the interpretation
and the way people feel about what is

2168
00:48:58,800 --> 00:48:58,810
and the way people feel about what is
 

2169
00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:00,770
and the way people feel about what is
the right way to proceed forward

2170
00:49:00,770 --> 00:49:00,780
the right way to proceed forward
 

2171
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:04,620
the right way to proceed forward
you are as I've seen from a presentation

2172
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:04,630
you are as I've seen from a presentation
 

2173
00:49:04,630 --> 00:49:08,100
you are as I've seen from a presentation
you're a parent as I show a couple

2174
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:08,110
you're a parent as I show a couple
 

2175
00:49:08,110 --> 00:49:11,180
you're a parent as I show a couple
pictures of your son is it just the one

2176
00:49:11,180 --> 00:49:11,190
pictures of your son is it just the one
 

2177
00:49:11,190 --> 00:49:14,940
pictures of your son is it just the one
to sign a daughter so what have you

2178
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:14,950
to sign a daughter so what have you
 

2179
00:49:14,950 --> 00:49:18,810
to sign a daughter so what have you
learned from the human bracing two of

2180
00:49:18,810 --> 00:49:18,820
learned from the human bracing two of
 

2181
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:27,210
learned from the human bracing two of
them what have I learned I've learned

2182
00:49:27,210 --> 00:49:27,220
them what have I learned I've learned
 

2183
00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:29,490
them what have I learned I've learned
that children really have this amazing

2184
00:49:29,490 --> 00:49:29,500
that children really have this amazing
 

2185
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:32,120
that children really have this amazing
plastic minds right that we have a

2186
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:32,130
plastic minds right that we have a
 

2187
00:49:32,130 --> 00:49:36,480
plastic minds right that we have a
responsibility to you know foster their

2188
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:36,490
responsibility to you know foster their
 

2189
00:49:36,490 --> 00:49:39,750
responsibility to you know foster their
growth in good healthy ways that keep

2190
00:49:39,750 --> 00:49:39,760
growth in good healthy ways that keep
 

2191
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:41,309
growth in good healthy ways that keep
them curious that keeps

2192
00:49:41,309 --> 00:49:41,319
them curious that keeps
 

2193
00:49:41,319 --> 00:49:44,549
them curious that keeps
adventures that doesn't raise them in

2194
00:49:44,549 --> 00:49:44,559
adventures that doesn't raise them in
 

2195
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:47,969
adventures that doesn't raise them in
fear of things but also respecting who

2196
00:49:47,969 --> 00:49:47,979
fear of things but also respecting who
 

2197
00:49:47,979 --> 00:49:49,979
fear of things but also respecting who
they are which is in part you know

2198
00:49:49,979 --> 00:49:49,989
they are which is in part you know
 

2199
00:49:49,989 --> 00:49:51,689
they are which is in part you know
coming from their genetics we talked

2200
00:49:51,689 --> 00:49:51,699
coming from their genetics we talked
 

2201
00:49:51,699 --> 00:49:53,789
coming from their genetics we talked
about my children are very different

2202
00:49:53,789 --> 00:49:53,799
about my children are very different
 

2203
00:49:53,799 --> 00:49:55,259
about my children are very different
from each other despite the fact that

2204
00:49:55,259 --> 00:49:55,269
from each other despite the fact that
 

2205
00:49:55,269 --> 00:49:57,059
from each other despite the fact that
they're the product of the same two

2206
00:49:57,059 --> 00:49:57,069
they're the product of the same two
 

2207
00:49:57,069 --> 00:50:02,309
they're the product of the same two
parents I also learned that what you do

2208
00:50:02,309 --> 00:50:02,319
parents I also learned that what you do
 

2209
00:50:02,319 --> 00:50:04,829
parents I also learned that what you do
for them comes back to you like you know

2210
00:50:04,829 --> 00:50:04,839
for them comes back to you like you know
 

2211
00:50:04,839 --> 00:50:06,890
for them comes back to you like you know
if you're a good parent you're gonna

2212
00:50:06,890 --> 00:50:06,900
if you're a good parent you're gonna
 

2213
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:10,289
if you're a good parent you're gonna
most of the time have you know perhaps a

2214
00:50:10,289 --> 00:50:10,299
most of the time have you know perhaps a
 

2215
00:50:10,299 --> 00:50:12,749
most of the time have you know perhaps a
decent kids at the end what do you think

2216
00:50:12,749 --> 00:50:12,759
decent kids at the end what do you think
 

2217
00:50:12,759 --> 00:50:14,189
decent kids at the end what do you think
just a quick comment what what do you

2218
00:50:14,189 --> 00:50:14,199
just a quick comment what what do you
 

2219
00:50:14,199 --> 00:50:16,979
just a quick comment what what do you
think is the source of that difference

2220
00:50:16,979 --> 00:50:16,989
think is the source of that difference
 

2221
00:50:16,989 --> 00:50:19,589
think is the source of that difference
it's often the surprising thing for

2222
00:50:19,589 --> 00:50:19,599
it's often the surprising thing for
 

2223
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:22,620
it's often the surprising thing for
parents is it can't believe that our

2224
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:22,630
parents is it can't believe that our
 

2225
00:50:22,630 --> 00:50:26,640
parents is it can't believe that our
kids oh they're so different yet they

2226
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:26,650
kids oh they're so different yet they
 

2227
00:50:26,650 --> 00:50:28,439
kids oh they're so different yet they
came from the same parents well they are

2228
00:50:28,439 --> 00:50:28,449
came from the same parents well they are
 

2229
00:50:28,449 --> 00:50:30,569
came from the same parents well they are
genetically different even they came

2230
00:50:30,569 --> 00:50:30,579
genetically different even they came
 

2231
00:50:30,579 --> 00:50:32,549
genetically different even they came
from the same two parents because the

2232
00:50:32,549 --> 00:50:32,559
from the same two parents because the
 

2233
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:34,319
from the same two parents because the
mixing of gametes I mean you know we

2234
00:50:34,319 --> 00:50:34,329
mixing of gametes I mean you know we
 

2235
00:50:34,329 --> 00:50:37,640
mixing of gametes I mean you know we
know these genetics creates every time a

2236
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:37,650
know these genetics creates every time a
 

2237
00:50:37,650 --> 00:50:39,900
know these genetics creates every time a
genetically different individual which

2238
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:39,910
genetically different individual which
 

2239
00:50:39,910 --> 00:50:43,859
genetically different individual which
will have a specific mix of genes that

2240
00:50:43,859 --> 00:50:43,869
will have a specific mix of genes that
 

2241
00:50:43,869 --> 00:50:45,749
will have a specific mix of genes that
is a different mix every time from the

2242
00:50:45,749 --> 00:50:45,759
is a different mix every time from the
 

2243
00:50:45,759 --> 00:50:50,069
is a different mix every time from the
two parents and so so they're not twins

2244
00:50:50,069 --> 00:50:50,079
two parents and so so they're not twins
 

2245
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:53,130
two parents and so so they're not twins
so they are genetically different is

2246
00:50:53,130 --> 00:50:53,140
so they are genetically different is
 

2247
00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:55,529
so they are genetically different is
that a little bit of variation as you

2248
00:50:55,529 --> 00:50:55,539
that a little bit of variation as you
 

2249
00:50:55,539 --> 00:50:57,299
that a little bit of variation as you
said really from a biological

2250
00:50:57,299 --> 00:50:57,309
said really from a biological
 

2251
00:50:57,309 --> 00:50:59,339
said really from a biological
perspective the brains look pretty

2252
00:50:59,339 --> 00:50:59,349
perspective the brains look pretty
 

2253
00:50:59,349 --> 00:51:02,579
perspective the brains look pretty
similar well so let me clarify that so

2254
00:51:02,579 --> 00:51:02,589
similar well so let me clarify that so
 

2255
00:51:02,589 --> 00:51:04,799
similar well so let me clarify that so
the genetics you have the genes that you

2256
00:51:04,799 --> 00:51:04,809
the genetics you have the genes that you
 

2257
00:51:04,809 --> 00:51:07,410
the genetics you have the genes that you
have at that play that beautiful

2258
00:51:07,410 --> 00:51:07,420
have at that play that beautiful
 

2259
00:51:07,420 --> 00:51:10,699
have at that play that beautiful
orchestrated symphony of development

2260
00:51:10,699 --> 00:51:10,709
orchestrated symphony of development
 

2261
00:51:10,709 --> 00:51:12,779
orchestrated symphony of development
different genes will play it slightly

2262
00:51:12,779 --> 00:51:12,789
different genes will play it slightly
 

2263
00:51:12,789 --> 00:51:14,969
different genes will play it slightly
differently it's like playing the same

2264
00:51:14,969 --> 00:51:14,979
differently it's like playing the same
 

2265
00:51:14,979 --> 00:51:17,189
differently it's like playing the same
piece of music but with the different

2266
00:51:17,189 --> 00:51:17,199
piece of music but with the different
 

2267
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:19,469
piece of music but with the different
orchestra and a different director right

2268
00:51:19,469 --> 00:51:19,479
orchestra and a different director right

the music will not come out it will be

2270
00:51:21,719 --> 00:51:21,729
the music will not come out it will be
 

2271
00:51:21,729 --> 00:51:24,479
the music will not come out it will be
still a piece by the same you know

2272
00:51:24,479 --> 00:51:24,489
still a piece by the same you know
 

2273
00:51:24,489 --> 00:51:26,849
still a piece by the same you know
author but it will come out differently

2274
00:51:26,849 --> 00:51:26,859
author but it will come out differently
 

2275
00:51:26,859 --> 00:51:28,380

this is not something that comes from my

00:51:56,590 --> 00:52:00,170
this is not something that comes from my

00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:06,130
personality in a in a way right so both
 

2303
00:52:06,130 --> 00:52:09,420
personality in a in a way right so both
is needed the genetics as well as the

00:52:09,420 --> 00:52:09,430
is needed the genetics as well as the
 

2305
00:52:09,430 --> 00:52:12,930
is needed the genetics as well as the

certain way or thinking about a teenager
 

2337
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:01,260
certain way or thinking about a teenager
you know going through teenage years and

00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:01,270
you know going through teenage years and

2341
00:53:03,250 --> 00:53:06,450
being at I'm funny in the way they think
and impossible for me not to think it's

00:53:06,450 --> 00:53:06,460
and impossible for me not to think it's
 

2343
00:53:06,460 --> 00:53:09,000
and impossible for me not to think it's
because they're going through this

2344
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:09,010
because they're going through this
 

2345
00:53:09,010 --> 00:53:11,850
because they're going through this

00:53:16,510 --> 00:53:18,810
being eliminated here and there and
they're just confused and so from that

2352
00:53:18,810 --> 00:53:18,820
they're just confused and so from that
 

2353
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:22,890
they're just confused and so from that
comes perhaps a different take on the

2354
00:53:22,890 --> 00:53:22,900
comes perhaps a different take on the
 

2355
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:26,930
comes perhaps a different take on the
behavior or maybe I can justify

2356
00:53:26,930 --> 00:53:26,940
behavior or maybe I can justify
 

2357
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:29,910
behavior or maybe I can justify
scientifically in some sort of way I

2358
00:53:29,910 --> 00:53:29,920
scientifically in some sort of way I
 

2359
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:32,790
scientifically in some sort of way I
also look at humanity in general and I

2360
00:53:32,790 --> 00:53:32,800
also look at humanity in general and I
 

2361
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:37,890
also look at humanity in general and I
am amazed by what we can do and the kind

2362
00:53:37,890 --> 00:53:37,900
am amazed by what we can do and the kind
 

2363
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:40,080
am amazed by what we can do and the kind
of ideas that we can come up where then

2364
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:40,090
of ideas that we can come up where then
 

2365
00:53:40,090 --> 00:53:42,960
of ideas that we can come up where then
I cannot stop thinking about how the

2366
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:42,970
I cannot stop thinking about how the
 

2367
00:53:42,970 --> 00:53:46,680
I cannot stop thinking about how the
brain is continuing to evolve I don't

2368
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:46,690
brain is continuing to evolve I don't
 

2369
00:53:46,690 --> 00:53:47,910
brain is continuing to evolve I don't
know if you do this but I think about

2370
00:53:47,910 --> 00:53:47,920
know if you do this but I think about
 

2371
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:50,100
know if you do this but I think about
the next brain sometimes what are we

2372
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:50,110
the next brain sometimes what are we
 

2373
00:53:50,110 --> 00:53:52,260
the next brain sometimes what are we
going with it's like what are the

2374
00:53:52,260 --> 00:53:52,270
going with it's like what are the
 

2375
00:53:52,270 --> 00:53:54,930
going with it's like what are the
features of this brain that you know

2376
00:53:54,930 --> 00:53:54,940
features of this brain that you know
 

2377
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:58,350
features of this brain that you know
evolution is really plain wait to get us

2378
00:53:58,350 --> 00:53:58,360
evolution is really plain wait to get us
 

2379
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:02,150
evolution is really plain wait to get us
you know in the future the new brain

2380
00:54:02,150 --> 00:54:02,160
you know in the future the new brain
 

2381
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:05,550
you know in the future the new brain
it's not over right it's it's a work in

2382
00:54:05,550 --> 00:54:05,560
it's not over right it's it's a work in
 

2383
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:06,930
it's not over right it's it's a work in
progress

2384
00:54:06,930 --> 00:54:06,940
progress
 

2385
00:54:06,940 --> 00:54:09,150
progress
so let me just a quick comment on

2386
00:54:09,150 --> 00:54:09,160
so let me just a quick comment on
 

2387
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:12,120
so let me just a quick comment on
do you see do you think there's a

2388
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:12,130
do you see do you think there's a
 

2389
00:54:12,130 --> 00:54:14,759
do you see do you think there's a
there's a lot of fascination and hope

2390
00:54:14,759 --> 00:54:14,769
there's a lot of fascination and hope
 

2391
00:54:14,769 --> 00:54:16,620
there's a lot of fascination and hope
for artificial intelligence of creating

2392
00:54:16,620 --> 00:54:16,630
for artificial intelligence of creating
 

2393
00:54:16,630 --> 00:54:18,599
for artificial intelligence of creating
artificial brains you said the next

2394
00:54:18,599 --> 00:54:18,609
artificial brains you said the next
 

2395
00:54:18,609 --> 00:54:22,499
artificial brains you said the next
brain when you imagine over a period of

2396
00:54:22,499 --> 00:54:22,509
brain when you imagine over a period of
 

2397
00:54:22,509 --> 00:54:24,329
brain when you imagine over a period of
a thousand years the evolution of the

2398
00:54:24,329 --> 00:54:24,339
a thousand years the evolution of the
 

2399
00:54:24,339 --> 00:54:27,599
a thousand years the evolution of the
human brain do you sometimes envisioning

2400
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:27,609
human brain do you sometimes envisioning
 

2401
00:54:27,609 --> 00:54:30,950
human brain do you sometimes envisioning
that future see an artificial one

2402
00:54:30,950 --> 00:54:30,960
that future see an artificial one
 

2403
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:33,420
that future see an artificial one
artificial intelligence as it is hoped

2404
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:33,430
artificial intelligence as it is hoped
 

2405
00:54:33,430 --> 00:54:36,240
artificial intelligence as it is hoped
by many not hoped thought by many people

2406
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:36,250
by many not hoped thought by many people
 

2407
00:54:36,250 --> 00:54:38,579
by many not hoped thought by many people
would be actually the next evolutionary

2408
00:54:38,579 --> 00:54:38,589
would be actually the next evolutionary
 

2409
00:54:38,589 --> 00:54:41,099
would be actually the next evolutionary
step in the development yeah yeah I

2410
00:54:41,099 --> 00:54:41,109
step in the development yeah yeah I
 

2411
00:54:41,109 --> 00:54:44,880
step in the development yeah yeah I
think in a way that will happen right

2412
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:44,890
think in a way that will happen right
 

2413
00:54:44,890 --> 00:54:47,670
think in a way that will happen right
it's almost like a part of the way we

2414
00:54:47,670 --> 00:54:47,680
it's almost like a part of the way we
 

2415
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:50,190
it's almost like a part of the way we
evolved we evolved in the world that we

2416
00:54:50,190 --> 00:54:50,200
evolved we evolved in the world that we
 

2417
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:53,970
evolved we evolved in the world that we
created that we interact with the shape

2418
00:54:53,970 --> 00:54:53,980
created that we interact with the shape
 

2419
00:54:53,980 --> 00:54:57,620
created that we interact with the shape
has as we grow up and so on and so forth

2420
00:54:57,620 --> 00:54:57,630
has as we grow up and so on and so forth
 

2421
00:54:57,630 --> 00:54:59,940
has as we grow up and so on and so forth
sometimes I think about something that

2422
00:54:59,940 --> 00:54:59,950
sometimes I think about something that
 

2423
00:54:59,950 --> 00:55:02,759
sometimes I think about something that
may sound silly but think about the use

2424
00:55:02,759 --> 00:55:02,769
may sound silly but think about the use
 

2425
00:55:02,769 --> 00:55:05,940
may sound silly but think about the use
of of cell phones part of me thinks that

2426
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:05,950
of of cell phones part of me thinks that
 

2427
00:55:05,950 --> 00:55:07,589
of of cell phones part of me thinks that
somehow in their brain there will be a

2428
00:55:07,589 --> 00:55:07,599
somehow in their brain there will be a
 

2429
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:10,849
somehow in their brain there will be a
region of the cortex that is this much

2430
00:55:10,849 --> 00:55:10,859
region of the cortex that is this much
 

2431
00:55:10,859 --> 00:55:14,910
region of the cortex that is this much
attuned to that tool and and this comes

2432
00:55:14,910 --> 00:55:14,920
attuned to that tool and and this comes
 

2433
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:18,210
attuned to that tool and and this comes
from a lot of studies in in in model

2434
00:55:18,210 --> 00:55:18,220
from a lot of studies in in in model
 

2435
00:55:18,220 --> 00:55:20,910
from a lot of studies in in in model
organisms where really the cortex

2436
00:55:20,910 --> 00:55:20,920
organisms where really the cortex
 

2437
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:23,549
organisms where really the cortex
especially adapts to the kind of things

2438
00:55:23,549 --> 00:55:23,559
especially adapts to the kind of things
 

2439
00:55:23,559 --> 00:55:25,980
especially adapts to the kind of things
you have to do so if we need to move our

2440
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:25,990
you have to do so if we need to move our
 

2441
00:55:25,990 --> 00:55:29,099
you have to do so if we need to move our
fingers in a very specific way we have a

2442
00:55:29,099 --> 00:55:29,109
fingers in a very specific way we have a
 

2443
00:55:29,109 --> 00:55:31,019
fingers in a very specific way we have a
part of our cortex that allows us to do

2444
00:55:31,019 --> 00:55:31,029
part of our cortex that allows us to do
 

2445
00:55:31,029 --> 00:55:34,769
part of our cortex that allows us to do
this kind of very precise movement in an

2446
00:55:34,769 --> 00:55:34,779
this kind of very precise movement in an
 

2447
00:55:34,779 --> 00:55:36,630
this kind of very precise movement in an
owl that has to see very very far away

2448
00:55:36,630 --> 00:55:36,640
owl that has to see very very far away
 

2449
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:39,240
owl that has to see very very far away
with big eyes the visual cortex very big

2450
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:39,250
with big eyes the visual cortex very big
 

2451
00:55:39,250 --> 00:55:41,910
with big eyes the visual cortex very big
it's the brain attuned to your

2452
00:55:41,910 --> 00:55:41,920
it's the brain attuned to your
 

2453
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:45,269
it's the brain attuned to your
environment so the brain will attune to

2454
00:55:45,269 --> 00:55:45,279
environment so the brain will attune to
 

2455
00:55:45,279 --> 00:55:48,059
environment so the brain will attune to
the to the technologies that we will

2456
00:55:48,059 --> 00:55:48,069
the to the technologies that we will
 

2457
00:55:48,069 --> 00:55:50,609
the to the technologies that we will
have and will be shaped by it

2458
00:55:50,609 --> 00:55:50,619
have and will be shaped by it
 

2459
00:55:50,619 --> 00:55:53,609
have and will be shaped by it
so the cortex very well maybe we shaped

2460
00:55:53,609 --> 00:55:53,619
so the cortex very well maybe we shaped
 

2461
00:55:53,619 --> 00:55:56,160
so the cortex very well maybe we shaped
by it in the artificial intelligence it

2462
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:56,170
by it in the artificial intelligence it
 

2463
00:55:56,170 --> 00:55:59,640
by it in the artificial intelligence it
may merge with it they may get a envelop

2464
00:55:59,640 --> 00:55:59,650
may merge with it they may get a envelop
 

2465
00:55:59,650 --> 00:56:02,579
may merge with it they may get a envelop
it and adjust if it's not you know

2466
00:56:02,579 --> 00:56:02,589
it and adjust if it's not you know
 

2467
00:56:02,589 --> 00:56:04,950
it and adjust if it's not you know
emerge of the kind of oh let's have a

2468
00:56:04,950 --> 00:56:04,960
emerge of the kind of oh let's have a
 

2469
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:07,109
emerge of the kind of oh let's have a
synthetic element together with a

00:56:07,109 --> 00:56:07,119
synthetic element together with a
 

2471
00:56:07,119 --> 00:56:10,289
synthetic element together with a
biological one the very space around us

2472
00:56:10,289 --> 00:56:10,299
biological one the very space around us

00:56:10,299 --> 00:56:12,690
biological one the very space around us
the fact for example think about we put

2474
00:56:12,690 --> 00:56:12,700
the fact for example think about we put
 

2475
00:56:12,700 --> 00:56:15,059
the fact for example think about we put
on some goggles of virtual reality and

2476
00:56:15,059 --> 00:56:15,069
on some goggles of virtual reality and
 

2477
00:56:15,069 --> 00:56:18,450
on some goggles of virtual reality and
we physically are surfing the ocean

2478
00:56:18,450 --> 00:56:18,460
we physically are surfing the ocean
 

2479
00:56:18,460 --> 00:56:20,730
we physically are surfing the ocean
right like I've done it and you have all

2480
00:56:20,730 --> 00:56:20,740
right like I've done it and you have all
 

2481
00:56:20,740 --> 00:56:23,050
right like I've done it and you have all
these emotions that come to you you

2482
00:56:23,050 --> 00:56:23,060
these emotions that come to you you
 

2483
00:56:23,060 --> 00:56:27,610
these emotions that come to you you
brain placed you in that reality and it

2484
00:56:27,610 --> 00:56:27,620
brain placed you in that reality and it
 

2485
00:56:27,620 --> 00:56:30,070
brain placed you in that reality and it
was able to do it like that just by

2486
00:56:30,070 --> 00:56:30,080
was able to do it like that just by
 

2487
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:32,130
was able to do it like that just by
putting the goggles on it didn't take

2488
00:56:32,130 --> 00:56:32,140
putting the goggles on it didn't take
 

2489
00:56:32,140 --> 00:56:35,290
putting the goggles on it didn't take
thousands of years of adapting to this

2490
00:56:35,290 --> 00:56:35,300
thousands of years of adapting to this
 

2491
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:38,590
thousands of years of adapting to this
the brain is plastic so adapts to new

2492
00:56:38,590 --> 00:56:38,600
the brain is plastic so adapts to new
 

2493
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:41,080
the brain is plastic so adapts to new
technology so you could do it from the

2494
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:41,090
technology so you could do it from the
 

2495
00:56:41,090 --> 00:56:45,030
technology so you could do it from the
outside by simply hijacking some sensory

2496
00:56:45,030 --> 00:56:45,040
outside by simply hijacking some sensory
 

2497
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:49,570
outside by simply hijacking some sensory
capacities that we have so clearly over

2498
00:56:49,570 --> 00:56:49,580
capacities that we have so clearly over
 

2499
00:56:49,580 --> 00:56:52,270
capacities that we have so clearly over
you know recent evolution the cerebral

2500
00:56:52,270 --> 00:56:52,280
you know recent evolution the cerebral
 

2501
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:54,070
you know recent evolution the cerebral
cortex has been a part of the brain that

2502
00:56:54,070 --> 00:56:54,080
cortex has been a part of the brain that
 

2503
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:56,680
cortex has been a part of the brain that
has known the most evolution so we have

2504
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:56,690
has known the most evolution so we have
 

2505
00:56:56,690 --> 00:57:00,940
has known the most evolution so we have
put a lot of chips on evolving this

2506
00:57:00,940 --> 00:57:00,950
put a lot of chips on evolving this
 

2507
00:57:00,950 --> 00:57:02,860
put a lot of chips on evolving this
specific part of the brain and the

2508
00:57:02,860 --> 00:57:02,870
specific part of the brain and the
 

2509
00:57:02,870 --> 00:57:06,070
specific part of the brain and the
evolution of cortex is plasticity it's

2510
00:57:06,070 --> 00:57:06,080
evolution of cortex is plasticity it's
 

2511
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:08,830
evolution of cortex is plasticity it's
this ability to change in response to

2512
00:57:08,830 --> 00:57:08,840
this ability to change in response to
 

2513
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:12,550
this ability to change in response to
things so yes they will integrate that

2514
00:57:12,550 --> 00:57:12,560
things so yes they will integrate that
 

2515
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:16,870
things so yes they will integrate that
we want it or not well there is no

2516
00:57:16,870 --> 00:57:16,880
we want it or not well there is no
 

2517
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:18,610
we want it or not well there is no
better way to end it Paula thank you so

2518
00:57:18,610 --> 00:57:18,620
better way to end it Paula thank you so
 

2519
00:57:18,620 --> 00:57:29,300
better way to end it Paula thank you so
