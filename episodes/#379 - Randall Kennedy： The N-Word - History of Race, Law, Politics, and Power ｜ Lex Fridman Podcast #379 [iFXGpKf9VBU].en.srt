755
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:19,189

sometimes it's a very bad thing that

756
00:17:19,189 --> 00:17:19,199
sometimes it's a very bad thing that
 

757
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:22,250
sometimes it's a very bad thing that
person discriminates

person discriminates
 

759
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:24,650
person discriminates
and when if you know again you know

and I'm obviously being disapproving
 

767
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:35,270

00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:43,490
distinguishes between things on an
unjustifiable basis and that's a bad

774
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:43,500
unjustifiable basis and that's a bad
 

775
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,610
unjustifiable basis and that's a bad
thing on the other hand that person has

discriminating taste
 

779
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,510
discriminating taste
oh that means something very different

780
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:50,520
oh that means something very different
 

781
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,930
oh that means something very different
that means that the person

differentiates in a way that shows that

differentiates in a way that shows that
they understand the difference between

00:17:59,470 --> 00:17:59,480
they understand the difference between
 

787
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:03,950
they understand the difference between
excellent good and not so good and we

788
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:03,960
excellent good and not so good and we
 

789
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,169
excellent good and not so good and we
think that that's a good thing so words

790
00:18:06,169 --> 00:18:06,179
think that that's a good thing so words
 

791
00:18:06,179 --> 00:18:08,390
think that that's a good thing so words
can have different you know words can

mean different things in different
contexts it seems to me that that's

796
00:18:12,289 --> 00:18:12,299
contexts it seems to me that that's
 

797
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:15,169
contexts it seems to me that that's
something that actually we ought to

798
00:18:15,169 --> 00:18:15,179
something that actually we ought to
 

799
00:18:15,179 --> 00:18:18,770
something that actually we ought to
recognized we ought to recognize and

talk about well some words enter this
territory of being a slur

804
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:24,600
territory of being a slur
 

805
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,529
territory of being a slur
and it seems like when they cross the

806

and it seems like when they cross the
 

807
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:30,190
and it seems like when they cross the
line into being a slur

808

line into being a slur
 

809
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:33,890

from whenever whenever you utter a word

and then let's imagine that a Ku Klux
 

2245
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:02,270
and then let's imagine that a Ku Klux
klansman comes up to me after my talk

2246
00:50:02,270 --> 00:50:02,280
klansman comes up to me after my talk
 

2247
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:06,230
klansman comes up to me after my talk
and says oh you have now hurt my

regretful that my talk about the

2256
00:50:16,010 --> 00:50:16,020
regretful that my talk about the
 

2257
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:18,349
regretful that my talk about the
greatness of Martin Luther King Jr has

2261
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:22,910
hurt the feelings of the klansmen no my
response is going to be you know you

2262
00:50:22,910 --> 00:50:22,920
response is going to be you know you
 

2263
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:26,030
response is going to be you know you
need to reevaluate your feelings

2264
00:50:26,030 --> 00:50:26,040
need to reevaluate your feelings
 

2265
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:29,890
need to reevaluate your feelings
because actually uh your feeling of hurt

2266
00:50:29,890 --> 00:50:29,900
because actually uh your feeling of hurt
 

2267
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:34,309
because actually uh your feeling of hurt
is unjustified and no I'm you know no

2268
00:50:34,309 --> 00:50:34,319
is unjustified and no I'm you know no
 

2269
00:50:34,319 --> 00:50:36,829
is unjustified and no I'm you know no
there's no apology coming from me but

2270
00:50:36,829 --> 00:50:36,839
there's no apology coming from me but
 

2271
00:50:36,839 --> 00:50:38,750
there's no apology coming from me but
there there's a kind of line and perhaps

2272
00:50:38,750 --> 00:50:38,760
there there's a kind of line and perhaps
 

2273
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:40,910
there there's a kind of line and perhaps
the gray area and maybe the word hurt

2274
00:50:40,910 --> 00:50:40,920
the gray area and maybe the word hurt
 

2275
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:43,250
the gray area and maybe the word hurt
has been overused because if you try to

2276
00:50:43,250 --> 00:50:43,260
has been overused because if you try to
 

2277
00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:45,370
has been overused because if you try to
avoid hurting

2278
00:50:45,370 --> 00:50:45,380
avoid hurting
 

2279
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:49,549
avoid hurting
uh a small fraction of society that is

2280
00:50:49,549 --> 00:50:49,559
uh a small fraction of society that is
 

2281
00:50:49,559 --> 00:50:51,890
uh a small fraction of society that is
mentally weak in a way where everything

2282
00:50:51,890 --> 00:50:51,900
mentally weak in a way where everything
 

2283
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:54,410
mentally weak in a way where everything
hurts them that's that's the wrong way

2284
00:50:54,410 --> 00:50:54,420
hurts them that's that's the wrong way
 

2285
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:57,890
hurts them that's that's the wrong way
to build a society but if we flip that

2286
00:50:57,890 --> 00:50:57,900
to build a society but if we flip that
 

2287
00:50:57,900 --> 00:50:59,630
to build a society but if we flip that
upside down and say trying to maximize

2288
00:50:59,630 --> 00:50:59,640
upside down and say trying to maximize
 

2289
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:01,970
upside down and say trying to maximize
the amount of love in the world

2290
00:51:01,970 --> 00:51:01,980
the amount of love in the world
 

2291
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:04,790
the amount of love in the world
uh and think about decisions we make in

2292
00:51:04,790 --> 00:51:04,800
uh and think about decisions we make in
 

2293
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:06,290
uh and think about decisions we make in
terms of the language you use to try to

2294
00:51:06,290 --> 00:51:06,300
terms of the language you use to try to
 

2295
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:08,390
terms of the language you use to try to
maximize the amount of love and not just

2296
00:51:08,390 --> 00:51:08,400
maximize the amount of love and not just
 

2297
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:10,309
maximize the amount of love and not just
short term but long term okay and that's

2298
00:51:10,309 --> 00:51:10,319
short term but long term okay and that's
 

2299
00:51:10,319 --> 00:51:11,870
short term but long term okay and that's
where freedom of speech is very powerful

2300
00:51:11,870 --> 00:51:11,880
where freedom of speech is very powerful
 

2301
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:14,750
where freedom of speech is very powerful
because it's a short-term painful thing

2302
00:51:14,750 --> 00:51:14,760
because it's a short-term painful thing
 

2303
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:18,109
because it's a short-term painful thing
often but long-term beneficial thing

2304
00:51:18,109 --> 00:51:18,119
often but long-term beneficial thing
 

2305
00:51:18,119 --> 00:51:21,109
often but long-term beneficial thing
just having freedom and so there's where

2306
00:51:21,109 --> 00:51:21,119
just having freedom and so there's where
 

2307
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:23,450
just having freedom and so there's where
the question of the n-word starts to

2308
00:51:23,450 --> 00:51:23,460
the question of the n-word starts to
 

2309
00:51:23,460 --> 00:51:24,829
the question of the n-word starts to
come in

2310
00:51:24,829 --> 00:51:24,839
come in
 

2311
00:51:24,839 --> 00:51:26,630
come in
how much

2312
00:51:26,630 --> 00:51:26,640
how much
 

2313
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:28,030
how much
uh

2314
00:51:28,030 --> 00:51:28,040
uh
 

2315
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:31,730
uh
how do we think about its use on the

2316
00:51:31,730 --> 00:51:31,740
how do we think about its use on the
 

2317
00:51:31,740 --> 00:51:34,250
how do we think about its use on the
internet on college campuses in a way

2318
00:51:34,250 --> 00:51:34,260
internet on college campuses in a way
 

2319
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:36,589
internet on college campuses in a way
that maximizes the amount of love and

2320
00:51:36,589 --> 00:51:36,599
that maximizes the amount of love and
 

2321
00:51:36,599 --> 00:51:38,270
that maximizes the amount of love and
compassion and camaraderie in the world

2322
00:51:38,270 --> 00:51:38,280
compassion and camaraderie in the world
 

2323
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:40,549
compassion and camaraderie in the world
I think that's good and I'm you know I

2324
00:51:40,549 --> 00:51:40,559
I think that's good and I'm you know I
 

2325
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:43,430
I think that's good and I'm you know I
would associate myself with

2326
00:51:43,430 --> 00:51:43,440
would associate myself with
 

2327
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:46,730
would associate myself with
uh your vision how can we maximize how

2328
00:51:46,730 --> 00:51:46,740
uh your vision how can we maximize how
 

2329
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:49,130
uh your vision how can we maximize how
can we maximize love no I love that I I

2330
00:51:49,130 --> 00:51:49,140
can we maximize love no I love that I I
 

2331
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:51,230
can we maximize love no I love that I I
think that's great so let's let's take

2332
00:51:51,230 --> 00:51:51,240
think that's great so let's let's take
 

2333
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:52,910
think that's great so let's let's take
that on

2334
00:51:52,910 --> 00:51:52,920
that on
 

2335
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:58,549
that on
um I doubt that the way of doing that

2336
00:51:58,549 --> 00:51:58,559
um I doubt that the way of doing that
 

2337
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:01,970
um I doubt that the way of doing that
is to

2338
00:52:01,970 --> 00:52:01,980
is to
 

2339
00:52:01,980 --> 00:52:03,710
is to

00:52:08,809 --> 00:52:08,819
the infamous inward
 

2345
00:52:08,819 --> 00:52:12,910
the infamous inward
I doubt that the way of doing that

2346
00:52:12,910 --> 00:52:12,920
I doubt that the way of doing that
 

2347
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:15,230
I doubt that the way of doing that
is to

2348
00:52:15,230 --> 00:52:15,240
is to
 

2349
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:17,930
is to
say to people

2350
00:52:17,930 --> 00:52:17,940
say to people

00:52:23,930 --> 00:52:23,940
that we can
 

2357
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:29,030
that we can
to avoid this symbolic action you know

to avoid this symbolic action you know
 

2359
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:31,730
to avoid this symbolic action you know
maybe this word or maybe this symbol we

00:52:31,730 --> 00:52:31,740
maybe this word or maybe this symbol we
 

2361

maybe this word or maybe this symbol we
we're going to really we're going to do

all that we can to suppress it
 

2365
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:38,150
all that we can to suppress it
so that we can have a more loving

Universe I doubt that that's the way to

2368
00:52:40,549 --> 00:52:40,559
Universe I doubt that that's the way to
 

2369
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:42,710
Universe I doubt that that's the way to
do it I think a better way to do it I

2370
00:52:42,710 --> 00:52:42,720
do it I think a better way to do it I

do it I think a better way to do it I
think a better way to do it

00:52:45,170 --> 00:52:45,180
think a better way to do it
 

2373
00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:49,870
think a better way to do it
would be to fully educate people

2374
00:52:49,870 --> 00:52:49,880
would be to fully educate people
 

2375
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:54,370
would be to fully educate people
including educate people such that

2376

including educate people such that
you see that over there

you see that over there
 

2379
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:04,609
you see that over there
that is the uniform of the Klu Klux Klan

2380
00:53:04,609 --> 00:53:04,619

can look at the uniform of the Ku Klux

2386
00:53:09,770 --> 00:53:09,780
can look at the uniform of the Ku Klux
 

2387
00:53:09,780 --> 00:53:12,589
can look at the uniform of the Ku Klux
Klan and know what it's about you're not

00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:16,309
terrorized by it
you're not immediately you're not you

01:10:38,750 --> 01:10:38,760
and here's what I've done that shows
 

3147
01:10:38,760 --> 01:10:40,970
and here's what I've done that shows
that I'm down with this program

3148
01:10:40,970 --> 01:10:40,980
that I'm down with this program
 

3149
01:10:40,980 --> 01:10:44,510
that I'm down with this program
and therefore I'm okay

3150
01:10:44,510 --> 01:10:44,520
and therefore I'm okay
 

3151
01:10:44,520 --> 01:10:47,090
and therefore I'm okay
well you know a lot of what I do would

01:10:47,090 --> 01:10:47,100
well you know a lot of what I do would
 

3153
01:10:47,100 --> 01:10:50,030
well you know a lot of what I do would
fit very comfortably within that but

01:22:07,330 --> 01:22:07,340
more deeply embedded in American Life
 

3681
01:22:07,340 --> 01:22:12,110
more deeply embedded in American Life
than uh most people perceived including

3682
01:22:12,110 --> 01:22:12,120
than uh most people perceived including
 

3683
01:22:12,120 --> 01:22:13,910
than uh most people perceived including
liberals and I think there was a lot of

3684
01:22:13,910 --> 01:22:13,920
liberals and I think there was a lot of
 

3685
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:17,149
liberals and I think there was a lot of
strength to that proposition

3686
01:22:17,149 --> 01:22:17,159
strength to that proposition
 

3687
01:22:17,159 --> 01:22:18,110
strength to that proposition
um

3688
01:22:18,110 --> 01:22:18,120
um
 

3689
01:22:18,120 --> 01:22:21,290
um
but then they also took on some other

3690
01:22:21,290 --> 01:22:21,300
but then they also took on some other
 

3691
01:22:21,300 --> 01:22:23,810
but then they also took on some other
propositions with which I was in very

3692
01:22:23,810 --> 01:22:23,820
propositions with which I was in very
 

3693
01:22:23,820 --> 01:22:25,850
propositions with which I was in very
strong disagreement

3694
01:22:25,850 --> 01:22:25,860
strong disagreement
 

3695
01:22:25,860 --> 01:22:29,450
strong disagreement
so I think it's perfectly fine to say

3696
01:22:29,450 --> 01:22:29,460
so I think it's perfectly fine to say
 

3697
01:22:29,460 --> 01:22:33,050
so I think it's perfectly fine to say
that racism is a force in American Life

3698
01:22:33,050 --> 01:22:33,060
that racism is a force in American Life
 

3699
01:22:33,060 --> 01:22:37,790
that racism is a force in American Life
that is deeper more pervasive more

3700
01:22:37,790 --> 01:22:37,800
that is deeper more pervasive more
 

3701
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:40,490
that is deeper more pervasive more
stubborn more resilient than I think

3702
01:22:40,490 --> 01:22:40,500
stubborn more resilient than I think
 

3703
01:22:40,500 --> 01:22:44,090
stubborn more resilient than I think

say
racial profiling is when police officers

5236
01:57:18,229 --> 01:57:18,239
racial profiling is when police officers
 

5237
01:57:18,239 --> 01:57:21,530
racial profiling is when police officers
act against somebody wholly on the basis

5238
01:57:21,530 --> 01:57:21,540
act against somebody wholly on the basis
 

5239
01:57:21,540 --> 01:57:23,570

of race
 

5241
01:57:23,580 --> 01:57:27,290
of race
that is that gets rid of the issue

5242
01:57:27,290 --> 01:57:27,300
that is that gets rid of the issue
 

5243
01:57:27,300 --> 01:57:29,810
that is that gets rid of the issue
because

5244
01:57:29,810 --> 01:57:29,820
because
 

5245
01:57:29,820 --> 01:57:32,990
because
you know most police officers don't act

5246
01:57:32,990 --> 01:57:33,000
you know most police officers don't act
 

5247
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:36,530

01:57:36,540 --> 01:57:37,550
against anyone wholly on the basis of
race

5250
01:57:37,550 --> 01:57:37,560
race
 

5251
01:57:37,560 --> 01:57:39,830
race
you could have the most racist police

5252
01:57:39,830 --> 01:57:39,840
you could have the most racist police
 

5253
01:57:39,840 --> 01:57:43,729
you could have the most racist police
officer and that that police officer is

5254
01:57:43,729 --> 01:57:43,739
officer and that that police officer is
 

5255
01:57:43,739 --> 01:57:47,930
officer and that that police officer is
not going to act adversely against the

5256
01:57:47,930 --> 01:57:47,940
not going to act adversely against the
 

5257
01:57:47,940 --> 01:57:51,350
not going to act adversely against the
90 year old black woman walking down the

5258
01:57:51,350 --> 01:57:51,360
90 year old black woman walking down the
 

5259
01:57:51,360 --> 01:57:54,950
90 year old black woman walking down the
street with a cane okay so it's always

5261
01:57:54,960 --> 01:57:57,290
street with a cane okay so it's always
it's so there you know if you Define

5262
01:57:57,290 --> 01:57:57,300
it's so there you know if you Define
 

5263
01:57:57,300 --> 01:58:00,169
it's so there you know if you Define
racial profiling that way you're getting

5264
01:58:00,169 --> 01:58:00,179
racial profiling that way you're getting
 

5265
01:58:00,179 --> 01:58:01,910
racial profiling that way you're getting
rid of the issue

5266
01:58:01,910 --> 01:58:01,920
rid of the issue
 

5267
01:58:01,920 --> 01:58:06,470
rid of the issue
the issue is the proper issue is this

5268
01:58:06,470 --> 01:58:06,480
the issue is the proper issue is this
 

5269
01:58:06,480 --> 01:58:08,689
the issue is the proper issue is this
should the police

5270
01:58:08,689 --> 01:58:08,699
should the police
 

5271
01:58:08,699 --> 01:58:13,209
should the police
be able to act against someone

5272
01:58:13,209 --> 01:58:13,219
be able to act against someone
 

5273
01:58:13,219 --> 01:58:18,709
be able to act against someone
uh taking race into account as a factor

5274
01:58:18,709 --> 01:58:18,719
uh taking race into account as a factor
 

5275
01:58:18,719 --> 01:58:21,350
uh taking race into account as a factor
so let's imagine that a black person

5276
01:58:21,350 --> 01:58:21,360
so let's imagine that a black person
 

5277
01:58:21,360 --> 01:58:24,169
so let's imagine that a black person
who's 25 years old is walking down the

5278
01:58:24,169 --> 01:58:24,179
who's 25 years old is walking down the
 

5279
01:58:24,179 --> 01:58:25,790
who's 25 years old is walking down the
street right next to a white person

5280
01:58:25,790 --> 01:58:25,800
street right next to a white person
 

5281
01:58:25,800 --> 01:58:28,089
street right next to a white person
who's 25 years old

5282
01:58:28,089 --> 01:58:28,099
who's 25 years old
 

5283
01:58:28,099 --> 01:58:31,010
who's 25 years old
some people would say you know what

5284
01:58:31,010 --> 01:58:31,020
some people would say you know what
 

5285
01:58:31,020 --> 01:58:35,870
some people would say you know what
under those circumstances it's okay for

5286
01:58:35,870 --> 01:58:35,880
under those circumstances it's okay for
 

5287
01:58:35,880 --> 01:58:39,530
under those circumstances it's okay for
the police officer to give two looks at

5288
01:58:39,530 --> 01:58:39,540
the police officer to give two looks at
 

5289
01:58:39,540 --> 01:58:41,570
the police officer to give two looks at
the black person and only one look at

5290
01:58:41,570 --> 01:58:41,580
the black person and only one look at
 

5291
01:58:41,580 --> 01:58:44,810
the black person and only one look at
the white person why because the

5292
01:58:44,810 --> 01:58:44,820
the white person why because the
 

5293
01:58:44,820 --> 01:58:48,410
the white person why because the
statistics tell us that the black 25

5294
01:58:48,410 --> 01:58:48,420
statistics tell us that the black 25
 

5295
01:58:48,420 --> 01:58:51,830
statistics tell us that the black 25
year old there's much more risk of that

5296
01:58:51,830 --> 01:58:51,840
year old there's much more risk of that
 

5297
01:58:51,840 --> 01:58:54,050
year old there's much more risk of that
person acting in an unlawful way if you

5298
01:58:54,050 --> 01:58:54,060
person acting in an unlawful way if you
 

5299
01:58:54,060 --> 01:58:57,350
person acting in an unlawful way if you
take a look at you know crime statistics

5300
01:58:57,350 --> 01:58:57,360

you know it wasn't so low you know 9 11

5386
02:00:43,370 --> 02:00:43,380
you know it wasn't so low you know 9 11

ago but it wasn't all that long ago and
this very issue came up with the respect

5392
02:00:49,790 --> 02:00:49,800
this very issue came up with the respect
 

5393
02:00:49,800 --> 02:00:51,410
this very issue came up with the respect
to the profiling

5394
02:00:51,410 --> 02:00:51,420

5423
02:01:23,639 --> 02:01:26,810
the facts never take us this way there
are facts and then there is our choice

02:01:26,810 --> 02:01:26,820
are facts and then there is our choice
 

5425
02:01:26,820 --> 02:01:30,530
are facts and then there is our choice
of how we want to respond to those facts

5426
02:01:30,530 --> 02:01:30,540
of how we want to respond to those facts
 

5427

divided societies is a problem that is

5620
02:06:13,970 --> 02:06:13,980
divided societies is a problem that is
 

5621
02:06:13,980 --> 02:06:15,649
divided societies is a problem that is
worldwide

5622
02:06:15,649 --> 02:06:15,659
worldwide
 

5623
02:06:15,659 --> 02:06:18,350
worldwide
there's you know and it seems as though

5625
02:06:18,360 --> 02:06:22,189
there's you know and it seems as though
it seems as though human Ingenuity is

5626
02:06:22,189 --> 02:06:22,199
it seems as though human Ingenuity is
 

5627
02:06:22,199 --> 02:06:24,169
it seems as though human Ingenuity is
such that

5628
02:06:24,169 --> 02:06:24,179
such that
 

5629
02:06:24,179 --> 02:06:27,290
such that
humans will find something

5630
02:06:27,290 --> 02:06:27,300
humans will find something
 

5631
02:06:27,300 --> 02:06:30,229
humans will find something
to divide over

5632
02:06:30,229 --> 02:06:30,239
to divide over
 

5633
02:06:30,239 --> 02:06:33,830
to divide over

5691
02:07:52,860 --> 02:07:54,530
and now we're headed towards War the
interesting thing is if I were to step

5692
02:07:54,530 --> 02:07:54,540
interesting thing is if I were to step
 

5693
02:07:54,540 --> 02:07:56,390
interesting thing is if I were to step
outside of this whole thing from an

5694
02:07:56,390 --> 02:07:56,400
outside of this whole thing from an
 

5695
02:07:56,400 --> 02:07:59,990
outside of this whole thing from an
alien perspective visiting Earth

5696
02:07:59,990 --> 02:08:00,000

 

5697
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:02,209

I think America is one of the greatest

5698
02:08:02,209 --> 02:08:02,219
I think America is one of the greatest
 

5699
02:08:02,219 --> 02:08:03,950
I think America is one of the greatest
if not the greatest countries in the

5700
02:08:03,950 --> 02:08:03,960
if not the greatest countries in the
 

5701
02:08:03,960 --> 02:08:06,530
if not the greatest countries in the
history of human civilization and I

5702
02:08:06,530 --> 02:08:06,540
history of human civilization and I
 

5703
02:08:06,540 --> 02:08:10,310
history of human civilization and I
think that the the line between white

5704
02:08:10,310 --> 02:08:10,320
think that the the line between white
 

5705
02:08:10,320 --> 02:08:12,830
think that the the line between white
and black the racial struggle is the

5706
02:08:12,830 --> 02:08:12,840
and black the racial struggle is the
 

5707
02:08:12,840 --> 02:08:14,149
and black the racial struggle is the
thing that

5708
02:08:14,149 --> 02:08:14,159
thing that
 

5709
02:08:14,159 --> 02:08:17,450
thing that
in part made it a great nation there's

5710
02:08:17,450 --> 02:08:17,460
in part made it a great nation there's
 

5711
02:08:17,460 --> 02:08:20,390
in part made it a great nation there's
something about the division and the way

5712
02:08:20,390 --> 02:08:20,400
something about the division and the way
 

5713
02:08:20,400 --> 02:08:22,310
something about the division and the way
you alleviate that division through the

5714
02:08:22,310 --> 02:08:22,320
you alleviate that division through the
 

5715
02:08:22,320 --> 02:08:25,129
you alleviate that division through the
struggle for human rights that makes for

5716
02:08:25,129 --> 02:08:25,139
struggle for human rights that makes for
 

5717
02:08:25,139 --> 02:08:27,290
struggle for human rights that makes for
a great nation and so it's interesting

5718
02:08:27,290 --> 02:08:27,300
a great nation and so it's interesting
 

5719
02:08:27,300 --> 02:08:32,149
a great nation and so it's interesting
that the division is almost the fuel for

5720
02:08:32,149 --> 02:08:32,159
that the division is almost the fuel for
 

5721
02:08:32,159 --> 02:08:34,129
that the division is almost the fuel for
the greatness for our discovery of what

5722
02:08:34,129 --> 02:08:34,139
the greatness for our discovery of what
 

5723
02:08:34,139 --> 02:08:36,169
the greatness for our discovery of what
it means to be human what it means to be

5724
02:08:36,169 --> 02:08:36,179
it means to be human what it means to be
 

5725
02:08:36,179 --> 02:08:39,169
it means to be human what it means to be
or what Justice Means of

5726
02:08:39,169 --> 02:08:39,179
or what Justice Means of
 

5727
02:08:39,179 --> 02:08:41,450
or what Justice Means of
um and it's interesting that it seems

5728
02:08:41,450 --> 02:08:41,460
um and it's interesting that it seems
 

5729
02:08:41,460 --> 02:08:43,250
um and it's interesting that it seems
like there's the struggle that you're

5730
02:08:43,250 --> 02:08:43,260
like there's the struggle that you're
 

5731
02:08:43,260 --> 02:08:45,709
like there's the struggle that you're
you're where you're elucidating now but

5732
02:08:45,709 --> 02:08:45,719
you're where you're elucidating now but
 

5733
02:08:45,719 --> 02:08:50,030
you're where you're elucidating now but
that struggle itself is our search uh a

5734
02:08:50,030 --> 02:08:50,040
that struggle itself is our search uh a
 

5735
02:08:50,040 --> 02:08:52,370
that struggle itself is our search uh a
man's search for meaning and Justice and

5736
02:08:52,370 --> 02:08:52,380
man's search for meaning and Justice and
 

5737
02:08:52,380 --> 02:08:54,530
man's search for meaning and Justice and
freedom I think there's something to

5738
02:08:54,530 --> 02:08:54,540
freedom I think there's something to
 

5739
02:08:54,540 --> 02:08:55,970
freedom I think there's something to
that as you were speaking I was

5740
02:08:55,970 --> 02:08:55,980
that as you were speaking I was
 

5741
02:08:55,980 --> 02:08:57,649
that as you were speaking I was
immediately thinking of

5742
02:08:57,649 --> 02:08:57,659
immediately thinking of
 

5743
02:08:57,659 --> 02:08:59,629
immediately thinking of
a person who you know most jumped to

5744
02:08:59,629 --> 02:08:59,639
a person who you know most jumped to
 

5745
02:08:59,639 --> 02:09:02,089
a person who you know most jumped to
mine was The Great Frederick Douglass

5746
02:09:02,089 --> 02:09:02,099
mine was The Great Frederick Douglass
 

5747
02:09:02,099 --> 02:09:04,370
mine was The Great Frederick Douglass
so I mean here you have a person who in

5748
02:09:04,370 --> 02:09:04,380
so I mean here you have a person who in
 

5749
02:09:04,380 --> 02:09:06,050
so I mean here you have a person who in
my view is one of the great people in

5750
02:09:06,050 --> 02:09:06,060
my view is one of the great people in
 

5751
02:09:06,060 --> 02:09:08,330
my view is one of the great people in
the history of the world

5752
02:09:08,330 --> 02:09:08,340
the history of the world
 

5753
02:09:08,340 --> 02:09:11,589
the history of the world
and you know one of the things that

5754
02:09:11,589 --> 02:09:11,599
and you know one of the things that
 

5755
02:09:11,599 --> 02:09:14,450
and you know one of the things that
ironically enabled him to become one of

5756
02:09:14,450 --> 02:09:14,460
ironically enabled him to become one of
 

5757
02:09:14,460 --> 02:09:15,709
ironically enabled him to become one of
the great people of the world he was

5758
02:09:15,709 --> 02:09:15,719
the great people of the world he was
 

5759
02:09:15,719 --> 02:09:17,930
the great people of the world he was
born he was born into slavery

5760
02:09:17,930 --> 02:09:17,940
born he was born into slavery
 

5761
02:09:17,940 --> 02:09:20,270
born he was born into slavery
his overcoming

5762
02:09:20,270 --> 02:09:20,280
his overcoming
 

5763
02:09:20,280 --> 02:09:22,790
his overcoming
was the very thing

5764
02:09:22,790 --> 02:09:22,800
was the very thing
 

5765
02:09:22,800 --> 02:09:26,209
was the very thing
that in a sense made him

5766
02:09:26,209 --> 02:09:26,219
that in a sense made him
 

5767
02:09:26,219 --> 02:09:28,850
that in a sense made him
this Larger than Life figure and

5768
02:09:28,850 --> 02:09:28,860
this Larger than Life figure and
 

5769
02:09:28,860 --> 02:09:30,709
this Larger than Life figure and
I think there's something to you I will

5770
02:09:30,709 --> 02:09:30,719
I think there's something to you I will
 

5771
02:09:30,719 --> 02:09:32,209
I think there's something to you I will
say this because a minute ago you

5772
02:09:32,209 --> 02:09:32,219
say this because a minute ago you
 

5773
02:09:32,219 --> 02:09:35,570
say this because a minute ago you
mentioned optimism and pessimism

5774
02:09:35,570 --> 02:09:35,580
mentioned optimism and pessimism
 

5775
02:09:35,580 --> 02:09:38,390
mentioned optimism and pessimism
and

5776
02:09:38,390 --> 02:09:38,400
and
 

5777
02:09:38,400 --> 02:09:40,669
and
uh

5778
02:09:40,669 --> 02:09:40,679
uh
 

5779
02:09:40,679 --> 02:09:45,169
uh
I'd say in the last

5780

been the predominant justification
 

6751
02:31:31,200 --> 02:31:34,190
been the predominant justification
whether people owned up to it or not but

6753
02:31:34,200 --> 02:31:35,809

not going to stand for that
so for purpose of legitimation

6800
02:32:34,429 --> 02:32:34,439
so for purpose of legitimation
 

6801
02:32:34,439 --> 02:32:39,110
so for purpose of legitimation
we need to for for purposes of buy-in

6802
02:32:39,110 --> 02:32:39,120
we need to for for purposes of buy-in
 

6803
02:32:39,120 --> 02:32:42,469
we need to for for purposes of buy-in
we need to have a situation in which

6804
02:32:42,469 --> 02:32:42,479
we need to have a situation in which
 

6805
02:32:42,479 --> 02:32:45,110
we need to have a situation in which
people get the sense that

6806
02:32:45,110 --> 02:32:45,120
people get the sense that
 

6807
02:32:45,120 --> 02:32:48,530
people get the sense that
even if they're sort of low down

6808
02:32:48,530 --> 02:32:48,540
even if they're sort of low down
 

6809
02:32:48,540 --> 02:32:50,570
even if they're sort of low down
they're still part of the story they're

6810
02:32:50,570 --> 02:32:50,580
they're still part of the story they're
 

6811
02:32:50,580 --> 02:32:52,130
they're still part of the story they're
part of the team

6812
02:32:52,130 --> 02:32:52,140
part of the team
 

6813
02:32:52,140 --> 02:32:54,469
part of the team
so that's part of the sort of

6814
02:32:54,469 --> 02:32:54,479
so that's part of the sort of
 

6815
02:32:54,479 --> 02:32:57,190
so that's part of the sort of
you know just you know I don't know

6816
02:32:57,190 --> 02:32:57,200
you know just you know I don't know
 

6817
02:32:57,200 --> 02:33:00,650
you know just you know I don't know
distributive justice notion do you think

6818
02:33:00,650 --> 02:33:00,660
distributive justice notion do you think
 

6819
02:33:00,660 --> 02:33:02,270
distributive justice notion do you think
that's power to that I mean do you think

6820
02:33:02,270 --> 02:33:02,280
that's power to that I mean do you think
 

6821
02:33:02,280 --> 02:33:03,590
that's power to that I mean do you think
there's value there's correctness to

6822
02:33:03,590 --> 02:33:03,600
there's value there's correctness to
 

6823
02:33:03,600 --> 02:33:05,690
there's value there's correctness to
that kind of idea I think there's some

6824
02:33:05,690 --> 02:33:05,700
that kind of idea I think there's some
 

6825
02:33:05,700 --> 02:33:07,550
that kind of idea I think there's some
because for the application process for

6826
02:33:07,550 --> 02:33:07,560
because for the application process for
 

6827
02:33:07,560 --> 02:33:08,870
because for the application process for
different universities I think that

6828
02:33:08,870 --> 02:33:08,880
different universities I think that
 

6829
02:33:08,880 --> 02:33:11,090
different universities I think that
that's probably a driving narrative the

6830
02:33:11,090 --> 02:33:11,100
that's probably a driving narrative the
 

6831
02:33:11,100 --> 02:33:14,690
that's probably a driving narrative the
justification for for

6832
02:33:14,690 --> 02:33:14,700

 

6833
02:33:14,700 --> 02:33:16,790

well affirmative action I don't know

6834
02:33:16,790 --> 02:33:16,800
well affirmative action I don't know
 

6835
02:33:16,800 --> 02:33:20,090
well affirmative action I don't know
where we put Dei efforts because they

6836
02:33:20,090 --> 02:33:20,100
where we put Dei efforts because they
 

6837
02:33:20,100 --> 02:33:22,309
where we put Dei efforts because they
overlap but they're not perfectly uh

6838
02:33:22,309 --> 02:33:22,319
overlap but they're not perfectly uh
 

6839
02:33:22,319 --> 02:33:25,370
overlap but they're not perfectly uh
overlapping the reason that the school

6840
02:33:25,370 --> 02:33:25,380
overlapping the reason that the school
 

6841
02:33:25,380 --> 02:33:27,830
overlapping the reason that the school
so yeah as you know there is a case

6842
02:33:27,830 --> 02:33:27,840
so yeah as you know there is a case
 

6843
02:33:27,840 --> 02:33:30,170
so yeah as you know there is a case
it'll we'll know about it it'll be

going on for the most part I mean if
 

6903
02:34:45,000 --> 02:34:47,210
going on for the most part I mean if
that's what's really going on why why

6904
02:34:47,210 --> 02:34:47,220
that's what's really going on why why
 

6905
02:34:47,220 --> 02:34:49,969
that's what's really going on why why
don't we have more foreign students

6906
02:34:49,969 --> 02:34:49,979
don't we have more foreign students
 

6907
02:34:49,979 --> 02:34:52,070
don't we have more foreign students
you know why why isn't there a greater

6908
02:34:52,070 --> 02:34:52,080
you know why why isn't there a greater
 

6909
02:34:52,080 --> 02:34:53,750
you know why why isn't there a greater
effort to bring in more foreign students

6910
02:34:53,750 --> 02:34:53,760
effort to bring in more foreign students
 

6911
02:34:53,760 --> 02:34:55,250
effort to bring in more foreign students
why isn't there a greater effort to

6912
02:34:55,250 --> 02:34:55,260
why isn't there a greater effort to
 

6913
02:34:55,260 --> 02:34:59,090
why isn't there a greater effort to
bring in more I don't know uh religious

6914
02:34:59,090 --> 02:34:59,100
bring in more I don't know uh religious
 

6915
02:34:59,100 --> 02:35:01,370
bring in more I don't know uh religious
fundamentalists why isn't there a

6916
02:35:01,370 --> 02:35:01,380
fundamentalists why isn't there a
 

6917
02:35:01,380 --> 02:35:02,990
fundamentalists why isn't there a
greater effort to bring in and you could

6918
02:35:02,990 --> 02:35:03,000
greater effort to bring in and you could
 

6919
02:35:03,000 --> 02:35:04,250
greater effort to bring in and you could
just name

6920
02:35:04,250 --> 02:35:04,260
just name
 

6921
02:35:04,260 --> 02:35:06,830
just name
various groups that are you know you

6922
02:35:06,830 --> 02:35:06,840
various groups that are you know you
 

6923
02:35:06,840 --> 02:35:08,690
various groups that are you know you
hardly ever see them on campus so you

6924
02:35:08,690 --> 02:35:08,700
hardly ever see them on campus so you
 

6925
02:35:08,700 --> 02:35:11,150
hardly ever see them on campus so you
don't think this kind of effort of

6926
02:35:11,150 --> 02:35:11,160
don't think this kind of effort of
 

6927
02:35:11,160 --> 02:35:14,150
don't think this kind of effort of
driving towards diversity is um

6928
02:35:14,150 --> 02:35:14,160
driving towards diversity is um
 

6929
02:35:14,160 --> 02:35:16,550
driving towards diversity is um
uh rigorous enough I think it's often

6930
02:35:16,550 --> 02:35:16,560
uh rigorous enough I think it's often
 

6931
02:35:16,560 --> 02:35:19,070
uh rigorous enough I think it's often
pretextual I think frankly the real

6932
02:35:19,070 --> 02:35:19,080
pretextual I think frankly the real
 

6933
02:35:19,080 --> 02:35:21,969
pretextual I think frankly the real
reason has to do with

6934
02:35:21,969 --> 02:35:21,979
reason has to do with
 

6935
02:35:21,979 --> 02:35:24,110
reason has to do with
the belief and I think it's a good

6936
02:35:24,110 --> 02:35:24,120
the belief and I think it's a good
 

6937
02:35:24,120 --> 02:35:26,330
the belief and I think it's a good
belief I associate myself with the

6938
02:35:26,330 --> 02:35:26,340
belief I associate myself with the
 

6939
02:35:26,340 --> 02:35:28,670
belief I associate myself with the
belief it's it's just that because of

6940
02:35:28,670 --> 02:35:28,680
belief it's it's just that because of
 

6941
02:35:28,680 --> 02:35:31,610
belief it's it's just that because of
the legal rules the authorities can't

6942
02:35:31,610 --> 02:35:31,620
the legal rules the authorities can't
 

6943
02:35:31,620 --> 02:35:34,790
the legal rules the authorities can't
say this belief out loud

6944
02:35:34,790 --> 02:35:34,800
say this belief out loud
 

6945
02:35:34,800 --> 02:35:36,830
say this belief out loud
but it's still the case that a lot of

6946
02:35:36,830 --> 02:35:36,840
but it's still the case that a lot of
 

6947
02:35:36,840 --> 02:35:39,230
but it's still the case that a lot of
Institutions want to

6948
02:35:39,230 --> 02:35:39,240
Institutions want to
 

6949
02:35:39,240 --> 02:35:42,290
Institutions want to
help American society overcome its

6950
02:35:42,290 --> 02:35:42,300
help American society overcome its
 

6951
02:35:42,300 --> 02:35:43,849
help American society overcome its
racial past

6952
02:35:43,849 --> 02:35:43,859
racial past
 

6953
02:35:43,859 --> 02:35:46,910
racial past
the real animating Force now this thing

6954
02:35:46,910 --> 02:35:46,920
the real animating Force now this thing
 

6955
02:35:46,920 --> 02:35:47,929
the real animating Force now this thing
about

6956
02:35:47,929 --> 02:35:47,939
about
 

6957
02:35:47,939 --> 02:35:49,670
about
you know we'll have better classroom

6958
02:35:49,670 --> 02:35:49,680
you know we'll have better classroom
 

6959
02:35:49,680 --> 02:35:52,429
you know we'll have better classroom
discussions uh you know some discussions

6960
02:35:52,429 --> 02:35:52,439
discussions uh you know some discussions
 

6961
02:35:52,439 --> 02:35:54,950
discussions uh you know some discussions
I mean you know with some subjects

6962
02:35:54,950 --> 02:35:54,960
I mean you know with some subjects
 

6963
02:35:54,960 --> 02:35:57,770
I mean you know with some subjects
yeah listen I'm you know I'm in

6964
02:35:57,770 --> 02:35:57,780
yeah listen I'm you know I'm in
 

6965
02:35:57,780 --> 02:36:00,889
yeah listen I'm you know I'm in
ignoramus when it comes to physics my

6966
02:36:00,889 --> 02:36:00,899
ignoramus when it comes to physics my
 

6967
02:36:00,899 --> 02:36:04,010
ignoramus when it comes to physics my
sense of it is however that uh if you're

6968
02:36:04,010 --> 02:36:04,020
sense of it is however that uh if you're
 

6969
02:36:04,020 --> 02:36:06,050
sense of it is however that uh if you're
talking about physics you're talking

6970
02:36:06,050 --> 02:36:06,060
talking about physics you're talking
 

6971
02:36:06,060 --> 02:36:08,270
talking about physics you're talking
about physics and frankly it doesn't

6972
02:36:08,270 --> 02:36:08,280
about physics and frankly it doesn't
 

6973
02:36:08,280 --> 02:36:10,730
about physics and frankly it doesn't
much matter in terms of mastering

6974
02:36:10,730 --> 02:36:10,740
much matter in terms of mastering
 

6975
02:36:10,740 --> 02:36:13,849
much matter in terms of mastering
physics what the demographics of that

6976
02:36:13,849 --> 02:36:13,859
physics what the demographics of that
 

6977
02:36:13,859 --> 02:36:16,070
physics what the demographics of that
classroom are like well you either know

6978
02:36:16,070 --> 02:36:16,080
classroom are like well you either know
 

6979
02:36:16,080 --> 02:36:17,510
classroom are like well you either know
physics or you don't the interesting

6980
02:36:17,510 --> 02:36:17,520
physics or you don't the interesting
 

6981
02:36:17,520 --> 02:36:18,830
physics or you don't the interesting
thing I've noticed since doing this

6982
02:36:18,830 --> 02:36:18,840
thing I've noticed since doing this
 

6983
02:36:18,840 --> 02:36:21,830
thing I've noticed since doing this
podcast is uh one way it does matter

6984
02:36:21,830 --> 02:36:21,840
podcast is uh one way it does matter
 

6985
02:36:21,840 --> 02:36:26,210
podcast is uh one way it does matter
it's really lonely when you do a thing

6986
02:36:26,210 --> 02:36:26,220
it's really lonely when you do a thing
 

6987
02:36:26,220 --> 02:36:28,370
it's really lonely when you do a thing
and you don't see somebody that looks

6988
02:36:28,370 --> 02:36:28,380
and you don't see somebody that looks
 

6989
02:36:28,380 --> 02:36:30,650
and you don't see somebody that looks
like you doing that thing okay and it's

6990
02:36:30,650 --> 02:36:30,660
like you doing that thing okay and it's
 

6991
02:36:30,660 --> 02:36:33,290
like you doing that thing okay and it's
such a seemingly stupid thing why does

6992
02:36:33,290 --> 02:36:33,300
such a seemingly stupid thing why does
 

6993
02:36:33,300 --> 02:36:35,510
such a seemingly stupid thing why does
it matter if there's another person that

6994
02:36:35,510 --> 02:36:35,520
it matter if there's another person that
 

6995
02:36:35,520 --> 02:36:38,330
it matter if there's another person that
looks like you in this very shallow

6996
02:36:38,330 --> 02:36:38,340
looks like you in this very shallow
 

6997
02:36:38,340 --> 02:36:40,490
looks like you in this very shallow
sense but it seems to matter to people

6998
02:36:40,490 --> 02:36:40,500
sense but it seems to matter to people
 

6999
02:36:40,500 --> 02:36:43,130
sense but it seems to matter to people
and when I talk to for example women on

7000
02:36:43,130 --> 02:36:43,140
and when I talk to for example women on
 

7001
02:36:43,140 --> 02:36:44,870
and when I talk to for example women on
this podcast a lot of women reach out

7002
02:36:44,870 --> 02:36:44,880
this podcast a lot of women reach out
 

7003
02:36:44,880 --> 02:36:47,270
this podcast a lot of women reach out
saying how inspiring that is that's

7004
02:36:47,270 --> 02:36:47,280
saying how inspiring that is that's
 

7005
02:36:47,280 --> 02:36:49,370
saying how inspiring that is that's
interesting right like I I think we're

7006
02:36:49,370 --> 02:36:49,380
interesting right like I I think we're
 

7007
02:36:49,380 --> 02:36:51,410
interesting right like I I think we're
still human and we see people that look

7008
02:36:51,410 --> 02:36:51,420
still human and we see people that look
 

7009
02:36:51,420 --> 02:36:52,730
still human and we see people that look
like us

7010
02:36:52,730 --> 02:36:52,740
like us
 

7011
02:36:52,740 --> 02:36:55,670
like us
and uh this kind of narrow shallow

7012
02:36:55,670 --> 02:36:55,680
and uh this kind of narrow shallow
 

7013
02:36:55,680 --> 02:36:57,349
and uh this kind of narrow shallow
definition of diversity still matters

7014
02:36:57,349 --> 02:36:57,359
definition of diversity still matters
 

7015
02:36:57,359 --> 02:37:00,530
definition of diversity still matters
okay well you know I think I think

7016
02:37:00,530 --> 02:37:00,540
okay well you know I think I think
 

7017
02:37:00,540 --> 02:37:04,730
okay well you know I think I think
I think you've made a good point and

7018
02:37:04,730 --> 02:37:04,740
I think you've made a good point and
 

7019
02:37:04,740 --> 02:37:07,130
I think you've made a good point and
maybe so so let's go back to the physics

7020
02:37:07,130 --> 02:37:07,140
maybe so so let's go back to the physics
 

7021
02:37:07,140 --> 02:37:09,110
maybe so so let's go back to the physics
I mean let's suppose that

7022
02:37:09,110 --> 02:37:09,120
I mean let's suppose that
 

7023
02:37:09,120 --> 02:37:11,630
I mean let's suppose that
under one scenario there's a classroom

7024
02:37:11,630 --> 02:37:11,640
under one scenario there's a classroom
 

7025
02:37:11,640 --> 02:37:14,870
under one scenario there's a classroom
and a kid sticks his head in a black kid

7026
02:37:14,870 --> 02:37:14,880
and a kid sticks his head in a black kid
 

7027
02:37:14,880 --> 02:37:16,969
and a kid sticks his head in a black kid
sticks a set in the classroom and

7028
02:37:16,969 --> 02:37:16,979
sticks a set in the classroom and
 

7029
02:37:16,979 --> 02:37:19,969
sticks a set in the classroom and
doesn't see anybody else black there and

7030
02:37:19,969 --> 02:37:19,979
doesn't see anybody else black there and
 

7031
02:37:19,979 --> 02:37:21,710
doesn't see anybody else black there and
has to make a quick decision and says

7032
02:37:21,710 --> 02:37:21,720
has to make a quick decision and says
 

7033
02:37:21,720 --> 02:37:24,349
has to make a quick decision and says
yeah you know nah this ain't for me

7034
02:37:24,349 --> 02:37:24,359
yeah you know nah this ain't for me
 

7035
02:37:24,359 --> 02:37:27,050
yeah you know nah this ain't for me
versus they stick their head in the

7036
02:37:27,050 --> 02:37:27,060
versus they stick their head in the
 

7037
02:37:27,060 --> 02:37:29,510
versus they stick their head in the
classroom they see a smattering of other

7038
02:37:29,510 --> 02:37:29,520
classroom they see a smattering of other
 

7039
02:37:29,520 --> 02:37:30,950
classroom they see a smattering of other
black people in the classroom they say

7040
02:37:30,950 --> 02:37:30,960
black people in the classroom they say
 

7041
02:37:30,960 --> 02:37:33,290
black people in the classroom they say
let me try me try this and then they try

7042
02:37:33,290 --> 02:37:33,300
let me try me try this and then they try
 

7043
02:37:33,300 --> 02:37:35,210
let me try me try this and then they try
it and it turns out damn it they're you

7044
02:37:35,210 --> 02:37:35,220
it and it turns out damn it they're you
 

7045
02:37:35,220 --> 02:37:37,250
it and it turns out damn it they're you
know Albert Einstein

7046
02:37:37,250 --> 02:37:37,260
know Albert Einstein
 

7047
02:37:37,260 --> 02:37:40,670
know Albert Einstein
so you know to that extent I can see you

7048
02:37:40,670 --> 02:37:40,680
so you know to that extent I can see you
 

7049
02:37:40,680 --> 02:37:41,330
so you know to that extent I can see you
know

7050
02:37:41,330 --> 02:37:41,340
know
 

7051
02:37:41,340 --> 02:37:43,849
know
under that scenario maybe it does matter

7052
02:37:43,849 --> 02:37:43,859
under that scenario maybe it does matter
 

7053
02:37:43,859 --> 02:37:45,889
under that scenario maybe it does matter
so you know I'll have to recalibrate

7054
02:37:45,889 --> 02:37:45,899
so you know I'll have to recalibrate
 

7055
02:37:45,899 --> 02:37:48,830
so you know I'll have to recalibrate
still those are the three those are the

7056
02:37:48,830 --> 02:37:48,840
still those are the three those are the
 

7057
02:37:48,840 --> 02:37:51,410
still those are the three those are the
three leading justifications for

7058
02:37:51,410 --> 02:37:51,420

on a racial basis
they're going to be

7100
02:38:43,610 --> 02:38:43,620
they're going to be
 

7101
02:38:43,620 --> 02:38:46,429
they're going to be
people who observe that

7102
02:38:46,429 --> 02:38:46,439
people who observe that
 

7103
02:38:46,439 --> 02:38:47,990
people who observe that
and who are going to be thinking to

and who are going to be thinking to
themselves hmm

7106
02:38:50,170 --> 02:38:50,180
themselves hmm
 

7107
02:38:50,180 --> 02:38:53,330
themselves hmm
if so and so is here and they were given

7108
02:38:53,330 --> 02:38:53,340
if so and so is here and they were given
 

7109
02:38:53,340 --> 02:38:55,969
if so and so is here and they were given
a special boost

7110
02:38:55,969 --> 02:38:55,979
a special boost
 

7111
02:38:55,979 --> 02:38:59,630
a special boost
doesn't that mean that they were not as

7112
02:38:59,630 --> 02:38:59,640
doesn't that mean that they were not as
 

7113
02:38:59,640 --> 02:39:01,130
doesn't that mean that they were not as
proficient

7114
02:39:01,130 --> 02:39:01,140
proficient
 

7115
02:39:01,140 --> 02:39:03,650
proficient
as the other people who were here and

7116
02:39:03,650 --> 02:39:03,660
as the other people who were here and
 

7117
02:39:03,660 --> 02:39:06,110
as the other people who were here and
who did not have that boost

7118
02:39:06,110 --> 02:39:06,120
who did not have that boost
 

7119
02:39:06,120 --> 02:39:08,570
who did not have that boost
so if they are not as proficient that

7120
02:39:08,570 --> 02:39:08,580
so if they are not as proficient that
 

7121
02:39:08,580 --> 02:39:11,389
so if they are not as proficient that
means that they might not be as good

7122
02:39:11,389 --> 02:39:11,399
means that they might not be as good
 

7123
02:39:11,399 --> 02:39:15,230
means that they might not be as good
they might not be as up to Snuff

02:39:15,230 --> 02:39:15,240
they might not be as up to Snuff

I think that there is a certain sort of
denialism

7554
02:48:02,750 --> 02:48:02,760
denialism
 

7555
02:48:02,760 --> 02:48:05,990
denialism
that has accompanied the affirmative

7556
02:48:05,990 --> 02:48:06,000
that has accompanied the affirmative
 

7557
02:48:06,000 --> 02:48:07,090
that has accompanied the affirmative
action

7558
02:48:07,090 --> 02:48:07,100
action
 

7559
02:48:07,100 --> 02:48:09,230
action
debate so

7560
02:48:09,230 --> 02:48:09,240
debate so
 

7561
02:48:09,240 --> 02:48:12,650
debate so
because

7562
02:48:12,650 --> 02:48:12,660

 

7563
02:48:12,660 --> 02:48:16,870

you know black people like myself

you know black people like myself
want to avoid

02:48:20,650 --> 02:48:20,660
want to avoid
 

7567
02:48:20,660 --> 02:48:24,410
want to avoid
the stigmatizing burden of affirmative

7568
02:48:24,410 --> 02:48:24,420
the stigmatizing burden of affirmative
 

7569
02:48:24,420 --> 02:48:27,650
the stigmatizing burden of affirmative
action there's some people who to deal

7570
02:48:27,650 --> 02:48:27,660
action there's some people who to deal
 

7571
02:48:27,660 --> 02:48:28,849
action there's some people who to deal
with that

7572
02:48:28,849 --> 02:48:28,859
with that
 

7573
02:48:28,859 --> 02:48:31,250
with that
have said oh

actually
 

7577
02:48:33,000 --> 02:48:35,389
actually
there is no difference

7578
02:48:35,389 --> 02:48:35,399
there is no difference
 

7579
02:48:35,399 --> 02:48:36,889
there is no difference
between

7580
02:48:36,889 --> 02:48:36,899
between
 

7581
02:48:36,899 --> 02:48:39,110
between
you know the beneficiaries of

7582
02:48:39,110 --> 02:48:39,120
you know the beneficiaries of
 

7583
02:48:39,120 --> 02:48:40,849
you know the beneficiaries of
affirmative action

7584
02:48:40,849 --> 02:48:40,859
affirmative action
 

7585
02:48:40,859 --> 02:48:42,590
affirmative action
and the other kids

7586
02:48:42,590 --> 02:48:42,600
and the other kids
 

7587
02:48:42,600 --> 02:48:44,510
and the other kids
there is no difference

7588
02:48:44,510 --> 02:48:44,520
there is no difference
 

7589
02:48:44,520 --> 02:48:46,790
there is no difference
um if if the affirmative action kids got

7590
02:48:46,790 --> 02:48:46,800
um if if the affirmative action kids got
 

7591
02:48:46,800 --> 02:48:50,590
um if if the affirmative action kids got
let's say a 500 and the other kids got a

7592
02:48:50,590 --> 02:48:50,600
let's say a 500 and the other kids got a
 

7593
02:48:50,600 --> 02:48:53,690
let's say a 500 and the other kids got a
750. uh that doesn't make any difference

7594
02:48:53,690 --> 02:48:53,700
750. uh that doesn't make any difference
 

7595
02:48:53,700 --> 02:48:56,330
750. uh that doesn't make any difference
that's just BS they're you know the only

7596
02:48:56,330 --> 02:48:56,340
that's just BS they're you know the only
 

7597
02:48:56,340 --> 02:48:59,510
that's just BS they're you know the only
reason the kid who you know the 550 kid

7598
02:48:59,510 --> 02:48:59,520
reason the kid who you know the 550 kid
 

7599
02:48:59,520 --> 02:49:02,870
reason the kid who you know the 550 kid
didn't get 750 is because the test asks

7600
02:49:02,870 --> 02:49:02,880
didn't get 750 is because the test asks
 

7601
02:49:02,880 --> 02:49:06,349
didn't get 750 is because the test asks
all sorts of you know biased culturally

what a yacht is you could know what a
 

7623
02:49:27,840 --> 02:49:29,930

[Music]
and there's this denialism

7628
02:49:34,490 --> 02:49:34,500
and there's this denialism
 

7629
02:49:34,500 --> 02:49:38,630
and there's this denialism
that I think has really seeped into

7630
02:49:38,630 --> 02:49:38,640
that I think has really seeped into
 

7631
02:49:38,640 --> 02:49:41,090
that I think has really seeped into
not just the you know in into various

7632
02:49:41,090 --> 02:49:41,100
not just the you know in into various
 

7633
02:49:41,100 --> 02:49:43,250
not just the you know in into various
conversations that can have a slippery

7634
02:49:43,250 --> 02:49:43,260
conversations that can have a slippery
 

7635
02:49:43,260 --> 02:49:45,830
conversations that can have a slippery
slope effect that's beyond just this yes

7636
02:49:45,830 --> 02:49:45,840
slope effect that's beyond just this yes
 

7637
02:49:45,840 --> 02:49:48,050
slope effect that's beyond just this yes
and you know we see it in various ways

7638
02:49:48,050 --> 02:49:48,060
and you know we see it in various ways
 

7639
02:49:48,060 --> 02:49:49,910
and you know we see it in various ways
so you know this this you know this

7640
02:49:49,910 --> 02:49:49,920
so you know this this you know this
 

7641
02:49:49,920 --> 02:49:52,010
so you know this this you know this
attack on testing

7642
02:49:52,010 --> 02:49:52,020
attack on testing
 

7643
02:49:52,020 --> 02:49:54,230
attack on testing
it's not like I'm holding the you know

7644
02:49:54,230 --> 02:49:54,240
it's not like I'm holding the you know
 

7645
02:49:54,240 --> 02:49:56,630
it's not like I'm holding the you know
you know some tests are not good tests I

7646
02:49:56,630 --> 02:49:56,640
you know some tests are not good tests I
 

7647
02:49:56,640 --> 02:49:57,830
you know some tests are not good tests I
think we should be skeptical of

7648
02:49:57,830 --> 02:49:57,840
think we should be skeptical of
 

7649
02:49:57,840 --> 02:49:59,929
think we should be skeptical of
everything but there are a lot of tests

7650
02:49:59,929 --> 02:49:59,939
everything but there are a lot of tests
 

7651
02:49:59,939 --> 02:50:02,150
everything but there are a lot of tests
that yeah they tell us something all

7652
02:50:02,150 --> 02:50:02,160
that yeah they tell us something all
 

7653
02:50:02,160 --> 02:50:04,370
that yeah they tell us something all
right they tell us who knows what

7654
02:50:04,370 --> 02:50:04,380
right they tell us who knows what
 

7655
02:50:04,380 --> 02:50:05,929
right they tell us who knows what
and

7656
02:50:05,929 --> 02:50:05,939
and
 

7657
02:50:05,939 --> 02:50:07,610
and
um there's some people who are really

7658
02:50:07,610 --> 02:50:07,620
um there's some people who are really
 

7659
02:50:07,620 --> 02:50:09,349
um there's some people who are really
you know Dead Set against testing

7660
02:50:09,349 --> 02:50:09,359
you know Dead Set against testing
 

7661
02:50:09,359 --> 02:50:10,550
you know Dead Set against testing
because they're dead set against

7662
02:50:10,550 --> 02:50:10,560
because they're dead set against
 

7663
02:50:10,560 --> 02:50:13,370
because they're dead set against
anything that might show a gap

7664
02:50:13,370 --> 02:50:13,380
anything that might show a gap
 

7665
02:50:13,380 --> 02:50:15,710
anything that might show a gap
well I think by the way you know are

7666
02:50:15,710 --> 02:50:15,720
well I think by the way you know are
 

7667
02:50:15,720 --> 02:50:17,929
well I think by the way you know are
there gaps yeah they're gaps

7668
02:50:17,929 --> 02:50:17,939
there gaps yeah they're gaps
 

7669
02:50:17,939 --> 02:50:20,450
there gaps yeah they're gaps
and what we need to do is be cognizant

7670
02:50:20,450 --> 02:50:20,460
and what we need to do is be cognizant
 

7671
02:50:20,460 --> 02:50:22,010
and what we need to do is be cognizant
of those gaps

7672
02:50:22,010 --> 02:50:22,020
of those gaps
 

7673
02:50:22,020 --> 02:50:25,910
of those gaps
and do things to make it so that if

7674
02:50:25,910 --> 02:50:25,920
and do things to make it so that if
 

7675
02:50:25,920 --> 02:50:27,469
and do things to make it so that if
there's a gap if you're if you're

7676
02:50:27,469 --> 02:50:27,479
there's a gap if you're if you're
 

7677
02:50:27,479 --> 02:50:28,630
there's a gap if you're if you're
deficient

7678
02:50:28,630 --> 02:50:28,640
deficient
 

7679
02:50:28,640 --> 02:50:31,610
deficient
no no shame in being deficient heck I'm

7680
02:50:31,610 --> 02:50:31,620
no no shame in being deficient heck I'm
 

7681
02:50:31,620 --> 02:50:34,010
no no shame in being deficient heck I'm
deficient about a lot of things

7682
02:50:34,010 --> 02:50:34,020
deficient about a lot of things
 

7683
02:50:34,020 --> 02:50:37,550
deficient about a lot of things
let's you know let's learn

7684
02:50:37,550 --> 02:50:37,560
let's you know let's learn
 

7685
02:50:37,560 --> 02:50:39,770
let's you know let's learn
so that I catch up

7686
02:50:39,770 --> 02:50:39,780
so that I catch up
 

7687
02:50:39,780 --> 02:50:41,570
so that I catch up
but others you know but I think

7688
02:50:41,570 --> 02:50:41,580
but others you know but I think
 

7689
02:50:41,580 --> 02:50:43,490
but others you know but I think
sometimes there have been people who've

7690
02:50:43,490 --> 02:50:43,500
sometimes there have been people who've
 

7691
02:50:43,500 --> 02:50:45,530
sometimes there have been people who've
been afraid

7692
02:50:45,530 --> 02:50:45,540
been afraid
 

7693
02:50:45,540 --> 02:50:49,210
been afraid
of even acknowledging

7694
02:50:49,210 --> 02:50:49,220
of even acknowledging
 

7695
02:50:49,220 --> 02:50:53,870
of even acknowledging
the gaps of course there's uh I guess a

7696
02:50:53,870 --> 02:50:53,880
the gaps of course there's uh I guess a
 

7697
02:50:53,880 --> 02:50:55,610
the gaps of course there's uh I guess a
colleague of yours Michael sandel with

7698
02:50:55,610 --> 02:50:55,620
colleague of yours Michael sandel with
 

7699
02:50:55,620 --> 02:50:58,490
colleague of yours Michael sandel with
uh with tyranny and Merit there's uh

7700
02:50:58,490 --> 02:50:58,500
uh with tyranny and Merit there's uh
 

7701
02:50:58,500 --> 02:51:00,469
uh with tyranny and Merit there's uh
interesting rigorous ways to kind of

7702
02:51:00,469 --> 02:51:00,479
interesting rigorous ways to kind of
 

7703
02:51:00,479 --> 02:51:02,870
interesting rigorous ways to kind of
challenge ways on the flip side of that

7704
02:51:02,870 --> 02:51:02,880
challenge ways on the flip side of that
 

7705
02:51:02,880 --> 02:51:05,150
challenge ways on the flip side of that
were obsessing with Merit can go wrong

7706
02:51:05,150 --> 02:51:05,160
were obsessing with Merit can go wrong
 

7707
02:51:05,160 --> 02:51:07,610
were obsessing with Merit can go wrong
also yes uh you mentioned Michael sandel

7708
02:51:07,610 --> 02:51:07,620
