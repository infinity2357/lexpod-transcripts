you know in local schools and so there
 

191
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,490
you know in local schools and so there
was an idea that you know women could

192
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:25,500
was an idea that you know women could
 

193
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,890

time uh before I embarked on my studies
at University as you're speaking now

908

at University as you're speaking now
 

909
00:15:55,019 --> 00:15:56,930
at University as you're speaking now
it's reminding me that there's a

different way to look both at history
 

913
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,970
different way to look both at history
and a geography in the different places

914
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:01,980
and a geography in the different places
 

915
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:03,590
and a geography in the different places
is

916
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:03,600
is
 

917
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,310
is
um

918

um
 

919
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,410
um
you know this is an industrial region

920
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:06,420
you know this is an industrial region
 

921
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:09,170
you know this is an industrial region
that's right and it echoes in the

922
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:09,180
that's right and it echoes in the
 

923
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:11,449
that's right and it echoes in the
experience of living there

924
00:16:11,449 --> 00:16:11,459
experience of living there
 

925
00:16:11,459 --> 00:16:15,889
experience of living there
is more captured not by Moscow or Kiev

926
00:16:15,889 --> 00:16:15,899
is more captured not by Moscow or Kiev
 

927
00:16:15,899 --> 00:16:19,610
is more captured not by Moscow or Kiev
but by at least historically but by just

928
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:19,620
but by at least historically but by just
 

929
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:22,250
but by at least historically but by just
being a mining town and Industry that's

930
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:22,260
being a mining town and Industry that's
 

931
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:24,290
being a mining town and Industry that's
right in the place itself yeah yeah I

932
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:24,300
right in the place itself yeah yeah I
 

933
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,310
right in the place itself yeah yeah I
mean there are places in the United

mean there are places in the United
 

935
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,110

States and Appalachia and West Virginia
 

937
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,090

on the northeast of England you know was
 

943
00:16:33,899 --> 00:16:35,810
on the northeast of England you know was
the Cradle of the Industrial Revolution

944
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:35,820
the Cradle of the Industrial Revolution
 

945
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,970
the Cradle of the Industrial Revolution
it was the Industrial version of the

946
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:37,980
it was the Industrial version of the
 

947
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:40,249
it was the Industrial version of the
silica of Silicon Valley which has its

948
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:40,259
silica of Silicon Valley which has its
 

949
00:16:40,259 --> 00:16:41,210
silica of Silicon Valley which has its

I would say Contours and frames and when
 

953
00:16:44,339 --> 00:16:46,850
I would say Contours and frames and when
you come to those industrial areas your

954
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:46,860
you come to those industrial areas your
 

955
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:49,009
you come to those industrial areas your
previous identities get submerged in

956
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:49,019
previous identities get submerged in
 

957
00:16:49,019 --> 00:16:51,710

studies at talford that the Soviet Union
 

1445
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:18,950
studies at talford that the Soviet Union
basically unraveled and it really did

00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:18,960
basically unraveled and it really did
 

1447
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,409
basically unraveled and it really did
unravel it wasn't like it collapsed it

1448
00:25:21,409 --> 00:25:21,419
unravel it wasn't like it collapsed it
 

1449
00:25:21,419 --> 00:25:22,789
unravel it wasn't like it collapsed it
was basically that there were so many

put it on a different path that you know
no one was in agreement and it was

no one was in agreement and it was
 

1459
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,769

a loss of faith in the system in the
 

1467

population that in fact pulled it apart
 

1471
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,289
population that in fact pulled it apart
and of course in 1991

1472
00:25:48,289 --> 00:25:48,299
and of course in 1991
 

1473
00:25:48,299 --> 00:25:50,390
and of course in 1991
you get um

1474
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:50,400
you get um
 

1475
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,669
you get um
Boris Yeltsin as the head of the Russian

together and agreeing and essentially
ending it and gorbachevino so basically

1490
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:07,440
ending it and gorbachevino so basically
 

1491
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,049
ending it and gorbachevino so basically
I'm there at the the peak of this whole

1492
00:26:09,049 --> 00:26:09,059
I'm there at the the peak of this whole
 

1493
00:26:09,059 --> 00:26:10,970
I'm there at the the peak of this whole
kind of period of experimentation and

1494
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:10,980
kind of period of experimentation and
 

1495
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:12,830
kind of period of experimentation and
thinking about the future and within a

1496
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:12,840
thinking about the future and within a
 

1497
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,029
thinking about the future and within a
couple of years it's all kind of gone

1498
00:26:14,029 --> 00:26:14,039
couple of years it's all kind of gone
 

1499
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:15,590
couple of years it's all kind of gone
and it's on a different track entirely

1500
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:15,600
and it's on a different track entirely
 

1501
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,830
and it's on a different track entirely
well I wonder if we re-ran the 20th

1502
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:18,840
well I wonder if we re-ran the 20th
 

1503
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:22,430
well I wonder if we re-ran the 20th
century a thousand times if how many

1504
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:22,440
century a thousand times if how many
 

1505
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:25,010
century a thousand times if how many
times the Soviet Union will collapse

1506
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:25,020
times the Soviet Union will collapse
 

1507
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:26,870
times the Soviet Union will collapse
yeah I wonder about that too and I also

1508
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:26,880
yeah I wonder about that too and I also
 

1509
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:27,769
yeah I wonder about that too and I also
wondered about what would have happened

1510
00:26:27,769 --> 00:26:27,779
wondered about what would have happened
 

1511
00:26:27,779 --> 00:26:29,750
wondered about what would have happened
if it didn't collapse and Gorbachev had

1512
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:29,760
if it didn't collapse and Gorbachev had
 

1513
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,250
if it didn't collapse and Gorbachev had
found a different direction

1514
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:31,260
found a different direction
 

1515
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:33,769
found a different direction
I mean you know we see a very divisive

1516
00:26:33,769 --> 00:26:33,779
I mean you know we see a very divisive
 

1517
00:26:33,779 --> 00:26:36,769
I mean you know we see a very divisive
time now in American history the United

1525
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:46,070
ideologies within those States but those
are that's that's kind of the strength

1526
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:46,080
are that's that's kind of the strength
 

1527
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,750
are that's that's kind of the strength
of America's there's these little

1528
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:47,760
of America's there's these little
 

1529
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:51,110
of America's there's these little
Laboratories of ideas until though that

1530
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:51,120
Laboratories of ideas until though that
 

1531
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,549
Laboratories of ideas until though that
they don't keep together I mean I've had

1532
00:26:52,549 --> 00:26:52,559
they don't keep together I mean I've had
 

1533
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:53,930
they don't keep together I mean I've had
colleagues who have described what's

1534
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:53,940
colleagues who have described what's
 

1535
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:55,310
colleagues who have described what's
happening in the west right now was a

1536
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:55,320
happening in the west right now was a
 

1537
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,590
happening in the west right now was a
kind of soft secession with States you

1538
00:26:57,590 --> 00:26:57,600
kind of soft secession with States you
 

1539
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:01,330
kind of soft secession with States you
know going off in their own Direction

1540
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:01,340

 

1541
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:04,070

well you know these kinds of conceptions

1542
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:04,080
well you know these kinds of conceptions
 

1543
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,690
well you know these kinds of conceptions
that we have now are divisions between

1544
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:05,700
that we have now are divisions between
 

1545
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,730
that we have now are divisions between
red and blue States because of the

1546
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:07,740
red and blue States because of the
 

1547
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:09,590
red and blue States because of the
fracturing of our politics

1548
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:09,600
fracturing of our politics
 

1549
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,970
fracturing of our politics
and I'd always thought that that

1550
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:10,980
and I'd always thought that that
 

1551
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:12,289
and I'd always thought that that
wouldn't be possible in somewhere like

1552
00:27:12,289 --> 00:27:12,299
wouldn't be possible in somewhere like
 

1553
00:27:12,299 --> 00:27:14,510
wouldn't be possible in somewhere like
the United States or um you know many

1554
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:14,520
the United States or um you know many
 

1555
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,830
the United States or um you know many
other countries as well because it

1556
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:15,840
other countries as well because it
 

1557
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,570
other countries as well because it
wasn't that ethnic

1558
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:17,580
wasn't that ethnic
 

1559
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:20,269
wasn't that ethnic
um uh Dimension but in fact many of our

1560
00:27:20,269 --> 00:27:20,279
um uh Dimension but in fact many of our
 

1561
00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:22,010
um uh Dimension but in fact many of our
the way that people talk about politics

1562
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:22,020
the way that people talk about politics
 

1563
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:24,830
the way that people talk about politics
has given it that kind of appearance in

1564
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:24,840
has given it that kind of appearance in
 

1565
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,210
has given it that kind of appearance in
many respects because look I mean we

1566
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:26,220
many respects because look I mean we
 

1567
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:28,370
many respects because look I mean we
know from the Soviet Union and the

1568
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:28,380
know from the Soviet Union and the
 

1569

1573
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:34,730
you know originally in Ukraine that
language is not the man to signify of

1574
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:34,740
language is not the man to signify of
 

1575
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:37,549
language is not the man to signify of
identity and that identity can take all

1576
00:27:37,549 --> 00:27:37,559
identity and that identity can take all
 

1577
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:40,490
identity and that identity can take all
kinds of of other forms that's really

1578
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:40,500
kinds of of other forms that's really
 

1579
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,110
kinds of of other forms that's really
interesting I mean but

1580
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:42,120
interesting I mean but
 

1581
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,450
interesting I mean but
there has to be a deep grievance of some

1582
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:44,460
there has to be a deep grievance of some
 

1583
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:47,269
there has to be a deep grievance of some
kind if you took a poll in any other

1584

affiliation then I opened the book and
 

1939
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:02,690
affiliation then I opened the book and
it's blank it was pretty funny I had to

1940
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:02,700
it's blank it was pretty funny I had to
 

1941
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,430
it's blank it was pretty funny I had to
laugh I thought well there you go then

laugh I thought well there you go then
 

1943
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,529

there's just there's no way that you

1944
00:34:06,529 --> 00:34:06,539
there's just there's no way that you
 

1945
00:34:06,539 --> 00:34:08,089
there's just there's no way that you
know people can pull themselves out of

00:34:08,089 --> 00:34:08,099
know people can pull themselves out of
 

1947
00:34:08,099 --> 00:34:09,649
know people can pull themselves out of
these frames so for me it's very

1948
00:34:09,649 --> 00:34:09,659
these frames so for me it's very
 

1949
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:11,510
these frames so for me it's very
important to have that independence of

00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:11,520
important to have that independence of
 

1951
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,730
important to have that independence of
thought I think you can be politically

1952

00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:16,550
thought I think you can be politically
engaged on the issues but you know

basically without taking you know a
 

1957
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:21,470
basically without taking you know a
stance that's defined by some

1958
00:34:21,470 --> 00:34:21,480

2005
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,050
I'm glad he said that or he's even
asking the right kinds of questions

2006
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:18,060
asking the right kinds of questions

which he often often actually I mean
 

2009
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,410
which he often often actually I mean
obviously put them in a way that most of

2010
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:21,420
obviously put them in a way that most of
 

2011
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:23,089
obviously put them in a way that most of
us wouldn't have done but there was

2012
00:35:23,089 --> 00:35:23,099
us wouldn't have done but there was
 

2013
00:35:23,099 --> 00:35:24,349
us wouldn't have done but there was
often kind of questions about why is

2014
00:35:24,349 --> 00:35:24,359
often kind of questions about why is
 

2015
00:35:24,359 --> 00:35:25,910
often kind of questions about why is
this happening why are we doing this and

2016
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:25,920
this happening why are we doing this and
 

2017
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,230
this happening why are we doing this and
you know we have to challenge ourselves

2018
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:27,240
you know we have to challenge ourselves
 

2019
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:29,750
you know we have to challenge ourselves
all the time so yeah actually why are we

2020
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:29,760
all the time so yeah actually why are we
 

2021
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,550
all the time so yeah actually why are we
doing that and then you have to and

2022
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:31,560
doing that and then you have to and
 

2023
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,050
doing that and then you have to and
really inspect it and say whether it's

2024
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:33,060
really inspect it and say whether it's
 

2025
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:34,730
really inspect it and say whether it's
actually worth continuing that way or

2026
00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:34,740
actually worth continuing that way or
 

2027
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:35,630
actually worth continuing that way or
they should be doing something

2028
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:35,640
they should be doing something
 

2029
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,609
they should be doing something
differently now he had a more kind of

2030
00:35:37,609 --> 00:35:37,619
differently now he had a more kind of
 

2031
00:35:37,619 --> 00:35:39,530
differently now he had a more kind of
destructive quality to those kinds of

2032
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:39,540
destructive quality to those kinds of
 

2033
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:41,630
destructive quality to those kinds of
questions you know about maybe it's the

2034
00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:41,640

00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:50,520
if you really paid attention he was
 

2045
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,430
if you really paid attention he was
asking a valid set of questions about

2046
00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:52,440
asking a valid set of questions about
 

2047
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,930
asking a valid set of questions about
why do we continue to do things like

why do we continue to do things like
 

2049
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:55,310
why do we continue to do things like
this now we didn't often have answers

2050
00:35:55,310 --> 00:35:55,320
this now we didn't often have answers
 

2051
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,630
this now we didn't often have answers

tough measures and maximum pressure
often though it does work right because

2238
00:39:18,109 --> 00:39:18,119
often though it does work right because

to to make the case for chaos maybe we
 

2921
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,270
to to make the case for chaos maybe we
need to shake up the machine

2922

need to shake up the machine
 

2923

need to shake up the machine
throw a wrench into the engine into the

2924
00:51:50,630 --> 00:51:50,640
throw a wrench into the engine into the
 

2925
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:53,450
throw a wrench into the engine into the
gears and then every individual gear is

2926
00:51:53,450 --> 00:51:53,460
gears and then every individual gear is
 

2927
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:55,430
gears and then every individual gear is
going to be very upset with that because

2928
00:51:55,430 --> 00:51:55,440
going to be very upset with that because
 

2929
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:57,170
going to be very upset with that because
it's the wrench it's not it's not it's

it's the wrench it's not it's not it's
 

2931
00:51:57,180 --> 00:51:58,970
it's the wrench it's not it's not it's
an inefficient process but maybe it

2932
00:51:58,970 --> 00:51:58,980
an inefficient process but maybe it
 

2933
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:02,809
an inefficient process but maybe it
leads uh for government it forces the

2934
00:52:02,809 --> 00:52:02,819
leads uh for government it forces the
 

2935
00:52:02,819 --> 00:52:04,130
leads uh for government it forces the
the system as a whole not the

2936
00:52:04,130 --> 00:52:04,140
the system as a whole not the
 

2937
00:52:04,140 --> 00:52:05,990
the system as a whole not the
individuals but the system to reconsider

2938
00:52:05,990 --> 00:52:06,000
individuals but the system to reconsider
 

2939
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,230
individuals but the system to reconsider
how things are done so obviously all of

those things
uh the actual results are not that

2944
00:52:12,950 --> 00:52:12,960
uh the actual results are not that
 

2945
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:14,270
uh the actual results are not that
impressive

2946
00:52:14,270 --> 00:52:14,280
impressive
 

2947
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:16,790
impressive
could have done that on the

stuff but but you know the question is
 

2957
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:23,990
stuff but but you know the question is
if you bring the whole system down with

2958
00:52:23,990 --> 00:52:24,000
if you bring the whole system down with
 

2959
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,150
if you bring the whole system down with
nothing ideas of putting it to play it's

sometimes I didn't agree because I
 

3671
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,910
sometimes I didn't agree because I
didn't see the the

didn't see the the
 

3673
01:03:58,920 --> 01:03:59,990
didn't see the the
um you know the reasoning but other

3674
01:03:59,990 --> 01:04:00,000
um you know the reasoning but other
 

3675
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,329
um you know the reasoning but other
times I'm like they're right I you know

3676
01:04:02,329 --> 01:04:02,339
times I'm like they're right I you know
 

3677

to admit that and you know kind of we
 

3681
01:04:06,420 --> 01:04:07,970
to admit that and you know kind of we
need to figure out a different way of

3682
01:04:07,970 --> 01:04:07,980
need to figure out a different way of
 

3683
01:04:07,980 --> 01:04:09,829
need to figure out a different way of
doing things but at one point I do want

3725
01:04:46,740 --> 01:04:49,190
power you know you've got you've got to
call that out you know is that a

3726
01:04:49,190 --> 01:04:49,200
call that out you know is that a
 

3727
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:50,809
call that out you know is that a

01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:22,490
beginning and that you know as a result
a lot of people just saw this this is

4242
01:13:22,490 --> 01:13:22,500
a lot of people just saw this this is
 

4243
01:13:22,500 --> 01:13:24,229
a lot of people just saw this this is
kind of a continuation of you know

4244
01:13:24,229 --> 01:13:24,239
kind of a continuation of you know
 

4245
01:13:24,239 --> 01:13:26,630
kind of a continuation of you know
political games you know coming out of

uh the 2016 election but on the

4248
01:13:29,149 --> 01:13:29,159
uh the 2016 election but on the
 

4249
01:13:29,159 --> 01:13:31,370
uh the 2016 election but on the
Republican side it was just a game there

4250
01:13:31,370 --> 01:13:31,380
Republican side it was just a game there
 

4251
01:13:31,380 --> 01:13:33,530
Republican side it was just a game there
was people I knew who were you know

4252
01:13:33,530 --> 01:13:33,540
was people I knew who were you know
 

4253
01:13:33,540 --> 01:13:35,209
was people I knew who were you know
being basically you know one point one

4254
01:13:35,209 --> 01:13:35,219
being basically you know one point one
 

4255
01:13:35,219 --> 01:13:37,729
being basically you know one point one
of them winked at me you know in the

4256
01:13:37,729 --> 01:13:37,739
of them winked at me you know in the
 

4257
01:13:37,739 --> 01:13:38,930
of them winked at me you know in the
middle of this you know kind of

4258
01:13:38,930 --> 01:13:38,940
middle of this you know kind of
 

4259
01:13:38,940 --> 01:13:40,310
middle of this you know kind of
impeachment it's just like don't take

4260
01:13:40,310 --> 01:13:40,320
impeachment it's just like don't take
 

4261
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:42,110
impeachment it's just like don't take
this personally you know this is there's

4262
01:13:42,110 --> 01:13:42,120
this personally you know this is there's
 

4263
01:13:42,120 --> 01:13:43,790
this personally you know this is there's
the game this is a game and I just

4264
01:13:43,790 --> 01:13:43,800
the game this is a game and I just
 

4265
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:45,709
the game this is a game and I just
thought this isn't a game and that's why

4266
01:13:45,709 --> 01:13:45,719
thought this isn't a game and that's why
 

4267
01:13:45,719 --> 01:13:46,790
thought this isn't a game and that's why
I think that it you know kind of

4268
01:13:46,790 --> 01:13:46,800
I think that it you know kind of
 

4269
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:48,590
I think that it you know kind of
weakened because I mean again on the

4270
01:13:48,590 --> 01:13:48,600
weakened because I mean again on the
 

4271
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:51,229
weakened because I mean again on the
outside it it weakened us the whole

4272
01:13:51,229 --> 01:13:51,239
outside it it weakened us the whole
 

4273
01:13:51,239 --> 01:13:53,510
outside it it weakened us the whole
process we can does in the eyes of the

4274
01:13:53,510 --> 01:13:53,520
process we can does in the eyes of the
 

4275
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:54,890
process we can does in the eyes of the
world because again the United States

4276
01:13:54,890 --> 01:13:54,900
world because again the United States
 

4277
01:13:54,900 --> 01:13:57,290
world because again the United States
was the gold standard and I do think I

4278
01:13:57,290 --> 01:13:57,300
was the gold standard and I do think I
 

4279
01:13:57,300 --> 01:13:58,790
was the gold standard and I do think I
mean again in the in the terms of the

4280
01:13:58,790 --> 01:13:58,800
mean again in the in the terms of the
 

4281
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:00,169
mean again in the in the terms of the
larger population although a lot of

4282
01:14:00,169 --> 01:14:00,179
larger population although a lot of
 

4283
01:14:00,179 --> 01:14:02,209
larger population although a lot of
people you did actually see the system

4284
01:14:02,209 --> 01:14:02,219
people you did actually see the system
 

4285
01:14:02,219 --> 01:14:03,770
people you did actually see the system
you know standing up trying to do

4286
01:14:03,770 --> 01:14:03,780
you know standing up trying to do
 

4287
01:14:03,780 --> 01:14:05,149
you know standing up trying to do
something to help people account but

4288
01:14:05,149 --> 01:14:05,159
something to help people account but
 

4289
01:14:05,159 --> 01:14:07,310
something to help people account but
there's always that element of circus

4290
01:14:07,310 --> 01:14:07,320
there's always that element of circus
 

4291
01:14:07,320 --> 01:14:09,470
there's always that element of circus
and a big political game and people

4292
01:14:09,470 --> 01:14:09,480
and a big political game and people
 

4293
01:14:09,480 --> 01:14:11,930
and a big political game and people
being careless with the country but I do

4294
01:14:11,930 --> 01:14:11,940
being careless with the country but I do
 

4295
01:14:11,940 --> 01:14:14,270
being careless with the country but I do
think that the Democrats

4296
01:14:14,270 --> 01:14:14,280
think that the Democrats
 

4297
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:18,530
think that the Democrats
were the instigators of the circus so as

4298
01:14:18,530 --> 01:14:18,540
were the instigators of the circus so as
 

4299
01:14:18,540 --> 01:14:19,669
were the instigators of the circus so as
uh

4300
01:14:19,669 --> 01:14:19,679
uh
 

4301
01:14:19,679 --> 01:14:22,550
uh
it's perhaps subtle but there's a

4302
01:14:22,550 --> 01:14:22,560
it's perhaps subtle but there's a
 

4303
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:25,669
it's perhaps subtle but there's a
there's a different way you talk about

4304
01:14:25,669 --> 01:14:25,679
there's a different way you talk about
 

4305
01:14:25,679 --> 01:14:28,330
there's a different way you talk about
issues or concerns about accountability

4306
01:14:28,330 --> 01:14:28,340
issues or concerns about accountability
 

4307
01:14:28,340 --> 01:14:31,850
issues or concerns about accountability
when you care about your country when

4308
01:14:31,850 --> 01:14:31,860
when you care about your country when
 

4309
01:14:31,860 --> 01:14:33,470
when you care about your country when
you love your country when you love the

4310
01:14:33,470 --> 01:14:33,480
you love your country when you love the
 

4311
01:14:33,480 --> 01:14:36,470
you love your country when you love the
ideals and when you uh versus when you

4312
01:14:36,470 --> 01:14:36,480
ideals and when you uh versus when you
 

4313
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:39,350
ideals and when you uh versus when you
just want to win and stick it to the

4314
01:14:39,350 --> 01:14:39,360
just want to win and stick it to the
 

4315
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:41,510
just want to win and stick it to the
other side I agree I mean there were

4316
01:14:41,510 --> 01:14:41,520
other side I agree I mean there were
 

4317
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:44,450
other side I agree I mean there were
people who um I actually thought managed

4318
01:14:44,450 --> 01:14:44,460
people who um I actually thought managed
 

4319
01:14:44,460 --> 01:14:46,550
people who um I actually thought managed
that that made it about the country

4320
01:14:46,550 --> 01:14:46,560
that that made it about the country
 

4321
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:48,910
that that made it about the country
rather than about themselves

4322
01:14:48,910 --> 01:14:48,920
rather than about themselves
 

4323
01:14:48,920 --> 01:14:50,870
rather than about themselves
yeah there were a lot of those who did a

4324
01:14:50,870 --> 01:14:50,880
yeah there were a lot of those who did a
 

4325
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:53,450
yeah there were a lot of those who did a
lot of grandstanding yeah and that's

4326
01:14:53,450 --> 01:14:53,460
lot of grandstanding yeah and that's
 

4327
01:14:53,460 --> 01:14:54,890
lot of grandstanding yeah and that's
that's another problem of our political

4328
01:14:54,890 --> 01:14:54,900
that's another problem of our political
 

4329
01:14:54,900 --> 01:14:56,750
that's another problem of our political
incentive structures the the kind of

4330
01:14:56,750 --> 01:14:56,760
incentive structures the the kind of
 

4331
01:14:56,760 --> 01:14:57,770
incentive structures the the kind of
sense of accountability and

4332
01:14:57,770 --> 01:14:57,780
sense of accountability and
 

4333
01:14:57,780 --> 01:15:00,290
sense of accountability and
responsibility tends to be personal you

4334
01:15:00,290 --> 01:15:00,300
responsibility tends to be personal you
 

4335
01:15:00,300 --> 01:15:01,790
responsibility tends to be personal you
know people whether people decide to do

4336
01:15:01,790 --> 01:15:01,800
know people whether people decide to do
 

4337
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:04,430
know people whether people decide to do
it or not it's not institutional if that

4338
01:15:04,430 --> 01:15:04,440
it or not it's not institutional if that
 

4339
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:05,689
it or not it's not institutional if that
makes sense we've added kind of a

4340
01:15:05,689 --> 01:15:05,699
makes sense we've added kind of a
 

4341
01:15:05,699 --> 01:15:07,729
makes sense we've added kind of a
breakdown of that kind of that sense now

4342
01:15:07,729 --> 01:15:07,739
breakdown of that kind of that sense now
 

4343
01:15:07,739 --> 01:15:09,649
breakdown of that kind of that sense now
I took an oath of office and I'm

4344
01:15:09,649 --> 01:15:09,659
I took an oath of office and I'm
 

4345
01:15:09,659 --> 01:15:11,750
I took an oath of office and I'm
assuming that most of them did too you

4346
01:15:11,750 --> 01:15:11,760
assuming that most of them did too you
 

4347
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:13,550
assuming that most of them did too you
know I had to be sworn in you know when

4348
01:15:13,550 --> 01:15:13,560
know I had to be sworn in you know when
 

4349
01:15:13,560 --> 01:15:15,229
know I had to be sworn in you know when
I I took those positions I took that

4350
01:15:15,229 --> 01:15:15,239
I I took those positions I took that
 

4351
01:15:15,239 --> 01:15:16,910
I I took those positions I took that
seriously but I already took an oath of

4352
01:15:16,910 --> 01:15:16,920
seriously but I already took an oath of
 

4353
01:15:16,920 --> 01:15:19,250
seriously but I already took an oath of
citizenship there's you know presumably

4354
01:15:19,250 --> 01:15:19,260
citizenship there's you know presumably
 

4355
01:15:19,260 --> 01:15:21,950
citizenship there's you know presumably
you did too you know you kind of started

4356
01:15:21,950 --> 01:15:21,960
you did too you know you kind of started
 

4357
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:23,270
you did too you know you kind of started
to become an American citizen it's not

4358
01:15:23,270 --> 01:15:23,280
to become an American citizen it's not
 

4359
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:25,010
to become an American citizen it's not
something you take on lightly

4360
01:15:25,010 --> 01:15:25,020
something you take on lightly
 

4361
01:15:25,020 --> 01:15:26,630
something you take on lightly
and you know that's why I felt this deep

4362
01:15:26,630 --> 01:15:26,640
and you know that's why I felt this deep
 

4363
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:28,130
and you know that's why I felt this deep
sense of responsibility all the time

4364
01:15:28,130 --> 01:15:28,140
sense of responsibility all the time
 

4365
01:15:28,140 --> 01:15:29,750
sense of responsibility all the time
which is why I went into the

4366
01:15:29,750 --> 01:15:29,760
which is why I went into the
 

4367
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:31,189
which is why I went into the
administration in the first place I mean

4368
01:15:31,189 --> 01:15:31,199
administration in the first place I mean
 

4369
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:33,649
administration in the first place I mean
I got a lot of flack for it because you

4370
01:15:33,649 --> 01:15:33,659
I got a lot of flack for it because you
 

4371
01:15:33,659 --> 01:15:35,990
I got a lot of flack for it because you
know I thought well look I've been asked

4372
01:15:35,990 --> 01:15:36,000
know I thought well look I've been asked
 

4373
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,810
know I thought well look I've been asked
and there's a real issue here after the

4374
01:15:38,810 --> 01:15:38,820
and there's a real issue here after the

Russian interference and you know the
whole influence operation in the 2016

4378
01:15:42,950 --> 01:15:42,960
whole influence operation in the 2016
 

4379
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:45,410
whole influence operation in the 2016
elections and I knew what was going on

4380
01:15:45,410 --> 01:15:45,420
elections and I knew what was going on
 

4381
01:15:45,420 --> 01:15:47,870
elections and I knew what was going on
and I should do something

4382
01:15:47,870 --> 01:15:47,880
and I should do something
 

4383
01:15:47,880 --> 01:15:50,450
and I should do something

someone else will go and do it but can I

4386
01:15:52,070 --> 01:15:52,080
someone else will go and do it but can I
 

4387
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:53,510
someone else will go and do it but can I
live with myself just sitting on the

4388
01:15:53,510 --> 01:15:53,520
live with myself just sitting on the
 

4389
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:55,010
live with myself just sitting on the
sidelines and criticizing what people

4390
01:15:55,010 --> 01:15:55,020
sidelines and criticizing what people
 

4391

4547
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:37,189
added a bit of a next settlement here
and there

4548
01:18:37,189 --> 01:18:37,199
and there
 

4549
01:18:37,199 --> 01:18:39,649
and there
yeah the interference I mean that's a

4550
01:18:39,649 --> 01:18:39,659
yeah the interference I mean that's a
 

4551
01:18:39,659 --> 01:18:41,930
yeah the interference I mean that's a
much longer discussion

4552
01:18:41,930 --> 01:18:41,940
much longer discussion
 

4553
01:18:41,940 --> 01:18:45,169
much longer discussion
because uh it's also for me technically

4554
01:18:45,169 --> 01:18:45,179
because uh it's also for me technically
 

4555
01:18:45,179 --> 01:18:47,090
because uh it's also for me technically
fascinating

4556
01:18:47,090 --> 01:18:47,100
fascinating
 

4557
01:18:47,100 --> 01:18:48,350
fascinating
um I've been playing with the idea of

4558
01:18:48,350 --> 01:18:48,360
um I've been playing with the idea of
 

4559
01:18:48,360 --> 01:18:50,930
um I've been playing with the idea of
just launching like a million Bots but

4560
01:18:50,930 --> 01:18:50,940
just launching like a million Bots but
 

4561
01:18:50,940 --> 01:18:52,790
just launching like a million Bots but
that are doing just positive stuff and

4562
01:18:52,790 --> 01:18:52,800
that are doing just positive stuff and
 

4563
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:55,250
that are doing just positive stuff and
just being kind yeah I was kind of

4564
01:18:55,250 --> 01:18:55,260
just being kind yeah I was kind of
 

4565
01:18:55,260 --> 01:18:56,450
just being kind yeah I was kind of
wondering if is it possible to do

4566
01:18:56,450 --> 01:18:56,460
wondering if is it possible to do
 

4567
01:18:56,460 --> 01:18:58,130
wondering if is it possible to do
something on this skill that's positive

4568
01:18:58,130 --> 01:18:58,140
something on this skill that's positive
 

4569
01:18:58,140 --> 01:18:59,930
something on this skill that's positive
because you know a lot of people seem to

4570
01:18:59,930 --> 01:18:59,940
because you know a lot of people seem to
 

4571
01:18:59,940 --> 01:19:01,250
because you know a lot of people seem to
be able to use all of this for pretty

4572
01:19:01,250 --> 01:19:01,260
be able to use all of this for pretty
 

4573
01:19:01,260 --> 01:19:02,570
be able to use all of this for pretty
negative effect you've got to kind of

4574
01:19:02,570 --> 01:19:02,580
negative effect you've got to kind of
 

4575
01:19:02,580 --> 01:19:03,830
negative effect you've got to kind of
hope that you could do this use the Sim

4576
01:19:03,830 --> 01:19:03,840
hope that you could do this use the Sim
 

4577
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:05,630
hope that you could do this use the Sim
networks for for positive effects I

4578
01:19:05,630 --> 01:19:05,640
networks for for positive effects I
 

4579
01:19:05,640 --> 01:19:07,130
networks for for positive effects I
think that's actually where a lot of the

4580
01:19:07,130 --> 01:19:07,140
think that's actually where a lot of the
 

4581
01:19:07,140 --> 01:19:10,790
think that's actually where a lot of the
war I think uh from the original hackers

4582
01:19:10,790 --> 01:19:10,800
war I think uh from the original hackers
 

4583
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:12,189
war I think uh from the original hackers
to today

4584
01:19:12,189 --> 01:19:12,199
to today
 

4585
01:19:12,199 --> 01:19:15,229
to today

01:19:15,229 --> 01:19:15,239
what gives people like me and I think a
 

4587
01:19:15,239 --> 01:19:17,450
what gives people like me and I think a
lot of people that in the hacking

4588
01:19:17,450 --> 01:19:17,460
lot of people that in the hacking
 

4589
01:19:17,460 --> 01:19:19,070
lot of people that in the hacking

you can't go and study math because you

5254
01:30:40,010 --> 01:30:40,020
you can't go and study math because you
 

5255
01:30:40,020 --> 01:30:41,390
you can't go and study math because you
know whatever physics you know because

5256

know whatever physics you know because
 

5257
01:30:41,400 --> 01:30:43,610
know whatever physics you know because
of but a lot of that you can't actually

5258
01:30:43,610 --> 01:30:43,620
of but a lot of that you can't actually
 

5259
01:30:43,620 --> 01:30:46,129
of but a lot of that you can't actually
make it into law well you could I

5260

make it into law well you could I
 

5261
01:30:46,139 --> 01:30:48,530

5301
01:31:24,120 --> 01:31:26,689
including a Putin himself I mean that's
when a system has degenerated and that's

the system but again it's just a
 

5309
01:31:32,100 --> 01:31:33,890
the system but again it's just a
diversion from you know kind of the

very strange sort of system of fealty
 

5955
01:42:33,060 --> 01:42:35,090
very strange sort of system of fealty
almost a feudal system in the kind of

almost a feudal system in the kind of

lot of distortions you know kind of as a
 

5963
01:42:40,920 --> 01:42:42,109
lot of distortions you know kind of as a
result of that in the way that the

5964
01:42:42,109 --> 01:42:42,119
result of that in the way that the
 

5965
01:42:42,119 --> 01:42:44,030
result of that in the way that the
Russian Federation was run you know a

5966
01:42:44,030 --> 01:42:44,040
Russian Federation was run you know a
 

5967
01:42:44,040 --> 01:42:46,070
Russian Federation was run you know a
lot more of an emphasis on the security

5968
01:42:46,070 --> 01:42:46,080
lot more of an emphasis on the security
 

5969
01:42:46,080 --> 01:42:48,109
lot more of an emphasis on the security
services for example but there was a lot

5970
01:42:48,109 --> 01:42:48,119
services for example but there was a lot
 

5971
01:42:48,119 --> 01:42:50,030
services for example but there was a lot
of pragmatism you know opening up the

5972
01:42:50,030 --> 01:42:50,040
of pragmatism you know opening up the
 

5973
01:42:50,040 --> 01:42:52,129
of pragmatism you know opening up the
country for business

01:42:52,139 --> 01:42:53,570
country for business
um you know basically extending

5976
01:42:53,570 --> 01:42:53,580
um you know basically extending
 

5977
01:42:53,580 --> 01:42:56,510
um you know basically extending
relationships I would say that you know

5978
01:42:56,510 --> 01:42:56,520
relationships I would say that you know
 

5979
01:42:56,520 --> 01:42:59,270
relationships I would say that you know
by the end of those first couple of

5980
01:42:59,270 --> 01:42:59,280
by the end of those first couple of
 

5981
01:42:59,280 --> 01:43:01,430
by the end of those first couple of
terms of uh Putin Russians were living

5982
01:43:01,430 --> 01:43:01,440
terms of uh Putin Russians were living
 

5983
01:43:01,440 --> 01:43:03,470
terms of uh Putin Russians were living
their best lives

5984
01:43:03,470 --> 01:43:03,480
their best lives
 

5985
01:43:03,480 --> 01:43:04,370
their best lives
um you know there was a lot of

5986
01:43:04,370 --> 01:43:04,380
um you know there was a lot of
 

5987
01:43:04,380 --> 01:43:07,310
um you know there was a lot of
opportunity for people uh people the

5988
01:43:07,310 --> 01:43:07,320
opportunity for people uh people the
 

5989
01:43:07,320 --> 01:43:09,530
opportunity for people uh people the
labor you know was being paid for they

5990
01:43:09,530 --> 01:43:09,540
labor you know was being paid for they
 

5991
01:43:09,540 --> 01:43:11,209
labor you know was being paid for they
weren't being taxed the taxes were

5992
01:43:11,209 --> 01:43:11,219
weren't being taxed the taxes were
 

5993
01:43:11,219 --> 01:43:13,669
weren't being taxed the taxes were
coming out of the extractive industries

5994
01:43:13,669 --> 01:43:13,679
coming out of the extractive industries
 

5995
01:43:13,679 --> 01:43:16,010
coming out of the extractive industries
uh there was you know kind of a I guess

5996
01:43:16,010 --> 01:43:16,020
uh there was you know kind of a I guess
 

5997
01:43:16,020 --> 01:43:18,410
uh there was you know kind of a I guess
a sense of much more political pluralism

5998
01:43:18,410 --> 01:43:18,420
a sense of much more political pluralism
 

5999
01:43:18,420 --> 01:43:19,550
a sense of much more political pluralism
um but it wasn't the kind of the chaos

6000
01:43:19,550 --> 01:43:19,560
um but it wasn't the kind of the chaos
 

6001
01:43:19,560 --> 01:43:21,050
um but it wasn't the kind of the chaos
of the Elton period

6002
01:43:21,050 --> 01:43:21,060
of the Elton period
 

6003
01:43:21,060 --> 01:43:22,910
of the Elton period
and then you see a shift

6004
01:43:22,910 --> 01:43:22,920
and then you see a shift
 

6005
01:43:22,920 --> 01:43:24,830
and then you see a shift
and it's pretty much when he comes back

6006
01:43:24,830 --> 01:43:24,840
and it's pretty much when he comes back
 

6007
01:43:24,840 --> 01:43:26,390
and it's pretty much when he comes back
into Power again

6008
01:43:26,390 --> 01:43:26,400
into Power again
 

6009
01:43:26,400 --> 01:43:29,090
into Power again
in 2011 2012.

6010
01:43:29,090 --> 01:43:29,100
in 2011 2012.
 

6011
01:43:29,100 --> 01:43:31,010
in 2011 2012.
and that's when we see a kind of a

6012
01:43:31,010 --> 01:43:31,020
and that's when we see a kind of a
 

6013
01:43:31,020 --> 01:43:33,109
and that's when we see a kind of a
different phase emerging

6014
01:43:33,109 --> 01:43:33,119
different phase emerging
 

6015
01:43:33,119 --> 01:43:35,270
different phase emerging
and you know part of it is the the

6016
01:43:35,270 --> 01:43:35,280
and you know part of it is the the
 

6017
01:43:35,280 --> 01:43:37,310
and you know part of it is the the
larger International environment where

6018
01:43:37,310 --> 01:43:37,320
larger International environment where
 

6019
01:43:37,320 --> 01:43:39,050
larger International environment where
Putin is himself has become kind of

6020
01:43:39,050 --> 01:43:39,060
Putin is himself has become kind of
 

6021
01:43:39,060 --> 01:43:41,149
Putin is himself has become kind of
convinced of the United States is out to

6022
01:43:41,149 --> 01:43:41,159
convinced of the United States is out to
 

6023
01:43:41,159 --> 01:43:43,370
convinced of the United States is out to
to get him and part of it goes back to

6024
01:43:43,370 --> 01:43:43,380
to get him and part of it goes back to
 

6025
01:43:43,380 --> 01:43:45,530
to get him and part of it goes back to
the decision on the part of the United

6026
01:43:45,530 --> 01:43:45,540
the decision on the part of the United
 

6027
01:43:45,540 --> 01:43:48,350
the decision on the part of the United
States to invade Iraq in 2003

6028
01:43:48,350 --> 01:43:48,360
States to invade Iraq in 2003
 

6029
01:43:48,360 --> 01:43:50,390
States to invade Iraq in 2003
there's also you know the recognition of

6030
01:43:50,390 --> 01:43:50,400
there's also you know the recognition of
 

6031
01:43:50,400 --> 01:43:53,030
there's also you know the recognition of
Kosovo in 2008 and you know the whole

6032
01:43:53,030 --> 01:43:53,040
Kosovo in 2008 and you know the whole
 

6033
01:43:53,040 --> 01:43:55,550
Kosovo in 2008 and you know the whole
kind of machinations around all kinds of

6034
01:43:55,550 --> 01:43:55,560
kind of machinations around all kinds of
 

6035
01:43:55,560 --> 01:43:57,530
kind of machinations around all kinds of
you know other issues of NATO expansion

6036
01:43:57,530 --> 01:43:57,540
you know other issues of NATO expansion
 

6037
01:43:57,540 --> 01:44:00,770
you know other issues of NATO expansion
and elsewhere but Iraq in 2003 and this

6038
01:44:00,770 --> 01:44:00,780
and elsewhere but Iraq in 2003 and this
 

6039
01:44:00,780 --> 01:44:02,510
and elsewhere but Iraq in 2003 and this
kind of whole idea after that that the

6040
01:44:02,510 --> 01:44:02,520
kind of whole idea after that that the
 

6041
01:44:02,520 --> 01:44:03,649
kind of whole idea after that that the
United States is in the business of

6042
01:44:03,649 --> 01:44:03,659
United States is in the business of
 

6043
01:44:03,659 --> 01:44:05,510
United States is in the business of
regime change and perhaps you know has

6044
01:44:05,510 --> 01:44:05,520
regime change and perhaps you know has
 

6045
01:44:05,520 --> 01:44:07,729
regime change and perhaps you know has
him in his crosshairs as well

6046
01:44:07,729 --> 01:44:07,739
him in his crosshairs as well
 

6047
01:44:07,739 --> 01:44:09,890
him in his crosshairs as well
but there's also then kind of I think a

6048
01:44:09,890 --> 01:44:09,900
but there's also then kind of I think a
 

6049
01:44:09,900 --> 01:44:13,129
but there's also then kind of I think a
sense of building crisis after the

6050
01:44:13,129 --> 01:44:13,139
sense of building crisis after the
 

6051
01:44:13,139 --> 01:44:16,030
sense of building crisis after the
financial crisis and the Great Recession

6052
01:44:16,030 --> 01:44:16,040
financial crisis and the Great Recession
 

6053
01:44:16,040 --> 01:44:19,609
financial crisis and the Great Recession
2008 2009 because I think Putin up until

6054
01:44:19,609 --> 01:44:19,619
2008 2009 because I think Putin up until
 

6055
01:44:19,619 --> 01:44:22,189
2008 2009 because I think Putin up until
then believed in you know the whole idea

6056
01:44:22,189 --> 01:44:22,199
then believed in you know the whole idea
 

6057
01:44:22,199 --> 01:44:23,870
then believed in you know the whole idea
of the Global Financial system and that

6058
01:44:23,870 --> 01:44:23,880
of the Global Financial system and that
 

6059
01:44:23,880 --> 01:44:26,930
of the Global Financial system and that
Russia was prospering and that Russia

6060
01:44:26,930 --> 01:44:26,940
Russia was prospering and that Russia
 

6061
01:44:26,940 --> 01:44:28,790
Russia was prospering and that Russia
you know part of the G8 actually could

6062
01:44:28,790 --> 01:44:28,800
you know part of the G8 actually could
 

6063
01:44:28,800 --> 01:44:30,350
you know part of the G8 actually could
be genuinely one of the you know the

6064
01:44:30,350 --> 01:44:30,360
be genuinely one of the you know the
 

6065
01:44:30,360 --> 01:44:33,350
be genuinely one of the you know the
major economic and financial powers

6066
01:44:33,350 --> 01:44:33,360
major economic and financial powers
 

6067
01:44:33,360 --> 01:44:36,290
major economic and financial powers
and then suddenly he realizes that in

6068
01:44:36,290 --> 01:44:36,300
and then suddenly he realizes that in
 

6069
01:44:36,300 --> 01:44:38,870
and then suddenly he realizes that in
the west is incompetent that you know we

6070
01:44:38,870 --> 01:44:38,880
the west is incompetent that you know we
 

6071
01:44:38,880 --> 01:44:40,970
the west is incompetent that you know we
totally mismanaged the economy of our

6072
01:44:40,970 --> 01:44:40,980
totally mismanaged the economy of our
 

6073
01:44:40,980 --> 01:44:42,410
totally mismanaged the economy of our
own the financial crash in the United

6074
01:44:42,410 --> 01:44:42,420
own the financial crash in the United
 

6075
01:44:42,420 --> 01:44:44,930
own the financial crash in the United
States the kind of blowing up of the uh

6076
01:44:44,930 --> 01:44:44,940
States the kind of blowing up of the uh
 

6077
01:44:44,940 --> 01:44:47,450
States the kind of blowing up of the uh
of the the housing bubble and that we

6078
01:44:47,450 --> 01:44:47,460
of the the housing bubble and that we
 

6079
01:44:47,460 --> 01:44:48,770
of the the housing bubble and that we
were feckless

6080
01:44:48,770 --> 01:44:48,780
were feckless
 

6081
01:44:48,780 --> 01:44:50,390
were feckless
and that we that had global

6082
01:44:50,390 --> 01:44:50,400
and that we that had global
 

6083
01:44:50,400 --> 01:44:51,890
and that we that had global
reverberations

6084
01:44:51,890 --> 01:44:51,900
reverberations
 

6085
01:44:51,900 --> 01:44:53,570
reverberations
and he's prime minister of course you

6086
01:44:53,570 --> 01:44:53,580
and he's prime minister of course you
 

6087
01:44:53,580 --> 01:44:55,970
and he's prime minister of course you
know in this kind of period but then you

6088
01:44:55,970 --> 01:44:55,980
know in this kind of period but then you
 

6089
01:44:55,980 --> 01:44:56,930
know in this kind of period but then you
know and I think that that kind of

6090
01:44:56,930 --> 01:44:56,940
know and I think that that kind of
 

6091
01:44:56,940 --> 01:44:58,370
know and I think that that kind of
compels him to kind of come back into

6092
01:44:58,370 --> 01:44:58,380
compels him to kind of come back into
 

6093
01:44:58,380 --> 01:45:00,470
compels him to kind of come back into
the presidency and try to kind of uh

6094
01:45:00,470 --> 01:45:00,480
the presidency and try to kind of uh
 

6095
01:45:00,480 --> 01:45:02,510
the presidency and try to kind of uh
take things under control again in 2011

6096
01:45:02,510 --> 01:45:02,520
take things under control again in 2011
 

6097
01:45:02,520 --> 01:45:05,270
take things under control again in 2011
2012 and after that he goes into kind of

6098
01:45:05,270 --> 01:45:05,280
2012 and after that he goes into kind of
 

6099
01:45:05,280 --> 01:45:07,189
2012 and after that he goes into kind of
a much more sort of focused role where

6100
01:45:07,189 --> 01:45:07,199

the box and yeah there might be a bit of
 

7153
02:02:52,920 --> 02:02:54,229
the box and yeah there might be a bit of
violence and a bit of fighting but

well hold on a second let me sort of
 

7365
02:06:31,199 --> 02:06:34,370
well hold on a second let me sort of
push back at the fact that I don't think

02:06:34,370 --> 02:06:34,380
push back at the fact that I don't think
 

7367

push back at the fact that I don't think
any of this is obvious so first of all

7368
02:06:37,189 --> 02:06:37,199
any of this is obvious so first of all
 

7369

that
Liberty yeah

yeah let me uh sort of make the case
 

7379
02:06:46,500 --> 02:06:48,890
yeah let me uh sort of make the case
that the the calculation here

7380
02:06:48,890 --> 02:06:48,900
that the the calculation here
 

7381
02:06:48,900 --> 02:06:51,770
that the the calculation here
uh is is very difficult if you were to

7382
02:06:51,770 --> 02:06:51,780
uh is is very difficult if you were to
 

7383
02:06:51,780 --> 02:06:53,149
uh is is very difficult if you were to
pull

7384
02:06:53,149 --> 02:06:53,159
pull
 

7385
02:06:53,159 --> 02:06:55,910

think happens
I honestly think most of them will say

7400
02:07:09,470 --> 02:07:09,480
I honestly think most of them will say
 

7401
02:07:09,480 --> 02:07:11,689
I honestly think most of them will say
that they will agree

7402
02:07:11,689 --> 02:07:11,699
that they will agree
 

7403
02:07:11,699 --> 02:07:13,310
that they will agree
with a prediction that the government

7404
02:07:13,310 --> 02:07:13,320
with a prediction that the government
 

7405
02:07:13,320 --> 02:07:16,129
with a prediction that the government
would flee with collapse and the the

7406
02:07:16,129 --> 02:07:16,139
would flee with collapse and the the
 

7407
02:07:16,139 --> 02:07:18,169
would flee with collapse and the the
country won't Unite

7408
02:07:18,169 --> 02:07:18,179
country won't Unite
 

7409
02:07:18,179 --> 02:07:21,050
country won't Unite
uh around the cause because of the

7410
02:07:21,050 --> 02:07:21,060
uh around the cause because of the
 

7411
02:07:21,060 --> 02:07:22,850
uh around the cause because of the
factions because of all the different

7412
02:07:22,850 --> 02:07:22,860
factions because of all the different
 

7413
02:07:22,860 --> 02:07:24,350
factions because of all the different
parties involved because of the

7414
02:07:24,350 --> 02:07:24,360
parties involved because of the
 

7415
02:07:24,360 --> 02:07:25,790
parties involved because of the
popularity might have said the same

7416
02:07:25,790 --> 02:07:25,800
popularity might have said the same
 

7417
02:07:25,800 --> 02:07:28,970
popularity might have said the same
thing about the Soviet Union when Hitler

7418
02:07:28,970 --> 02:07:28,980
thing about the Soviet Union when Hitler
 

7419
02:07:28,980 --> 02:07:31,910
thing about the Soviet Union when Hitler
invaded in 1941

7420
02:07:31,910 --> 02:07:31,920
invaded in 1941
 

7421
02:07:31,920 --> 02:07:33,830
invaded in 1941
you see the problem is Putin always

7422
02:07:33,830 --> 02:07:33,840
you see the problem is Putin always
 

7423
02:07:33,840 --> 02:07:35,629
you see the problem is Putin always
reads history from one perspective over

7424
02:07:35,629 --> 02:07:35,639
reads history from one perspective over
 

7425
02:07:35,639 --> 02:07:39,050
reads history from one perspective over
another I think most countries

7426
02:07:39,050 --> 02:07:39,060
another I think most countries
 

7427
02:07:39,060 --> 02:07:41,810
another I think most countries
basically rise to their own defense

7428
02:07:41,810 --> 02:07:41,820
basically rise to their own defense
 

7429
02:07:41,820 --> 02:07:43,729
basically rise to their own defense
so this is actually one of the first

7430
02:07:43,729 --> 02:07:43,739
so this is actually one of the first
 

7431
02:07:43,739 --> 02:07:45,290
so this is actually one of the first
times that Russia has been on the

7432
02:07:45,290 --> 02:07:45,300
times that Russia has been on the
 

7433
02:07:45,300 --> 02:07:46,550
times that Russia has been on the
offensive

7434
02:07:46,550 --> 02:07:46,560
offensive
 

7435
02:07:46,560 --> 02:07:50,030
offensive
rather than on the defensive

7436
02:07:50,030 --> 02:07:50,040

 

7437
02:07:50,040 --> 02:07:51,950

you know so there's kind of a bit of a

7438
02:07:51,950 --> 02:07:51,960
you know so there's kind of a bit of a
 

7439
02:07:51,960 --> 02:07:53,570
you know so there's kind of a bit of a
flip there

7440
02:07:53,570 --> 02:07:53,580
flip there
 

7441
02:07:53,580 --> 02:07:55,430
flip there

oh those will be before I mean because
 

9433
02:41:42,780 --> 02:41:44,570
oh those will be before I mean because
sometime in that you know early part of

9434
02:41:44,570 --> 02:41:44,580
sometime in that you know early part of
 

9435
02:41:44,580 --> 02:41:45,710
sometime in that you know early part of
the year for the presidential election

9436
02:41:45,710 --> 02:41:45,720
the year for the presidential election
 

9437
02:41:45,720 --> 02:41:47,750
the year for the presidential election
yeah and also I don't know if you know

9438
02:41:47,750 --> 02:41:47,760
yeah and also I don't know if you know
 

9439
02:41:47,760 --> 02:41:49,429
yeah and also I don't know if you know
about U.S elections but they actually

9440
02:41:49,429 --> 02:41:49,439
about U.S elections but they actually
 

9441
02:41:49,439 --> 02:41:52,130
about U.S elections but they actually
last way longer we're in it now aren't

9442
02:41:52,130 --> 02:41:52,140
last way longer we're in it now aren't
 

9443
02:41:52,140 --> 02:41:53,889
last way longer we're in it now aren't
we you know already yeah it's starting

9444
02:41:53,889 --> 02:41:53,899
we you know already yeah it's starting
 

9445
02:41:53,899 --> 02:41:56,030
we you know already yeah it's starting
so there's going to be a significant

9446
02:41:56,030 --> 02:41:56,040
so there's going to be a significant
 

9447
02:41:56,040 --> 02:41:57,530
so there's going to be a significant
overlap

9448
02:41:57,530 --> 02:41:57,540
overlap
 

9449
02:41:57,540 --> 02:41:59,030
overlap
um yeah you know you think that actually

9450
02:41:59,030 --> 02:41:59,040
um yeah you know you think that actually
 

9451
02:41:59,040 --> 02:42:03,230
um yeah you know you think that actually
comes into play in their calculus I

9452
02:42:03,230 --> 02:42:03,240
comes into play in their calculus I
 

9453
02:42:03,240 --> 02:42:04,250
comes into play in their calculus I
think it was one of the reasons why

9454
02:42:04,250 --> 02:42:04,260

think it was one of the reasons why
Putin invaded in February of 2022

person if he's got an instrument he
wants to figure out how to use it you

9890

wants to figure out how to use it you
 

9891

use of chemical weapons in Syria you
know for example so you know don't think

9910
02:49:34,190 --> 02:49:34,200
know for example so you know don't think
 

9911
02:49:34,200 --> 02:49:35,870
know for example so you know don't think
that Putin you know hasn't thought about

9912
02:49:35,870 --> 02:49:35,880
that Putin you know hasn't thought about
 

9913
02:49:35,880 --> 02:49:37,849
that Putin you know hasn't thought about
how ruthless he can possibly be the

how ruthless he can possibly be the
 

9915
02:49:37,859 --> 02:49:40,190
how ruthless he can possibly be the
question is really the calculation it's

9916
02:49:40,190 --> 02:49:40,200
question is really the calculation it's
 

9917
02:49:40,200 --> 02:49:42,650
question is really the calculation it's
his estimation of the probability that

9918
02:49:42,650 --> 02:49:42,660
his estimation of the probability that
 

9919
02:49:42,660 --> 02:49:44,870
his estimation of the probability that
will get the desired effect

9920
02:49:44,870 --> 02:49:44,880
will get the desired effect
 

9921
02:49:44,880 --> 02:49:46,790
will get the desired effect
we keep talking about this idea of

9922
02:49:46,790 --> 02:49:46,800
we keep talking about this idea of
 

9923
02:49:46,800 --> 02:49:48,650
we keep talking about this idea of
escalate de-escalate that's not what the

9924
02:49:48,650 --> 02:49:48,660
escalate de-escalate that's not what the
 

9925
02:49:48,660 --> 02:49:50,150
escalate de-escalate that's not what the
Russians you know how they call it but

Russians you know how they call it but
 

9927
02:49:50,160 --> 02:49:51,469
Russians you know how they call it but
it's the whole idea that you do

9928
02:49:51,469 --> 02:49:51,479
it's the whole idea that you do
 

9929
02:49:51,479 --> 02:49:53,210
it's the whole idea that you do
something really outrageous to get

9930
02:49:53,210 --> 02:49:53,220
something really outrageous to get
 

9931
02:49:53,220 --> 02:49:55,130
something really outrageous to get
everybody else to back off yeah now when

9932
02:49:55,130 --> 02:49:55,140
everybody else to back off yeah now when
 

9933
02:49:55,140 --> 02:49:57,170
everybody else to back off yeah now when
you talked about the precedent that the

9934
02:49:57,170 --> 02:49:57,180
you talked about the precedent that the
 

9935
02:49:57,180 --> 02:50:00,650
you talked about the precedent that the
United States set of detonating uh the

9936
02:50:00,650 --> 02:50:00,660
United States set of detonating uh the
 

9937
02:50:00,660 --> 02:50:03,290
United States set of detonating uh the
nuclear weapons in Hiroshima Nagasaki

9938

nuclear weapons in Hiroshima Nagasaki
 

9939
02:50:03,300 --> 02:50:05,990
nuclear weapons in Hiroshima Nagasaki
what you know he obviously meant the

9940
02:50:05,990 --> 02:50:06,000
what you know he obviously meant the
 

9941
02:50:06,000 --> 02:50:07,550
what you know he obviously meant the
president of using nuclear weapons of

9942

president of using nuclear weapons of
course which of course we would then say

9944
02:50:09,530 --> 02:50:09,540
course which of course we would then say
 

9945
02:50:09,540 --> 02:50:12,830

permissibility of ever doing that again
 

9949
02:50:14,399 --> 02:50:16,130
permissibility of ever doing that again
but what he's talking about is the

9950
02:50:16,130 --> 02:50:16,140
but what he's talking about is the
 

9951
02:50:16,140 --> 02:50:18,410
but what he's talking about is the
precedent of escalating to such an

9952
02:50:18,410 --> 02:50:18,420
precedent of escalating to such an
 

9953
02:50:18,420 --> 02:50:19,429
precedent of escalating to such an
accident that you stopped the war

9954
02:50:19,429 --> 02:50:19,439
accident that you stopped the war
 

9955
02:50:19,439 --> 02:50:21,590
accident that you stopped the war
because he reads that saying well you

9956

because he reads that saying well you
know the US dropped the bombs on

to a quick conclusion and of course

9962
02:50:27,290 --> 02:50:27,300
to a quick conclusion and of course
 

9963
02:50:27,300 --> 02:50:29,090
to a quick conclusion and of course
there's a huge debate in America about

these massive bombing campaigns are
 

9999
02:51:00,600 --> 02:51:02,090
these massive bombing campaigns are
realizing they actually often had the

10000
02:51:02,090 --> 02:51:02,100
realizing they actually often had the
 

10001
02:51:02,100 --> 02:51:04,309
realizing they actually often had the
opposite effect Hiroshima Nagasaki might

10002
02:51:04,309 --> 02:51:04,319
opposite effect Hiroshima Nagasaki might
 

10003
02:51:04,319 --> 02:51:06,290
opposite effect Hiroshima Nagasaki might
have uh contributed and there's a lot of

10004
02:51:06,290 --> 02:51:06,300
have uh contributed and there's a lot of
 

10005
02:51:06,300 --> 02:51:07,730
have uh contributed and there's a lot of
you know scholarship suggesting it did

10006
02:51:07,730 --> 02:51:07,740
you know scholarship suggesting it did
 

10007
02:51:07,740 --> 02:51:09,469
you know scholarship suggesting it did
to the end of the war but all of the big

10008
02:51:09,469 --> 02:51:09,479
to the end of the war but all of the big
 

10009
02:51:09,479 --> 02:51:10,730
to the end of the war but all of the big
bombing campaigns the destruction

10010
02:51:10,730 --> 02:51:10,740
bombing campaigns the destruction
 

10011
02:51:10,740 --> 02:51:12,770
bombing campaigns the destruction
actually prolonged was because they made

10012
02:51:12,770 --> 02:51:12,780
actually prolonged was because they made
 

10013
02:51:12,780 --> 02:51:14,030
actually prolonged was because they made
people fight back as we're kind of

10014
02:51:14,030 --> 02:51:14,040
people fight back as we're kind of
 

10015
02:51:14,040 --> 02:51:15,770
people fight back as we're kind of
seeing in the case of Ukraine so Putin

10016
02:51:15,770 --> 02:51:15,780
seeing in the case of Ukraine so Putin
 

10017
02:51:15,780 --> 02:51:19,070
seeing in the case of Ukraine so Putin
has to calculate the probability that if

10018
02:51:19,070 --> 02:51:19,080
has to calculate the probability that if
 

10019
02:51:19,080 --> 02:51:22,070
has to calculate the probability that if
he uses some tactical nuclear weapon

10020
02:51:22,070 --> 02:51:22,080
he uses some tactical nuclear weapon
 

10021
02:51:22,080 --> 02:51:23,270
he uses some tactical nuclear weapon
that it will get the desired effect

10022
02:51:23,270 --> 02:51:23,280
that it will get the desired effect
 

10023
02:51:23,280 --> 02:51:25,550
that it will get the desired effect
which is get us to capitulate and

10024
02:51:25,550 --> 02:51:25,560
which is get us to capitulate and
 

10025
02:51:25,560 --> 02:51:26,870
which is get us to capitulate and
Ukraine to capitulate it us to

10026
02:51:26,870 --> 02:51:26,880
Ukraine to capitulate it us to
 

10027
02:51:26,880 --> 02:51:28,429
Ukraine to capitulate it us to
capitulate meaning the United States and

10028
02:51:28,429 --> 02:51:28,439
capitulate meaning the United States and
 

10029
02:51:28,439 --> 02:51:30,590
capitulate meaning the United States and
the Europeans not supporting Ukraine

10030
02:51:30,590 --> 02:51:30,600
the Europeans not supporting Ukraine
 

10031
02:51:30,600 --> 02:51:32,210
the Europeans not supporting Ukraine
anymore pushing towards the negotiating

10032
02:51:32,210 --> 02:51:32,220
anymore pushing towards the negotiating
 

10033
02:51:32,220 --> 02:51:34,490
anymore pushing towards the negotiating
table negotiating Ukraine away and

10034
02:51:34,490 --> 02:51:34,500
table negotiating Ukraine away and
 

10035
02:51:34,500 --> 02:51:37,130
table negotiating Ukraine away and
Ukraine is saying okay we give up like

10036
02:51:37,130 --> 02:51:37,140
Ukraine is saying okay we give up like
 

10037
02:51:37,140 --> 02:51:40,250
Ukraine is saying okay we give up like
um happened in Hiroshima Nagasaki in

10038
02:51:40,250 --> 02:51:40,260
um happened in Hiroshima Nagasaki in
 

10039
02:51:40,260 --> 02:51:43,370
um happened in Hiroshima Nagasaki in
Japan ton so it's it's his calculation

10040
02:51:43,370 --> 02:51:43,380
Japan ton so it's it's his calculation
 

10041
02:51:43,380 --> 02:51:45,290
Japan ton so it's it's his calculation
you know as much as anything else which

10042
02:51:45,290 --> 02:51:45,300
you know as much as anything else which
 

10043
02:51:45,300 --> 02:51:46,490
you know as much as anything else which
is really important he said we have to

10044
02:51:46,490 --> 02:51:46,500
is really important he said we have to
 

10045
02:51:46,500 --> 02:51:47,929
is really important he said we have to
show him that he won't get that out of

10046
02:51:47,929 --> 02:51:47,939
show him that he won't get that out of
 

10047
02:51:47,939 --> 02:51:50,030
show him that he won't get that out of
it it's kind of less our probability and

10048
02:51:50,030 --> 02:51:50,040
it it's kind of less our probability and
 

10049
02:51:50,040 --> 02:51:51,230
it it's kind of less our probability and
you know kind of the odds of it it's

10050
02:51:51,230 --> 02:51:51,240
you know kind of the odds of it it's
 

10051
02:51:51,240 --> 02:51:53,929
you know kind of the odds of it it's
just how he calculates that probability

10052
02:51:53,929 --> 02:51:53,939
just how he calculates that probability
 

10053
02:51:53,939 --> 02:51:56,510
just how he calculates that probability
oh they're getting what he wants I mean

10054
02:51:56,510 --> 02:51:56,520
oh they're getting what he wants I mean
 

10055
02:51:56,520 --> 02:51:58,070
oh they're getting what he wants I mean
I guess that's how the game of poker

10056
02:51:58,070 --> 02:51:58,080
I guess that's how the game of poker
 

10057
02:51:58,080 --> 02:52:00,830
I guess that's how the game of poker
works it's your your probability and

10058
02:52:00,830 --> 02:52:00,840
works it's your your probability and
 

10059
02:52:00,840 --> 02:52:03,290
works it's your your probability and
your estimate of their probability and

10060
02:52:03,290 --> 02:52:03,300
your estimate of their probability and
 

10061
02:52:03,300 --> 02:52:05,090
your estimate of their probability and
your estimate of their estimate of your

10062
02:52:05,090 --> 02:52:05,100
your estimate of their estimate of your
 

10063
02:52:05,100 --> 02:52:07,429
your estimate of their estimate of your
probability and yeah so it goes on yeah

10064
02:52:07,429 --> 02:52:07,439
probability and yeah so it goes on yeah
 

10065
02:52:07,439 --> 02:52:10,670
probability and yeah so it goes on yeah
uh I think he has two tools right so one

10066
02:52:10,670 --> 02:52:10,680
uh I think he has two tools right so one
 

10067
02:52:10,680 --> 02:52:12,590
uh I think he has two tools right so one
is actually the actual use of nuclear

10068
02:52:12,590 --> 02:52:12,600
is actually the actual use of nuclear
 

10069
02:52:12,600 --> 02:52:14,269
is actually the actual use of nuclear
weapons and then the threat of these oh

10070
02:52:14,269 --> 02:52:14,279
weapons and then the threat of these oh
 

10071
02:52:14,279 --> 02:52:17,269
weapons and then the threat of these oh
the threat is very effective and the

10072
02:52:17,269 --> 02:52:17,279
the threat is very effective and the
 

10073
02:52:17,279 --> 02:52:19,910
the threat is very effective and the
more real you make the threat that's

10074
02:52:19,910 --> 02:52:19,920
more real you make the threat that's
 

10075
02:52:19,920 --> 02:52:22,670
more real you make the threat that's
right so if they get uh the more you

10076
02:52:22,670 --> 02:52:22,680
right so if they get uh the more you
 

10077
02:52:22,680 --> 02:52:25,610
right so if they get uh the more you
approach the actual use I get very close

10078
02:52:25,610 --> 02:52:25,620
approach the actual use I get very close
 

10079
02:52:25,620 --> 02:52:28,010
approach the actual use I get very close
to you there's already using Chernobyl

10080
02:52:28,010 --> 02:52:28,020
to you there's already using Chernobyl
 

10081
02:52:28,020 --> 02:52:31,429
to you there's already using Chernobyl
is that aparisia and then usual cranes

10082
02:52:31,429 --> 02:52:31,439
is that aparisia and then usual cranes
 

10083
02:52:31,439 --> 02:52:34,130
is that aparisia and then usual cranes
the other nuclear reactors so he's using

10084
02:52:34,130 --> 02:52:34,140
the other nuclear reactors so he's using
 

10085
02:52:34,140 --> 02:52:36,230
the other nuclear reactors so he's using
civilian nuclear actors as a dirty bomb

10086
02:52:36,230 --> 02:52:36,240
civilian nuclear actors as a dirty bomb
 

10087
02:52:36,240 --> 02:52:39,429
civilian nuclear actors as a dirty bomb
so you know it's ironic that he has Sega

10088
02:52:39,429 --> 02:52:39,439
so you know it's ironic that he has Sega
 

10089
02:52:39,439 --> 02:52:41,389
so you know it's ironic that he has Sega
his defense minister calling people

10090
02:52:41,389 --> 02:52:41,399
his defense minister calling people
 

10091
02:52:41,399 --> 02:52:42,349
his defense minister calling people
obviously the ukraines are going to use

10092
02:52:42,349 --> 02:52:42,359
obviously the ukraines are going to use
 

10093
02:52:42,359 --> 02:52:44,269
obviously the ukraines are going to use
a dirty bomb they're already doing it I

10094
02:52:44,269 --> 02:52:44,279
a dirty bomb they're already doing it I
 

10095
02:52:44,279 --> 02:52:46,429
a dirty bomb they're already doing it I
mean what what what is um you know kind

10096
02:52:46,429 --> 02:52:46,439
mean what what what is um you know kind
 

10097
02:52:46,439 --> 02:52:48,710
mean what what what is um you know kind
of more destructive and stirring up all

10098
02:52:48,710 --> 02:52:48,720
of more destructive and stirring up all
 

10099
02:52:48,720 --> 02:52:50,150
of more destructive and stirring up all
the radioactive dust and Chernobyl as

10100
02:52:50,150 --> 02:52:50,160
the radioactive dust and Chernobyl as
 

10101
02:52:50,160 --> 02:52:51,650
the radioactive dust and Chernobyl as
you send your troops through you know

10102
02:52:51,650 --> 02:52:51,660
you send your troops through you know
 

10103
02:52:51,660 --> 02:52:54,050
you send your troops through you know
for example or shelling you know the the

10104
02:52:54,050 --> 02:52:54,060
for example or shelling you know the the
 

10105
02:52:54,060 --> 02:52:56,030
for example or shelling you know the the
Chernobyl plants and the sarcophagus and

10106
02:52:56,030 --> 02:52:56,040
Chernobyl plants and the sarcophagus and
 

10107
02:52:56,040 --> 02:52:58,010
Chernobyl plants and the sarcophagus and
putting it at risk and that Parisian

10108
02:52:58,010 --> 02:52:58,020
putting it at risk and that Parisian
 

10109
02:52:58,020 --> 02:52:59,690
putting it at risk and that Parisian
you've got the international atomic

10110
02:52:59,690 --> 02:52:59,700
you've got the international atomic
 

10111
02:52:59,700 --> 02:53:01,610
you've got the international atomic
energy agency running out there in a

10112
02:53:01,610 --> 02:53:01,620
energy agency running out there in a
 

10113
02:53:01,620 --> 02:53:04,070
energy agency running out there in a
panic and you know kind of also trying

10114
02:53:04,070 --> 02:53:04,080
panic and you know kind of also trying
 

10115
02:53:04,080 --> 02:53:06,590
panic and you know kind of also trying
to intervene in the conflict so you're

10116
02:53:06,590 --> 02:53:06,600
to intervene in the conflict so you're
 

10117
02:53:06,600 --> 02:53:08,990
to intervene in the conflict so you're
putting you know civilian nuclear uh

10118
02:53:08,990 --> 02:53:09,000
putting you know civilian nuclear uh
 

10119
02:53:09,000 --> 02:53:10,849
putting you know civilian nuclear uh
reactors at risk I mean that also has a

10120
02:53:10,849 --> 02:53:10,859
reactors at risk I mean that also has a
 

10121
02:53:10,859 --> 02:53:12,230
reactors at risk I mean that also has a
great added effect of cutting off

10122
02:53:12,230 --> 02:53:12,240
great added effect of cutting off
 

10123
02:53:12,240 --> 02:53:14,050
great added effect of cutting off
Ukraine's power supply because

10124
02:53:14,050 --> 02:53:14,060
Ukraine's power supply because
 

10125
02:53:14,060 --> 02:53:16,610
Ukraine's power supply because
zaparisian predicted it was the opposite

10126
02:53:16,610 --> 02:53:16,620
zaparisian predicted it was the opposite
 

10127
02:53:16,620 --> 02:53:19,190
zaparisian predicted it was the opposite
a third of them Ukraine's power

10128
02:53:19,190 --> 02:53:19,200
a third of them Ukraine's power
 

10129
02:53:19,200 --> 02:53:20,929
a third of them Ukraine's power
generation or some you know really high

10130
02:53:20,929 --> 02:53:20,939
generation or some you know really high
 

10131
02:53:20,939 --> 02:53:22,429
generation or some you know really high
percentage job but I'd have to go back

10132
02:53:22,429 --> 02:53:22,439
percentage job but I'd have to go back
 

10133
02:53:22,439 --> 02:53:23,630
percentage job but I'd have to go back
and you know take a look at that but

10134
02:53:23,630 --> 02:53:23,640
and you know take a look at that but
 

10135
02:53:23,640 --> 02:53:26,150
and you know take a look at that but
that's a twofer you know it's a kind of

10136
02:53:26,150 --> 02:53:26,160
that's a twofer you know it's a kind of
 

10137
02:53:26,160 --> 02:53:30,230
that's a twofer you know it's a kind of
a double effect there of undermining uh

10138
02:53:30,230 --> 02:53:30,240
a double effect there of undermining uh
 

10139
02:53:30,240 --> 02:53:31,969
a double effect there of undermining uh
Power Generation also frightening

10140
02:53:31,969 --> 02:53:31,979
Power Generation also frightening
 

10141
02:53:31,979 --> 02:53:33,650
Power Generation also frightening
Germans and others who've already been

10142
02:53:33,650 --> 02:53:33,660
Germans and others who've already been
 

10143
02:53:33,660 --> 02:53:35,450
Germans and others who've already been
very worried about nuclear power and you

10144
02:53:35,450 --> 02:53:35,460
very worried about nuclear power and you
 

10145
02:53:35,460 --> 02:53:36,710
very worried about nuclear power and you
know increasing your leverage on that

10146
02:53:36,710 --> 02:53:36,720
know increasing your leverage on that
 

10147
02:53:36,720 --> 02:53:39,830
know increasing your leverage on that
energy front but also scaring people uh

10148
02:53:39,830 --> 02:53:39,840
energy front but also scaring people uh
 

10149
02:53:39,840 --> 02:53:42,469
energy front but also scaring people uh
from the perspective of uh the use of

10150
02:53:42,469 --> 02:53:42,479
from the perspective of uh the use of
 

10151
02:53:42,479 --> 02:53:45,230
from the perspective of uh the use of
nuclear weapon those reactors also

10152
02:53:45,230 --> 02:53:45,240
nuclear weapon those reactors also
 

10153
02:53:45,240 --> 02:53:46,790
nuclear weapon those reactors also
become a nuclear weapon tactically

10154
02:53:46,790 --> 02:53:46,800
become a nuclear weapon tactically
 

10155
02:53:46,800 --> 02:53:49,309
become a nuclear weapon tactically
deployed and as you said that the

10156
02:53:49,309 --> 02:53:49,319
deployed and as you said that the
 

10157
02:53:49,319 --> 02:53:51,889

engendering all those fears and he's
 

10161
02:53:53,880 --> 02:53:56,210
engendering all those fears and he's
already got an effect everyone's running

blowing up a nuclear weapon so he's got
 

10171
02:54:04,380 --> 02:54:05,330

a lot of people obviously talking about
that so sorry for the difficult and uh

10174
02:54:08,870 --> 02:54:08,880
that so sorry for the difficult and uh
 

10175
02:54:08,880 --> 02:54:10,610
that so sorry for the difficult and uh
direct question it could be for you

10176
02:54:10,610 --> 02:54:10,620
direct question it could be for you
 

10177
02:54:10,620 --> 02:54:14,030
direct question it could be for you
directly or more like uh do you think we

02:54:14,030 --> 02:54:14,040
directly or more like uh do you think we
 

10179
02:54:14,040 --> 02:54:16,309
directly or more like uh do you think we
have a plan for this what happens if he

10180
02:54:16,309 --> 02:54:16,319
have a plan for this what happens if he
 

10181
02:54:16,319 --> 02:54:17,210
have a plan for this what happens if he
does

10182
02:54:17,210 --> 02:54:17,220
does
 

10183
02:54:17,220 --> 02:54:19,450
does
drop a nuclear

10184
02:54:19,450 --> 02:54:19,460
drop a nuclear
 

10185
02:54:19,460 --> 02:54:22,010
drop a nuclear
weapon do you have a sense that the

10186
02:54:22,010 --> 02:54:22,020
weapon do you have a sense that the

United States
 

10189
02:54:23,720 --> 02:54:27,650
United States
has a good plan

10190
02:54:27,650 --> 02:54:27,660

 

10191
02:54:27,660 --> 02:54:29,870

I know we're talking about it I think we

10192
02:54:29,870 --> 02:54:29,880
I know we're talking about it I think we
 

10193
02:54:29,880 --> 02:54:31,250
I know we're talking about it I think we
probably have several plans because it

10194
02:54:31,250 --> 02:54:31,260
probably have several plans because it
 

10195
02:54:31,260 --> 02:54:35,389
probably have several plans because it
depends on what where when how

10196
02:54:35,389 --> 02:54:35,399
depends on what where when how
 

10197
02:54:35,399 --> 02:54:37,849
depends on what where when how
but that don't and also don't these

10198
02:54:37,849 --> 02:54:37,859
but that don't and also don't these
 

10199
02:54:37,859 --> 02:54:40,610
but that don't and also don't these
things happen very quickly

10200
02:54:40,610 --> 02:54:40,620
things happen very quickly
 

10201
02:54:40,620 --> 02:54:42,889
things happen very quickly
well there's also signaling and sign and

10202
02:54:42,889 --> 02:54:42,899
well there's also signaling and sign and
 

10203
02:54:42,899 --> 02:54:45,290
well there's also signaling and sign and
signs of um of movement there I mean I

10204
02:54:45,290 --> 02:54:45,300
signs of um of movement there I mean I
 

10205
02:54:45,300 --> 02:54:46,610
signs of um of movement there I mean I
want to be very you know kind of careful

10206
02:54:46,610 --> 02:54:46,620
want to be very you know kind of careful
 

10207
02:54:46,620 --> 02:54:47,870
want to be very you know kind of careful
about this but and the thing is it's

10208
02:54:47,870 --> 02:54:47,880
about this but and the thing is it's
 

10209
02:54:47,880 --> 02:54:50,269
about this but and the thing is it's
also very important that we do this with

10210
02:54:50,269 --> 02:54:50,279
also very important that we do this with
 

10211
02:54:50,279 --> 02:54:52,309
also very important that we do this with
other nuclear Powers so the other thing

10212
02:54:52,309 --> 02:54:52,319
other nuclear Powers so the other thing
 

10213
02:54:52,319 --> 02:54:53,510
other nuclear Powers so the other thing
that's different

10214

that's different
 

10215

pull together and we've seen this in so
 

10981
03:08:06,000 --> 03:08:07,790
pull together and we've seen this in so
many contexts we can find solutions to

10982
03:08:07,790 --> 03:08:07,800
many contexts we can find solutions to
 

10983
03:08:07,800 --> 03:08:09,650
many contexts we can find solutions to
things just like we get back again to

things just like we get back again to
 

10985
03:08:09,660 --> 03:08:11,630
things just like we get back again to
our discussion about scientists and just

10986
03:08:11,630 --> 03:08:11,640
our discussion about scientists and just
 

10987
03:08:11,640 --> 03:08:14,150
our discussion about scientists and just
the kind of amazing breakthroughs of

10988
03:08:14,150 --> 03:08:14,160
the kind of amazing breakthroughs of
 

10989

and things and look there there is some
 

10995
03:08:21,540 --> 03:08:23,210
and things and look there there is some
similarities there's a pathology around

10996
03:08:23,210 --> 03:08:23,220
similarities there's a pathology around
 

10997
03:08:23,220 --> 03:08:24,830

presidency of David Hamburg who was a
 

11009
03:08:36,180 --> 03:08:38,210
presidency of David Hamburg who was a
scientist and actually did see a lot of

11010
03:08:38,210 --> 03:08:38,220
scientist and actually did see a lot of
 

11011
03:08:38,220 --> 03:08:39,710
scientist and actually did see a lot of
parallels between the sort of like the

11012
03:08:39,710 --> 03:08:39,720
parallels between the sort of like the
 

11013
03:08:39,720 --> 03:08:42,050
parallels between the sort of like the
pathology of disease and you know kind

11014
03:08:42,050 --> 03:08:42,060
pathology of disease and you know kind
 

11015
03:08:42,060 --> 03:08:43,330
pathology of disease and you know kind
of the the

11016
03:08:43,330 --> 03:08:43,340
of the the
 

11017
03:08:43,340 --> 03:08:45,769
of the the
pestilence you know of conflict kind of

11018
03:08:45,769 --> 03:08:45,779
pestilence you know of conflict kind of
 

11019
03:08:45,779 --> 03:08:47,690
pestilence you know of conflict kind of
idea and of course these you know

11020
03:08:47,690 --> 03:08:47,700
idea and of course these you know
 

11021
03:08:47,700 --> 03:08:49,309
idea and of course these you know
parallels had to be very careful because

11022
03:08:49,309 --> 03:08:49,319
parallels had to be very careful because
 

11023
03:08:49,319 --> 03:08:51,050
parallels had to be very careful because
you know they're not neat but there was

11024
03:08:51,050 --> 03:08:51,060
you know they're not neat but there was
 

11025
03:08:51,060 --> 03:08:52,610
you know they're not neat but there was
kind of like an idea in there and how do

11026
03:08:52,610 --> 03:08:52,620
kind of like an idea in there and how do
 

11027
03:08:52,620 --> 03:08:53,990
kind of like an idea in there and how do
you sort of treat this how do you deal

11028
03:08:53,990 --> 03:08:54,000
you sort of treat this how do you deal
 

11029
03:08:54,000 --> 03:08:55,130
you sort of treat this how do you deal
with this

11030

with this
 

11031
03:08:55,140 --> 03:08:57,410
with this
and we did come up with all kinds of of

11032
03:08:57,410 --> 03:08:57,420
and we did come up with all kinds of of
 

11033
03:08:57,420 --> 03:08:59,929
and we did come up with all kinds of of
ideas and you know things that are still

11034
03:08:59,929 --> 03:08:59,939
ideas and you know things that are still
 

11035
03:08:59,939 --> 03:09:01,849
ideas and you know things that are still
out there we've created institutions

03:09:01,849 --> 03:09:01,859
out there we've created institutions
 

11037
03:09:01,859 --> 03:09:03,230
out there we've created institutions
that have helped to keep the peace we

11038
03:09:03,230 --> 03:09:03,240
that have helped to keep the peace we
 

11039
03:09:03,240 --> 03:09:06,349
that have helped to keep the peace we
just have neglected them allowed them to

11040
03:09:06,349 --> 03:09:06,359
just have neglected them allowed them to
 

11041
03:09:06,359 --> 03:09:08,750
just have neglected them allowed them to
degrade just like the United Nations and

11042
03:09:08,750 --> 03:09:08,760
degrade just like the United Nations and
 

11043
03:09:08,760 --> 03:09:11,450
degrade just like the United Nations and
you know we've created problems inside

11044
03:09:11,450 --> 03:09:11,460
you know we've created problems inside
 

11045
03:09:11,460 --> 03:09:14,150
you know we've created problems inside
of them like the veto power of the

11046
03:09:14,150 --> 03:09:14,160
of them like the veto power of the
 

11047
03:09:14,160 --> 03:09:16,370
of them like the veto power of the
permanent powers on the

11048
03:09:16,370 --> 03:09:16,380
permanent powers on the
 

11049
03:09:16,380 --> 03:09:18,650
permanent powers on the
U.N security Council but we can change

U.N security Council but we can change
 

11051
03:09:18,660 --> 03:09:21,050
U.N security Council but we can change
that he's just gonna have a will and I

11052
03:09:21,050 --> 03:09:21,060
that he's just gonna have a will and I
 

11053

03:09:27,889 --> 03:09:27,899
amazed by how people can mobilize
 

11061
03:09:27,899 --> 03:09:29,809
amazed by how people can mobilize
themselves around a crisis remember

11062
03:09:29,809 --> 03:09:29,819
themselves around a crisis remember
 

11063
03:09:29,819 --> 03:09:31,910
themselves around a crisis remember
Winston Churchill I don't quite all the

03:09:31,910 --> 03:09:31,920
Winston Churchill I don't quite all the
 

11065
03:09:31,920 --> 03:09:32,870
Winston Churchill I don't quite all the
time because I can never remember half

11066
03:09:32,870 --> 03:09:32,880
time because I can never remember half
 

11067
03:09:32,880 --> 03:09:34,730
time because I can never remember half
his quotes but I do remember the one

11068
03:09:34,730 --> 03:09:34,740
his quotes but I do remember the one
 

11069
03:09:34,740 --> 03:09:36,349
his quotes but I do remember the one
about never let a good crisis go to

about never let a good crisis go to
 

11071
03:09:36,359 --> 03:09:38,929
about never let a good crisis go to
waste and I always think that that you

11072
03:09:38,929 --> 03:09:38,939
waste and I always think that that you
 

11073
03:09:38,939 --> 03:09:41,630
waste and I always think that that you
know yeah that we should we shouldn't
