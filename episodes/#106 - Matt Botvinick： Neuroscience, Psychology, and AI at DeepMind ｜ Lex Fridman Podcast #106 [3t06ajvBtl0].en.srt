you won't regret it and now here's my
conversation with Matt Botvinnik how

164
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:29,729
conversation with Matt Botvinnik how
 

165
00:03:29,729 --> 00:03:31,429
conversation with Matt Botvinnik how
much of the human brain do you think we

166
00:03:31,429 --> 00:03:31,439
much of the human brain do you think we
 

167
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:35,780
much of the human brain do you think we
understand I think we're at a weird

168
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:35,790
understand I think we're at a weird
 

169
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:39,020
understand I think we're at a weird
moment in the history of neuroscience in

170
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:39,030
moment in the history of neuroscience in
 

171
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:45,439
moment in the history of neuroscience in
the sense that there's a there I feel

172
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:45,449
the sense that there's a there I feel
 

173
00:03:45,449 --> 00:03:46,849
the sense that there's a there I feel
like we understand a lot about the brain

174
00:03:46,849 --> 00:03:46,859
like we understand a lot about the brain
 

175
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:50,530
like we understand a lot about the brain
at a very high level but a very very

176
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:50,540
at a very high level but a very very
 

177
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:53,479
at a very high level but a very very
coarse level when you say high level

178
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:53,489
coarse level when you say high level
 

179
00:03:53,489 --> 00:03:54,409
coarse level when you say high level
what are you thinking you thinking

180
00:03:54,409 --> 00:03:54,419
what are you thinking you thinking
 

181
00:03:54,419 --> 00:03:58,490
what are you thinking you thinking
functional yeah structurally so in other

182
00:03:58,490 --> 00:03:58,500
functional yeah structurally so in other
 

183
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,830
functional yeah structurally so in other
words what is what is the brain for you

184
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:00,840
words what is what is the brain for you
 

185
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,569
words what is what is the brain for you
know what what what kinds of computation

186
00:04:02,569 --> 00:04:02,579
know what what what kinds of computation
 

187
00:04:02,579 --> 00:04:06,909
know what what what kinds of computation
does the brain do you know what kinds of

188
00:04:06,909 --> 00:04:06,919
does the brain do you know what kinds of
 

189
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:11,059
does the brain do you know what kinds of
behaviors would we have - would we have

190
00:04:11,059 --> 00:04:11,069
behaviors would we have - would we have
 

191
00:04:11,069 --> 00:04:13,339
behaviors would we have - would we have
to explain if we were going to look down

192
00:04:13,339 --> 00:04:13,349
to explain if we were going to look down
 

193
00:04:13,349 --> 00:04:16,909
to explain if we were going to look down
at the mechanistic level and at that

194
00:04:16,909 --> 00:04:16,919
at the mechanistic level and at that
 

195
00:04:16,919 --> 00:04:18,649
at the mechanistic level and at that
level I feel like we understand much

196
00:04:18,649 --> 00:04:18,659
level I feel like we understand much
 

197
00:04:18,659 --> 00:04:20,029
level I feel like we understand much
much more about the brain than we did

198
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:20,039
much more about the brain than we did
 

199
00:04:20,039 --> 00:04:22,580
much more about the brain than we did
when I was in high school but what but

200
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:22,590
when I was in high school but what but
 

201
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:24,140
when I was in high school but what but
it's at a very it's almost like we're

202
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:24,150
it's at a very it's almost like we're
 

203
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:24,510
it's at a very it's almost like we're
seeing it

204
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:24,520
seeing it
 

205
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,580
seeing it
a fog it's only at a very coarse level

206
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:26,590
a fog it's only at a very coarse level
 

207
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:28,650
a fog it's only at a very coarse level
we don't really understand what the the

208
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:28,660
we don't really understand what the the
 

209
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:30,719
we don't really understand what the the
neuronal mechanisms are that underlie

210
00:04:30,719 --> 00:04:30,729
neuronal mechanisms are that underlie
 

211
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:32,939
neuronal mechanisms are that underlie
these computations we've gotten better

212
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:32,949
these computations we've gotten better
 

213
00:04:32,949 --> 00:04:35,070
these computations we've gotten better
at saying you know what are the

214
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:35,080
at saying you know what are the
 

215
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,689
at saying you know what are the
functions that the brain is computing

216
00:04:36,689 --> 00:04:36,699
functions that the brain is computing
 

217
00:04:36,699 --> 00:04:38,219
functions that the brain is computing
that we would have to understand you

218
00:04:38,219 --> 00:04:38,229
that we would have to understand you
 

219
00:04:38,229 --> 00:04:39,300
that we would have to understand you
know if we were going to get down to the

220
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:39,310
know if we were going to get down to the
 

221
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:41,189
know if we were going to get down to the
neuronal level and at the other end of

222
00:04:41,189 --> 00:04:41,199
neuronal level and at the other end of
 

223
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:46,230
neuronal level and at the other end of
the spectrum we you know in the last few

224
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:46,240
the spectrum we you know in the last few
 

225
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,390
the spectrum we you know in the last few
years

226
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:47,400
years
 

227
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,620
years
incredible progress has been made in

228
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:49,630
incredible progress has been made in
 

229
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:53,189
incredible progress has been made in
terms of technologies that allow us to

230
00:04:53,189 --> 00:04:53,199
terms of technologies that allow us to
 

231
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,249
terms of technologies that allow us to
see you know actually literally see in

232
00:04:56,249 --> 00:04:56,259
see you know actually literally see in
 

233
00:04:56,259 --> 00:04:59,270
see you know actually literally see in
some cases what's going on at the the

234
00:04:59,270 --> 00:04:59,280
some cases what's going on at the the
 

235
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,740
some cases what's going on at the the
single unit level even the dendritic

236
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:01,750
single unit level even the dendritic
 

237
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:04,469
single unit level even the dendritic
level and then there's this yawning gap

238
00:05:04,469 --> 00:05:04,479
level and then there's this yawning gap
 

239
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:06,689
level and then there's this yawning gap
in between oh that's interesting so it's

240
00:05:06,689 --> 00:05:06,699
in between oh that's interesting so it's
 

241
00:05:06,699 --> 00:05:07,830
in between oh that's interesting so it's
a high level so there's almost a

242
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:07,840
a high level so there's almost a
 

243
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,140
a high level so there's almost a
cognitive science yeah yeah and then at

244
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:10,150
cognitive science yeah yeah and then at
 

245
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:13,020
cognitive science yeah yeah and then at
the neuronal level that's neurobiology

246
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:13,030
the neuronal level that's neurobiology
 

247
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:13,980
the neuronal level that's neurobiology
and neuroscience

248
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:13,990
and neuroscience
 

249
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:16,320
and neuroscience
yeah just studying single neurons the

250
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:16,330
yeah just studying single neurons the
 

251
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:19,170
yeah just studying single neurons the
the the the synaptic connections and all

252
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:19,180
the the the synaptic connections and all
 

253
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,520
the the the synaptic connections and all
the dopamine all the kind of new

254
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:20,530
the dopamine all the kind of new
 

255
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:22,529
the dopamine all the kind of new
transmitters one blanket statement I

256
00:05:22,529 --> 00:05:22,539
transmitters one blanket statement I
 

257
00:05:22,539 --> 00:05:26,430
transmitters one blanket statement I
should probably make is that as I've

258
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:26,440
should probably make is that as I've
 

259
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:29,430
should probably make is that as I've
gotten older I have become more and more

260
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:29,440
gotten older I have become more and more
 

261
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,990
gotten older I have become more and more
reluctant to make a distinction between

262
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:31,000
reluctant to make a distinction between
 

263
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,189
reluctant to make a distinction between
psychology and neuroscience to me the

264
00:05:35,189 --> 00:05:35,199
psychology and neuroscience to me the
 

265
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:40,020
psychology and neuroscience to me the
point of neuroscience is to study what

266
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:40,030
point of neuroscience is to study what
 

267
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:43,080
point of neuroscience is to study what
the brain is for if you if you if you're

268
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:43,090
the brain is for if you if you if you're
 

269
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:44,850
the brain is for if you if you if you're
if you're a nephrologist and you want to

270
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:44,860
if you're a nephrologist and you want to
 

271
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:47,939
if you're a nephrologist and you want to
learn about the kidney you start by at

272
00:05:47,939 --> 00:05:47,949
learn about the kidney you start by at
 

273
00:05:47,949 --> 00:05:51,180
learn about the kidney you start by at
by saying what is this thing for well it

274
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:51,190
by saying what is this thing for well it
 

275
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:55,409
by saying what is this thing for well it
seems to be for taking blood on one side

276
00:05:55,409 --> 00:05:55,419
seems to be for taking blood on one side
 

277
00:05:55,419 --> 00:05:58,980
seems to be for taking blood on one side
that has metabolites in it that are that

278
00:05:58,980 --> 00:05:58,990
that has metabolites in it that are that
 

279
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:00,529
that has metabolites in it that are that
shouldn't be there

280
00:06:00,529 --> 00:06:00,539
shouldn't be there
 

281
00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:03,450
shouldn't be there
sucking them out of the blood while

282
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:03,460
sucking them out of the blood while
 

283
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:05,339
sucking them out of the blood while
leaving the good stuff behind and then

284
00:06:05,339 --> 00:06:05,349
leaving the good stuff behind and then
 

285
00:06:05,349 --> 00:06:06,899
leaving the good stuff behind and then
excreting that in the form of urine

286
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:06,909
excreting that in the form of urine
 

287
00:06:06,909 --> 00:06:08,700
excreting that in the form of urine
that's what the kidney is for it's like

288
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:08,710
that's what the kidney is for it's like
 

289
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:11,309
that's what the kidney is for it's like
obvious so the rest of the work is

290
00:06:11,309 --> 00:06:11,319
obvious so the rest of the work is
 

291
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:14,339
obvious so the rest of the work is
deciding how it does that and this it

292
00:06:14,339 --> 00:06:14,349
deciding how it does that and this it
 

293
00:06:14,349 --> 00:06:16,050
deciding how it does that and this it
seems to me is the right approach to

294
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:16,060
seems to me is the right approach to
 

295
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:17,909
seems to me is the right approach to
take to the brain you say well what is

296
00:06:17,909 --> 00:06:17,919
take to the brain you say well what is
 

297
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,430
take to the brain you say well what is
the brain for the brain as far as I can

298
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:20,440
the brain for the brain as far as I can
 

299
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:23,070
the brain for the brain as far as I can
tell is for producing behavior it's from

300
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:23,080
tell is for producing behavior it's from
 

301
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,290
tell is for producing behavior it's from
going it's for going from perceptual

302
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:25,300
going it's for going from perceptual
 

303
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:28,140
going it's for going from perceptual
inputs to behavioral outputs and the

304
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:28,150
inputs to behavioral outputs and the
 

305
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:30,580
inputs to behavioral outputs and the
behavioral output should be adaptive

306
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:30,590
behavioral output should be adaptive
 

307
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:33,680
behavioral output should be adaptive
so that's what psychology is about it's

308
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:33,690
so that's what psychology is about it's
 

309
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:34,820
so that's what psychology is about it's
about understanding the structure of

310
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:34,830
about understanding the structure of
 

311
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:37,190
about understanding the structure of
that function and then the rest of

312
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:37,200
that function and then the rest of
 

313
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,050
that function and then the rest of
neuroscience is about figuring out how

314
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:39,060
neuroscience is about figuring out how
 

315
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:41,600
neuroscience is about figuring out how
those operations are actually carried

316
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:41,610
those operations are actually carried
 

317
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:44,360
those operations are actually carried
out at a mechanistic level it's really

318
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:44,370
out at a mechanistic level it's really
 

319
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:47,720
out at a mechanistic level it's really
interesting but so unlike the kidney the

320
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:47,730
interesting but so unlike the kidney the
 

321
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:51,050
interesting but so unlike the kidney the
the brain the the gap between the

322
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:51,060
the brain the the gap between the
 

323
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:54,290
the brain the the gap between the
electrical signal and behavior so you

324
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:54,300
electrical signal and behavior so you
 

325
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:58,250
electrical signal and behavior so you
truly see neuroscience as the science

326
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:58,260
truly see neuroscience as the science
 

327
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:01,400
truly see neuroscience as the science
oh that that touches behavior how the

328
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:01,410
oh that that touches behavior how the
 

329
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:04,490
oh that that touches behavior how the
brain generates behavior or how the

330
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:04,500
brain generates behavior or how the
 

331
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,340
brain generates behavior or how the
brain converts raw visual information

332
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:07,350
brain converts raw visual information
 

333
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:09,950
brain converts raw visual information
into understanding like and it's like

334
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:09,960
into understanding like and it's like
 

335
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,350
into understanding like and it's like
you you basically see cognitive science

336
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:12,360
you you basically see cognitive science
 

337
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,840
you you basically see cognitive science
psychology and neuroscience is all one

338
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:14,850
psychology and neuroscience is all one
 

339
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:18,800
psychology and neuroscience is all one
science yeah is that a personal

340
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:18,810
science yeah is that a personal
 

341
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:20,720
science yeah is that a personal
statement I said I'm hopeful is that is

342
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:20,730
statement I said I'm hopeful is that is
 

343
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:22,910
statement I said I'm hopeful is that is
that a hopeful or a realistic statement

344
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:22,920
that a hopeful or a realistic statement
 

345
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:25,480
that a hopeful or a realistic statement
so certainly you will be correct in your

346
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:25,490
so certainly you will be correct in your
 

347
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:28,580
so certainly you will be correct in your
feeling in some number of years but that

348
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:28,590
feeling in some number of years but that
 

349
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:30,230
feeling in some number of years but that
number of years could be two hundred

350
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:30,240
number of years could be two hundred
 

351
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,180
number of years could be two hundred
three hundred years from now oh well

352
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:32,190
three hundred years from now oh well
 

353
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:34,730
three hundred years from now oh well
there's a is that aspirational or is

354
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:34,740
there's a is that aspirational or is
 

355
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:37,940
there's a is that aspirational or is
that a pragmatic engineering feeling

356
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:37,950
that a pragmatic engineering feeling
 

357
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:41,270
that a pragmatic engineering feeling
that you have it's it's both in the

358
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:41,280
that you have it's it's both in the
 

359
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:46,610
that you have it's it's both in the
sense that this is what I hope and

360
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:46,620
sense that this is what I hope and
 

361
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:52,100
sense that this is what I hope and
expect will bear fruit over the coming

362
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:52,110
expect will bear fruit over the coming
 

363
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:55,730
expect will bear fruit over the coming
decades but it's also pragmatic in the

364
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:55,740
decades but it's also pragmatic in the
 

365
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:58,580
decades but it's also pragmatic in the
sense that I'm not sure what we're doing

366
00:07:58,580 --> 00:07:58,590
sense that I'm not sure what we're doing
 

367
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:01,670
sense that I'm not sure what we're doing
in either in either psychology or

00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:01,680
in either in either psychology or
 

369
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,250
in either in either psychology or
neuroscience if that's not the framing I

00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:04,260
neuroscience if that's not the framing I
 

371
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:06,680
neuroscience if that's not the framing I
don't I don't I don't know what it means

372
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:06,690
don't I don't I don't know what it means
 

373
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:10,850
don't I don't I don't know what it means
to understand the brain if there's no if

374
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:10,860
to understand the brain if there's no if
 

375
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:16,030

part of the enterprise is not about

00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:16,040
part of the enterprise is not about
 

377
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:19,010
part of the enterprise is not about
understanding the behavior that's being

00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:19,020
understanding the behavior that's being
 

379
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:21,830
understanding the behavior that's being
produced I mean yeah but out I would

00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:21,840
produced I mean yeah but out I would

00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,860
produced I mean yeah but out I would
have compared to maybe astronomers

382
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:24,870
have compared to maybe astronomers
 

383
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:26,900
have compared to maybe astronomers
looking at the movement of the planets

384
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:26,910
looking at the movement of the planets
 

385
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:29,930
looking at the movement of the planets
and the stars and without any interest

386
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:29,940
and the stars and without any interest
 

387
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:32,900

of the underlying physics right and I

388
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:32,910
of the underlying physics right and I
 

389
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:34,610
of the underlying physics right and I
would argue that there at least in the

390
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:34,620
would argue that there at least in the
 

391
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,680
would argue that there at least in the
early days there are some valued is just

00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:36,690
early days there are some valued is just

tracing the movement of the planets and

394
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:38,940
tracing the movement of the planets and
 

395
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:41,930
tracing the movement of the planets and
the stars without thinking about the

the stars without thinking about the
 

397
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:43,620
the stars without thinking about the

00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:45,400
to start thinking about the physics
 

401
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,640
to start thinking about the physics
before you even understand even the

402
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:47,650
before you even understand even the
 

403
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:49,860
before you even understand even the
basic structural elements of oh I agree

404
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:49,870
basic structural elements of oh I agree
 

405
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:50,430
basic structural elements of oh I agree
with that

406
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:50,440
with that
 

407
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,140
with that
I agree what you're saying in the end

408
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:52,150
I agree what you're saying in the end
 

409
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:54,090
I agree what you're saying in the end
the goal should be yeah deeply

410
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:54,100
the goal should be yeah deeply
 

411
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:57,450
the goal should be yeah deeply
understand well right and I I think so I

412
00:08:57,450 --> 00:08:57,460
understand well right and I I think so I
 

413
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:58,710
understand well right and I I think so I
thought about this a lot when I was in

414
00:08:58,710 --> 00:08:58,720
thought about this a lot when I was in
 

415
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,820
thought about this a lot when I was in
grad school because a lot of what I

416
00:08:59,820 --> 00:08:59,830
grad school because a lot of what I
 

417
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,230
grad school because a lot of what I
studied in grad school was psychology

418
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:01,240
studied in grad school was psychology
 

419
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:05,610
studied in grad school was psychology
and I found myself a little bit confused

420
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:05,620
and I found myself a little bit confused
 

421
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:09,060
and I found myself a little bit confused
about what it meant to it seems like

422
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:09,070
about what it meant to it seems like
 

423
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:10,830
about what it meant to it seems like
what we were talking about a lot of the

424
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:10,840
what we were talking about a lot of the
 

425
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:14,910
what we were talking about a lot of the
time were virtual causal mechanisms like

426
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:14,920
time were virtual causal mechanisms like
 

427
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,910
time were virtual causal mechanisms like
oh well you know attentional selection

428
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:17,920
oh well you know attentional selection
 

429
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,510
oh well you know attentional selection
then selects some object in the

430
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:21,520
then selects some object in the
 

431
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:24,000
then selects some object in the
environment and that is then passed on

432
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,010
environment and that is then passed on
 

433
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:26,100
environment and that is then passed on
to the motor you know information about

434
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:26,110
to the motor you know information about
 

435
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:27,330
to the motor you know information about
that is passed on to the motor system

436
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:27,340
that is passed on to the motor system
 

437
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:29,070
that is passed on to the motor system
but these are these are virtual

00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:29,080
but these are these are virtual

00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,710
this point in history
so in psychology at least for me

462
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:55,720
so in psychology at least for me
 

463
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,890
so in psychology at least for me
personally there was this strange

464
00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:57,900
personally there was this strange
 

465
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:00,360
personally there was this strange
insecurity about trafficking in these

466
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:00,370
insecurity about trafficking in these
 

467
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:03,270
insecurity about trafficking in these
metaphors you know which we're supposed

468
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:03,280
metaphors you know which we're supposed
 

469
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:06,380
metaphors you know which we're supposed
to explain the the function of the mind

470
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:06,390
to explain the the function of the mind
 

471
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:08,820
to explain the the function of the mind
if you can't ground them in physical

if you can't ground them in physical
 

473
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:10,950
if you can't ground them in physical
mechanisms then what you know you know

474
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:10,960
mechanisms then what you know you know
 

475
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,760
mechanisms then what you know you know
what is the what is the explanatory

476

what is the what is the explanatory
 

477
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:17,700
what is the what is the explanatory
validity of these explanations and I I

validity of these explanations and I I
 

479
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:23,100

00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:27,500
managed to I managed to soothe my own
nerves by thinking about the history of

482
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:27,510
nerves by thinking about the history of
 

483
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:31,740
nerves by thinking about the history of
genetics research so I'm very far from

484
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:31,750
genetics research so I'm very far from
 

485
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:34,230
genetics research so I'm very far from
being an expert on the history of this

486
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:34,240
being an expert on the history of this
 

487
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,770
being an expert on the history of this
field but I know enough to say that you

488
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:37,780
field but I know enough to say that you
 

489
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:41,340
field but I know enough to say that you
know Mendelian genetics preceded you

490
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:41,350
know Mendelian genetics preceded you
 

491
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:43,670
know Mendelian genetics preceded you
know Watson and Crick and so there was a

492
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:43,680
know Watson and Crick and so there was a
 

493
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,750
know Watson and Crick and so there was a
significant period of time during which

494
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:45,760
significant period of time during which
 

495
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:49,440
significant period of time during which
people were you know continued

496
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:49,450
people were you know continued
 

497
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:53,280
people were you know continued
productively investigating the structure

498
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:53,290
productively investigating the structure
 

499
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:55,650
productively investigating the structure
of inheritance using what was

500
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:55,660
of inheritance using what was
 

501
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,129
of inheritance using what was
essentially a metaphor

502
00:10:57,129 --> 00:10:57,139
essentially a metaphor
 

503
00:10:57,139 --> 00:10:59,379
essentially a metaphor
of gene you know and no genes do this

504
00:10:59,379 --> 00:10:59,389
of gene you know and no genes do this
 

505
00:10:59,389 --> 00:11:01,660
of gene you know and no genes do this
and genes do that but you know where the

506
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:01,670
and genes do that but you know where the
 

507
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:03,009
and genes do that but you know where the
genes they're they're sort of an

508
00:11:03,009 --> 00:11:03,019
genes they're they're sort of an
 

509
00:11:03,019 --> 00:11:05,859
genes they're they're sort of an
explanatory thing that we made up and we

510
00:11:05,859 --> 00:11:05,869
explanatory thing that we made up and we
 

511
00:11:05,869 --> 00:11:08,379
explanatory thing that we made up and we
we ascribed to them these causal

512
00:11:08,379 --> 00:11:08,389
we ascribed to them these causal
 

513
00:11:08,389 --> 00:11:09,970
we ascribed to them these causal
property so there's a dominant there's a

514
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:09,980
property so there's a dominant there's a
 

515
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:11,739
property so there's a dominant there's a
recessive and then then they recombine

516
00:11:11,739 --> 00:11:11,749
recessive and then then they recombine
 

517
00:11:11,749 --> 00:11:16,569
recessive and then then they recombine
and and and then later there was a kind

518
00:11:16,569 --> 00:11:16,579
and and and then later there was a kind
 

519
00:11:16,579 --> 00:11:18,639
and and and then later there was a kind
of blank there that was filled in with

520
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:18,649
of blank there that was filled in with
 

521
00:11:18,649 --> 00:11:21,729
of blank there that was filled in with
it with a with a physical mechanism that

522
00:11:21,729 --> 00:11:21,739
it with a with a physical mechanism that
 

523
00:11:21,739 --> 00:11:24,909
it with a with a physical mechanism that
connection was made in but it was worth

524
00:11:24,909 --> 00:11:24,919
connection was made in but it was worth
 

525
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:27,699
connection was made in but it was worth
having that metaphor because that's that

526
00:11:27,699 --> 00:11:27,709
having that metaphor because that's that
 

527
00:11:27,709 --> 00:11:30,489
having that metaphor because that's that
gave us a good sense of what kind of

528
00:11:30,489 --> 00:11:30,499
gave us a good sense of what kind of
 

529
00:11:30,499 --> 00:11:32,769
gave us a good sense of what kind of
cause what kind of causal mechanism we

530
00:11:32,769 --> 00:11:32,779
cause what kind of causal mechanism we
 

531
00:11:32,779 --> 00:11:35,619
cause what kind of causal mechanism we
were looking for and the fundamental

532
00:11:35,619 --> 00:11:35,629
were looking for and the fundamental
 

533
00:11:35,629 --> 00:11:38,979
were looking for and the fundamental
metaphor of cognition you said is the

534
00:11:38,979 --> 00:11:38,989
metaphor of cognition you said is the
 

535
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:41,590
metaphor of cognition you said is the
interaction of neurons is that what is

536
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:41,600
interaction of neurons is that what is
 

537
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,619
interaction of neurons is that what is
the metaphor no no the metaphor the the

538
00:11:44,619 --> 00:11:44,629
the metaphor no no the metaphor the the
 

539
00:11:44,629 --> 00:11:46,749
the metaphor no no the metaphor the the
metaphors we use in in in cognitive

540
00:11:46,749 --> 00:11:46,759
metaphors we use in in in cognitive
 

541
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:50,679
metaphors we use in in in cognitive
psychology are you know things like

542
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:50,689
psychology are you know things like
 

543
00:11:50,689 --> 00:11:55,809
psychology are you know things like
attention way that memory works you know

544
00:11:55,809 --> 00:11:55,819
attention way that memory works you know
 

545
00:11:55,819 --> 00:11:58,929
attention way that memory works you know
I I retrieve something from memory right

546
00:11:58,929 --> 00:11:58,939
I I retrieve something from memory right
 

547
00:11:58,939 --> 00:12:02,199
I I retrieve something from memory right
you know a memory retrieval occurs what

548
00:12:02,199 --> 00:12:02,209
you know a memory retrieval occurs what
 

549
00:12:02,209 --> 00:12:05,350
you know a memory retrieval occurs what
is the Hat you know that's not that's

550
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:05,360
is the Hat you know that's not that's
 

551
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,090
is the Hat you know that's not that's
not a physical mechanism that I can

552
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:07,100
not a physical mechanism that I can
 

553
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:10,289
not a physical mechanism that I can
examine in its own right but if we if

554
00:12:10,289 --> 00:12:10,299
examine in its own right but if we if
 

555
00:12:10,299 --> 00:12:12,729
examine in its own right but if we if
but it's still worth having that that

556
00:12:12,729 --> 00:12:12,739
but it's still worth having that that
 

557
00:12:12,739 --> 00:12:14,590
but it's still worth having that that
metaphorical level yeah so yeah I

558
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:14,600
metaphorical level yeah so yeah I
 

559
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,479
metaphorical level yeah so yeah I
misunderstood actually so the higher

560
00:12:16,479 --> 00:12:16,489
misunderstood actually so the higher
 

561
00:12:16,489 --> 00:12:18,280
misunderstood actually so the higher
level abstractions is the metaphor

562
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:18,290
level abstractions is the metaphor
 

563
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:21,519
level abstractions is the metaphor
that's most useful yes but but what

564
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:21,529
that's most useful yes but but what
 

565
00:12:21,529 --> 00:12:27,329
that's most useful yes but but what
about so how does that connect to the

566
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:27,339

 

567
00:12:27,339 --> 00:12:30,639

the idea that that arises from

568
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:30,649
the idea that that arises from
 

569
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:34,030
the idea that that arises from
interaction of neurons well even it is

570
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:34,040
interaction of neurons well even it is
 

571
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,489
interaction of neurons well even it is
the interaction of neurons also not a

572
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:36,499
the interaction of neurons also not a
 

573
00:12:36,499 --> 00:12:39,569
the interaction of neurons also not a
metaphor to you is or is it literally

574
00:12:39,569 --> 00:12:39,579
metaphor to you is or is it literally
 

575
00:12:39,579 --> 00:12:42,309
metaphor to you is or is it literally
like that's no longer a metaphor that's

576
00:12:42,309 --> 00:12:42,319
like that's no longer a metaphor that's
 

577
00:12:42,319 --> 00:12:45,100
like that's no longer a metaphor that's
that's already that's already the lowest

578
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:45,110
that's already that's already the lowest
 

579
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:46,449
that's already that's already the lowest
level of abstractions that could

580
00:12:46,449 --> 00:12:46,459
level of abstractions that could
 

581
00:12:46,459 --> 00:12:51,669
level of abstractions that could
actually be directly studied well I'm

582
00:12:51,669 --> 00:12:51,679
actually be directly studied well I'm
 

583
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:54,759
actually be directly studied well I'm
hesitating because I think what I want

584
00:12:54,759 --> 00:12:54,769
hesitating because I think what I want
 

585
00:12:54,769 --> 00:12:57,090
hesitating because I think what I want
to say could end up being controversial

586
00:12:57,090 --> 00:12:57,100
to say could end up being controversial
 

587
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:00,009
to say could end up being controversial
so what I want to say is yes the

588
00:13:00,009 --> 00:13:00,019
so what I want to say is yes the
 

589
00:13:00,019 --> 00:13:01,419
so what I want to say is yes the
interaction of the interactions of

590
00:13:01,419 --> 00:13:01,429
interaction of the interactions of
 

591
00:13:01,429 --> 00:13:03,249
interaction of the interactions of
neurons that's not metaphorical that's a

592
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:03,259
neurons that's not metaphorical that's a
 

593
00:13:03,259 --> 00:13:05,710
neurons that's not metaphorical that's a
physical fact that's that's where that's

594
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:05,720
physical fact that's that's where that's
 

595
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,479
physical fact that's that's where that's
where the causal interactions actually

596
00:13:07,479 --> 00:13:07,489
where the causal interactions actually
 

597
00:13:07,489 --> 00:13:09,999
where the causal interactions actually
occur now I suppose you could say well

598
00:13:09,999 --> 00:13:10,009
occur now I suppose you could say well
 

599
00:13:10,009 --> 00:13:11,050
occur now I suppose you could say well
you know even

600
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:11,060
you know even
 

601
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:13,390
you know even
is metaphorical relative to the quantum

602
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:13,400
is metaphorical relative to the quantum
 

603
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,880
is metaphorical relative to the quantum
events that underlie yes you know I

604
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:15,890
events that underlie yes you know I
 

605
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:17,110
events that underlie yes you know I
don't want to go down that rabbit hole

606
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:17,120
don't want to go down that rabbit hole
 

607
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,410
don't want to go down that rabbit hole
so is turtles on top potatoes but there

608
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:20,420
so is turtles on top potatoes but there
 

609
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:21,910
so is turtles on top potatoes but there
is it there isn't there's a reduction

610
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:21,920
is it there isn't there's a reduction
 

611
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,110
is it there isn't there's a reduction
that you can do you can say these

612
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:23,120
that you can do you can say these
 

613
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,870
that you can do you can say these
psychological phenomena are can be

614
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:25,880
psychological phenomena are can be
 

615
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,300
psychological phenomena are can be
explained through a very different kind

616
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:28,310
explained through a very different kind
 

617
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:29,620
explained through a very different kind
of causal mechanism which has to do with

618
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:29,630
of causal mechanism which has to do with
 

619
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:32,170
of causal mechanism which has to do with
neurotransmitter release and and so what

620
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:32,180
neurotransmitter release and and so what
 

621
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:33,790
neurotransmitter release and and so what
we're really trying to do in

622
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:33,800
we're really trying to do in
 

623
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,820
we're really trying to do in
neuroscience writ large you know as I

624
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:36,830
neuroscience writ large you know as I
 

625
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:39,520

say which for me includes psychology is

626
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:39,530
say which for me includes psychology is
 

627
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:43,510
say which for me includes psychology is
to take these psychological phenomena

628
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:43,520
to take these psychological phenomena
 

629
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:49,000
to take these psychological phenomena
and map them on to neural events

630
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:49,010
and map them on to neural events
 

631
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:53,440
and map them on to neural events
I think remaining forever at the level

632
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:53,450
I think remaining forever at the level
 

633
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:58,840
I think remaining forever at the level
of description that is natural for

634
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:58,850
of description that is natural for
 

635
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:01,570
of description that is natural for
psychology for me personally would be

636
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:01,580
psychology for me personally would be
 

637
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:03,220
psychology for me personally would be
disappointing I want to understand how

638
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:03,230
disappointing I want to understand how
 

639
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:07,980
disappointing I want to understand how
mental activity arises from neural

640

803
00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:01,840
different kinds and trying to understand
what what the what the specific deficits

00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:01,850
what what the what the specific deficits
 

805
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:05,320
what what the what the specific deficits
were that arose from a lesion in a

00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:05,330
were that arose from a lesion in a
 

807
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:07,270
were that arose from a lesion in a
particular part of the brain and the the

808
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:07,280
particular part of the brain and the the
 

809
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,890
particular part of the brain and the the
kind of experimentation that was done

810
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:08,900
kind of experimentation that was done
 

811
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,870
kind of experimentation that was done
and that's still being done to get

812
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:10,880
and that's still being done to get
 

813
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,170
and that's still being done to get
answers in that context was so creative

814
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:14,180
answers in that context was so creative
 

815
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:19,030
answers in that context was so creative
and it was so deliberate you know the it

816
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:19,040
and it was so deliberate you know the it
 

817
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:22,840
and it was so deliberate you know the it
was good science an experiment answered

818
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:22,850
was good science an experiment answered
 

819
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:24,490
was good science an experiment answered
one question but raised another and

820
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:24,500
one question but raised another and
 

821
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,630
one question but raised another and
somebody would do an experiment that

822
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:25,640
somebody would do an experiment that
 

823
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,070
somebody would do an experiment that
answered that question and you really

824
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:27,080
answered that question and you really
 

825
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,680
answered that question and you really
felt like you were narrowing in on some

826
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:29,690
felt like you were narrowing in on some
 

827

what this part of the brain was for do
 

831
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:36,510
what this part of the brain was for do
you have an example of the memory of

you have an example of the memory of
 

833
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:39,700
you have an example of the memory of
what kind of aspects of the mind could

what kind of aspects of the mind could
 

835
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:41,920
what kind of aspects of the mind could
be studied in this kind of way oh sure I

836
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:41,930
be studied in this kind of way oh sure I
 

837
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:44,440
be studied in this kind of way oh sure I
mean the very detailed

know reading and auditory and semantic
 

849
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:02,350
know reading and auditory and semantic
and I mean there were these beauty and

850
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:02,360
and I mean there were these beauty and
 

851
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,000
and I mean there were these beauty and
still are these beautiful models that

852
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:04,010
still are these beautiful models that
 

853
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:05,410
still are these beautiful models that
came out of that kind of research that

854
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:05,420
came out of that kind of research that
 

855
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:07,990
came out of that kind of research that
really made you feel like you understood

856
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:08,000
really made you feel like you understood
 

857
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,100
really made you feel like you understood
something that you hadn't understood

858

something that you hadn't understood
 

859

stood before about how you know language

860
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:12,710
stood before about how you know language

stood before about how you know language
processing is organized in the brain but

862
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:15,410
processing is organized in the brain but
 

863
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:21,580
processing is organized in the brain but
having said all that you know I I think

864
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:21,590
having said all that you know I I think
 

865
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:24,490
having said all that you know I I think
you know I think you are I mean I agree

866
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:24,500
you know I think you are I mean I agree
 

867
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:29,020
you know I think you are I mean I agree
with you that the cost of doing highly

868
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:29,030
with you that the cost of doing highly
 

869
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:32,850
with you that the cost of doing highly
controlled experiments is that you

870
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:32,860
controlled experiments is that you
 

871
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:36,240
controlled experiments is that you
by construction miss out on the richness

by what in those days was called
 

879
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,020
by what in those days was called
connectionism which is of course that

from the 80s some when I was in I went

904
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:15,970
from the 80s some when I was in I went
 

905
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:17,250
from the 80s some when I was in I went
to medical school before I went into

906
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:17,260
to medical school before I went into
 

907
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:21,180
to medical school before I went into
science and really yeah this thing Wow I

908
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:21,190
science and really yeah this thing Wow I
 

909
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:23,490
science and really yeah this thing Wow I
also I also did a graduate degree in art

910
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:23,500
also I also did a graduate degree in art
 

911
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:26,130
also I also did a graduate degree in art
history so I'm I kind of explored

912
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:26,140
history so I'm I kind of explored
 

913
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:28,710
history so I'm I kind of explored
well art history I understand there's

914
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:28,720
well art history I understand there's
 

915
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,950
well art history I understand there's
just a curious creative mind but medical

that slight tangent what did you what

920
00:20:37,409 --> 00:20:37,419
that slight tangent what did you what
 

921
00:20:37,419 --> 00:20:38,430

00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:40,480
I actually was quite interested in
 

925
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,480

surgery I was I was interested in
 

927
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:44,610
surgery I was I was interested in
surgery and psychiatry and I thought

928
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:44,620
surgery and psychiatry and I thought
 

929
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:46,850
surgery and psychiatry and I thought
that must be I must be the only person

930
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:46,860
that must be I must be the only person
 

931
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:51,150
that must be I must be the only person
on the planet who had who was torn

between those two fields and III said

934
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:54,370
between those two fields and III said
 

935
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:56,250
between those two fields and III said
exactly that to my advisor in medical

936
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:56,260
exactly that to my advisor in medical
 

937
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:59,370

school who turned out I found out later

938
00:20:59,370 --> 00:20:59,380
school who turned out I found out later
 

939
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:02,760
school who turned out I found out later
to be a famous psychoanalyst and and he

940
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:02,770
to be a famous psychoanalyst and and he
 

941
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:04,350
to be a famous psychoanalyst and and he
said to me no no it's actually not so

942
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:04,360
said to me no no it's actually not so
 

943
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,600
said to me no no it's actually not so
uncommon to be interested in surgery and

944
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:06,610
uncommon to be interested in surgery and
 

945
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:09,570
uncommon to be interested in surgery and
psychiatry and he conjectured that the

946
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:09,580
psychiatry and he conjectured that the
 

947
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:11,909
psychiatry and he conjectured that the
reason that people develop these these

948
00:21:11,909 --> 00:21:11,919
reason that people develop these these
 

949
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:13,860
reason that people develop these these
two interests is that both fields are

950
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:13,870
two interests is that both fields are
 

951
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:16,650
two interests is that both fields are
about going beneath the surface and kind

952
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:16,660
about going beneath the surface and kind
 

953
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:18,690
about going beneath the surface and kind
of getting into the kind of secret yeah

954
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:18,700
of getting into the kind of secret yeah
 

955
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,730
of getting into the kind of secret yeah
I mean maybe you understand this as

956
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:20,740
I mean maybe you understand this as
 

957
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:21,690
I mean maybe you understand this as
someone who was interested in

958
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:21,700
someone who was interested in
 

959
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,580
someone who was interested in
psychoanalysis and or the stage there's

960
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:23,590
psychoanalysis and or the stage there's
 

961
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:25,710
psychoanalysis and or the stage there's
sort of a this you know there's a cliche

962
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:25,720

sort of a this you know there's a cliche
phrase that people use now on you know

964
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:27,460
phrase that people use now on you know
 

965
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:30,480
phrase that people use now on you know
like an NPR The Secret Life of Bees like

966
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:30,490
like an NPR The Secret Life of Bees like
 

967
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:32,640
like an NPR The Secret Life of Bees like
right yeah you know and that was part of

968
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:32,650
right yeah you know and that was part of
 

969
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:34,440
right yeah you know and that was part of
the thrill of surgery was seeing you

970
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:34,450
the thrill of surgery was seeing you
 

971
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:36,090
the thrill of surgery was seeing you
know the secret

972
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:36,100
know the secret
 

973
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,310
know the secret
you know the secret activity that's

974
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:38,320
you know the secret activity that's
 

975
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,380
you know the secret activity that's
inside everybody is abdomen and thorax

976
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:40,390
inside everybody is abdomen and thorax
 

977
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:42,830
inside everybody is abdomen and thorax
it's a very poetic way to connect it to

978
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:42,840
it's a very poetic way to connect it to
 

979
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,120
it's a very poetic way to connect it to
disciplines that are very practically

980
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:45,130
disciplines that are very practically
 

981
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:46,050
disciplines that are very practically
speaking different

982
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:46,060
speaking different
 

983
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:47,730
speaking different
each other that's for sure that's for

984
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:47,740
each other that's for sure that's for
 

985
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:51,510
each other that's for sure that's for
sure yes so so how do we get on to

986
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:51,520
sure yes so so how do we get on to
 

987
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,130
sure yes so so how do we get on to
medical school so so I was in medical

988
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:53,140
medical school so so I was in medical
 

989
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:56,370
medical school so so I was in medical
school and I I was doing a psychiatry

990
00:21:56,370 --> 00:21:56,380
school and I I was doing a psychiatry
 

991
00:21:56,380 --> 00:22:00,210
school and I I was doing a psychiatry
rotation and my kind of advisor in that

992
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:00,220
rotation and my kind of advisor in that
 

993
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:03,870
rotation and my kind of advisor in that
rotation asked me what I was interested

994
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:03,880
rotation asked me what I was interested
 

995
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:07,920
rotation asked me what I was interested
in and I said well maybe psychiatry he

996
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:07,930
in and I said well maybe psychiatry he
 

997
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:10,410
in and I said well maybe psychiatry he
said why and I said well I've always

998
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:10,420
said why and I said well I've always
 

999
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:12,050
said why and I said well I've always
been interested in how the brain works

1000
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:12,060
been interested in how the brain works
 

1001
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:15,000
been interested in how the brain works
I'm pretty sure that nobody's doing

1002
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:15,010
I'm pretty sure that nobody's doing
 

1003
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:18,330
I'm pretty sure that nobody's doing
scientific research that addresses my

1004
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:18,340
scientific research that addresses my
 

1005
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:21,210
scientific research that addresses my
interests which are I didn't have a word

1006
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:21,220
interests which are I didn't have a word
 

1007
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:23,430
interests which are I didn't have a word
for it then but I would have said about

1008
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:23,440
for it then but I would have said about
 

1009
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,730
for it then but I would have said about
cognition and he said well you know I'm

1010
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:26,740
cognition and he said well you know I'm
 

1011
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:27,630
cognition and he said well you know I'm
not sure that's true

1012
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:27,640
not sure that's true
 

1013
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,070
not sure that's true
you might you might be interested in

1014
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:29,080
you might you might be interested in
 

1015
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,750
you might you might be interested in
these books and he pulled down the the

1016
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:30,760
these books and he pulled down the the
 

1017
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,850
these books and he pulled down the the
PDB books from his shelf and they were

1018
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:32,860
PDB books from his shelf and they were
 

1019
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:33,870
PDB books from his shelf and they were
still shrink-wrapped

1020
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:33,880
still shrink-wrapped
 

1021
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:36,180
still shrink-wrapped
he hadn't read them but he handed to me

1022
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:36,190
he hadn't read them but he handed to me
 

1023
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:37,350
he hadn't read them but he handed to me
a hint that inform you said he you can

1024
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:37,360
a hint that inform you said he you can
 

1025
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,120
a hint that inform you said he you can
you feel free to borrow these and that

1026
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:39,130
you feel free to borrow these and that
 

1027
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:41,400
you feel free to borrow these and that
was you know I went back to my dorm room

1028
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:41,410
was you know I went back to my dorm room
 

1029
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:43,050
was you know I went back to my dorm room
and I just you know read them cover to

1030
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:43,060
and I just you know read them cover to
 

1031
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:45,360
and I just you know read them cover to
cover and what's PDP parallel

1032
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:45,370
cover and what's PDP parallel
 

1033
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:47,310
cover and what's PDP parallel
distributed processing which was the one

1034
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:47,320
distributed processing which was the one
 

1035
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,740
distributed processing which was the one
of the original names for deep learning

1036
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:49,750
of the original names for deep learning
 

1037
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:54,510
of the original names for deep learning
and so I apologize for the romanticized

1038
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:54,520
and so I apologize for the romanticized
 

1039
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:57,450
and so I apologize for the romanticized
question but what what idea in the space

always fascinated me even when I was a

00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:09,280
always fascinated me even when I was a
 

1049
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:17,510
always fascinated me even when I was a
pretty young kid I think was the the the

pretty young kid I think was the the the
 

1051
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:23,370

paradox that lies in the fact that the

1052
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:23,380
paradox that lies in the fact that the
 

1053
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:26,910
paradox that lies in the fact that the
brain is so mysterious and so it seems

1054
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:26,920
brain is so mysterious and so it seems
 

1055
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:32,670
brain is so mysterious and so it seems
so distant but at the same time it's

1056
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:32,680
so distant but at the same time it's
 

1057
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:36,570
so distant but at the same time it's
responsible for the the the the full

used to teach when I taught at Princeton
 

1069
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,260
used to teach when I taught at Princeton
I used to teach a cognitive neuroscience

1070
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:52,270
I used to teach a cognitive neuroscience
 

1071
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:54,630
I used to teach a cognitive neuroscience
course and the very last thing I would

1072
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:54,640
course and the very last thing I would
 

1073
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,700
course and the very last thing I would
say to the students was you know

1074
00:23:58,700 --> 00:23:58,710
say to the students was you know
 

1075
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:01,780
say to the students was you know
people often when people think of

1076
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:01,790
people often when people think of
 

1077
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:05,390
people often when people think of
scientific inspiration the the metaphor

1078
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:05,400
scientific inspiration the the metaphor
 

1079
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,610
scientific inspiration the the metaphor
is often we'll look to the stars you

1080
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:07,620
is often we'll look to the stars you
 

1081
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:09,770
is often we'll look to the stars you
know the stars will inspire you to

1082
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:09,780
know the stars will inspire you to
 

1083
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:13,340
know the stars will inspire you to
wonder at the universe and and you know

1084
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:13,350
wonder at the universe and and you know
 

1085
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:15,080
wonder at the universe and and you know
think about your place in it and how

1086
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:15,090
think about your place in it and how
 

1087
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:17,450
think about your place in it and how
things work and and I'm all for looking

1088
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:17,460
things work and and I'm all for looking
 

1089
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:20,420
things work and and I'm all for looking
at the stars but I've always been much

1090
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:20,430
at the stars but I've always been much
 

1091
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:23,000
at the stars but I've always been much
more inspired and my sense of wonder

1092
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:23,010
more inspired and my sense of wonder
 

1093
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:26,470
more inspired and my sense of wonder
comes from the not from the distant

1094
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:26,480
comes from the not from the distant
 

1095
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:30,290
comes from the not from the distant
mysterious stars but from the extremely

1096
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:30,300
mysterious stars but from the extremely
 

1097
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:35,150
mysterious stars but from the extremely
intimately close brain yeah there's

1098
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:35,160
intimately close brain yeah there's
 

1099
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:38,750
intimately close brain yeah there's
something just endlessly fascinating to

1100
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:38,760
something just endlessly fascinating to
 

1101
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,880
something just endlessly fascinating to
me about that the like just like you

1102
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:40,890
me about that the like just like you
 

1103
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:44,060
me about that the like just like you
said the the one is close and yet

1104
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:44,070
said the the one is close and yet
 

1105
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:46,880
said the the one is close and yet
distant in in terms of our understanding

1106
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:46,890
distant in in terms of our understanding
 

1107
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:52,160
distant in in terms of our understanding
of it do you are you all so captivated

1108
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:52,170
of it do you are you all so captivated
 

1109
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:54,740
of it do you are you all so captivated
by the the fact that this very

1110
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:54,750
by the the fact that this very
 

1111
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:56,480
by the the fact that this very
conversation is happening because two

1112
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:56,490
conversation is happening because two
 

1113
00:24:56,490 --> 00:25:01,550
conversation is happening because two
brains are communicating the I guess

1114
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:01,560
brains are communicating the I guess
 

1115
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,830
brains are communicating the I guess
what I mean is the subjective nature of

1116
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:03,840
what I mean is the subjective nature of
 

1117
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,660
what I mean is the subjective nature of

the brain you are you talking about
 

1127
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,420
the brain you are you talking about
specifically the mechanism of cognition

1128
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:17,430
specifically the mechanism of cognition
 

1129
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:22,010
specifically the mechanism of cognition
or are you also just like at least for

1130
00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:22,020
or are you also just like at least for
 

1131
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:25,460
or are you also just like at least for
me it's almost like paralyzing the

1132
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:25,470
me it's almost like paralyzing the
 

1133
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:27,110
me it's almost like paralyzing the
beauty and the mystery of the fact that

1134
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:27,120
beauty and the mystery of the fact that
 

1135
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,760
beauty and the mystery of the fact that
it creates the entirety of the

1136
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:28,770
it creates the entirety of the
 

1137
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:30,730
it creates the entirety of the
experience not just the reasoning

1138
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:30,740
experience not just the reasoning
 

1139
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:35,810
experience not just the reasoning
capability but the experience well I I

1140
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:35,820
capability but the experience well I I
 

1141
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:38,120
capability but the experience well I I
definitely resonate with that that

1142
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:38,130
definitely resonate with that that
 

1143
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:42,670
definitely resonate with that that
latter thought and I I often find

1144
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:42,680
latter thought and I I often find
 

1145
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,720
latter thought and I I often find
discussions of artificial intelligence

1146
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:44,730
discussions of artificial intelligence
 

1147
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:50,330
discussions of artificial intelligence
to be disappointingly narrow you know

1148
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:50,340
to be disappointingly narrow you know
 

1149
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:53,240
to be disappointingly narrow you know
speaking of someone who has always had

1150
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:53,250
speaking of someone who has always had
 

1151
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:56,570
speaking of someone who has always had
an interest in in in art great it was

1152
00:25:56,570 --> 00:25:56,580
an interest in in in art great it was
 

1153
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:58,040
an interest in in in art great it was
just gonna go there cuz it sounds like

1154
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:58,050
just gonna go there cuz it sounds like
 

1155
00:25:58,050 --> 00:26:00,320
just gonna go there cuz it sounds like
somebody who has an interest in art yeah

1156
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:00,330
somebody who has an interest in art yeah
 

1157
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:02,720
somebody who has an interest in art yeah
I mean I there there there

1158
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:02,730
I mean I there there there
 

1159
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:05,830
I mean I there there there
there are many layers to you know to

1160
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:05,840
there are many layers to you know to
 

1161
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:10,640
there are many layers to you know to
full-bore him and experience and and in

1162
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:10,650
full-bore him and experience and and in
 

1163
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:12,590
full-bore him and experience and and in
some ways it's not enough to say oh well

1164
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:12,600
some ways it's not enough to say oh well
 

1165
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,330
some ways it's not enough to say oh well
don't worry you know we're talking about

1166
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:14,340
don't worry you know we're talking about
 

1167
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:16,430
don't worry you know we're talking about
cognition but we'll add emotion you know

1168
00:26:16,430 --> 00:26:16,440
cognition but we'll add emotion you know
 

1169
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,380
cognition but we'll add emotion you know
yeah there's there's there's an

1170
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:18,390
yeah there's there's there's an
 

1171
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:23,450
yeah there's there's there's an
incredible scope to what humans go

1172
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:23,460
incredible scope to what humans go
 

1173
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:30,770
incredible scope to what humans go
through in in every moment and and yes

1174
00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:30,780
through in in every moment and and yes
 

1175
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:33,110
through in in every moment and and yes
so it's that's part of what fascinates

1176
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:33,120
so it's that's part of what fascinates
 

1177
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,200
so it's that's part of what fascinates
me is that is that our brains are

1178
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:36,210
me is that is that our brains are
 

1179
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:41,450
me is that is that our brains are
producing that but at the same time it's

1180
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:41,460
producing that but at the same time it's
 

1181
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:46,340
producing that but at the same time it's
so mysterious to us how we literally our

1182
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:46,350
so mysterious to us how we literally our
 

1183
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:48,800
so mysterious to us how we literally our
brains are literally in our heads

1184
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:48,810
brains are literally in our heads
 

1185
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:52,430
brains are literally in our heads
producing mystics and yet there and yet

1186
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:52,440
producing mystics and yet there and yet
 

1187
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,890
producing mystics and yet there and yet
there's there it's so mysterious to us

1188
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:54,900
there's there it's so mysterious to us
 

1189
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,930
there's there it's so mysterious to us
and so and in the scientific challenge

1190
00:26:56,930 --> 00:26:56,940
and so and in the scientific challenge
 

1191
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:59,420
and so and in the scientific challenge
of getting at the the the actual

1192
00:26:59,420 --> 00:26:59,430
of getting at the the the actual
 

1193
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:02,600
of getting at the the the actual
explanation for that is so overwhelming

1194
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:02,610
explanation for that is so overwhelming
 

1195
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:04,930
explanation for that is so overwhelming
it's not that's just i don't know that

1196
00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:04,940
it's not that's just i don't know that
 

1197
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:07,250
it's not that's just i don't know that
certain people have fixations on

1198
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:07,260
certain people have fixations on
 

1199
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:08,990
certain people have fixations on
particular questions and that's always

1200
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:09,000
particular questions and that's always
 

1201
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,930
particular questions and that's always
that's just always been mine yeah I

1202
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:11,940
that's just always been mine yeah I
 

1203
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:13,970
that's just always been mine yeah I
would say the poetry that is fascinating

1204
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:13,980
would say the poetry that is fascinating
 

1205
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:15,890
would say the poetry that is fascinating
and I'm really interested in natural

1206
00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:15,900
and I'm really interested in natural
 

1207
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,990
and I'm really interested in natural
language as well and when you look at

1208
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:18,000
language as well and when you look at
 

1209
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,550
language as well and when you look at
our personal intelligence community it

1210
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:19,560
our personal intelligence community it
 

1211
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:24,320
our personal intelligence community it
always saddens me how much when you try

1212
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:24,330
always saddens me how much when you try
 

1213
00:27:24,330 --> 00:27:26,540
always saddens me how much when you try
to create a benchmark for the community

1214
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:26,550
to create a benchmark for the community
 

1215
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:29,720
to create a benchmark for the community
together around how much of the magic of

1216
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:29,730
together around how much of the magic of
 

1217
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:31,490
together around how much of the magic of
language is lost when you create that

1218
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:31,500
language is lost when you create that
 

1219
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:34,280
language is lost when you create that
benchmark that there's something would

1220
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:34,290
benchmark that there's something would
 

1221
00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:36,950
benchmark that there's something would
we talk about experience the the music

1222
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:36,960
we talk about experience the the music
 

1223
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,470
we talk about experience the the music
of the language the wit the something

1224
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:39,480
of the language the wit the something
 

1225
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,330
of the language the wit the something
that makes a rich experience something

1226
00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:41,340
that makes a rich experience something
 

1227
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:43,970
that makes a rich experience something
that would be required to pass the

1228
00:27:43,970 --> 00:27:43,980
that would be required to pass the
 

1229
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:46,760
that would be required to pass the
spirit of the Turing test is lost in

1230
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:46,770
spirit of the Turing test is lost in
 

1231
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:49,400
spirit of the Turing test is lost in
these benchmarks and I wonder how to get

1232
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:49,410
these benchmarks and I wonder how to get
 

1233
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:51,110
these benchmarks and I wonder how to get
it back in because it's very difficult

1234
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:51,120
it back in because it's very difficult
 

1235
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,810
it back in because it's very difficult
the moment you tried to do like real

1236
00:27:53,810 --> 00:27:53,820
the moment you tried to do like real
 

1237
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:55,820
the moment you tried to do like real
good rigorous science you lose some of

1238
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:55,830
good rigorous science you lose some of
 

1239
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:58,970
good rigorous science you lose some of
that magic when you try to study

1240
00:27:58,970 --> 00:27:58,980
that magic when you try to study
 

1241
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:01,430
that magic when you try to study
cognition in a rigorous scientific way

1242
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:01,440
cognition in a rigorous scientific way
 

1243
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,020
cognition in a rigorous scientific way
it feels like you're losing some of the

1244
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:03,030
it feels like you're losing some of the
 

1245
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:06,320
it feels like you're losing some of the
magic mm-hmm-hmm the the seen cognition

00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:08,340
in a mechanistic way that AI vote at
 

1249
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:10,730
in a mechanistic way that AI vote at
this stage in our history well okay I I

1250
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:10,740
this stage in our history well okay I I
 

1251
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:13,250
this stage in our history well okay I I
agree with you but at the same time one

1252
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:13,260
agree with you but at the same time one
 

1253
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:17,930
agree with you but at the same time one
one thing that I found really exciting

1254
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:17,940
one thing that I found really exciting
 

1255
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:20,870
one thing that I found really exciting
about that first wave of deep learning

1256
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:20,880
about that first wave of deep learning
 

1257
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:25,090
about that first wave of deep learning
models in cognition was

1258
00:28:25,090 --> 00:28:25,100
models in cognition was
 

1259
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:28,670
models in cognition was
there was the the fact that the people

1260
00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:28,680
there was the the fact that the people
 

1261
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,810
there was the the fact that the people
who were building these models were

1262
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:29,820
who were building these models were
 

1263
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:32,720
who were building these models were
focused on the richness and complexity

1264
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:32,730
focused on the richness and complexity
 

1265
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:37,810
focused on the richness and complexity
of human cognition so an early debate in

1266
00:28:37,810 --> 00:28:37,820
of human cognition so an early debate in
 

1267
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:40,640
of human cognition so an early debate in
cognitive science which I sort of

1268
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:40,650
cognitive science which I sort of
 

1269
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:42,290
cognitive science which I sort of
witnessed as a grad student was about

1270
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:42,300
witnessed as a grad student was about
 

1271
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:44,570
witnessed as a grad student was about
something that sounds very dry which is

1272
00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:44,580
something that sounds very dry which is
 

1273
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:47,420
something that sounds very dry which is
the formation of the past tense but

1274
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:47,430
the formation of the past tense but
 

1275
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:50,270
the formation of the past tense but
there were these two camps one said well

1276
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:50,280
there were these two camps one said well
 

1277
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:54,340
there were these two camps one said well
the the mind encodes certain rules and

1278
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:54,350
the the mind encodes certain rules and
 

1279
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:58,190
the the mind encodes certain rules and
it also has a list of exceptions because

1280
00:28:58,190 --> 00:28:58,200
it also has a list of exceptions because
 

1281
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,590
it also has a list of exceptions because
of course you know the rule is a DB but

1282
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:00,600
of course you know the rule is a DB but
 

1283
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,060
of course you know the rule is a DB but
that's not always what you do so you

1284
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:02,070
that's not always what you do so you
 

1285
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:03,530
that's not always what you do so you
have to have a list of exceptions and

1286
00:29:03,530 --> 00:29:03,540
have to have a list of exceptions and
 

1287
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:06,770
have to have a list of exceptions and
and then there were the connectionists

1288
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:06,780
and then there were the connectionists
 

1289
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:08,870
and then there were the connectionists
who you know evolved into the deep

1290
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:08,880
who you know evolved into the deep
 

1291
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,330
who you know evolved into the deep
learning people who said well well you

1292
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:11,340
learning people who said well well you
 

1293
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:13,310
learning people who said well well you
know if you look carefully at the data

1294
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:13,320
know if you look carefully at the data
 

1295
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:16,370
know if you look carefully at the data
if you look at actually look at corpora

1296
00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:16,380
if you look at actually look at corpora
 

1297
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:19,190
if you look at actually look at corpora
like language corpora it's it turns out

1298
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:19,200
like language corpora it's it turns out
 

1299
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,560
like language corpora it's it turns out
to be very rich because yes there are

1300
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:21,570
to be very rich because yes there are
 

1301
00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:24,380
to be very rich because yes there are
there are there's a you know the there

1302
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:24,390
there are there's a you know the there
 

1303
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:26,480
there are there's a you know the there
most verbs that and you know you just

1304
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:26,490
most verbs that and you know you just
 

1305
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:28,160
most verbs that and you know you just
tack on e d and then there are

1306
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:28,170
tack on e d and then there are
 

1307
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:29,810
tack on e d and then there are
exceptions but there are also there's

1308
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:29,820
exceptions but there are also there's
 

1309
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:32,419
exceptions but there are also there's
also there are there are rules that in

1310
00:29:32,419 --> 00:29:32,429
also there are there are rules that in
 

1311
00:29:32,429 --> 00:29:34,430
also there are there are rules that in
you know there's the exceptions aren't

1312
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:34,440
you know there's the exceptions aren't
 

1313
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:37,280
you know there's the exceptions aren't
just random they there are certain clues

1314
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:37,290
just random they there are certain clues
 

1315
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:40,010
just random they there are certain clues
to which which which verbs should be

1316
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:40,020
to which which which verbs should be
 

1317
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:41,990
to which which which verbs should be
exceptional and then there are some

1318
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:42,000
exceptional and then there are some
 

1319
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,480
exceptional and then there are some
exceptions to the exceptions and there

1320
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:44,490
exceptions to the exceptions and there
 

1321
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:47,810
exceptions to the exceptions and there
was a word that was kind of deployed in

1322
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:47,820
was a word that was kind of deployed in
 

1323
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:50,480
was a word that was kind of deployed in
order to capture this which was quasi

1324
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:50,490
order to capture this which was quasi
 

1325
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:52,970
order to capture this which was quasi
regular in other words there are rules

1326
00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:52,980
regular in other words there are rules
 

1327
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:55,580
regular in other words there are rules
but it's it's messy and there there's

1328
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:55,590
but it's it's messy and there there's
 

1329
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:57,200
but it's it's messy and there there's
their structure even among the

1330
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:57,210
their structure even among the
 

1331
00:29:57,210 --> 00:30:00,200
their structure even among the
exceptions and and it would be yeah you

1332
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:00,210
exceptions and and it would be yeah you
 

1333
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:01,730
exceptions and and it would be yeah you
could try to write down you could try to

1334
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:01,740
could try to write down you could try to
 

1335
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:04,250
could try to write down you could try to
write down the structure in some sort of

1336
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:04,260
write down the structure in some sort of
 

1337
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:06,620
write down the structure in some sort of
closed form but really the right way to

1338
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:06,630
closed form but really the right way to
 

1339
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:08,600
closed form but really the right way to
understand how the brain is handling all

1340
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:08,610
understand how the brain is handling all
 

1341
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:10,430
understand how the brain is handling all
this and by the way producing all of

1342
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:10,440
this and by the way producing all of
 

1343
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:13,790
this and by the way producing all of
this is to build a deep neural network

1344
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:13,800
this is to build a deep neural network
 

1345
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,650
this is to build a deep neural network
and trained it on this data and see how

1346
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:15,660
and trained it on this data and see how
 

1347
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:17,510
and trained it on this data and see how
it ends up representing all of this

1348
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:17,520
it ends up representing all of this
 

1349
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:21,350
it ends up representing all of this
richness so the way that deep learning

1350
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:21,360
richness so the way that deep learning
 

1351
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,870
richness so the way that deep learning
was deployed in cognitive psychology was

1352
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:23,880
was deployed in cognitive psychology was
 

1353
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:26,750
was deployed in cognitive psychology was
that was the spirit of it it was about

1354
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:26,760
that was the spirit of it it was about
 

1355
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:30,200
that was the spirit of it it was about
that richness and that's something that

1356
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:30,210
that richness and that's something that
 

1357
00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:31,640
that richness and that's something that

the significance of a Turing machine is
 

1453
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:43,150
the significance of a Turing machine is
is that it's a machine emulator it's it

1454
00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:43,160
is that it's a machine emulator it's it

that to me you know that that and it was

this line you drew mmm is is is there
 

1493
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:38,830
this line you drew mmm is is is there
any magic in there or is it just basic

any magic in there or is it just basic
 

1495
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:41,710
any magic in there or is it just basic
computation I'm happy to think of it as

1498
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:44,200
just basic computation but mind you I

the monkeys touch the yeah like that's
 

1579
00:35:22,369 --> 00:35:24,579
the monkeys touch the yeah like that's
the magical moment I think Eva Hari

00:35:24,589 --> 00:35:28,509
the magical moment I think Eva Hari
argues that the ability of our large

converge towards idea together like you

1586
00:35:32,109 --> 00:35:32,119
converge towards idea together like you
 

1587

00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:34,700
said shaking and bumping elbows somehow
 

1589
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:38,410

converge like without even like like

00:35:38,410 --> 00:35:38,420
converge like without even like like
 

1591
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:40,120

without you know without being in a room
 

1593
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:41,680
without you know without being in a room
all together just kind of this like

1594
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:41,690
all together just kind of this like
 

1595
00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:44,229
all together just kind of this like
distributed convergence towards an idea

1596

distributed convergence towards an idea
 

1597
00:35:44,239 --> 00:35:45,970
distributed convergence towards an idea
yeah over a particular period of time

1598
00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:45,980
yeah over a particular period of time
 

1599
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:51,039
yeah over a particular period of time

about reward but it seems like we don't

1606
00:35:57,819 --> 00:35:57,829
about reward but it seems like we don't
 

1607
00:35:57,829 --> 00:36:00,039
about reward but it seems like we don't
really have a clear objective function

1608
00:36:00,039 --> 00:36:00,049
really have a clear objective function
 

1609
00:36:00,049 --> 00:36:02,019
really have a clear objective function
under which we operate but we all kind

1610
00:36:02,019 --> 00:36:02,029
under which we operate but we all kind
 

1611
00:36:02,029 --> 00:36:04,420
under which we operate but we all kind
of converge towards one somehow and that

of converge towards one somehow and that

00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:06,359

that to me has always been a mystery
 

1615
00:36:06,369 --> 00:36:10,059

also understanding AI systems but I

also understanding AI systems but I
 

1619
00:36:14,059 --> 00:36:16,599
also understanding AI systems but I
guess I guess that's the next step the

I just I'm sort of stuck on the notion

00:36:58,519 --> 00:36:58,529
I just I'm sort of stuck on the notion
 

1653
00:36:58,529 --> 00:37:00,739
I just I'm sort of stuck on the notion
that the basic unit that we want to

00:37:00,739 --> 00:37:00,749
that the basic unit that we want to
 

1655
00:37:00,749 --> 00:37:03,079
that the basic unit that we want to
understand is individual humans and if

00:37:03,079 --> 00:37:03,089
understand is individual humans and if
 

1657

understand is individual humans and if
if we have to understand that in the

if we have to understand that in the
 

1659
00:37:06,059 --> 00:37:09,529
if we have to understand that in the
context of other humans fine but for me

1660
00:37:09,529 --> 00:37:09,539
context of other humans fine but for me

that could be the reduction is dream of

there's multiple intelligences when

00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:36,170
there's multiple intelligences when
there's multiple sort of it's a sad

00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:36,180
there's multiple sort of it's a sad
 

1683
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:38,690
there's multiple sort of it's a sad
thing if that's true because it's very

1684
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:38,700
thing if that's true because it's very
 

1685
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:41,599
thing if that's true because it's very
difficult to study but if it's just one

1686
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:41,609
difficult to study but if it's just one
 

1687
00:37:41,609 --> 00:37:44,329
difficult to study but if it's just one
human that one human will not be Homo

1688

1693

that's a real that's a possibility I I'm
with you well one thing I will say along

1694
00:37:51,410 --> 00:37:51,420
with you well one thing I will say along
 

1695
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:58,940
with you well one thing I will say along
these lines is that I think I think a

1696
00:37:58,940 --> 00:37:58,950
these lines is that I think I think a
 

1697
00:37:58,950 --> 00:38:02,359
these lines is that I think I think a
serious effort to understand human

serious effort to understand human
 

1699
00:38:02,369 --> 00:38:08,059
serious effort to understand human
intelligence and maybe to build a

intelligence and maybe to build a
 

1701
00:38:08,069 --> 00:38:10,579
intelligence and maybe to build a
human-like intelligence needs to pay

1702
00:38:10,579 --> 00:38:10,589
human-like intelligence needs to pay
 

1703
00:38:10,589 --> 00:38:12,289
human-like intelligence needs to pay
just as much attention to the structure

that's one thing I took away actually
 

1713
00:38:24,450 --> 00:38:27,709

00:39:00,569 --> 00:39:02,640
made most clear and reinforcement
learning where I simulate an environment

1742
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:02,650
learning where I simulate an environment
 

1743
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:05,040
learning where I simulate an environment
as you can only learn as much as you can

1744
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:05,050
as you can only learn as much as you can
 

1745
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:07,980
as you can only learn as much as you can
simulate and that's what made well deep

1746
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:07,990
simulate and that's what made well deep
 

1747
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:09,750
simulate and that's what made well deep
mine made very clear well the other

1748
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:09,760
mine made very clear well the other
 

1749
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,850
mine made very clear well the other
aspect of the environment which is the

1750
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:11,860
aspect of the environment which is the
 

1751
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:15,480
aspect of the environment which is the
self play mechanism of the other agent

1752
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:15,490
self play mechanism of the other agent
 

1753
00:39:15,490 --> 00:39:17,550
self play mechanism of the other agent
of the competitive behavior which the

1754
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:17,560
of the competitive behavior which the
 

1755
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:18,930
of the competitive behavior which the
other agent becomes the environment

1756
00:39:18,930 --> 00:39:18,940
other agent becomes the environment
 

1757
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:21,720
other agent becomes the environment
essentially yeah and that's I mean one

1758
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:21,730
essentially yeah and that's I mean one
 

1759
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:24,180
essentially yeah and that's I mean one
of the most exciting ideas in AI is the

1760
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:24,190
of the most exciting ideas in AI is the
 

1761
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:27,120
of the most exciting ideas in AI is the
self play mechanism that's able to learn

1762
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:27,130
self play mechanism that's able to learn
 

1763
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:28,830
self play mechanism that's able to learn
successfully so there you go there's a

1764
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:28,840
successfully so there you go there's a
 

1765
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,990
successfully so there you go there's a
there's a thing where competition is

1766
00:39:30,990 --> 00:39:31,000
there's a thing where competition is
 

1767
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,750
there's a thing where competition is
essential for yeah earning yeah at least

1768
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:33,760
essential for yeah earning yeah at least
 

1769
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,910
essential for yeah earning yeah at least
in that context so if we can step back

1770
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:35,920
in that context so if we can step back
 

1771
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,310
in that context so if we can step back
into another beautiful world which is

1772
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:38,320
into another beautiful world which is
 

1773
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:42,960
into another beautiful world which is
the actual mechanics the dirty mess of

1774
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:42,970
the actual mechanics the dirty mess of
 

1775
00:39:42,970 --> 00:39:45,320
the actual mechanics the dirty mess of
it of the human brain is is there

1776
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:45,330
it of the human brain is is there
 

1777
00:39:45,330 --> 00:39:48,590
it of the human brain is is there
something for people who might not know

1778
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:48,600
something for people who might not know
 

1779
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:51,660
something for people who might not know
is there something in common or describe

1780
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:51,670
is there something in common or describe
 

1781
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:54,180
is there something in common or describe
the key parts of the brain that are

1782
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:54,190
the key parts of the brain that are
 

1783
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:55,950
the key parts of the brain that are
important for intelligence or just in

1784
00:39:55,950 --> 00:39:55,960
important for intelligence or just in
 

1785
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:58,260
important for intelligence or just in
general what are the different parts of

1786
00:39:58,260 --> 00:39:58,270
general what are the different parts of
 

1787
00:39:58,270 --> 00:39:59,760
general what are the different parts of
the brain that you're curious about that

1788
00:39:59,760 --> 00:39:59,770
the brain that you're curious about that
 

1789
00:39:59,770 --> 00:40:03,420
the brain that you're curious about that
you've studied and that are just good to

1790
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:03,430
you've studied and that are just good to
 

1791
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:04,470
you've studied and that are just good to

know about when you're thinking about
 

1793
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:10,020
know about when you're thinking about
cognition well my area of expertise if I

1794
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:10,030
cognition well my area of expertise if I
 

1795
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:15,960
cognition well my area of expertise if I
have one is prefrontal cortex so what's

1796
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:15,970
have one is prefrontal cortex so what's
 

1797
00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:18,990
have one is prefrontal cortex so what's
that or do we it depends on who you ask

1798
00:40:18,990 --> 00:40:19,000
that or do we it depends on who you ask
 

1799
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,350
that or do we it depends on who you ask
the the the the the technical definition

1800
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:22,360
the the the the the technical definition
 

1801
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:27,300
the the the the the technical definition
is has is anatomical it there are there

1802
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:27,310
is has is anatomical it there are there
 

1803
00:40:27,310 --> 00:40:30,840
is has is anatomical it there are there
are parts of your brain that are

1804
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:30,850
are parts of your brain that are
 

1805
00:40:30,850 --> 00:40:32,610
are parts of your brain that are
responsible for motor behavior and

1806
00:40:32,610 --> 00:40:32,620
responsible for motor behavior and
 

1807
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:37,800
responsible for motor behavior and
they're very easy to identify and the

1808
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:37,810
they're very easy to identify and the
 

1809
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:40,950
they're very easy to identify and the
region of your cerebral cortex they out

1810
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:40,960
region of your cerebral cortex they out
 

1811
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,470
region of your cerebral cortex they out
needs sort of outer crust of your brain

1812
00:40:43,470 --> 00:40:43,480
needs sort of outer crust of your brain
 

1813
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:47,700
needs sort of outer crust of your brain
that lies in front of those is defined

1814
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:47,710
that lies in front of those is defined
 

1815
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:49,620
that lies in front of those is defined
as the prefrontal cortex and when you

1816
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:49,630
as the prefrontal cortex and when you
 

1817
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:51,750
as the prefrontal cortex and when you
say anatomical sorry to interrupt

1818
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:51,760
say anatomical sorry to interrupt
 

1819
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:55,100
say anatomical sorry to interrupt
so that's referring to sort of the

1820
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:55,110
so that's referring to sort of the
 

1821
00:40:55,110 --> 00:40:57,810
so that's referring to sort of the
geographic region yeah as opposed to

1822
00:40:57,810 --> 00:40:57,820
geographic region yeah as opposed to
 

1823
00:40:57,820 --> 00:40:59,790
geographic region yeah as opposed to
some kind of functional definition

1824
00:40:59,790 --> 00:40:59,800
some kind of functional definition
 

1825
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:02,610
some kind of functional definition
exactly so that it this is kind of the

1826
00:41:02,610 --> 00:41:02,620
exactly so that it this is kind of the
 

1827
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:04,770
exactly so that it this is kind of the
coward's way out and I'm telling you

1828
00:41:04,770 --> 00:41:04,780
coward's way out and I'm telling you
 

1829
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:06,510
coward's way out and I'm telling you
what the prefrontal cortex is just in

1830
00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:06,520
what the prefrontal cortex is just in
 

1831
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:07,980
what the prefrontal cortex is just in
terms of like what part of the

1832
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:07,990
terms of like what part of the
 

1833
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:10,200
terms of like what part of the
real-estate it occupies the thing in the

1834
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:10,210
real-estate it occupies the thing in the
 

1835
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:12,390
real-estate it occupies the thing in the
front of them yeah exactly and and in

1836
00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:12,400
front of them yeah exactly and and in
 

1837
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:16,059
front of them yeah exactly and and in
fact the early history of

1838
00:41:16,059 --> 00:41:16,069
fact the early history of
 

1839
00:41:16,069 --> 00:41:19,750
fact the early history of
you know the neuroscientific

1840
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:19,760
you know the neuroscientific
 

1841
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:22,250
you know the neuroscientific
investigation of what this like front

1842
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:22,260
investigation of what this like front
 

1843
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:25,339
investigation of what this like front
part of the brain does is sort of funny

1844
00:41:25,339 --> 00:41:25,349
part of the brain does is sort of funny
 

1845
00:41:25,349 --> 00:41:30,319
part of the brain does is sort of funny
to read because you know it was really

1846
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:30,329
to read because you know it was really
 

1847
00:41:30,329 --> 00:41:33,589
to read because you know it was really
it was really World War one that started

1848
00:41:33,589 --> 00:41:33,599
it was really World War one that started
 

1849
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:35,000
it was really World War one that started
people down this road of trying to

1850
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:35,010
people down this road of trying to
 

1851
00:41:35,010 --> 00:41:36,410
people down this road of trying to
figure out what different parts of the

1852
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:36,420
figure out what different parts of the
 

1853
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:39,319
figure out what different parts of the
brain the human brain do in the sense

1854
00:41:39,319 --> 00:41:39,329
brain the human brain do in the sense
 

1855
00:41:39,329 --> 00:41:41,779
brain the human brain do in the sense
that there were a lot of people with

1856
00:41:41,779 --> 00:41:41,789
that there were a lot of people with
 

1857
00:41:41,789 --> 00:41:43,670
that there were a lot of people with
brain damage who came back from the war

1858
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:43,680
brain damage who came back from the war
 

1859
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:46,099
brain damage who came back from the war
with brain damage and it that provided

1860
00:41:46,099 --> 00:41:46,109
with brain damage and it that provided
 

1861
00:41:46,109 --> 00:41:48,589
with brain damage and it that provided
as tragic as that was it provided an

1862
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:48,599
as tragic as that was it provided an
 

1863
00:41:48,599 --> 00:41:50,329
as tragic as that was it provided an
opportunity for scientists to try to

1864
00:41:50,329 --> 00:41:50,339
opportunity for scientists to try to
 

1865
00:41:50,339 --> 00:41:52,640
opportunity for scientists to try to
identify the functions of different

1866
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:52,650
identify the functions of different
 

1867
00:41:52,650 --> 00:41:54,680
identify the functions of different
brain regions and it wasn't actually

1868
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:54,690
brain regions and it wasn't actually
 

1869
00:41:54,690 --> 00:41:56,960
brain regions and it wasn't actually
incredibly productive but one of the

1870
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:56,970
incredibly productive but one of the
 

1871
00:41:56,970 --> 00:41:59,299
incredibly productive but one of the
frustrations that neuropsychologist face

1872
00:41:59,299 --> 00:41:59,309
frustrations that neuropsychologist face
 

1873
00:41:59,309 --> 00:42:01,089
frustrations that neuropsychologist face
was they couldn't really identify

1874
00:42:01,089 --> 00:42:01,099
was they couldn't really identify
 

1875
00:42:01,099 --> 00:42:04,309
was they couldn't really identify
exactly what the deficit was that arose

1876
00:42:04,309 --> 00:42:04,319
exactly what the deficit was that arose
 

1877
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:06,589
exactly what the deficit was that arose
from damage to this these most you know

1878
00:42:06,589 --> 00:42:06,599
from damage to this these most you know
 

1879
00:42:06,599 --> 00:42:08,329
from damage to this these most you know
kind of frontal parts of the brain it

1880
00:42:08,329 --> 00:42:08,339
kind of frontal parts of the brain it
 

1881
00:42:08,339 --> 00:42:10,849
kind of frontal parts of the brain it
was just a very difficult thing to you

1882
00:42:10,849 --> 00:42:10,859
was just a very difficult thing to you
 

1883
00:42:10,859 --> 00:42:13,940
was just a very difficult thing to you
know to you know to pin down there were

1884
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:13,950
know to you know to pin down there were
 

1885
00:42:13,950 --> 00:42:16,900
know to you know to pin down there were
a couple of neuropsychologists who

1886
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:16,910
a couple of neuropsychologists who
 

1887
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:20,240
a couple of neuropsychologists who
identified through through a large

1888
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:20,250
identified through through a large
 

1889
00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:21,829
identified through through a large
amount of clinical experience in close

1890
00:42:21,829 --> 00:42:21,839
amount of clinical experience in close
 

1891
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:24,920
amount of clinical experience in close
observation they started to put their

1892
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:24,930
observation they started to put their
 

1893
00:42:24,930 --> 00:42:26,720
observation they started to put their
finger on a syndrome that was associated

1894
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:26,730
finger on a syndrome that was associated
 

1895
00:42:26,730 --> 00:42:28,250
finger on a syndrome that was associated
with frontal damage actually one of them

1896
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:28,260
with frontal damage actually one of them
 

1897
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:30,559
with frontal damage actually one of them
was a russian neuropsychologist named

1898
00:42:30,559 --> 00:42:30,569
was a russian neuropsychologist named
 

1899
00:42:30,569 --> 00:42:33,380
was a russian neuropsychologist named
Gloria who you know students of

1900
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:33,390
Gloria who you know students of
 

1901
00:42:33,390 --> 00:42:36,559
Gloria who you know students of
cognitive psychology still read and and

1902
00:42:36,559 --> 00:42:36,569
cognitive psychology still read and and
 

1903
00:42:36,569 --> 00:42:40,549
cognitive psychology still read and and
what he started to figure out was that

1904
00:42:40,549 --> 00:42:40,559
what he started to figure out was that
 

1905
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:43,190
what he started to figure out was that
the frontal cortex was somehow involved

1906
00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:43,200
the frontal cortex was somehow involved
 

1907
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:49,400
the frontal cortex was somehow involved
in flexibility the in in in guiding

1908
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:49,410
in flexibility the in in in guiding
 

1909
00:42:49,410 --> 00:42:52,400
in flexibility the in in in guiding
behaviors that required someone to

1910
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:52,410
behaviors that required someone to
 

1911
00:42:52,410 --> 00:42:55,789
behaviors that required someone to
override a habit or to do something

1912
00:42:55,789 --> 00:42:55,799
override a habit or to do something
 

1913
00:42:55,799 --> 00:42:58,910
override a habit or to do something
unusual or to change what they were

1914
00:42:58,910 --> 00:42:58,920
unusual or to change what they were
 

1915
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:01,279
unusual or to change what they were
doing in a very flexible way from one

1916
00:43:01,279 --> 00:43:01,289
doing in a very flexible way from one
 

1917
00:43:01,289 --> 00:43:03,799
doing in a very flexible way from one
moment to another so focused on like new

1918
00:43:03,799 --> 00:43:03,809
moment to another so focused on like new
 

1919
00:43:03,809 --> 00:43:07,099
moment to another so focused on like new
experiences and so the so the way your

1920
00:43:07,099 --> 00:43:07,109
experiences and so the so the way your
 

1921
00:43:07,109 --> 00:43:09,950
experiences and so the so the way your
brain processes and acts in new

1922
00:43:09,950 --> 00:43:09,960
brain processes and acts in new
 

1923
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:13,730
brain processes and acts in new
experiences yeah what later helped bring

1924
00:43:13,730 --> 00:43:13,740
experiences yeah what later helped bring
 

1925
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:16,640
experiences yeah what later helped bring
this function into better focus was a

1926
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:16,650
this function into better focus was a
 

1927
00:43:16,650 --> 00:43:18,859
this function into better focus was a
distinction between controlled and

1928
00:43:18,859 --> 00:43:18,869
distinction between controlled and
 

1929
00:43:18,869 --> 00:43:21,769
distinction between controlled and
automatic behavior or - in in other

1930
00:43:21,769 --> 00:43:21,779
automatic behavior or - in in other
 

1931
00:43:21,779 --> 00:43:24,160
automatic behavior or - in in other
literature's this is referred to as

1932
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:24,170
literature's this is referred to as
 

1933
00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:26,870
literature's this is referred to as
habitual behavior versus goal directed

1934
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:26,880
habitual behavior versus goal directed
 

1935
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:29,780
habitual behavior versus goal directed
behavior so it's very

1936
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:29,790
behavior so it's very
 

1937
00:43:29,790 --> 00:43:33,530
behavior so it's very
very clear that the human brain has

1938
00:43:33,530 --> 00:43:33,540
very clear that the human brain has
 

1939
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:36,710
very clear that the human brain has
pathways that are dedicated to habits to

1940
00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:36,720
pathways that are dedicated to habits to
 

1941
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:39,830
pathways that are dedicated to habits to
things that you do all the time and they

1942
00:43:39,830 --> 00:43:39,840
things that you do all the time and they
 

1943
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:43,730
things that you do all the time and they
need to be autumn at they don't require

1944
00:43:43,730 --> 00:43:43,740
need to be autumn at they don't require
 

1945
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:45,800
need to be autumn at they don't require
you to concentrate too much so the that

1946
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:45,810
you to concentrate too much so the that
 

1947
00:43:45,810 --> 00:43:48,170
you to concentrate too much so the that
leaves your cognitive capacity freed you

1948
00:43:48,170 --> 00:43:48,180
leaves your cognitive capacity freed you
 

1949
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:51,230
leaves your cognitive capacity freed you
do other things just think about the

1950
00:43:51,230 --> 00:43:51,240
do other things just think about the
 

1951
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:54,830
do other things just think about the
difference between driving when you're

1952
00:43:54,830 --> 00:43:54,840
difference between driving when you're
 

1953
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:56,930
difference between driving when you're
learning to drive versus driving after

1954
00:43:56,930 --> 00:43:56,940
learning to drive versus driving after
 

1955
00:43:56,940 --> 00:44:00,950

you're fairly expert there are brain

1956
00:44:00,950 --> 00:44:00,960
you're fairly expert there are brain
 

1957
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:03,910

frequently performed behaviors so that

1960
00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:08,160
frequently performed behaviors so that
 

1961
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:11,120
frequently performed behaviors so that
they can be habits so that they can be

1962
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:11,130
they can be habits so that they can be
 

1963
00:44:11,130 --> 00:44:12,890
they can be habits so that they can be
automatic for that that's kind of like

1964
00:44:12,890 --> 00:44:12,900
automatic for that that's kind of like
 

1965
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:14,390
automatic for that that's kind of like
the purest form of learning

1966
00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:14,400
the purest form of learning
 

1967
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,940
the purest form of learning
I guess it's happening there which is

1968
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:16,950
I guess it's happening there which is
 

1969
00:44:16,950 --> 00:44:19,850
I guess it's happening there which is
why I mean this is kind of jumping ahead

1970
00:44:19,850 --> 00:44:19,860
why I mean this is kind of jumping ahead
 

1971
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:21,530
why I mean this is kind of jumping ahead
which is why that perhaps is the most

1972
00:44:21,530 --> 00:44:21,540
which is why that perhaps is the most
 

1973
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:23,720
which is why that perhaps is the most
useful for us to focusing on and trying

interesting I I do think about this

1980
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:29,550
interesting I I do think about this
 

1981
00:44:29,550 --> 00:44:30,950
interesting I I do think about this

00:45:09,290 --> 00:45:09,300
you to say well what I usually do in

you to say well what I usually do in
this situation is acts but given the

the elbow bump is a great example right

2012
00:45:17,180 --> 00:45:17,190
the elbow bump is a great example right
 

2013
00:45:17,190 --> 00:45:18,980
the elbow bump is a great example right
if you know reaching out and shaking

2014
00:45:18,980 --> 00:45:18,990
if you know reaching out and shaking
 

2015
00:45:18,990 --> 00:45:21,980
if you know reaching out and shaking
hands is a probably habitual behavior

2016
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:21,990
hands is a probably habitual behavior
 

2017
00:45:21,990 --> 00:45:25,430
hands is a probably habitual behavior
and it's the prefrontal cortex that

2018
00:45:25,430 --> 00:45:25,440
and it's the prefrontal cortex that
 

2019
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:28,010
and it's the prefrontal cortex that
allows us to bear in mind that there's

2020
00:45:28,010 --> 00:45:28,020
allows us to bear in mind that there's
 

2021
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:29,480
allows us to bear in mind that there's
something unusual going on right now

00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:29,490
something unusual going on right now
 

2023
00:45:29,490 --> 00:45:32,360
something unusual going on right now
and in this situation I need to not do

2024
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:32,370
and in this situation I need to not do
 

2025
00:45:32,370 --> 00:45:36,200
and in this situation I need to not do
the usual thing the kind of behaviors

2026
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:36,210
the usual thing the kind of behaviors

00:45:36,210 --> 00:45:39,800
the usual thing the kind of behaviors
that Luria reported and he built tests

this so in other words when I stick out

2034
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:45,710
this so in other words when I stick out
 

2035
00:45:45,710 --> 00:45:49,000
this so in other words when I stick out
my hand I want you instead to present

your elbow a patient with frontal damage
 

2039
00:45:51,050 --> 00:45:52,270
your elbow a patient with frontal damage
would have great deal of trouble with

2040
00:45:52,270 --> 00:45:52,280
would have great deal of trouble with
 

2041
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:54,460
would have great deal of trouble with
that you know somebody preferring their

that you know somebody preferring their
 

2043
00:45:54,470 --> 00:45:57,960
that you know somebody preferring their
hand would elicit you know a handshake

2044
00:45:57,960 --> 00:45:57,970
hand would elicit you know a handshake
 

2045
00:45:57,970 --> 00:46:00,370
hand would elicit you know a handshake
the prefrontal cortex is what allows us

2046
00:46:00,370 --> 00:46:00,380
the prefrontal cortex is what allows us
 

2047
00:46:00,380 --> 00:46:02,770
the prefrontal cortex is what allows us
to say oh no hold on that's the usual

2048
00:46:02,770 --> 00:46:02,780
to say oh no hold on that's the usual
 

2049
00:46:02,780 --> 00:46:06,490
to say oh no hold on that's the usual
thing but I'm I have the ability to bear

2050
00:46:06,490 --> 00:46:06,500
thing but I'm I have the ability to bear
 

2051
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:08,950
thing but I'm I have the ability to bear
in mind even very unusual contexts and

2052
00:46:08,950 --> 00:46:08,960
in mind even very unusual contexts and
 

2053
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:11,290
in mind even very unusual contexts and

00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:14,320
to reason about what behavior is
appropriate there just to get a sense is

2056
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:14,330
appropriate there just to get a sense is
 

2057
00:46:14,330 --> 00:46:18,310
appropriate there just to get a sense is
our us humans special in the presence of

2058
00:46:18,310 --> 00:46:18,320
our us humans special in the presence of
 

2059
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:21,490
our us humans special in the presence of
the prefrontal cortex do mice have a

2060
00:46:21,490 --> 00:46:21,500
the prefrontal cortex do mice have a
 

2061
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:24,010
the prefrontal cortex do mice have a
prefrontal cortex do other mammals that

2062
00:46:24,010 --> 00:46:24,020
prefrontal cortex do other mammals that
 

2063
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:28,150
prefrontal cortex do other mammals that
we can study if you if no then how do

2064
00:46:28,150 --> 00:46:28,160
we can study if you if no then how do
 

2065
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:30,280
we can study if you if no then how do
they integrate new experiences yeah

2066
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:30,290
they integrate new experiences yeah
 

2067
00:46:30,290 --> 00:46:33,610
they integrate new experiences yeah
that's a that's a really tricky question

2068
00:46:33,610 --> 00:46:33,620
that's a that's a really tricky question
 

2069
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:37,930
that's a that's a really tricky question
and a very timely question because we

2070
00:46:37,930 --> 00:46:37,940
and a very timely question because we
 

2071
00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:45,960
and a very timely question because we
have revolutionary new technologies for

2072
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:45,970
have revolutionary new technologies for
 

2073
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:50,020
have revolutionary new technologies for
monitoring measuring and also causally

2074
00:46:50,020 --> 00:46:50,030
monitoring measuring and also causally
 

2075
00:46:50,030 --> 00:46:54,540
monitoring measuring and also causally
influencing neural behavior in mice and

2076
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:54,550
influencing neural behavior in mice and
 

2077
00:46:54,550 --> 00:46:59,100
influencing neural behavior in mice and
fruit flies and these techniques are not

2078
00:46:59,100 --> 00:46:59,110
fruit flies and these techniques are not
 

2079
00:46:59,110 --> 00:47:03,580
fruit flies and these techniques are not
fully available even for studying brain

2080
00:47:03,580 --> 00:47:03,590
fully available even for studying brain
 

2081
00:47:03,590 --> 00:47:07,050
fully available even for studying brain
function in in monkeys let alone humans

2082
00:47:07,050 --> 00:47:07,060
function in in monkeys let alone humans
 

2083
00:47:07,060 --> 00:47:12,280
function in in monkeys let alone humans
and so it's a it's a very sort of for me

2084
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:12,290
and so it's a it's a very sort of for me
 

2085
00:47:12,290 --> 00:47:14,520
and so it's a it's a very sort of for me
at least a very urgent question whether

2086
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:14,530
at least a very urgent question whether
 

2087
00:47:14,530 --> 00:47:16,510
at least a very urgent question whether
the kinds of things that we want to

2088
00:47:16,510 --> 00:47:16,520
the kinds of things that we want to
 

2089
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:18,130
the kinds of things that we want to
understand about human intelligence can

2090
00:47:18,130 --> 00:47:18,140
understand about human intelligence can
 

2091
00:47:18,140 --> 00:47:22,890
understand about human intelligence can
be pursued in these other organisms and

2092
00:47:22,890 --> 00:47:22,900
be pursued in these other organisms and
 

2093
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:25,510
be pursued in these other organisms and
you know to put it briefly there's

2094
00:47:25,510 --> 00:47:25,520
you know to put it briefly there's
 

2095
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:27,540
you know to put it briefly there's
disagreement

2096
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:27,550
disagreement
 

2097
00:47:27,550 --> 00:47:31,270
disagreement
you know people who study fruit flies

2098
00:47:31,270 --> 00:47:31,280
you know people who study fruit flies
 

2099
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:33,760
you know people who study fruit flies
will often tell you hey root flies are

2100
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:33,770
will often tell you hey root flies are
 

2101
00:47:33,770 --> 00:47:35,170
will often tell you hey root flies are
smarter than you think

2102
00:47:35,170 --> 00:47:35,180
smarter than you think
 

2103
00:47:35,180 --> 00:47:36,970
smarter than you think
and they'll point to experiments where

2104
00:47:36,970 --> 00:47:36,980
and they'll point to experiments where
 

2105
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:39,070
and they'll point to experiments where
fruit flies were able to learn new

2106
00:47:39,070 --> 00:47:39,080
fruit flies were able to learn new
 

2107
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:41,820
fruit flies were able to learn new
behaviors we're able to generalize from

2108
00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:41,830
behaviors we're able to generalize from
 

2109
00:47:41,830 --> 00:47:44,800
behaviors we're able to generalize from
one stimulus to another in a way that

2110
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:44,810
one stimulus to another in a way that
 

2111
00:47:44,810 --> 00:47:47,260
one stimulus to another in a way that
suggests that they have abstractions

2112
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:47,270
suggests that they have abstractions
 

2113
00:47:47,270 --> 00:47:52,180
suggests that they have abstractions
that guide their generalization I've had

2114
00:47:52,180 --> 00:47:52,190
that guide their generalization I've had
 

2115
00:47:52,190 --> 00:47:54,220
that guide their generalization I've had
many conversations in which

2116
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:54,230
many conversations in which
 

2117
00:47:54,230 --> 00:47:57,900
many conversations in which
I will start by observing you know

2118
00:47:57,900 --> 00:47:57,910
I will start by observing you know
 

2119
00:47:57,910 --> 00:48:03,910
I will start by observing you know
recounting some some observation about

2120
00:48:03,910 --> 00:48:03,920
recounting some some observation about
 

2121
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:07,150
recounting some some observation about
Mouse behavior where it seemed like mice

2122
00:48:07,150 --> 00:48:07,160
Mouse behavior where it seemed like mice
 

2123
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:09,160
Mouse behavior where it seemed like mice
were taking an awfully long time to

2124
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:09,170
were taking an awfully long time to
 

2125
00:48:09,170 --> 00:48:11,280
were taking an awfully long time to
learn a task that for a human would be

2126
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:11,290
learn a task that for a human would be
 

2127
00:48:11,290 --> 00:48:15,700
learn a task that for a human would be
profoundly trivial and I will conclude

2128
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:15,710
profoundly trivial and I will conclude
 

2129
00:48:15,710 --> 00:48:17,500
profoundly trivial and I will conclude
from that that mice really don't have

2130
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:17,510
from that that mice really don't have
 

2131
00:48:17,510 --> 00:48:19,270
from that that mice really don't have
the cognitive flexibility that we want

2132
00:48:19,270 --> 00:48:19,280
the cognitive flexibility that we want
 

2133
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:21,070
the cognitive flexibility that we want
to explain and that a mouse researcher

2134
00:48:21,070 --> 00:48:21,080
to explain and that a mouse researcher
 

2135
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:23,849
to explain and that a mouse researcher
will say to me well you know hold on

2136
00:48:23,849 --> 00:48:23,859
will say to me well you know hold on
 

2137
00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:26,140
will say to me well you know hold on
that experiment may not have worked

2138
00:48:26,140 --> 00:48:26,150
that experiment may not have worked
 

2139
00:48:26,150 --> 00:48:30,120
that experiment may not have worked
because you asked a mouse to deal with

2140
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:30,130
because you asked a mouse to deal with
 

2141
00:48:30,130 --> 00:48:32,380
because you asked a mouse to deal with
stimuli and behaviors that were very

2142
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:32,390
stimuli and behaviors that were very
 

2143
00:48:32,390 --> 00:48:35,710
stimuli and behaviors that were very
unnatural for the mouse if instead you

2144
00:48:35,710 --> 00:48:35,720
unnatural for the mouse if instead you
 

2145
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:38,050
unnatural for the mouse if instead you
kept the logic of the experiment the

2146
00:48:38,050 --> 00:48:38,060
kept the logic of the experiment the
 

2147
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:40,930
kept the logic of the experiment the
same but put you know kind of put it in

2148
00:48:40,930 --> 00:48:40,940
same but put you know kind of put it in
 

2149
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:43,510
same but put you know kind of put it in
a you know presented it the information

2150
00:48:43,510 --> 00:48:43,520
a you know presented it the information
 

2151
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:46,120
a you know presented it the information
in a way that aligns with what mice are

2152
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:46,130
in a way that aligns with what mice are
 

2153
00:48:46,130 --> 00:48:47,230
in a way that aligns with what mice are
used to dealing with in their natural

2154
00:48:47,230 --> 00:48:47,240
used to dealing with in their natural
 

2155
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:49,570
used to dealing with in their natural
habitats you might find that a mouse

2156
00:48:49,570 --> 00:48:49,580
habitats you might find that a mouse
 

2157
00:48:49,580 --> 00:48:51,340
habitats you might find that a mouse
actually has more intelligence than you

2158
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:51,350
actually has more intelligence than you
 

2159
00:48:51,350 --> 00:48:53,730
actually has more intelligence than you
think and then they'll go on to show you

2160
00:48:53,730 --> 00:48:53,740
think and then they'll go on to show you
 

2161
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:56,349
think and then they'll go on to show you
videos of mice doing things in their

2162
00:48:56,349 --> 00:48:56,359
videos of mice doing things in their
 

2163
00:48:56,359 --> 00:48:58,930
videos of mice doing things in their
natural habitat which seem strikingly

2164
00:48:58,930 --> 00:48:58,940
natural habitat which seem strikingly
 

2165
00:48:58,940 --> 00:49:00,760
natural habitat which seem strikingly
intelligent you know dealing with you

2166
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:00,770
intelligent you know dealing with you
 

2167
00:49:00,770 --> 00:49:03,130
intelligent you know dealing with you
know physical problems you know I have

2168
00:49:03,130 --> 00:49:03,140
know physical problems you know I have
 

2169
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:05,050
know physical problems you know I have
to drag this piece of food back to my

2170
00:49:05,050 --> 00:49:05,060
to drag this piece of food back to my
 

2171
00:49:05,060 --> 00:49:07,480
to drag this piece of food back to my
you know back to my lair but there's

2172
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:07,490
you know back to my lair but there's
 

2173
00:49:07,490 --> 00:49:09,370
you know back to my lair but there's
something in my way and how do I get rid

2174
00:49:09,370 --> 00:49:09,380
something in my way and how do I get rid
 

2175
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:12,160
something in my way and how do I get rid
of that thing so I think I think these

2176
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:12,170
of that thing so I think I think these
 

2177
00:49:12,170 --> 00:49:14,230
of that thing so I think I think these
are open questions to put it you know to

2178
00:49:14,230 --> 00:49:14,240
are open questions to put it you know to
 

2179
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:16,780
are open questions to put it you know to
sum that up and then taking a small step

2180
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:16,790
sum that up and then taking a small step
 

2181
00:49:16,790 --> 00:49:19,030
sum that up and then taking a small step
back so related to that is you kind of

2182
00:49:19,030 --> 00:49:19,040
back so related to that is you kind of
 

2183
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:21,400
back so related to that is you kind of
mentioned we're taking a little shortcut

2184
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:21,410
mentioned we're taking a little shortcut
 

2185
00:49:21,410 --> 00:49:23,890
mentioned we're taking a little shortcut
by saying it's a geographic geographic

2186
00:49:23,890 --> 00:49:23,900
by saying it's a geographic geographic

00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:26,710
by saying it's a geographic geographic

00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:29,620
part of the the prefrontal cortex is a

kind of does everything and is

00:49:51,619 --> 00:49:55,210
kind of does everything and is
impossible to disentangle them I think

impossible to disentangle them I think
there's overwhelming evidence that

2212
00:49:57,190 --> 00:49:57,200
there's overwhelming evidence that
 

2213
00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:00,370
there's overwhelming evidence that
there's functional differentiation that

2214
00:50:00,370 --> 00:50:00,380
there's functional differentiation that
 

2215
00:50:00,380 --> 00:50:04,720
there's functional differentiation that
it's clearly not the case that all parts

2216
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:04,730
it's clearly not the case that all parts
 

2217
00:50:04,730 --> 00:50:06,829
it's clearly not the case that all parts
of the brain are doing the same thing

2218
00:50:06,829 --> 00:50:06,839
of the brain are doing the same thing
 

2219
00:50:06,839 --> 00:50:09,709
of the brain are doing the same thing
this follows immediately from the kinds

2220
00:50:09,709 --> 00:50:09,719
this follows immediately from the kinds
 

2221
00:50:09,719 --> 00:50:12,709
this follows immediately from the kinds
of studies of brain damage that we were

2222
00:50:12,709 --> 00:50:12,719
of studies of brain damage that we were
 

2223
00:50:12,719 --> 00:50:17,029
of studies of brain damage that we were
chatting about before it's obvious from

2224
00:50:17,029 --> 00:50:17,039
chatting about before it's obvious from
 

2225
00:50:17,039 --> 00:50:18,799
chatting about before it's obvious from
what you see if you stick an electrode

2226
00:50:18,799 --> 00:50:18,809
what you see if you stick an electrode
 

2227
00:50:18,809 --> 00:50:21,109
what you see if you stick an electrode
in the brain and measure what's going on

2228
00:50:21,109 --> 00:50:21,119
in the brain and measure what's going on
 

2229
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:25,209
in the brain and measure what's going on
at the level of you neural activity

2230
00:50:25,209 --> 00:50:25,219
at the level of you neural activity
 

2231
00:50:25,219 --> 00:50:29,449
at the level of you neural activity
having said that there are two other

2232
00:50:29,449 --> 00:50:29,459
having said that there are two other
 

2233
00:50:29,459 --> 00:50:32,569
having said that there are two other
things to add which kind of I don't know

2234
00:50:32,569 --> 00:50:32,579
things to add which kind of I don't know
 

2235
00:50:32,579 --> 00:50:34,399
things to add which kind of I don't know
maybe tug in the other direction

2236
00:50:34,399 --> 00:50:34,409
maybe tug in the other direction
 

2237
00:50:34,409 --> 00:50:39,169
maybe tug in the other direction
one is that it's when you look carefully

2238
00:50:39,169 --> 00:50:39,179
one is that it's when you look carefully
 

2239
00:50:39,179 --> 00:50:41,329
one is that it's when you look carefully
at functional differentiation in the

2240
00:50:41,329 --> 00:50:41,339
at functional differentiation in the
 

2241
00:50:41,339 --> 00:50:44,890
at functional differentiation in the
brain what you usually end up concluding

2242
00:50:44,890 --> 00:50:44,900
brain what you usually end up concluding
 

2243
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:47,329
brain what you usually end up concluding
at least this is my observation of the

2244
00:50:47,329 --> 00:50:47,339
at least this is my observation of the
 

2245
00:50:47,339 --> 00:50:50,359
at least this is my observation of the
literature is that the the differences

2246
00:50:50,359 --> 00:50:50,369
literature is that the the differences
 

2247
00:50:50,369 --> 00:50:53,269
literature is that the the differences
between regions are graded rather than

2248
00:50:53,269 --> 00:50:53,279
between regions are graded rather than
 

2249
00:50:53,279 --> 00:50:56,839
between regions are graded rather than
being discrete so it doesn't seem like

2250
00:50:56,839 --> 00:50:56,849
being discrete so it doesn't seem like
 

2251
00:50:56,849 --> 00:50:59,919
being discrete so it doesn't seem like
it's easy to divide the brain up into

2252
00:50:59,919 --> 00:50:59,929
it's easy to divide the brain up into
 

2253
00:50:59,929 --> 00:51:04,339
it's easy to divide the brain up into
true modules where you know that are you

2254
00:51:04,339 --> 00:51:04,349
true modules where you know that are you
 

2255
00:51:04,349 --> 00:51:07,130
true modules where you know that are you
know that have clear boundaries and that

2256
00:51:07,130 --> 00:51:07,140
know that have clear boundaries and that
 

2257
00:51:07,140 --> 00:51:14,089
know that have clear boundaries and that
have you know like like clear channels

2258
00:51:14,089 --> 00:51:14,099
have you know like like clear channels
 

2259
00:51:14,099 --> 00:51:16,399
have you know like like clear channels
of communication between them instead

2260
00:51:16,399 --> 00:51:16,409
of communication between them instead
 

2261
00:51:16,409 --> 00:51:18,229
of communication between them instead
lies to the prefrontal cortex yeah oh

2262
00:51:18,229 --> 00:51:18,239
lies to the prefrontal cortex yeah oh
 

2263
00:51:18,239 --> 00:51:19,999
lies to the prefrontal cortex yeah oh
yeah yeah the prefrontal cortex is made

2264
00:51:19,999 --> 00:51:20,009
yeah yeah the prefrontal cortex is made
 

2265
00:51:20,009 --> 00:51:22,269
yeah yeah the prefrontal cortex is made
up of a bunch of different sub regions

2266
00:51:22,269 --> 00:51:22,279
up of a bunch of different sub regions
 

2267
00:51:22,279 --> 00:51:26,120
up of a bunch of different sub regions
the you know the functions of which are

2268
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:26,130
the you know the functions of which are
 

2269
00:51:26,130 --> 00:51:28,489
the you know the functions of which are
not clearly defined and which then the

2270
00:51:28,489 --> 00:51:28,499
not clearly defined and which then the
 

2271
00:51:28,499 --> 00:51:31,419
not clearly defined and which then the
borders of which seem to be quite vague

2272
00:51:31,419 --> 00:51:31,429
borders of which seem to be quite vague
 

2273
00:51:31,429 --> 00:51:33,620
borders of which seem to be quite vague
and then then there's another thing

2274
00:51:33,620 --> 00:51:33,630
and then then there's another thing
 

2275
00:51:33,630 --> 00:51:35,179
and then then there's another thing
that's popping up in very recent

2276
00:51:35,179 --> 00:51:35,189
that's popping up in very recent
 

2277
00:51:35,189 --> 00:51:40,699
that's popping up in very recent
research which you know which involves

2278
00:51:40,699 --> 00:51:40,709
research which you know which involves
 

2279
00:51:40,709 --> 00:51:44,109
research which you know which involves
application of these new techniques

2280
00:51:44,109 --> 00:51:44,119
application of these new techniques
 

2281
00:51:44,119 --> 00:51:46,429
application of these new techniques
which there are a number of studies that

2282
00:51:46,429 --> 00:51:46,439
which there are a number of studies that
 

2283
00:51:46,439 --> 00:51:50,299
which there are a number of studies that
suggest that parts of the brain that we

2284
00:51:50,299 --> 00:51:50,309
suggest that parts of the brain that we
 

2285
00:51:50,309 --> 00:51:53,620
suggest that parts of the brain that we
would have previously thought were quite

2286
00:51:53,620 --> 00:51:53,630
would have previously thought were quite
 

2287
00:51:53,630 --> 00:51:58,219
would have previously thought were quite
focused in their function are actually

2288
00:51:58,219 --> 00:51:58,229
focused in their function are actually
 

2289
00:51:58,229 --> 00:52:00,259
focused in their function are actually
carrying signals that we wouldn't have

2290
00:52:00,259 --> 00:52:00,269
carrying signals that we wouldn't have
 

2291
00:52:00,269 --> 00:52:02,019
carrying signals that we wouldn't have
thought would be there for example

2292
00:52:02,019 --> 00:52:02,029
thought would be there for example
 

2293
00:52:02,029 --> 00:52:03,949
thought would be there for example
looking in the primary visual cortex

2294
00:52:03,949 --> 00:52:03,959
looking in the primary visual cortex
 

2295
00:52:03,959 --> 00:52:06,609
looking in the primary visual cortex
which is classically thought of as

2296
00:52:06,609 --> 00:52:06,619
which is classically thought of as
 

2297
00:52:06,619 --> 00:52:09,319
which is classically thought of as
basically the first cortical way station

2298
00:52:09,319 --> 00:52:09,329
basically the first cortical way station
 

2299
00:52:09,329 --> 00:52:10,339
basically the first cortical way station
for processing visual information

2300
00:52:10,339 --> 00:52:10,349
for processing visual information
 

2301
00:52:10,349 --> 00:52:12,259
for processing visual information
basically what it should care about is

2302
00:52:12,259 --> 00:52:12,269
basically what it should care about is
 

2303
00:52:12,269 --> 00:52:14,539
basically what it should care about is
you know where are the edges in this

2304
00:52:14,539 --> 00:52:14,549
you know where are the edges in this
 

2305
00:52:14,549 --> 00:52:17,150
you know where are the edges in this
scene that I'm viewing

2306
00:52:17,150 --> 00:52:17,160
scene that I'm viewing
 

2307
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:18,680
scene that I'm viewing
it turns out that if you have enough

2308
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:18,690
it turns out that if you have enough
 

2309
00:52:18,690 --> 00:52:21,079
it turns out that if you have enough
data you can recover information from

2310
00:52:21,079 --> 00:52:21,089
data you can recover information from
 

2311
00:52:21,089 --> 00:52:22,819
data you can recover information from
primary visual cortex about all sorts of

2312
00:52:22,819 --> 00:52:22,829
primary visual cortex about all sorts of
 

2313
00:52:22,829 --> 00:52:24,859
primary visual cortex about all sorts of
things like you know what what behavior

2314
00:52:24,859 --> 00:52:24,869
things like you know what what behavior
 

2315
00:52:24,869 --> 00:52:26,960
things like you know what what behavior
the animal is engaged in right now and

2316
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:26,970
the animal is engaged in right now and
 

2317
00:52:26,970 --> 00:52:29,420
the animal is engaged in right now and
what what how much reward is on offer in

2318
00:52:29,420 --> 00:52:29,430
what what how much reward is on offer in
 

2319
00:52:29,430 --> 00:52:32,390
what what how much reward is on offer in
the task that it's pursuing so it's

2320
00:52:32,390 --> 00:52:32,400
the task that it's pursuing so it's
 

2321
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:35,680
the task that it's pursuing so it's
clear that even even regions whose

2322
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:35,690
clear that even even regions whose
 

2323
00:52:35,690 --> 00:52:39,020
clear that even even regions whose
function is pretty well defined at a

2324
00:52:39,020 --> 00:52:39,030
function is pretty well defined at a
 

2325
00:52:39,030 --> 00:52:41,990
function is pretty well defined at a
course brain are nonetheless carrying

2326
00:52:41,990 --> 00:52:42,000
course brain are nonetheless carrying
 

2327
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,620
course brain are nonetheless carrying
some information about information from

2328
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:45,630
some information about information from
 

2329
00:52:45,630 --> 00:52:48,260
some information about information from
very different domains so you know the

2330
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:48,270
very different domains so you know the
 

2331
00:52:48,270 --> 00:52:50,410
very different domains so you know the
history of neuroscience is sort of this

2332
00:52:50,410 --> 00:52:50,420
history of neuroscience is sort of this
 

2333
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:52,789
history of neuroscience is sort of this
oscillation between the two views that

2334
00:52:52,789 --> 00:52:52,799
oscillation between the two views that
 

2335
00:52:52,799 --> 00:52:54,319
oscillation between the two views that
you articulated you know the kind of

2336
00:52:54,319 --> 00:52:54,329
you articulated you know the kind of
 

2337
00:52:54,329 --> 00:52:56,480
you articulated you know the kind of
modular view and then the big you know

2338
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:56,490
modular view and then the big you know
 

2339
00:52:56,490 --> 00:53:00,710
modular view and then the big you know
mush view and you know I think I guess

2340
00:53:00,710 --> 00:53:00,720
mush view and you know I think I guess
 

2341
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:02,059
mush view and you know I think I guess
we're gonna end up somewhere in the

2342
00:53:02,059 --> 00:53:02,069
we're gonna end up somewhere in the
 

2343
00:53:02,069 --> 00:53:04,700
we're gonna end up somewhere in the
middle which is which is unfortunate for

2344
00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:04,710
middle which is which is unfortunate for
 

2345
00:53:04,710 --> 00:53:06,470
middle which is which is unfortunate for
our understanding because the mod

2346
00:53:06,470 --> 00:53:06,480
our understanding because the mod
 

2347
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:08,510
our understanding because the mod
there's something about our you know

2348
00:53:08,510 --> 00:53:08,520
there's something about our you know
 

2349
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:10,700
there's something about our you know
conceptual system that finds it's easy

2350
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:10,710
conceptual system that finds it's easy
 

2351
00:53:10,710 --> 00:53:12,680
conceptual system that finds it's easy
to think about a modular AI system and

2352
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:12,690
to think about a modular AI system and
 

2353
00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:14,120
to think about a modular AI system and
easy to think about a completely

2354
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:14,130
easy to think about a completely
 

2355
00:53:14,130 --> 00:53:15,920
easy to think about a completely
undifferentiated system but something

2356
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:15,930
undifferentiated system but something
 

2357
00:53:15,930 --> 00:53:17,770
undifferentiated system but something
that kind of lies in between is

2358
00:53:17,770 --> 00:53:17,780
that kind of lies in between is
 

2359
00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:20,720
that kind of lies in between is
confusing but we're gonna have to get

2360
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:20,730
confusing but we're gonna have to get
 

2361
00:53:20,730 --> 00:53:22,309
confusing but we're gonna have to get
used to it I think unless we can

2362
00:53:22,309 --> 00:53:22,319
used to it I think unless we can
 

2363
00:53:22,319 --> 00:53:23,960
used to it I think unless we can
understand deeply the lower-level

2364
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:23,970
understand deeply the lower-level
 

2365
00:53:23,970 --> 00:53:25,849
understand deeply the lower-level
mechanism and you're all communicating

2366
00:53:25,849 --> 00:53:25,859
mechanism and you're all communicating
 

2367
00:53:25,859 --> 00:53:27,950
mechanism and you're all communicating
yeah so yeah on that on that topic you

2368
00:53:27,950 --> 00:53:27,960
yeah so yeah on that on that topic you
 

2369
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:30,049
yeah so yeah on that on that topic you
kind of mention information just to get

2370
00:53:30,049 --> 00:53:30,059
kind of mention information just to get
 

2371
00:53:30,059 --> 00:53:32,210
kind of mention information just to get
a sense I imagine something that there's

2372
00:53:32,210 --> 00:53:32,220
a sense I imagine something that there's
 

2373
00:53:32,220 --> 00:53:35,000
a sense I imagine something that there's
still mystery and disagreement on is how

2374
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:35,010
still mystery and disagreement on is how
 

2375
00:53:35,010 --> 00:53:37,279
still mystery and disagreement on is how
does the brain carry information and

2376
00:53:37,279 --> 00:53:37,289
does the brain carry information and
 

2377
00:53:37,289 --> 00:53:40,760
does the brain carry information and
signal like what in your sense is the

2378
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:40,770
signal like what in your sense is the
 

2379
00:53:40,770 --> 00:53:45,079
signal like what in your sense is the
basic mechanism of communication in the

2380
00:53:45,079 --> 00:53:45,089
basic mechanism of communication in the
 

2381
00:53:45,089 --> 00:53:48,950
basic mechanism of communication in the
brain well I I guess I'm old-fashioned

2382
00:53:48,950 --> 00:53:48,960
brain well I I guess I'm old-fashioned
 

2383
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:52,970
brain well I I guess I'm old-fashioned
in that I consider the networks that we

2384
00:53:52,970 --> 00:53:52,980
in that I consider the networks that we
 

2385
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:54,769
in that I consider the networks that we
use in deep learning research to be a

2386
00:53:54,769 --> 00:53:54,779
use in deep learning research to be a
 

2387
00:53:54,779 --> 00:53:59,420
use in deep learning research to be a
reasonable approximation to you know the

2388
00:53:59,420 --> 00:53:59,430
reasonable approximation to you know the
 

2389
00:53:59,430 --> 00:54:01,700
reasonable approximation to you know the
the mechanisms that carry information in

2390
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:01,710
the mechanisms that carry information in
 

2391
00:54:01,710 --> 00:54:04,279
the mechanisms that carry information in
the brain so the the the usual way of

2392
00:54:04,279 --> 00:54:04,289
the brain so the the the usual way of
 

2393
00:54:04,289 --> 00:54:06,769
the brain so the the the usual way of
articulating that is to say what really

2394
00:54:06,769 --> 00:54:06,779
articulating that is to say what really
 

2395
00:54:06,779 --> 00:54:09,019
articulating that is to say what really
matters is a rate code it what matters

2396
00:54:09,019 --> 00:54:09,029
matters is a rate code it what matters
 

2397
00:54:09,029 --> 00:54:12,799
matters is a rate code it what matters
is how how how quickly is an individual

2398
00:54:12,799 --> 00:54:12,809
is how how how quickly is an individual
 

2399
00:54:12,809 --> 00:54:15,140
is how how how quickly is an individual
neuron spiking how you know what's the

2400
00:54:15,140 --> 00:54:15,150
neuron spiking how you know what's the
 

2401
00:54:15,150 --> 00:54:16,789
neuron spiking how you know what's the
frequency at which it's spiking is the

2402
00:54:16,789 --> 00:54:16,799
frequency at which it's spiking is the
 

2403
00:54:16,799 --> 00:54:18,769
frequency at which it's spiking is the
timing of the spike yeah is it is it

2404
00:54:18,769 --> 00:54:18,779
timing of the spike yeah is it is it
 

2405
00:54:18,779 --> 00:54:21,019
timing of the spike yeah is it is it
firing fast or slow let's you know let's

2406
00:54:21,019 --> 00:54:21,029
firing fast or slow let's you know let's
 

2407
00:54:21,029 --> 00:54:23,390
firing fast or slow let's you know let's
put a number on that and that number is

2408
00:54:23,390 --> 00:54:23,400
put a number on that and that number is
 

2409
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:25,549
put a number on that and that number is
enough to capture what what neurons are

2410
00:54:25,549 --> 00:54:25,559
enough to capture what what neurons are
 

2411
00:54:25,559 --> 00:54:28,940

2413
00:54:28,950 --> 00:54:31,289

still uncertainty about whether that's

2414
00:54:31,289 --> 00:54:31,299
still uncertainty about whether that's
 

2415
00:54:31,299 --> 00:54:34,680
still uncertainty about whether that's
an an adequate description of how

by sticking to this high level of

by sticking to this high level of
 

2445
00:55:10,839 --> 00:55:13,349
by sticking to this high level of
abstraction just the rate and by the way

2446
00:55:13,349 --> 00:55:13,359
abstraction just the rate and by the way
 

2447
00:55:13,359 --> 00:55:14,940

we're talking about the electrical

00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:14,950
we're talking about the electrical
 

2449
00:55:14,950 --> 00:55:17,099
we're talking about the electrical

signal that I remember reading some
 

2451
00:55:17,109 --> 00:55:20,549

vague paper somewhere recently where the

2452
00:55:20,549 --> 00:55:20,559
vague paper somewhere recently where the
 

2453
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:23,489
vague paper somewhere recently where the
mechanical signal like the vibrations or

2454
00:55:23,489 --> 00:55:23,499
mechanical signal like the vibrations or
 

2455
00:55:23,499 --> 00:55:28,019
mechanical signal like the vibrations or
something of the of the neurons also

2456
00:55:28,019 --> 00:55:28,029
something of the of the neurons also
 

2457
00:55:28,029 --> 00:55:29,430
something of the of the neurons also
communicates and if I haven't seen that

2458
00:55:29,430 --> 00:55:29,440
communicates and if I haven't seen that
 

2459
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:32,039
communicates and if I haven't seen that
but this is there somebody was arguing

2460
00:55:32,039 --> 00:55:32,049
but this is there somebody was arguing
 

2461
00:55:32,049 --> 00:55:35,910
but this is there somebody was arguing
that the the electrical signal this is

2462
00:55:35,910 --> 00:55:35,920
that the the electrical signal this is
 

2463
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:37,380
that the the electrical signal this is
in nature paper something like that

2464
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:37,390
in nature paper something like that
 

2465
00:55:37,390 --> 00:55:39,150
in nature paper something like that
where the electrical signal is actually

2466
00:55:39,150 --> 00:55:39,160
where the electrical signal is actually
 

2467
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:43,109
where the electrical signal is actually
a side effect of the mechanical signal

2468
00:55:43,109 --> 00:55:43,119
a side effect of the mechanical signal
 

2469
00:55:43,119 --> 00:55:45,299
a side effect of the mechanical signal
but I don't think they changes the story

2470
00:55:45,299 --> 00:55:45,309
but I don't think they changes the story
 

2471
00:55:45,309 --> 00:55:48,930
but I don't think they changes the story
but it's almost the interesting idea

2472
00:55:48,930 --> 00:55:48,940
but it's almost the interesting idea
 

2473
00:55:48,940 --> 00:55:50,609
but it's almost the interesting idea
that there could be a deeper it's like

2474
00:55:50,609 --> 00:55:50,619
that there could be a deeper it's like
 

2475
00:55:50,619 --> 00:55:53,519
that there could be a deeper it's like
it's always like in physics with quantum

2476
00:55:53,519 --> 00:55:53,529
it's always like in physics with quantum
 

2477
00:55:53,529 --> 00:55:55,469
it's always like in physics with quantum
mechanics there's always a deeper story

2478
00:55:55,469 --> 00:55:55,479
mechanics there's always a deeper story
 

2479
00:55:55,479 --> 00:55:57,150
mechanics there's always a deeper story
that could be underlying the whole thing

2480
00:55:57,150 --> 00:55:57,160
that could be underlying the whole thing
 

2481
00:55:57,160 --> 00:55:59,489
that could be underlying the whole thing
but you think is basically the rate of

2482
00:55:59,489 --> 00:55:59,499
but you think is basically the rate of
 

2483
00:55:59,499 --> 00:56:01,680
but you think is basically the rate of
spiking that gets us that's like the

2484
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:01,690
spiking that gets us that's like the
 

2485
00:56:01,690 --> 00:56:03,359
spiking that gets us that's like the
lowest hanging fruit that can get us

2486
00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:03,369
lowest hanging fruit that can get us
 

2487
00:56:03,369 --> 00:56:06,120
lowest hanging fruit that can get us
really far this is a this is a classical

2488
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:06,130
really far this is a this is a classical
 

2489
00:56:06,130 --> 00:56:08,430
really far this is a this is a classical
view I mean this is this is this is not

2490
00:56:08,430 --> 00:56:08,440
view I mean this is this is this is not
 

2491
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:10,829

the only way in which this stance would

2492
00:56:10,829 --> 00:56:10,839
the only way in which this stance would
 

2493
00:56:10,839 --> 00:56:13,319
the only way in which this stance would
be controversial is it you know in the

2494
00:56:13,319 --> 00:56:13,329
be controversial is it you know in the
 

2495
00:56:13,329 --> 00:56:15,839
be controversial is it you know in the
sense that there are there are members

2496
00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:15,849
sense that there are there are members
 

2497
00:56:15,849 --> 00:56:17,219
sense that there are there are members
of the neuroscience community who are

2498
00:56:17,219 --> 00:56:17,229
of the neuroscience community who are
 

2499
00:56:17,229 --> 00:56:19,650
of the neuroscience community who are
interested in alternatives but this is

2500
00:56:19,650 --> 00:56:19,660
interested in alternatives but this is
 

2501
00:56:19,660 --> 00:56:21,660
interested in alternatives but this is
really a very mainstream view the way

2502
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:21,670
really a very mainstream view the way
 

2503
00:56:21,670 --> 00:56:25,459
really a very mainstream view the way
that neurons communicate is that

2504
00:56:25,459 --> 00:56:25,469
that neurons communicate is that
 

2505
00:56:25,469 --> 00:56:28,769
that neurons communicate is that
neurotransmitters arrive or you know at

2506
00:56:28,769 --> 00:56:28,779
neurotransmitters arrive or you know at
 

2507
00:56:28,779 --> 00:56:31,529
neurotransmitters arrive or you know at
a at you know they they wash up on a

2508
00:56:31,529 --> 00:56:31,539
a at you know they they wash up on a
 

2509
00:56:31,539 --> 00:56:34,680
a at you know they they wash up on a
neuron the neuron has receptors for

2510
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:34,690
neuron the neuron has receptors for
 

2511
00:56:34,690 --> 00:56:37,920
neuron the neuron has receptors for
those transmitters the the the the the

2512
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:37,930
those transmitters the the the the the
 

2513
00:56:37,930 --> 00:56:39,299
those transmitters the the the the the
meeting of the transmitter with these

2514
00:56:39,299 --> 00:56:39,309
meeting of the transmitter with these
 

2515
00:56:39,309 --> 00:56:41,099
meeting of the transmitter with these
receptors changes the voltage of the

2516
00:56:41,099 --> 00:56:41,109
receptors changes the voltage of the
 

2517
00:56:41,109 --> 00:56:41,870
receptors changes the voltage of the
neuro

2518
00:56:41,870 --> 00:56:41,880
neuro
 

2519
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:45,170
neuro
and if enough voltage change occurs then

2520
00:56:45,170 --> 00:56:45,180
and if enough voltage change occurs then
 

2521
00:56:45,180 --> 00:56:47,450
and if enough voltage change occurs then
a spike occurs right one of these like

2522
00:56:47,450 --> 00:56:47,460
a spike occurs right one of these like
 

2523
00:56:47,460 --> 00:56:50,300
a spike occurs right one of these like
discrete events and it's that spike that

2524

this human being on and then let's look
 

2633
00:59:13,260 --> 00:59:16,670
this human being on and then let's look
at what the units deep in the system are

at what the units deep in the system are

01:00:16,790 --> 01:00:16,800
papers that sort of weave beautifully
 

2681
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:19,040
papers that sort of weave beautifully
between the world of neuroscience and

2682
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:19,050
between the world of neuroscience and
 

2683
01:00:19,050 --> 01:00:23,420
between the world of neuroscience and
artificial intelligence and this maybe

2684
01:00:23,420 --> 01:00:23,430
artificial intelligence and this maybe
 

2685
01:00:23,430 --> 01:00:26,000
artificial intelligence and this maybe
if we could can we just try to dance

2686
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:26,010
if we could can we just try to dance
 

2687
01:00:26,010 --> 01:00:27,710
if we could can we just try to dance
around and talk about some of them maybe

2688
01:00:27,710 --> 01:00:27,720
around and talk about some of them maybe
 

2689
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:29,720
around and talk about some of them maybe
tried to pick up the interesting idea as

2690
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:29,730
tried to pick up the interesting idea as
 

2691
01:00:29,730 --> 01:00:32,660
tried to pick up the interesting idea as
a jump to your mind from memory so maybe

2692
01:00:32,660 --> 01:00:32,670
a jump to your mind from memory so maybe
 

2693
01:00:32,670 --> 01:00:34,400
a jump to your mind from memory so maybe
looking at we're talking about the

2694
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:34,410
looking at we're talking about the
 

2695
01:00:34,410 --> 01:00:37,250
looking at we're talking about the
prefrontal cortex the 2018 I believe

2696
01:00:37,250 --> 01:00:37,260
prefrontal cortex the 2018 I believe
 

2697
01:00:37,260 --> 01:00:40,190
prefrontal cortex the 2018 I believe
paper called the prefrontal cortex as a

2698
01:00:40,190 --> 01:00:40,200
paper called the prefrontal cortex as a
 

2699
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:41,810
paper called the prefrontal cortex as a
matter of reinforcement learning system

2700
01:00:41,810 --> 01:00:41,820
matter of reinforcement learning system
 

2701
01:00:41,820 --> 01:00:45,320
matter of reinforcement learning system
what is there a key idea that you can

2702
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:45,330
what is there a key idea that you can
 

2703
01:00:45,330 --> 01:00:49,040
what is there a key idea that you can
speak to from that paper yeah the I mean

2704
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:49,050
speak to from that paper yeah the I mean
 

2705
01:00:49,050 --> 01:00:53,210
speak to from that paper yeah the I mean
the key idea is about meta learning so

2706
01:00:53,210 --> 01:00:53,220
the key idea is about meta learning so
 

2707
01:00:53,220 --> 01:00:56,500
the key idea is about meta learning so
what is meta learning meta learning is

2708
01:00:56,500 --> 01:00:56,510
what is meta learning meta learning is
 

2709
01:00:56,510 --> 01:01:03,590
what is meta learning meta learning is
by definition a situation in which you

2710
01:01:03,590 --> 01:01:03,600
by definition a situation in which you
 

2711
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:06,020
by definition a situation in which you
have a learning algorithm

2712
01:01:06,020 --> 01:01:06,030
have a learning algorithm
 

2713
01:01:06,030 --> 01:01:08,540
have a learning algorithm
and the learning algorithm operates in

2714
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:08,550
and the learning algorithm operates in
 

2715
01:01:08,550 --> 01:01:11,960
and the learning algorithm operates in
such a way that it gives rise to another

2716
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:11,970
such a way that it gives rise to another
 

2717
01:01:11,970 --> 01:01:14,570
such a way that it gives rise to another
learning algorithm in the in the

2718
01:01:14,570 --> 01:01:14,580
learning algorithm in the in the
 

2719
01:01:14,580 --> 01:01:17,330
learning algorithm in the in the
earliest applications with this idea you

2720
01:01:17,330 --> 01:01:17,340
earliest applications with this idea you
 

2721
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:19,820
earliest applications with this idea you
had one learning algorithm sort of

2722
01:01:19,820 --> 01:01:19,830
had one learning algorithm sort of
 

2723
01:01:19,830 --> 01:01:21,770
had one learning algorithm sort of
adjusting the parameters on another

2724
01:01:21,770 --> 01:01:21,780
adjusting the parameters on another
 

2725
01:01:21,780 --> 01:01:23,840
adjusting the parameters on another
learning algorithm but the case that

2726
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:23,850
learning algorithm but the case that
 

2727
01:01:23,850 --> 01:01:25,910
learning algorithm but the case that
we're interested in this paper is one

2728
01:01:25,910 --> 01:01:25,920
we're interested in this paper is one
 

2729
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:28,610
we're interested in this paper is one
where you start with just one learning

2730
01:01:28,610 --> 01:01:28,620
where you start with just one learning
 

2731
01:01:28,620 --> 01:01:30,170
where you start with just one learning
algorithm and then another learning

2732
01:01:30,170 --> 01:01:30,180
algorithm and then another learning
 

2733
01:01:30,180 --> 01:01:33,470
algorithm and then another learning
algorithm kind of emerges out of the

2734
01:01:33,470 --> 01:01:33,480
algorithm kind of emerges out of the
 

2735
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:35,870
algorithm kind of emerges out of the
kind of thin air I can say more about

2736
01:01:35,870 --> 01:01:35,880
kind of thin air I can say more about
 

2737
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:37,460
kind of thin air I can say more about
what I mean by that I don't mean to be

2738
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:37,470
what I mean by that I don't mean to be
 

2739
01:01:37,470 --> 01:01:42,260
what I mean by that I don't mean to be
um you know your entities but that's the

2740
01:01:42,260 --> 01:01:42,270
um you know your entities but that's the
 

2741
01:01:42,270 --> 01:01:44,780
um you know your entities but that's the
idea of meta learning you you it relates

2742
01:01:44,780 --> 01:01:44,790
idea of meta learning you you it relates
 

2743
01:01:44,790 --> 01:01:46,100
idea of meta learning you you it relates
to the old idea and psychology of

2744
01:01:46,100 --> 01:01:46,110
to the old idea and psychology of
 

2745
01:01:46,110 --> 01:01:51,440
to the old idea and psychology of
learning to learn situations where you

2746
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:51,450
learning to learn situations where you
 

2747
01:01:51,450 --> 01:01:54,950
learning to learn situations where you
you you have experiences that make you

2748
01:01:54,950 --> 01:01:54,960
you you have experiences that make you
 

2749
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:57,470
you you have experiences that make you
better at learning something new like a

2750
01:01:57,470 --> 01:01:57,480
better at learning something new like a
 

2751
01:01:57,480 --> 01:01:59,200
better at learning something new like a
group a familiar example would be

2752
01:01:59,200 --> 01:01:59,210
group a familiar example would be
 

2753
01:01:59,210 --> 01:02:01,700
group a familiar example would be
learning a foreign language the first

2754
01:02:01,700 --> 01:02:01,710
learning a foreign language the first
 

2755
01:02:01,710 --> 01:02:03,110
learning a foreign language the first
time you learn a foreign language it may

2756
01:02:03,110 --> 01:02:03,120
time you learn a foreign language it may
 

2757
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:05,480
time you learn a foreign language it may
be you know quite laborious and

2758
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:05,490
be you know quite laborious and
 

2759
01:02:05,490 --> 01:02:08,570
be you know quite laborious and
disorienting and a novel but if you

2760
01:02:08,570 --> 01:02:08,580
disorienting and a novel but if you
 

2761
01:02:08,580 --> 01:02:11,270
disorienting and a novel but if you
let's say you've learned to two foreign

2762
01:02:11,270 --> 01:02:11,280
let's say you've learned to two foreign
 

2763
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:13,250
let's say you've learned to two foreign
languages the third foreign language

2764
01:02:13,250 --> 01:02:13,260
languages the third foreign language
 

2765
01:02:13,260 --> 01:02:15,350
languages the third foreign language
obviously is going to be much easier to

2766
01:02:15,350 --> 01:02:15,360
obviously is going to be much easier to
 

2767
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:17,540
obviously is going to be much easier to
pick up and why because you've learned

2768
01:02:17,540 --> 01:02:17,550
pick up and why because you've learned
 

2769
01:02:17,550 --> 01:02:20,300
pick up and why because you've learned
how to learn you know how this goes you

2770
01:02:20,300 --> 01:02:20,310
how to learn you know how this goes you
 

2771
01:02:20,310 --> 01:02:21,470
how to learn you know how this goes you
know okay I'm gonna have to learn how to

2772
01:02:21,470 --> 01:02:21,480
know okay I'm gonna have to learn how to
 

2773
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:24,260
know okay I'm gonna have to learn how to
conjugate I'm gonna happen that's a

2774
01:02:24,260 --> 01:02:24,270
conjugate I'm gonna happen that's a
 

2775
01:02:24,270 --> 01:02:25,730
conjugate I'm gonna happen that's a
that's a simple form of meta learning

2776
01:02:25,730 --> 01:02:25,740
that's a simple form of meta learning
 

2777
01:02:25,740 --> 01:02:27,740
that's a simple form of meta learning
right in the sense that there's some

2778
01:02:27,740 --> 01:02:27,750
right in the sense that there's some
 

2779
01:02:27,750 --> 01:02:30,770
right in the sense that there's some
slow learning mechanism that's giving

2780
01:02:30,770 --> 01:02:30,780
slow learning mechanism that's giving
 

2781
01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:33,140
slow learning mechanism that's giving
that's helping you kind of update your

2782
01:02:33,140 --> 01:02:33,150
that's helping you kind of update your
 

2783
01:02:33,150 --> 01:02:35,360
that's helping you kind of update your
fast learning mechanism that that that

2784
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:35,370
fast learning mechanism that that that
 

2785
01:02:35,370 --> 01:02:38,660
fast learning mechanism that that that
makes you so how from from our

2786
01:02:38,660 --> 01:02:38,670
makes you so how from from our
 

2787
01:02:38,670 --> 01:02:40,070
makes you so how from from our
understand from the psychology world

2788
01:02:40,070 --> 01:02:40,080
understand from the psychology world
 

2789
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:42,230
understand from the psychology world
from neuroscience honor our

2790
01:02:42,230 --> 01:02:42,240
from neuroscience honor our
 

2791
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:44,560
from neuroscience honor our
understanding how meta learning works

2792
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:44,570
understanding how meta learning works
 

2793
01:02:44,570 --> 01:02:47,990
understanding how meta learning works
might work in the human brain what what

2794
01:02:47,990 --> 01:02:48,000
might work in the human brain what what
 

2795
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,510
might work in the human brain what what
lessons can we draw from that that we

2796
01:02:50,510 --> 01:02:50,520
lessons can we draw from that that we
 

2797
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:51,500
lessons can we draw from that that we
can bring into the artificial

2798
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:51,510
can bring into the artificial
 

2799
01:02:51,510 --> 01:02:54,710
can bring into the artificial
intelligence world well yeah so we the

2800
01:02:54,710 --> 01:02:54,720
intelligence world well yeah so we the
 

2801
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:58,340
intelligence world well yeah so we the
origin of that paper was in AI work that

2802
01:02:58,340 --> 01:02:58,350
origin of that paper was in AI work that
 

2803
01:02:58,350 --> 01:03:00,940
origin of that paper was in AI work that
that we were doing in my group we were

2804
01:03:00,940 --> 01:03:00,950
that we were doing in my group we were
 

2805
01:03:00,950 --> 01:03:03,920
that we were doing in my group we were
we were looking at what happens when you

2806
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:03,930
we were looking at what happens when you
 

2807
01:03:03,930 --> 01:03:06,560
we were looking at what happens when you
train a recurrent neural network using

2808
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:06,570
train a recurrent neural network using
 

2809
01:03:06,570 --> 01:03:08,170
train a recurrent neural network using
standard reinforcement learning

2810
01:03:08,170 --> 01:03:08,180
standard reinforcement learning
 

2811
01:03:08,180 --> 01:03:11,180
standard reinforcement learning
algorithms but but you train that

2812
01:03:11,180 --> 01:03:11,190
algorithms but but you train that
 

2813
01:03:11,190 --> 01:03:12,800
algorithms but but you train that
network not just in one task but you

2814
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:12,810
network not just in one task but you
 

2815
01:03:12,810 --> 01:03:14,300
network not just in one task but you
train it in a bunch of interrelated

2816
01:03:14,300 --> 01:03:14,310
train it in a bunch of interrelated
 

2817
01:03:14,310 --> 01:03:17,780
train it in a bunch of interrelated
tasks and then you ask what happens when

2818
01:03:17,780 --> 01:03:17,790
tasks and then you ask what happens when
 

2819
01:03:17,790 --> 01:03:19,740
tasks and then you ask what happens when
you give it yet another task

2820
01:03:19,740 --> 01:03:19,750
you give it yet another task
 

2821
01:03:19,750 --> 01:03:22,590
you give it yet another task
in that sort of line of interrelated

2822
01:03:22,590 --> 01:03:22,600
in that sort of line of interrelated
 

2823
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:26,550
in that sort of line of interrelated
tasks and and what we started to realize

2824
01:03:26,550 --> 01:03:26,560
tasks and and what we started to realize
 

2825
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:30,300
tasks and and what we started to realize
is that a form of meta learning

2826
01:03:30,300 --> 01:03:30,310
is that a form of meta learning
 

2827
01:03:30,310 --> 01:03:32,670
is that a form of meta learning
spontaneously happens in in recurrent

2828
01:03:32,670 --> 01:03:32,680
spontaneously happens in in recurrent
 

2829
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:36,360
spontaneously happens in in recurrent
neural networks and and the simplest way

2830
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:36,370
neural networks and and the simplest way
 

2831
01:03:36,370 --> 01:03:40,200
neural networks and and the simplest way
to explain it is to say a recurrent a

2832
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:40,210
to explain it is to say a recurrent a
 

2833
01:03:40,210 --> 01:03:42,270
to explain it is to say a recurrent a
recurrent neural network has a kind of

2834
01:03:42,270 --> 01:03:42,280
recurrent neural network has a kind of
 

2835
01:03:42,280 --> 01:03:45,720
recurrent neural network has a kind of
memory in its activation patterns it's

2836
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:45,730

activity dynamics into its own learning
algorithm and as we were as we were kind

2994
01:06:45,730 --> 01:06:45,740
algorithm and as we were as we were kind
 

2995
01:06:45,740 --> 01:06:51,460
algorithm and as we were as we were kind
of realizing that this is the thing it

2996
01:06:51,460 --> 01:06:51,470
of realizing that this is the thing it
 

2997
01:06:51,470 --> 01:06:53,170
of realizing that this is the thing it
just so happened that the group that was

2998
01:06:53,170 --> 01:06:53,180
just so happened that the group that was
 

2999
01:06:53,180 --> 01:06:54,700
just so happened that the group that was
working on this included a bunch of

3000
01:06:54,700 --> 01:06:54,710
working on this included a bunch of
 

3001
01:06:54,710 --> 01:06:57,940
working on this included a bunch of
neuroscientists and it started kind of

3002
01:06:57,940 --> 01:06:57,950
neuroscientists and it started kind of
 

3003
01:06:57,950 --> 01:07:00,490
neuroscientists and it started kind of
ringing a bell for us which is to say

3004
01:07:00,490 --> 01:07:00,500
ringing a bell for us which is to say
 

3005
01:07:00,500 --> 01:07:02,830
ringing a bell for us which is to say
that we thought this sounds a lot like

3006
01:07:02,830 --> 01:07:02,840
that we thought this sounds a lot like
 

3007
01:07:02,840 --> 01:07:05,200
that we thought this sounds a lot like
the distinction between synaptic

3008
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:05,210
the distinction between synaptic
 

3009
01:07:05,210 --> 01:07:08,350
the distinction between synaptic
learning and activity synaptic memory

3010
01:07:08,350 --> 01:07:08,360
learning and activity synaptic memory
 

3011
01:07:08,360 --> 01:07:09,900
learning and activity synaptic memory
and activity based memory in the brain

3012
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:09,910
and activity based memory in the brain
 

3013
01:07:09,910 --> 01:07:14,760
and activity based memory in the brain
and it also reminded us of recurrent

3014
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:14,770
and it also reminded us of recurrent
 

3015
01:07:14,770 --> 01:07:16,840
and it also reminded us of recurrent
connectivity that's very characteristic

3016
01:07:16,840 --> 01:07:16,850
connectivity that's very characteristic
 

3017
01:07:16,850 --> 01:07:20,410
connectivity that's very characteristic
of prefrontal function so there this is

3018
01:07:20,410 --> 01:07:20,420
of prefrontal function so there this is
 

3019
01:07:20,420 --> 01:07:22,060
of prefrontal function so there this is
this is kind of why it's good to have

3020
01:07:22,060 --> 01:07:22,070
this is kind of why it's good to have
 

3021
01:07:22,070 --> 01:07:25,180
this is kind of why it's good to have
people working on AI that know a little

3022
01:07:25,180 --> 01:07:25,190
people working on AI that know a little
 

3023
01:07:25,190 --> 01:07:27,270
people working on AI that know a little
bit about neuroscience and vice-versa

3024
01:07:27,270 --> 01:07:27,280
bit about neuroscience and vice-versa
 

3025
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:29,530
bit about neuroscience and vice-versa
because we started thinking about

3026
01:07:29,530 --> 01:07:29,540
because we started thinking about
 

3027
01:07:29,540 --> 01:07:31,360
because we started thinking about
whether we could apply this principle to

3028
01:07:31,360 --> 01:07:31,370
whether we could apply this principle to
 

3029
01:07:31,370 --> 01:07:32,950
whether we could apply this principle to
neuroscience and that's where the paper

3030
01:07:32,950 --> 01:07:32,960
neuroscience and that's where the paper
 

3031
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:35,790
neuroscience and that's where the paper
came from so the kind of principle of

3032
01:07:35,790 --> 01:07:35,800
came from so the kind of principle of
 

3033
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:38,080
came from so the kind of principle of
the the recurrence they can see in the

3034
01:07:38,080 --> 01:07:38,090
the the recurrence they can see in the
 

3035
01:07:38,090 --> 01:07:40,270
the the recurrence they can see in the
prefrontal cortex then you start to

3036
01:07:40,270 --> 01:07:40,280
prefrontal cortex then you start to
 

3037
01:07:40,280 --> 01:07:41,770
prefrontal cortex then you start to
realize

3038
01:07:41,770 --> 01:07:41,780
realize
 

3039
01:07:41,780 --> 01:07:44,560
realize
that is possible too for something like

3040
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:44,570
that is possible too for something like
 

3041
01:07:44,570 --> 01:07:49,090
that is possible too for something like
an idea of a learning to learn emerging

3042
01:07:49,090 --> 01:07:49,100
an idea of a learning to learn emerging
 

3043
01:07:49,100 --> 01:07:51,310
an idea of a learning to learn emerging
from this learning process as long as

3044
01:07:51,310 --> 01:07:51,320
from this learning process as long as
 

3045
01:07:51,320 --> 01:07:54,040
from this learning process as long as
you keep varying the environment

3046
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:54,050
you keep varying the environment
 

3047
01:07:54,050 --> 01:07:57,750
you keep varying the environment
sufficient zactly so so the kind of

3048
01:07:57,750 --> 01:07:57,760
sufficient zactly so so the kind of
 

3049
01:07:57,760 --> 01:07:59,710
sufficient zactly so so the kind of
metaphorical transition we made to

3050
01:07:59,710 --> 01:07:59,720
metaphorical transition we made to
 

3051
01:07:59,720 --> 01:08:02,440
metaphorical transition we made to
neuroscience was to think okay well we

3052
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:02,450
neuroscience was to think okay well we
 

3053
01:08:02,450 --> 01:08:03,760
neuroscience was to think okay well we
know that the prefrontal cortex is

3054
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:03,770
know that the prefrontal cortex is
 

3055
01:08:03,770 --> 01:08:05,920
know that the prefrontal cortex is
highly recurrent we know that it's an

3056
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:05,930
highly recurrent we know that it's an
 

3057
01:08:05,930 --> 01:08:08,680
highly recurrent we know that it's an
important locus for working memory for

3058
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:08,690
important locus for working memory for
 

3059
01:08:08,690 --> 01:08:11,890
important locus for working memory for
active activation based memory so maybe

3060
01:08:11,890 --> 01:08:11,900
active activation based memory so maybe
 

3061
01:08:11,900 --> 01:08:14,380
active activation based memory so maybe
the prefrontal cortex supports

3062
01:08:14,380 --> 01:08:14,390
the prefrontal cortex supports
 

3063
01:08:14,390 --> 01:08:16,230
the prefrontal cortex supports
reinforcement learning in other words

3064
01:08:16,230 --> 01:08:16,240
reinforcement learning in other words
 

3065
01:08:16,240 --> 01:08:19,420
reinforcement learning in other words
you what is reinforcement learning you

3066
01:08:19,420 --> 01:08:19,430
you what is reinforcement learning you
 

3067
01:08:19,430 --> 01:08:20,920
you what is reinforcement learning you
take an action you see how much reward

3068
01:08:20,920 --> 01:08:20,930
take an action you see how much reward
 

3069
01:08:20,930 --> 01:08:22,960
take an action you see how much reward
you got you update your policy of

3070
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:22,970
you got you update your policy of
 

3071
01:08:22,970 --> 01:08:25,809
you got you update your policy of
behavior maybe the prefrontal cortex is

3072
01:08:25,809 --> 01:08:25,819
behavior maybe the prefrontal cortex is
 

3073
01:08:25,819 --> 01:08:26,680
behavior maybe the prefrontal cortex is
doing that sort of thing

3074
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:26,690
doing that sort of thing
 

3075
01:08:26,690 --> 01:08:28,660
doing that sort of thing
strictly in its activation patterns it's

3076
01:08:28,660 --> 01:08:28,670
strictly in its activation patterns it's
 

3077
01:08:28,670 --> 01:08:31,210
strictly in its activation patterns it's
keeping around a memory in its activity

3078
01:08:31,210 --> 01:08:31,220
keeping around a memory in its activity
 

3079
01:08:31,220 --> 01:08:34,000
keeping around a memory in its activity
patterns of what you did how much reward

3080
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:34,010
patterns of what you did how much reward
 

3081
01:08:34,010 --> 01:08:36,670
patterns of what you did how much reward
you got and it's using that that

3082
01:08:36,670 --> 01:08:36,680
you got and it's using that that
 

3083
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:39,579
you got and it's using that that
activity based memory as a basis for

3084
01:08:39,579 --> 01:08:39,589
activity based memory as a basis for
 

3085
01:08:39,589 --> 01:08:41,710
activity based memory as a basis for
updating behavior but then the question

3086
01:08:41,710 --> 01:08:41,720
updating behavior but then the question
 

3087
01:08:41,720 --> 01:08:42,789
updating behavior but then the question
is well how did the prefrontal cortex

3088
01:08:42,789 --> 01:08:42,799
is well how did the prefrontal cortex
 

3089
01:08:42,799 --> 01:08:45,280
is well how did the prefrontal cortex
get get so smart in other words how did

3090
01:08:45,280 --> 01:08:45,290
get get so smart in other words how did
 

3091
01:08:45,290 --> 01:08:47,230
get get so smart in other words how did
it where did these activity dynamics

3092
01:08:47,230 --> 01:08:47,240
it where did these activity dynamics
 

3093
01:08:47,240 --> 01:08:50,200
it where did these activity dynamics
come from how did that program that's

3094
01:08:50,200 --> 01:08:50,210
come from how did that program that's
 

3095
01:08:50,210 --> 01:08:51,880
come from how did that program that's
implemented in the recurrent dynamics of

3096
01:08:51,880 --> 01:08:51,890
implemented in the recurrent dynamics of
 

3097
01:08:51,890 --> 01:08:55,480
implemented in the recurrent dynamics of
the prefrontal cortex arise and one

3098
01:08:55,480 --> 01:08:55,490
the prefrontal cortex arise and one
 

3099
01:08:55,490 --> 01:08:57,130
the prefrontal cortex arise and one
answer that became evident in this work

3100
01:08:57,130 --> 01:08:57,140
answer that became evident in this work
 

3101
01:08:57,140 --> 01:09:00,430
answer that became evident in this work
was well maybe maybe the mechanisms that

3102
01:09:00,430 --> 01:09:00,440
was well maybe maybe the mechanisms that
 

3103
01:09:00,440 --> 01:09:03,370
was well maybe maybe the mechanisms that
operate on the synaptic level which we

3104
01:09:03,370 --> 01:09:03,380
operate on the synaptic level which we
 

3105
01:09:03,380 --> 01:09:06,520
operate on the synaptic level which we
believe are mediated by dopamine are

3106
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:06,530
believe are mediated by dopamine are
 

3107
01:09:06,530 --> 01:09:09,390
believe are mediated by dopamine are
responsible for shaping those dynamics

3108
01:09:09,390 --> 01:09:09,400
responsible for shaping those dynamics
 

3109
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:12,430
responsible for shaping those dynamics
so this may be a silly question but

3110
01:09:12,430 --> 01:09:12,440
so this may be a silly question but
 

3111
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:18,579
so this may be a silly question but
because this kind of several temporal of

3112
01:09:18,579 --> 01:09:18,589
because this kind of several temporal of
 

3113
01:09:18,589 --> 01:09:21,280
because this kind of several temporal of
classes of learning are happening and so

3114
01:09:21,280 --> 01:09:21,290
classes of learning are happening and so
 

3115
01:09:21,290 --> 01:09:24,579
classes of learning are happening and so
the learning to learn is emerges can it

3116
01:09:24,579 --> 01:09:24,589
the learning to learn is emerges can it
 

3117
01:09:24,589 --> 01:09:28,270
the learning to learn is emerges can it
just can you keep building stacks of

3118
01:09:28,270 --> 01:09:28,280
just can you keep building stacks of
 

3119
01:09:28,280 --> 01:09:30,370
just can you keep building stacks of
learning to learn to learn learning to

3120
01:09:30,370 --> 01:09:30,380
learning to learn to learn learning to
 

3121
01:09:30,380 --> 01:09:31,900
learning to learn to learn learning to
learn to learn to learn to learn because

3122
01:09:31,900 --> 01:09:31,910
learn to learn to learn to learn because
 

3123
01:09:31,910 --> 01:09:34,360
learn to learn to learn to learn because
it keeps I mean basically abstractions

3124
01:09:34,360 --> 01:09:34,370
it keeps I mean basically abstractions
 

3125
01:09:34,370 --> 01:09:37,750
it keeps I mean basically abstractions

may have been in his PhD thesis that we

3144
01:10:05,110 --> 01:10:05,120
may have been in his PhD thesis that we
 

3145
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:07,090
may have been in his PhD thesis that we
should think about meta meta meta meta

should think about meta meta meta meta
meta meta learning you know that that's

3148
01:10:08,950 --> 01:10:08,960
meta meta learning you know that that's
 

3149
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:11,020
meta meta learning you know that that's
really that's really what's going to get

3150
01:10:11,020 --> 01:10:11,030
really that's really what's going to get
 

3151
01:10:11,030 --> 01:10:13,540
really that's really what's going to get
us to true intelligence certainly

3152
01:10:13,540 --> 01:10:13,550
us to true intelligence certainly
 

3153
01:10:13,550 --> 01:10:15,610
us to true intelligence certainly
there's a poetic aspect to it and it

3154
01:10:15,610 --> 01:10:15,620
there's a poetic aspect to it and it
 

3155
01:10:15,620 --> 01:10:19,810
there's a poetic aspect to it and it
seems interesting and correct that that

3156
01:10:19,810 --> 01:10:19,820
seems interesting and correct that that
 

3157
01:10:19,820 --> 01:10:21,280
seems interesting and correct that that
kind of level of abstraction would be

3158
01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:21,290
kind of level of abstraction would be
 

3159
01:10:21,290 --> 01:10:22,720
kind of level of abstraction would be
powerful but is that something you see

3160
01:10:22,720 --> 01:10:22,730
powerful but is that something you see
 

3161
01:10:22,730 --> 01:10:26,919
powerful but is that something you see
in the brain this kind of is it useful

3162
01:10:26,919 --> 01:10:26,929
in the brain this kind of is it useful
 

3163
01:10:26,929 --> 01:10:28,840
in the brain this kind of is it useful
to think of learning in these meta meta

3164
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:28,850
to think of learning in these meta meta
 

3165
01:10:28,850 --> 01:10:31,240
to think of learning in these meta meta
meta way or is it just meta learning

3166
01:10:31,240 --> 01:10:31,250
meta way or is it just meta learning
 

3167
01:10:31,250 --> 01:10:35,229
meta way or is it just meta learning
well one thing that really fascinated me

3168
01:10:35,229 --> 01:10:35,239
well one thing that really fascinated me
 

3169
01:10:35,239 --> 01:10:38,110
well one thing that really fascinated me
about this mechanism that we were

3170
01:10:38,110 --> 01:10:38,120
about this mechanism that we were
 

3171
01:10:38,120 --> 01:10:39,910
about this mechanism that we were
starting to look at and you know other

3172
01:10:39,910 --> 01:10:39,920
starting to look at and you know other
 

3173
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:41,680
starting to look at and you know other
groups started talking about very

3174
01:10:41,680 --> 01:10:41,690
groups started talking about very
 

3175
01:10:41,690 --> 01:10:45,070
groups started talking about very
similar things at the same time and and

3176
01:10:45,070 --> 01:10:45,080
similar things at the same time and and
 

3177
01:10:45,080 --> 01:10:47,050
similar things at the same time and and
then a kind of explosion of interest in

3178
01:10:47,050 --> 01:10:47,060
then a kind of explosion of interest in
 

3179
01:10:47,060 --> 01:10:48,310
then a kind of explosion of interest in
metal learning happened in the AI

3180
01:10:48,310 --> 01:10:48,320
metal learning happened in the AI
 

3181
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:50,800
metal learning happened in the AI
community shortly after that I don't

3182
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:50,810
community shortly after that I don't
 

3183
01:10:50,810 --> 01:10:51,879
community shortly after that I don't
know if we had anything to do with that

3184
01:10:51,879 --> 01:10:51,889
know if we had anything to do with that
 

3185
01:10:51,889 --> 01:10:54,640
know if we had anything to do with that
but but I was gratified to see that a

3186
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:54,650
but but I was gratified to see that a
 

3187
01:10:54,650 --> 01:10:56,379
but but I was gratified to see that a
lot of people started talking about meta

3188
01:10:56,379 --> 01:10:56,389
lot of people started talking about meta
 

3189
01:10:56,389 --> 01:10:58,899
lot of people started talking about meta
learning one of the things that I like

3190
01:10:58,899 --> 01:10:58,909
learning one of the things that I like
 

3191
01:10:58,909 --> 01:11:01,660
learning one of the things that I like
about the kind of flavor of meta

3192
01:11:01,660 --> 01:11:01,670
about the kind of flavor of meta
 

3193
01:11:01,670 --> 01:11:03,729
about the kind of flavor of meta
learning that we were studying was that

3194
01:11:03,729 --> 01:11:03,739
learning that we were studying was that
 

3195
01:11:03,739 --> 01:11:06,040
learning that we were studying was that
it didn't require anything special it

3196
01:11:06,040 --> 01:11:06,050
it didn't require anything special it
 

3197
01:11:06,050 --> 01:11:08,140
it didn't require anything special it
was just if you took a system that had

3198
01:11:08,140 --> 01:11:08,150
was just if you took a system that had
 

3199
01:11:08,150 --> 01:11:12,129
was just if you took a system that had
some form of memory that the function of

3200
01:11:12,129 --> 01:11:12,139
some form of memory that the function of
 

3201
01:11:12,139 --> 01:11:15,430
some form of memory that the function of
which could be shaped by picture RL

3202
01:11:15,430 --> 01:11:15,440
which could be shaped by picture RL
 

3203
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:17,979
which could be shaped by picture RL
algorithm then this would just happen

3204
01:11:17,979 --> 01:11:17,989
algorithm then this would just happen
 

3205
01:11:17,989 --> 01:11:20,229
algorithm then this would just happen
yes right I mean there there there are a

3206
01:11:20,229 --> 01:11:20,239
yes right I mean there there there are a
 

3207
01:11:20,239 --> 01:11:22,270
yes right I mean there there there are a
lot of forms of there are a lot of meta

3208
01:11:22,270 --> 01:11:22,280
lot of forms of there are a lot of meta
 

3209
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:23,439
lot of forms of there are a lot of meta
learning algorithms that have been

3210
01:11:23,439 --> 01:11:23,449
learning algorithms that have been
 

3211
01:11:23,449 --> 01:11:25,540
learning algorithms that have been
proposed since then that are fascinating

3212
01:11:25,540 --> 01:11:25,550
proposed since then that are fascinating
 

3213
01:11:25,550 --> 01:11:27,910
proposed since then that are fascinating
and effective in in their you know in

3214
01:11:27,910 --> 01:11:27,920
and effective in in their you know in
 

3215
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:30,129
and effective in in their you know in
their domains of application but they're

3216
01:11:30,129 --> 01:11:30,139
their domains of application but they're
 

3217
01:11:30,139 --> 01:11:31,780
their domains of application but they're
you know they're engineered they're

3218
01:11:31,780 --> 01:11:31,790
you know they're engineered they're
 

3219
01:11:31,790 --> 01:11:33,250
you know they're engineered they're
they're things that you had to say well

3220
01:11:33,250 --> 01:11:33,260
they're things that you had to say well
 

3221
01:11:33,260 --> 01:11:34,810
they're things that you had to say well
see if we wanted meta learning to happen

3222
01:11:34,810 --> 01:11:34,820
see if we wanted meta learning to happen
 

3223
01:11:34,820 --> 01:11:36,520
see if we wanted meta learning to happen
how would we do that here's an algorithm

3224
01:11:36,520 --> 01:11:36,530
how would we do that here's an algorithm
 

3225
01:11:36,530 --> 01:11:37,899
how would we do that here's an algorithm
that would but there's something about

3226
01:11:37,899 --> 01:11:37,909
that would but there's something about
 

3227
01:11:37,909 --> 01:11:39,939
that would but there's something about
the kind of meta learning that we were

3228
01:11:39,939 --> 01:11:39,949
the kind of meta learning that we were
 

3229
01:11:39,949 --> 01:11:42,669
the kind of meta learning that we were
studying that seemed to me special in

3230
01:11:42,669 --> 01:11:42,679
studying that seemed to me special in
 

3231
01:11:42,679 --> 01:11:45,129
studying that seemed to me special in
the sense that it wasn't an algorithm it

3232
01:11:45,129 --> 01:11:45,139
the sense that it wasn't an algorithm it
 

3233
01:11:45,139 --> 01:11:47,800
the sense that it wasn't an algorithm it
was just something that automatically

3234
01:11:47,800 --> 01:11:47,810
was just something that automatically
 

3235
01:11:47,810 --> 01:11:49,990
was just something that automatically
happened if you had a system that had

3236
01:11:49,990 --> 01:11:50,000
happened if you had a system that had
 

3237
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,330
happened if you had a system that had
memory and it was trained with a

3238
01:11:52,330 --> 01:11:52,340
memory and it was trained with a
 

3239
01:11:52,340 --> 01:11:54,629
memory and it was trained with a
reinforcement learning algorithm in and

3240
01:11:54,629 --> 01:11:54,639
reinforcement learning algorithm in and
 

3241
01:11:54,639 --> 01:11:58,330
reinforcement learning algorithm in and
in that sense it can be as meta as it

3242
01:11:58,330 --> 01:11:58,340
in that sense it can be as meta as it
 

3243
01:11:58,340 --> 01:12:00,490
in that sense it can be as meta as it
wants to be right it there's no limit on

3244
01:12:00,490 --> 01:12:00,500
wants to be right it there's no limit on
 

3245
01:12:00,500 --> 01:12:01,480
wants to be right it there's no limit on
how

3246
01:12:01,480 --> 01:12:01,490
how
 

3247
01:12:01,490 --> 01:12:04,180
how
abstract the the meta-learning can get

3248
01:12:04,180 --> 01:12:04,190
abstract the the meta-learning can get
 

3249
01:12:04,190 --> 01:12:07,120
abstract the the meta-learning can get
because it's not reliant on the human

3250
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:07,130
because it's not reliant on the human

3255
01:12:12,530 --> 01:12:16,330

I also I don't know I guess I hope that

3256
01:12:16,330 --> 01:12:16,340
I also I don't know I guess I hope that
 

3257
01:12:16,340 --> 01:12:18,190
I also I don't know I guess I hope that
that's relevant in the brain I think

3258
01:12:18,190 --> 01:12:18,200
that's relevant in the brain I think
 

3259
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:20,290
that's relevant in the brain I think
there's a kind of beauty in the in in

3260
01:12:20,290 --> 01:12:20,300
there's a kind of beauty in the in in
 

3261
01:12:20,300 --> 01:12:23,620
there's a kind of beauty in the in in
the ability of this emergent the

the ability of this emergent the
 

3263

the ability of this emergent the
emergent aspect of it yeah it's

01:12:25,110 --> 01:12:25,120
emergent aspect of it yeah it's
 

3265
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:27,700
emergent aspect of it yeah it's
engineered exactly it's something that

3266
01:12:27,700 --> 01:12:27,710

3267
01:12:27,710 --> 01:12:31,060

just it just happens in in in a sense in

01:12:31,060 --> 01:12:31,070
just it just happens in in in a sense in
 

3269
01:12:31,070 --> 01:12:33,010
just it just happens in in in a sense in
a sense you can't avoid this happening

3270
01:12:33,010 --> 01:12:33,020
a sense you can't avoid this happening
 

3271
01:12:33,020 --> 01:12:35,320
a sense you can't avoid this happening
if you have a system that has memory and

3281
01:12:47,270 --> 01:12:49,690

3286
01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:53,450

3287
01:12:53,450 --> 01:12:54,730

used a kind of slot based memory you

3294
01:13:02,350 --> 01:13:02,360
used a kind of slot based memory you
 

3295
01:13:02,360 --> 01:13:06,790
used a kind of slot based memory you
remember the title just it was memory

3296

3299
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:11,470

01:13:17,710 --> 01:13:17,720
know it was the same exact story you
 

3305
01:13:17,720 --> 01:13:20,920
know it was the same exact story you
know if you have a system with memory

01:13:20,930 --> 01:13:22,330
know if you have a system with memory
here it was a different kind of memory

3308
01:13:22,330 --> 01:13:22,340
here it was a different kind of memory
 

3309
01:13:22,340 --> 01:13:25,620
here it was a different kind of memory
but the function of that memory is

3310
01:13:25,620 --> 01:13:25,630
but the function of that memory is
 

3311
01:13:25,630 --> 01:13:30,250
but the function of that memory is
shaped by reinforcement learning here it

3312
01:13:30,250 --> 01:13:30,260
shaped by reinforcement learning here it
 

3313
01:13:30,260 --> 01:13:31,990
shaped by reinforcement learning here it
was the root you know the reads and

3314
01:13:31,990 --> 01:13:32,000
was the root you know the reads and
 

3315
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:35,200
was the root you know the reads and
writes that occurred on this slot based

3316
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:35,210
writes that occurred on this slot based
 

3317
01:13:35,210 --> 01:13:37,690
writes that occurred on this slot based
memory this yeah this will just happen

3318
01:13:37,690 --> 01:13:37,700
memory this yeah this will just happen
 

3319
01:13:37,700 --> 01:13:40,540
memory this yeah this will just happen
and and and so this but this brings us

3320
01:13:40,540 --> 01:13:40,550
and and and so this but this brings us
 

3321
01:13:40,550 --> 01:13:42,010
and and and so this but this brings us
back to something I was saying earlier

3322
01:13:42,010 --> 01:13:42,020
back to something I was saying earlier
 

3323
01:13:42,020 --> 01:13:44,290
back to something I was saying earlier
about the importance of the environment

3324
01:13:44,290 --> 01:13:44,300
about the importance of the environment
 

3325
01:13:44,300 --> 01:13:49,060
about the importance of the environment
the this this will happen if the system

3326
01:13:49,060 --> 01:13:49,070
the this this will happen if the system
 

3327
01:13:49,070 --> 01:13:50,830
the this this will happen if the system
is being trained in a setting where

3328
01:13:50,830 --> 01:13:50,840
is being trained in a setting where
 

3329
01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:53,200
is being trained in a setting where
there's like a sequence of tasks that

3330
01:13:53,200 --> 01:13:53,210
there's like a sequence of tasks that
 

3331
01:13:53,210 --> 01:13:55,900
there's like a sequence of tasks that
all share some abstract structure you

3332
01:13:55,900 --> 01:13:55,910
all share some abstract structure you
 

3333
01:13:55,910 --> 01:13:57,430
all share some abstract structure you
know sometimes talk about tasks

3334
01:13:57,430 --> 01:13:57,440
know sometimes talk about tasks
 

3335
01:13:57,440 --> 01:14:00,580
know sometimes talk about tasks
distributions and that's something

3336
01:14:00,580 --> 01:14:00,590
distributions and that's something
 

3337
01:14:00,590 --> 01:14:05,140
distributions and that's something
that's very obviously true of the world

3338
01:14:05,140 --> 01:14:05,150
that's very obviously true of the world
 

3339
01:14:05,150 --> 01:14:08,830
that's very obviously true of the world
that humans inhabit we're we're

3340
01:14:08,830 --> 01:14:08,840
that humans inhabit we're we're
 

3341
01:14:08,840 --> 01:14:10,150
that humans inhabit we're we're
constantly like if you just kind of

3342
01:14:10,150 --> 01:14:10,160
constantly like if you just kind of
 

3343
01:14:10,160 --> 01:14:12,470
constantly like if you just kind of
think about what you do every day

3344
01:14:12,470 --> 01:14:12,480
think about what you do every day
 

3345
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:15,720
think about what you do every day
you never you never do exactly the same

3346
01:14:15,720 --> 01:14:15,730
you never you never do exactly the same
 

3347
01:14:15,730 --> 01:14:17,760
you never you never do exactly the same
thing that you did the day before but

3348
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:17,770
thing that you did the day before but
 

3349
01:14:17,770 --> 01:14:19,860
thing that you did the day before but
everything that you do is sort of has a

3350
01:14:19,860 --> 01:14:19,870
everything that you do is sort of has a
 

3351
01:14:19,870 --> 01:14:21,840
everything that you do is sort of has a
family resemblance it shares structure

3352
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:21,850
family resemblance it shares structure
 

3353
01:14:21,850 --> 01:14:23,490
family resemblance it shares structure
with something that you did before and

3354
01:14:23,490 --> 01:14:23,500
with something that you did before and
 

3355
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:26,399
with something that you did before and
so you know the the real world is sort

3356
01:14:26,399 --> 01:14:26,409
so you know the the real world is sort
 

3357
01:14:26,409 --> 01:14:31,040
so you know the the real world is sort
of you know saturated with this kind of

3358
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:31,050
of you know saturated with this kind of
 

3359
01:14:31,050 --> 01:14:34,760
of you know saturated with this kind of
this property it's an endless variety

3360
01:14:34,760 --> 01:14:34,770
this property it's an endless variety
 

3361
01:14:34,770 --> 01:14:38,160
this property it's an endless variety
with endless redundancy and that's the

3362
01:14:38,160 --> 01:14:38,170
with endless redundancy and that's the
 

3363
01:14:38,170 --> 01:14:39,629
with endless redundancy and that's the
setting in which this kind of meta

3364
01:14:39,629 --> 01:14:39,639
setting in which this kind of meta
 

3365
01:14:39,639 --> 01:14:41,610
setting in which this kind of meta
learning happens and it does seem like

3366
01:14:41,610 --> 01:14:41,620
learning happens and it does seem like
 

3367
01:14:41,620 --> 01:14:45,450
learning happens and it does seem like
we're just so good at finding just like

3368
01:14:45,450 --> 01:14:45,460
we're just so good at finding just like
 

3369
01:14:45,460 --> 01:14:47,760
we're just so good at finding just like
in this emergent phenomena you describe

01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:47,770
in this emergent phenomena you describe
 

3371
01:14:47,770 --> 01:14:49,260
in this emergent phenomena you describe
we're really good at finding that

01:14:49,260 --> 01:14:49,270
we're really good at finding that
 

3373
01:14:49,270 --> 01:14:51,360
we're really good at finding that
redundancy finding those similarities

the family resemblance some people call

3376
01:14:54,149 --> 01:14:54,159
the family resemblance some people call
 

3377
01:14:54,159 --> 01:14:56,280
the family resemblance some people call
it sort of what is it

Melanie Mitchell was talking about

3380
01:14:57,629 --> 01:14:57,639
Melanie Mitchell was talking about
 

3381
01:14:57,639 --> 01:15:00,300
Melanie Mitchell was talking about
analogies so we were able to connect

3382
01:15:00,300 --> 01:15:00,310
analogies so we were able to connect
 

3383
01:15:00,310 --> 01:15:03,030
analogies so we were able to connect
concepts together in in this kind of way

bit about dopamine you have really

3398
01:15:20,790 --> 01:15:20,800
bit about dopamine you have really
 

3399
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:24,000
bit about dopamine you have really
you're a part of co-authoring really

3400
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:24,010
you're a part of co-authoring really
 

3401

describe the key ideas of that paper

3408
01:15:34,140 --> 01:15:34,150
describe the key ideas of that paper
 

3409
01:15:34,150 --> 01:15:36,300
describe the key ideas of that paper
sure yeah I mean one thing I want to

3410
01:15:36,300 --> 01:15:36,310
sure yeah I mean one thing I want to
 

3411
01:15:36,310 --> 01:15:38,820
sure yeah I mean one thing I want to
pause to do is acknowledge my co-authors

3412
01:15:38,820 --> 01:15:38,830
pause to do is acknowledge my co-authors
 

3413
01:15:38,830 --> 01:15:41,160
pause to do is acknowledge my co-authors
on actually both of the papers we're

3414
01:15:41,160 --> 01:15:41,170
on actually both of the papers we're
 

3415
01:15:41,170 --> 01:15:42,570
on actually both of the papers we're
talking about so the this dopamine I'll

3416
01:15:42,570 --> 01:15:42,580
talking about so the this dopamine I'll
 

3417
01:15:42,580 --> 01:15:45,450
talking about so the this dopamine I'll
just I'll certainly post all their names

3418
01:15:45,450 --> 01:15:45,460
just I'll certainly post all their names
 

3419
01:15:45,460 --> 01:15:48,450
just I'll certainly post all their names
okay wonderful yeah as I you know I I'm

3420
01:15:48,450 --> 01:15:48,460
okay wonderful yeah as I you know I I'm
 

3421
01:15:48,460 --> 01:15:50,310
okay wonderful yeah as I you know I I'm
sort of abashed to be the spokesperson

3422
01:15:50,310 --> 01:15:50,320
sort of abashed to be the spokesperson
 

3423
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:52,919
sort of abashed to be the spokesperson
for these papers when I had such amazing

3424
01:15:52,919 --> 01:15:52,929
for these papers when I had such amazing
 

3425
01:15:52,929 --> 01:15:56,070
for these papers when I had such amazing
collaborators on both so it's a it's a

3426
01:15:56,070 --> 01:15:56,080
collaborators on both so it's a it's a
 

3427
01:15:56,080 --> 01:15:57,479
collaborators on both so it's a it's a
comfort to me to know that you all have

3428
01:15:57,479 --> 01:15:57,489
comfort to me to know that you all have
 

3429
01:15:57,489 --> 01:15:58,860
comfort to me to know that you all have
you all acknowledge that yeah it's not

3430
01:15:58,860 --> 01:15:58,870
you all acknowledge that yeah it's not
 

3431
01:15:58,870 --> 01:16:00,360
you all acknowledge that yeah it's not
an incredible team there but yeah so

3432
01:16:00,360 --> 01:16:00,370
an incredible team there but yeah so
 

3433
01:16:00,370 --> 01:16:03,120
an incredible team there but yeah so
yeah it's such a it's so much fun and

3434
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:03,130
yeah it's such a it's so much fun and
 

3435
01:16:03,130 --> 01:16:05,310
yeah it's such a it's so much fun and
and in the case of the the dopamine

3436
01:16:05,310 --> 01:16:05,320
and in the case of the the dopamine
 

3437
01:16:05,320 --> 01:16:08,189
and in the case of the the dopamine
paper we also collaborated with now

3438
01:16:08,189 --> 01:16:08,199
paper we also collaborated with now
 

3439
01:16:08,199 --> 01:16:10,470
paper we also collaborated with now
ochite at Harvard who you know what a

3440
01:16:10,470 --> 01:16:10,480
ochite at Harvard who you know what a
 

3441
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:11,820
ochite at Harvard who you know what a
paper simply wouldn't happened without

3442
01:16:11,820 --> 01:16:11,830
paper simply wouldn't happened without
 

3443
01:16:11,830 --> 01:16:15,660
paper simply wouldn't happened without
him but so so you were asking for like a

3444
01:16:15,660 --> 01:16:15,670
him but so so you were asking for like a
 

3445
01:16:15,670 --> 01:16:18,629
him but so so you were asking for like a
thumbnail sketch of yes thumbnail sketch

3446
01:16:18,629 --> 01:16:18,639
thumbnail sketch of yes thumbnail sketch
 

3447
01:16:18,639 --> 01:16:21,450
thumbnail sketch of yes thumbnail sketch
or key ideas or you know things the

3448
01:16:21,450 --> 01:16:21,460
or key ideas or you know things the
 

3449
01:16:21,460 --> 01:16:23,370
or key ideas or you know things the
insights that no continued on our kind

3450
01:16:23,370 --> 01:16:23,380
insights that no continued on our kind
 

3451
01:16:23,380 --> 01:16:25,600
insights that no continued on our kind
of discussion here between euros

3452
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:25,610
of discussion here between euros
 

3453
01:16:25,610 --> 01:16:28,570
of discussion here between euros
and yeah yeah I mean this was another a

3454
01:16:28,570 --> 01:16:28,580
and yeah yeah I mean this was another a
 

3455
01:16:28,580 --> 01:16:30,490
and yeah yeah I mean this was another a
lot of the work that we've done so far

3456
01:16:30,490 --> 01:16:30,500
lot of the work that we've done so far
 

3457
01:16:30,500 --> 01:16:34,270
lot of the work that we've done so far
is taking ideas that have bubbled up in

3458
01:16:34,270 --> 01:16:34,280
is taking ideas that have bubbled up in
 

3459
01:16:34,280 --> 01:16:38,920
is taking ideas that have bubbled up in
AI and you know asking the question of

3460
01:16:38,920 --> 01:16:38,930
AI and you know asking the question of
 

3461
01:16:38,930 --> 01:16:40,210
AI and you know asking the question of
whether the brain might be doing

3462
01:16:40,210 --> 01:16:40,220
whether the brain might be doing
 

3463
01:16:40,220 --> 01:16:43,840
whether the brain might be doing
something related which I think on the

3464
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:43,850
something related which I think on the
 

3465
01:16:43,850 --> 01:16:45,550
something related which I think on the
surface sounds like something that's

3466
01:16:45,550 --> 01:16:45,560
surface sounds like something that's
 

3467
01:16:45,560 --> 01:16:49,540
surface sounds like something that's
really mainly of use to neuroscience we

3468
01:16:49,540 --> 01:16:49,550
really mainly of use to neuroscience we
 

3469
01:16:49,550 --> 01:16:53,680
really mainly of use to neuroscience we
see it also as a way of validating what

3470
01:16:53,680 --> 01:16:53,690
see it also as a way of validating what
 

3471
01:16:53,690 --> 01:16:55,930
see it also as a way of validating what
we're doing on the AI side if we can

3472
01:16:55,930 --> 01:16:55,940
we're doing on the AI side if we can
 

3473
01:16:55,940 --> 01:16:58,000
we're doing on the AI side if we can
gain some evidence that the brain is

3474
01:16:58,000 --> 01:16:58,010
gain some evidence that the brain is
 

3475
01:16:58,010 --> 01:17:00,880
gain some evidence that the brain is
using some technique that we've been

3476
01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:00,890
using some technique that we've been
 

3477
01:17:00,890 --> 01:17:04,810
using some technique that we've been
trying out in our AI work that gives us

3478
01:17:04,810 --> 01:17:04,820
trying out in our AI work that gives us
 

3479
01:17:04,820 --> 01:17:06,760
trying out in our AI work that gives us
confidence that you know it may be a

3480
01:17:06,760 --> 01:17:06,770
confidence that you know it may be a
 

3481
01:17:06,770 --> 01:17:09,850
confidence that you know it may be a
good idea that it'll you know scale to

3482
01:17:09,850 --> 01:17:09,860
good idea that it'll you know scale to
 

3483
01:17:09,860 --> 01:17:13,420
good idea that it'll you know scale to
rich complex tasks that it'll interface

3484
01:17:13,420 --> 01:17:13,430
rich complex tasks that it'll interface
 

3485
01:17:13,430 --> 01:17:15,610
rich complex tasks that it'll interface
well with other mechanisms so you see is

3486
01:17:15,610 --> 01:17:15,620
well with other mechanisms so you see is
 

3487
01:17:15,620 --> 01:17:17,590
well with other mechanisms so you see is
a two-way Road yeah for just because a

3488
01:17:17,590 --> 01:17:17,600
a two-way Road yeah for just because a
 

3489
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:19,510
a two-way Road yeah for just because a
particular paper is a little bit focused

3490
01:17:19,510 --> 01:17:19,520
particular paper is a little bit focused
 

3491
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:22,600
particular paper is a little bit focused
on from one to the from a yeah from

3492
01:17:22,600 --> 01:17:22,610
on from one to the from a yeah from
 

3493
01:17:22,610 --> 01:17:25,110
on from one to the from a yeah from
you'll network's to neuroscience

3494
01:17:25,110 --> 01:17:25,120
you'll network's to neuroscience
 

3495
01:17:25,120 --> 01:17:27,610
you'll network's to neuroscience
ultimately the discussion the thinking

3496
01:17:27,610 --> 01:17:27,620
ultimately the discussion the thinking
 

3497
01:17:27,620 --> 01:17:30,880
ultimately the discussion the thinking
the productive long-term aspect of it is

3498
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:30,890
the productive long-term aspect of it is
 

3499
01:17:30,890 --> 01:17:32,980
the productive long-term aspect of it is
the the two-way Road nature of the whole

3500
01:17:32,980 --> 01:17:32,990
the the two-way Road nature of the whole
 

3501
01:17:32,990 --> 01:17:35,170
the the two-way Road nature of the whole
and yeah I mean we we've talked about

3502
01:17:35,170 --> 01:17:35,180
and yeah I mean we we've talked about
 

3503
01:17:35,180 --> 01:17:37,780
and yeah I mean we we've talked about
the notion of a virtuous circle between

3504
01:17:37,780 --> 01:17:37,790
the notion of a virtuous circle between
 

3505
01:17:37,790 --> 01:17:40,900
the notion of a virtuous circle between
AI and neuroscience and you know the way

3506
01:17:40,900 --> 01:17:40,910
AI and neuroscience and you know the way
 

3507
01:17:40,910 --> 01:17:45,340
AI and neuroscience and you know the way
I see it that's always been there since

3508
01:17:45,340 --> 01:17:45,350
I see it that's always been there since
 

3509
01:17:45,350 --> 01:17:46,780
I see it that's always been there since
the two fields

3510
01:17:46,780 --> 01:17:46,790
the two fields
 

3511
01:17:46,790 --> 01:17:50,560
the two fields
you know jointly existed there have been

3512
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:50,570
you know jointly existed there have been
 

3513
01:17:50,570 --> 01:17:52,810
you know jointly existed there have been
some phases in that history when AI was

3514
01:17:52,810 --> 01:17:52,820
some phases in that history when AI was
 

3515
01:17:52,820 --> 01:17:54,490
some phases in that history when AI was
sort of ahead there are some phases when

3516
01:17:54,490 --> 01:17:54,500
sort of ahead there are some phases when
 

3517
01:17:54,500 --> 01:17:56,590
sort of ahead there are some phases when
neuroscience was sort of ahead I feel

3518
01:17:56,590 --> 01:17:56,600
neuroscience was sort of ahead I feel
 

3519
01:17:56,600 --> 01:18:00,520
neuroscience was sort of ahead I feel
like given the bursts of innovation

3520
01:18:00,520 --> 01:18:00,530
like given the bursts of innovation
 

3521
01:18:00,530 --> 01:18:02,910
like given the bursts of innovation
that's happened recently on the AI side

3522
01:18:02,910 --> 01:18:02,920
that's happened recently on the AI side
 

3523
01:18:02,920 --> 01:18:05,770
that's happened recently on the AI side
AI is kind of ahead in the sense that

3524
01:18:05,770 --> 01:18:05,780
AI is kind of ahead in the sense that
 

3525
01:18:05,780 --> 01:18:08,410
AI is kind of ahead in the sense that
they're all of these ideas that we you

3526
01:18:08,410 --> 01:18:08,420
they're all of these ideas that we you
 

3527
01:18:08,420 --> 01:18:11,680
they're all of these ideas that we you
know we you know for which it's exciting

3528
01:18:11,680 --> 01:18:11,690
know we you know for which it's exciting
 

3529
01:18:11,690 --> 01:18:13,870
know we you know for which it's exciting
to consider that there might be neural

3530
01:18:13,870 --> 01:18:13,880
to consider that there might be neural
 

3531
01:18:13,880 --> 01:18:18,520
to consider that there might be neural
analogs and neuroscience

3532
01:18:18,520 --> 01:18:18,530
analogs and neuroscience
 

3533
01:18:18,530 --> 01:18:21,490
analogs and neuroscience
you know in a sense has been focusing on

3534
01:18:21,490 --> 01:18:21,500
you know in a sense has been focusing on
 

3535
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:23,740
you know in a sense has been focusing on
approaches to studying behavior that

3536
01:18:23,740 --> 01:18:23,750
approaches to studying behavior that
 

3537
01:18:23,750 --> 01:18:25,720
approaches to studying behavior that
come from you know that are kind of

3538
01:18:25,720 --> 01:18:25,730
come from you know that are kind of
 

3539
01:18:25,730 --> 01:18:27,520
come from you know that are kind of
derived from this earlier era of

3540
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:27,530
derived from this earlier era of
 

3541
01:18:27,530 --> 01:18:30,880
derived from this earlier era of
cognitive psychology and you know so in

3542
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:30,890
cognitive psychology and you know so in
 

3543
01:18:30,890 --> 01:18:33,910
cognitive psychology and you know so in
some ways fail to connect with some of

3544
01:18:33,910 --> 01:18:33,920
some ways fail to connect with some of
 

3545
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:35,860
some ways fail to connect with some of
the issues that we're you know grappling

3546
01:18:35,860 --> 01:18:35,870
the issues that we're you know grappling
 

3547
01:18:35,870 --> 01:18:37,720
the issues that we're you know grappling
with in AI like how do we deal with you

3548
01:18:37,720 --> 01:18:37,730
with in AI like how do we deal with you
 

3549
01:18:37,730 --> 01:18:38,200
with in AI like how do we deal with you
know

3550
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:38,210
know
 

3551
01:18:38,210 --> 01:18:43,510
know
you know complex environments but I've

3552
01:18:43,510 --> 01:18:43,520
you know complex environments but I've
 

3553
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:45,100
you know complex environments but I've
you know I think it's inevitable that

3554
01:18:45,100 --> 01:18:45,110
you know I think it's inevitable that
 

3555
01:18:45,110 --> 01:18:48,130
you know I think it's inevitable that
this circle will keep turning and there

3556
01:18:48,130 --> 01:18:48,140
this circle will keep turning and there
 

3557
01:18:48,140 --> 01:18:49,990
this circle will keep turning and there
will be a moment in the not too

3558
01:18:49,990 --> 01:18:50,000
will be a moment in the not too
 

3559
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:51,630
will be a moment in the not too
different distant future when

3560
01:18:51,630 --> 01:18:51,640
different distant future when
 

3561
01:18:51,640 --> 01:18:54,490
different distant future when
neuroscience is pelting AI researchers

3562
01:18:54,490 --> 01:18:54,500
neuroscience is pelting AI researchers
 

3563
01:18:54,500 --> 01:18:57,130
neuroscience is pelting AI researchers
with insights that may change the

3564
01:18:57,130 --> 01:18:57,140
with insights that may change the
 

3565
01:18:57,140 --> 01:18:58,990
with insights that may change the
direction of our work just as just a

3566
01:18:58,990 --> 01:18:59,000
direction of our work just as just a
 

3567
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:02,459
direction of our work just as just a
quick human question is it you have

3568
01:19:02,459 --> 01:19:02,469
quick human question is it you have
 

3569
01:19:02,469 --> 01:19:06,070
quick human question is it you have
parts of your brain this is very meta

3570
01:19:06,070 --> 01:19:06,080
parts of your brain this is very meta
 

3571
01:19:06,080 --> 01:19:08,440
parts of your brain this is very meta
but they're able to both think about

3572
01:19:08,440 --> 01:19:08,450
but they're able to both think about
 

3573
01:19:08,450 --> 01:19:11,020
but they're able to both think about
neuroscience and AI you know I don't

3574
01:19:11,020 --> 01:19:11,030
neuroscience and AI you know I don't
 

3575
01:19:11,030 --> 01:19:15,220
neuroscience and AI you know I don't
often meet people like that do you do

3576
01:19:15,220 --> 01:19:15,230
often meet people like that do you do
 

3577
01:19:15,230 --> 01:19:18,580
often meet people like that do you do
you think let me ask a meta plasticity

3578
01:19:18,580 --> 01:19:18,590
you think let me ask a meta plasticity
 

3579
01:19:18,590 --> 01:19:21,400
you think let me ask a meta plasticity
question you think a human being can be

3580
01:19:21,400 --> 01:19:21,410
question you think a human being can be
 

3581
01:19:21,410 --> 01:19:23,800
question you think a human being can be
both good at AI and neuroscience is like

3582
01:19:23,800 --> 01:19:23,810
both good at AI and neuroscience is like
 

3583
01:19:23,810 --> 01:19:26,830
both good at AI and neuroscience is like
what on the team at deep mind what kind

3584
01:19:26,830 --> 01:19:26,840
what on the team at deep mind what kind
 

3585
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:29,800
what on the team at deep mind what kind
of human can occupy these two realms and

3586
01:19:29,800 --> 01:19:29,810
of human can occupy these two realms and
 

3587
01:19:29,810 --> 01:19:31,959
of human can occupy these two realms and
is that something you see everybody

3588
01:19:31,959 --> 01:19:31,969
is that something you see everybody
 

3589
01:19:31,969 --> 01:19:35,170
is that something you see everybody
should be doing can be doing or is it a

3590
01:19:35,170 --> 01:19:35,180
should be doing can be doing or is it a
 

3591
01:19:35,180 --> 01:19:37,540
should be doing can be doing or is it a
very special few can kind of jump just

3592
01:19:37,540 --> 01:19:37,550
very special few can kind of jump just
 

3593
01:19:37,550 --> 01:19:38,920
very special few can kind of jump just
like we thought about our history I

3594
01:19:38,920 --> 01:19:38,930
like we thought about our history I
 

3595
01:19:38,930 --> 01:19:41,020
like we thought about our history I
would think it's a special person that

3596
01:19:41,020 --> 01:19:41,030
would think it's a special person that
 

3597
01:19:41,030 --> 01:19:44,380
would think it's a special person that
can major in art history and also

3598
01:19:44,380 --> 01:19:44,390
can major in art history and also
 

3599
01:19:44,390 --> 01:19:47,410
can major in art history and also
consider being a surgeon otherwise known

3600
01:19:47,410 --> 01:19:47,420
consider being a surgeon otherwise known
 

3601
01:19:47,420 --> 01:19:51,240
consider being a surgeon otherwise known
as a dilettante yeah easily distracted

3602
01:19:51,240 --> 01:19:51,250
as a dilettante yeah easily distracted
 

3603
01:19:51,250 --> 01:19:58,150
as a dilettante yeah easily distracted
no I I think it does take a special kind

3604
01:19:58,150 --> 01:19:58,160
no I I think it does take a special kind
 

3605
01:19:58,160 --> 01:20:01,270
no I I think it does take a special kind
of person to be truly world-class at

3606
01:20:01,270 --> 01:20:01,280
of person to be truly world-class at
 

3607
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:03,520
of person to be truly world-class at
both AI and neuroscience and I am not on

01:20:03,520 --> 01:20:03,530
both AI and neuroscience and I am not on
 

3609
01:20:03,530 --> 01:20:08,260
both AI and neuroscience and I am not on
that list I happen to be someone who

3610
01:20:08,260 --> 01:20:08,270
that list I happen to be someone who
 

3611
01:20:08,270 --> 01:20:10,330
that list I happen to be someone who
whose interest in neuroscience and

whose interest in neuroscience and
 

3613
01:20:10,340 --> 01:20:16,030
whose interest in neuroscience and
psychology involved using the kinds of

central in AI and that sort of I guess

3618
01:20:22,720 --> 01:20:22,730
central in AI and that sort of I guess
 

3619
01:20:22,730 --> 01:20:25,690
central in AI and that sort of I guess
bought me a ticket to be involved in all

3620
01:20:25,690 --> 01:20:25,700
bought me a ticket to be involved in all
 

3621
01:20:25,700 --> 01:20:27,070
bought me a ticket to be involved in all
of the amazing things that are going on

3622
01:20:27,070 --> 01:20:27,080
of the amazing things that are going on
 

3623
01:20:27,080 --> 01:20:30,700
of the amazing things that are going on
in AI research right now I do know a few

3624
01:20:30,700 --> 01:20:30,710
in AI research right now I do know a few
 

3625
01:20:30,710 --> 01:20:33,010
in AI research right now I do know a few
people who I would consider pretty

3626
01:20:33,010 --> 01:20:33,020
people who I would consider pretty
 

3627
01:20:33,020 --> 01:20:35,290
people who I would consider pretty
expert on both fronts and I won't

3628
01:20:35,290 --> 01:20:35,300
expert on both fronts and I won't
 

3629
01:20:35,300 --> 01:20:37,030
expert on both fronts and I won't
embarrass them by naming them but you

3630
01:20:37,030 --> 01:20:37,040
embarrass them by naming them but you
 

3631
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:38,260
embarrass them by naming them but you
know there are there are like

3632
01:20:38,260 --> 01:20:38,270
know there are there are like
 

3633
01:20:38,270 --> 01:20:40,870
know there are there are like
exceptional people out there who are

3634
01:20:40,870 --> 01:20:40,880
exceptional people out there who are
 

3635
01:20:40,880 --> 01:20:42,729
exceptional people out there who are
like this the the one the one thing that

3636
01:20:42,729 --> 01:20:42,739
like this the the one the one thing that
 

3637
01:20:42,739 --> 01:20:47,320
like this the the one the one thing that
I find is a is a barrier to being truly

3638
01:20:47,320 --> 01:20:47,330
I find is a is a barrier to being truly
 

3639
01:20:47,330 --> 01:20:51,700
I find is a is a barrier to being truly
world-class on both fronts is is the

3640
01:20:51,700 --> 01:20:51,710
world-class on both fronts is is the
 

3641
01:20:51,710 --> 01:20:52,620
world-class on both fronts is is the
just the

3642
01:20:52,620 --> 01:20:52,630
just the
 

3643
01:20:52,630 --> 01:20:55,260
just the
the complexity of the technology that's

3644
01:20:55,260 --> 01:20:55,270
the complexity of the technology that's
 

3645
01:20:55,270 --> 01:21:00,090
the complexity of the technology that's
involved in both disciplines now so the

3646
01:21:00,090 --> 01:21:00,100
involved in both disciplines now so the
 

3647
01:21:00,100 --> 01:21:02,459
involved in both disciplines now so the
the engineering expertise that it takes

3648
01:21:02,459 --> 01:21:02,469
the engineering expertise that it takes
 

3649
01:21:02,469 --> 01:21:04,530
the engineering expertise that it takes
to to do

3650
01:21:04,530 --> 01:21:04,540
to to do
 

3651
01:21:04,540 --> 01:21:06,840
to to do
you know truly frontline hands-on AI

3652
01:21:06,840 --> 01:21:06,850
you know truly frontline hands-on AI
 

3653
01:21:06,850 --> 01:21:10,350
you know truly frontline hands-on AI
research is really really considerable

3654
01:21:10,350 --> 01:21:10,360
research is really really considerable
 

3655
01:21:10,360 --> 01:21:12,209
research is really really considerable
the learning curve of the tools just

3656
01:21:12,209 --> 01:21:12,219
the learning curve of the tools just
 

3657
01:21:12,219 --> 01:21:14,760
the learning curve of the tools just
like the specifics of just whether it's

3658
01:21:14,760 --> 01:21:14,770
like the specifics of just whether it's
 

3659
01:21:14,770 --> 01:21:16,020
like the specifics of just whether it's
programming or the kind of tools

3660
01:21:16,020 --> 01:21:16,030
programming or the kind of tools
 

3661
01:21:16,030 --> 01:21:18,030
programming or the kind of tools
necessary to collect the data to manage

3662
01:21:18,030 --> 01:21:18,040
necessary to collect the data to manage
 

3663
01:21:18,040 --> 01:21:20,040
necessary to collect the data to manage
the data to distribute to compute all

3664
01:21:20,040 --> 01:21:20,050
the data to distribute to compute all
 

3665
01:21:20,050 --> 01:21:21,300
the data to distribute to compute all
that kind of stuff yeah and on the

3666
01:21:21,300 --> 01:21:21,310
that kind of stuff yeah and on the
 

3667
01:21:21,310 --> 01:21:22,770
that kind of stuff yeah and on the
neuroscience I guess side there'll be

3668
01:21:22,770 --> 01:21:22,780
neuroscience I guess side there'll be
 

3669
01:21:22,780 --> 01:21:25,200
neuroscience I guess side there'll be
all different sets of tools exactly

3670
01:21:25,200 --> 01:21:25,210
all different sets of tools exactly
 

3671
01:21:25,210 --> 01:21:27,120
all different sets of tools exactly
especially with the recent explosion in

3672
01:21:27,120 --> 01:21:27,130
especially with the recent explosion in
 

3673
01:21:27,130 --> 01:21:29,910
especially with the recent explosion in
you know in neuroscience methods so but

3674
01:21:29,910 --> 01:21:29,920
you know in neuroscience methods so but
 

3675
01:21:29,920 --> 01:21:31,919
you know in neuroscience methods so but
but how you know so having said all that

3676
01:21:31,919 --> 01:21:31,929
but how you know so having said all that
 

3677
01:21:31,929 --> 01:21:35,610
but how you know so having said all that
I I think I think the rule I think the

3678
01:21:35,610 --> 01:21:35,620
I I think I think the rule I think the
 

3679
01:21:35,620 --> 01:21:40,160
I I think I think the rule I think the
best scenario for both neuroscience and

3680
01:21:40,160 --> 01:21:40,170
best scenario for both neuroscience and
 

3681
01:21:40,170 --> 01:21:45,930
best scenario for both neuroscience and
AI is to have people who interacting who

3682
01:21:45,930 --> 01:21:45,940
AI is to have people who interacting who
 

3683
01:21:45,940 --> 01:21:48,750
AI is to have people who interacting who
live at every point on this spectrum

3684
01:21:48,750 --> 01:21:48,760
live at every point on this spectrum
 

3685
01:21:48,760 --> 01:21:52,229
live at every point on this spectrum
from exclusively focused on neuroscience

3686
01:21:52,229 --> 01:21:52,239
from exclusively focused on neuroscience
 

3687
01:21:52,239 --> 01:21:54,930
from exclusively focused on neuroscience
to exclusively focused on the

01:21:54,930 --> 01:21:54,940
to exclusively focused on the
 

3689
01:21:54,940 --> 01:21:57,479
to exclusively focused on the
engineering side of AI but but to have

3690
01:21:57,479 --> 01:21:57,489
engineering side of AI but but to have
 

3691
01:21:57,489 --> 01:22:01,200
engineering side of AI but but to have
those people you know inhabiting a

3692
01:22:01,200 --> 01:22:01,210
those people you know inhabiting a
 

3693
01:22:01,210 --> 01:22:03,300
those people you know inhabiting a
community where they're talking to

3694
01:22:03,300 --> 01:22:03,310
community where they're talking to
 

3695
01:22:03,310 --> 01:22:05,189
community where they're talking to
people who live elsewhere on the on the

3696
01:22:05,189 --> 01:22:05,199
people who live elsewhere on the on the
 

3697
01:22:05,199 --> 01:22:07,260
people who live elsewhere on the on the
spectrum and I be I may be someone who's

3698
01:22:07,260 --> 01:22:07,270
spectrum and I be I may be someone who's
 

3699
01:22:07,270 --> 01:22:10,229
spectrum and I be I may be someone who's
very close to the center in in the sense

3700
01:22:10,229 --> 01:22:10,239
very close to the center in in the sense
 

3701
01:22:10,239 --> 01:22:12,540
very close to the center in in the sense
that I have one foot in the neuroscience

3702
01:22:12,540 --> 01:22:12,550
that I have one foot in the neuroscience
 

3703
01:22:12,550 --> 01:22:14,939
that I have one foot in the neuroscience
world and one foot in the AI world in

3704
01:22:14,939 --> 01:22:14,949
world and one foot in the AI world in
 

3705
01:22:14,949 --> 01:22:17,340
world and one foot in the AI world in
and and that central position I will

3706
01:22:17,340 --> 01:22:17,350
and and that central position I will
 

3707
01:22:17,350 --> 01:22:20,129
and and that central position I will
admit prevents me at least someone with

3708
01:22:20,129 --> 01:22:20,139
admit prevents me at least someone with
 

3709
01:22:20,139 --> 01:22:22,830
admit prevents me at least someone with
my limited cognitive capacity from being

3710
01:22:22,830 --> 01:22:22,840
my limited cognitive capacity from being
 

3711
01:22:22,840 --> 01:22:25,350
my limited cognitive capacity from being
a truly you know true having true

3712
01:22:25,350 --> 01:22:25,360
a truly you know true having true
 

3713
01:22:25,360 --> 01:22:26,939
a truly you know true having true
technical expertise in any you know

3714
01:22:26,939 --> 01:22:26,949
technical expertise in any you know
 

3715
01:22:26,949 --> 01:22:30,450
technical expertise in any you know
either domain but at the same time I at

3716
01:22:30,450 --> 01:22:30,460
either domain but at the same time I at
 

3717
01:22:30,460 --> 01:22:32,100
either domain but at the same time I at
least hope that it's worthwhile having

3718
01:22:32,100 --> 01:22:32,110
least hope that it's worthwhile having
 

3719
01:22:32,110 --> 01:22:34,590
least hope that it's worthwhile having
people around who can kind of you know

3720
01:22:34,590 --> 01:22:34,600
people around who can kind of you know
 

3721
01:22:34,600 --> 01:22:37,290
people around who can kind of you know
see the connections if the community the

3722
01:22:37,290 --> 01:22:37,300
see the connections if the community the
 

3723
01:22:37,300 --> 01:22:40,169
see the connections if the community the
yeah the the emergent intelligence of

3724
01:22:40,169 --> 01:22:40,179
yeah the the emergent intelligence of
 

3725
01:22:40,179 --> 01:22:41,720
yeah the the emergent intelligence of
the community yeah yeah that's nicely

3726
01:22:41,720 --> 01:22:41,730
the community yeah yeah that's nicely
 

3727
01:22:41,730 --> 01:22:44,970
the community yeah yeah that's nicely
distributed is useful okay exactly yeah

3728
01:22:44,970 --> 01:22:44,980
distributed is useful okay exactly yeah
 

3729
01:22:44,980 --> 01:22:46,500
distributed is useful okay exactly yeah
so hopefully but I mean I've seen that

3730
01:22:46,500 --> 01:22:46,510
so hopefully but I mean I've seen that
 

3731
01:22:46,510 --> 01:22:48,390
so hopefully but I mean I've seen that
work I've seen that work out well at D

3732
01:22:48,390 --> 01:22:48,400
work I've seen that work out well at D
 

3733
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:51,330
work I've seen that work out well at D
mind there there are there are people

3734
01:22:51,330 --> 01:22:51,340
mind there there are there are people
 

3735
01:22:51,340 --> 01:22:54,300
mind there there are there are people
who I mean even if you just focus on the

3736
01:22:54,300 --> 01:22:54,310
who I mean even if you just focus on the
 

3737
01:22:54,310 --> 01:22:56,550
who I mean even if you just focus on the
AI work that happens a deep mind it's

3738
01:22:56,550 --> 01:22:56,560
AI work that happens a deep mind it's
 

3739
01:22:56,560 --> 01:22:59,280
AI work that happens a deep mind it's
been a good thing to have some people

3740
01:22:59,280 --> 01:22:59,290
been a good thing to have some people
 

3741
01:22:59,290 --> 01:23:01,410
been a good thing to have some people
around doing that kind of work whose

3742
01:23:01,410 --> 01:23:01,420
around doing that kind of work whose
 

3743
01:23:01,420 --> 01:23:05,459
around doing that kind of work whose
PhDs are in neuroscience or psychology

3744
01:23:05,459 --> 01:23:05,469
PhDs are in neuroscience or psychology
 

3745
01:23:05,469 --> 01:23:08,419
PhDs are in neuroscience or psychology
every every academic discipline has its

3746
01:23:08,419 --> 01:23:08,429
every every academic discipline has its
 

3747
01:23:08,429 --> 01:23:12,989
every every academic discipline has its
kind of blind spots and kind of

3748
01:23:12,989 --> 01:23:12,999
kind of blind spots and kind of
 

3749
01:23:12,999 --> 01:23:15,839
kind of blind spots and kind of
unfortunate obsessions and it's

3750
01:23:15,839 --> 01:23:15,849
unfortunate obsessions and it's
 

3751
01:23:15,849 --> 01:23:18,589
unfortunate obsessions and it's
metaphors and it's reference points and

3752
01:23:18,589 --> 01:23:18,599
metaphors and it's reference points and
 

3753
01:23:18,599 --> 01:23:22,469
metaphors and it's reference points and
having some intellectual diversity is is

3754
01:23:22,469 --> 01:23:22,479
having some intellectual diversity is is
 

3755
01:23:22,479 --> 01:23:25,739
having some intellectual diversity is is
really healthy people get each other

3756
01:23:25,739 --> 01:23:25,749
really healthy people get each other
 

3757
01:23:25,749 --> 01:23:29,549
really healthy people get each other
unstuck I think I see it all the time at

3758
01:23:29,549 --> 01:23:29,559
unstuck I think I see it all the time at
 

3759
01:23:29,559 --> 01:23:32,520
unstuck I think I see it all the time at
deep mind and you know I like to think

3760
01:23:32,520 --> 01:23:32,530
deep mind and you know I like to think
 

3761
01:23:32,530 --> 01:23:33,839
deep mind and you know I like to think
that the people who bring some

3762
01:23:33,839 --> 01:23:33,849
that the people who bring some
 

3763
01:23:33,849 --> 01:23:36,060
that the people who bring some
neuroscience background to the table are

3764
01:23:36,060 --> 01:23:36,070
neuroscience background to the table are
 

3765
01:23:36,070 --> 01:23:38,310
neuroscience background to the table are
helping with that so one of the one of

3766
01:23:38,310 --> 01:23:38,320
helping with that so one of the one of
 

3767
01:23:38,320 --> 01:23:40,680
helping with that so one of the one of
them I like probably the deepest passion

3768
01:23:40,680 --> 01:23:40,690
them I like probably the deepest passion
 

3769
01:23:40,690 --> 01:23:42,989
them I like probably the deepest passion
for me what I would say maybe who kind

3770
01:23:42,989 --> 01:23:42,999
for me what I would say maybe who kind
 

3771
01:23:42,999 --> 01:23:44,910
for me what I would say maybe who kind
of spoke off mic a little bit about it

3772
01:23:44,910 --> 01:23:44,920
of spoke off mic a little bit about it
 

3773
01:23:44,920 --> 01:23:49,290
of spoke off mic a little bit about it
but that that I think is a blind spot

3774
01:23:49,290 --> 01:23:49,300
but that that I think is a blind spot
 

3775
01:23:49,300 --> 01:23:51,450
but that that I think is a blind spot
for at least robotics and AI folks is

3776
01:23:51,450 --> 01:23:51,460
for at least robotics and AI folks is
 

3777
01:23:51,460 --> 01:23:54,209
for at least robotics and AI folks is
human robot interaction human agent

3778
01:23:54,209 --> 01:23:54,219
human robot interaction human agent
 

3779
01:23:54,219 --> 01:23:58,620
human robot interaction human agent
interaction maybe idea of thoughts about

3780
01:23:58,620 --> 01:23:58,630
interaction maybe idea of thoughts about
 

3781
01:23:58,630 --> 01:24:02,819
interaction maybe idea of thoughts about
how we reduce the size of that lines but

3782
01:24:02,819 --> 01:24:02,829
how we reduce the size of that lines but
 

3783
01:24:02,829 --> 01:24:06,299
how we reduce the size of that lines but
do you also share the feeling that not

3784
01:24:06,299 --> 01:24:06,309
do you also share the feeling that not
 

3785
01:24:06,309 --> 01:24:09,419
do you also share the feeling that not
enough folks are studying this aspect of

3786
01:24:09,419 --> 01:24:09,429
enough folks are studying this aspect of
 

3787
01:24:09,429 --> 01:24:12,080
enough folks are studying this aspect of
interaction well I I'm I'm actually

3788
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:12,090
interaction well I I'm I'm actually
 

3789
01:24:12,090 --> 01:24:15,239
interaction well I I'm I'm actually
pretty intensively interested in this

3790
01:24:15,239 --> 01:24:15,249
pretty intensively interested in this
 

3791
01:24:15,249 --> 01:24:16,770
pretty intensively interested in this
issue now and there are people in my

3792
01:24:16,770 --> 01:24:16,780
issue now and there are people in my
 

3793
01:24:16,780 --> 01:24:19,500
issue now and there are people in my
group who've actually pivoted pretty

3794
01:24:19,500 --> 01:24:19,510
group who've actually pivoted pretty
 

3795
01:24:19,510 --> 01:24:22,140
group who've actually pivoted pretty
hard over the last few years from doing

3796
01:24:22,140 --> 01:24:22,150
hard over the last few years from doing
 

3797
01:24:22,150 --> 01:24:24,180
hard over the last few years from doing
more traditional cognitive psychology

3798
01:24:24,180 --> 01:24:24,190
more traditional cognitive psychology
 

3799
01:24:24,190 --> 01:24:26,750
more traditional cognitive psychology
and cognitive neuroscience to doing

3800
01:24:26,750 --> 01:24:26,760
and cognitive neuroscience to doing
 

3801
01:24:26,760 --> 01:24:29,129
and cognitive neuroscience to doing
experimental work on human agent

3802
01:24:29,129 --> 01:24:29,139
experimental work on human agent
 

3803
01:24:29,139 --> 01:24:32,160
experimental work on human agent
interaction and there are a couple of

3804
01:24:32,160 --> 01:24:32,170
interaction and there are a couple of
 

3805
01:24:32,170 --> 01:24:34,410
interaction and there are a couple of
reasons that I'm pretty passionately

3806
01:24:34,410 --> 01:24:34,420
reasons that I'm pretty passionately
 

3807
01:24:34,420 --> 01:24:39,930
reasons that I'm pretty passionately
interested in this one is it's kind of

3808
01:24:39,930 --> 01:24:39,940
interested in this one is it's kind of
 

3809
01:24:39,940 --> 01:24:42,870
interested in this one is it's kind of
the outcome of having thought for a few

3810
01:24:42,870 --> 01:24:42,880
the outcome of having thought for a few
 

3811
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:47,100
the outcome of having thought for a few
years now about what we're up to like

3812
01:24:47,100 --> 01:24:47,110
years now about what we're up to like
 

3813
01:24:47,110 --> 01:24:48,839
years now about what we're up to like
what were you like what are we doing

3814
01:24:48,839 --> 01:24:48,849
what were you like what are we doing
 

3815
01:24:48,849 --> 01:24:51,149
what were you like what are we doing
like what what is this what is this aid

3816
01:24:51,149 --> 01:24:51,159
like what what is this what is this aid
 

3817
01:24:51,159 --> 01:24:55,500
like what what is this what is this aid
AI research for so what does it mean to

3818
01:24:55,500 --> 01:24:55,510
AI research for so what does it mean to
 

3819
01:24:55,510 --> 01:24:57,180
AI research for so what does it mean to
make the world a better place I think

3820
01:24:57,180 --> 01:24:57,190
make the world a better place I think
 

3821
01:24:57,190 --> 01:24:59,489
make the world a better place I think
I'm pretty sure that means making life

3822
01:24:59,489 --> 01:24:59,499
I'm pretty sure that means making life
 

3823
01:24:59,499 --> 01:25:01,200
I'm pretty sure that means making life
better for humans yeah

3824
01:25:01,200 --> 01:25:01,210
better for humans yeah
 

3825
01:25:01,210 --> 01:25:05,129
better for humans yeah
and so how do you make life better for

3826
01:25:05,129 --> 01:25:05,139
and so how do you make life better for
 

3827
01:25:05,139 --> 01:25:08,009
and so how do you make life better for
humans that's that's a proposition that

3828
01:25:08,009 --> 01:25:08,019
humans that's that's a proposition that
 

3829
01:25:08,019 --> 01:25:10,620
humans that's that's a proposition that
when you look at it carefully and

3830
01:25:10,620 --> 01:25:10,630
when you look at it carefully and
 

3831
01:25:10,630 --> 01:25:14,549
when you look at it carefully and
honestly is rather horrendously

3832
01:25:14,549 --> 01:25:14,559
honestly is rather horrendously
 

3833
01:25:14,559 --> 01:25:18,120
honestly is rather horrendously
complicated especially when the AI

3834
01:25:18,120 --> 01:25:18,130
complicated especially when the AI
 

3835
01:25:18,130 --> 01:25:19,030
complicated especially when the AI
systems that

3836
01:25:19,030 --> 01:25:19,040
systems that
 

3837
01:25:19,040 --> 01:25:24,100
systems that
your that your building our learning

3838
01:25:24,100 --> 01:25:24,110
your that your building our learning
 

3839
01:25:24,110 --> 01:25:28,090
your that your building our learning
systems they're not you're not you know

3840
01:25:28,090 --> 01:25:28,100
systems they're not you're not you know
 

3841
01:25:28,100 --> 01:25:29,770
systems they're not you're not you know
programming something that you then

3842
01:25:29,770 --> 01:25:29,780
programming something that you then
 

3843
01:25:29,780 --> 01:25:31,570
programming something that you then
introduce to the to the world and it

3844
01:25:31,570 --> 01:25:31,580
introduce to the to the world and it
 

3845
01:25:31,580 --> 01:25:33,910
introduce to the to the world and it
just works as programmed like Google

3846
01:25:33,910 --> 01:25:33,920
just works as programmed like Google
 

3847
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:37,390

Maps or something we're building systems

3848
01:25:37,390 --> 01:25:37,400
Maps or something we're building systems
 

3849
01:25:37,400 --> 01:25:40,480
Maps or something we're building systems
that that learn from experience so you

3850
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:40,490
that that learn from experience so you
 

3851
01:25:40,490 --> 01:25:42,580
that that learn from experience so you
know that that typically leads to AI

3852
01:25:42,580 --> 01:25:42,590
know that that typically leads to AI
 

3853
01:25:42,590 --> 01:25:43,990
know that that typically leads to AI
safety questions how do we keep these

3854
01:25:43,990 --> 01:25:44,000
safety questions how do we keep these
 

3855
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:45,490
safety questions how do we keep these
things from getting out of control how

3856
01:25:45,490 --> 01:25:45,500
things from getting out of control how
 

3857
01:25:45,500 --> 01:25:47,860
things from getting out of control how
do we keep them from doing things that

3858
01:25:47,860 --> 01:25:47,870
do we keep them from doing things that
 

3859
01:25:47,870 --> 01:25:51,090
do we keep them from doing things that
harm humans and I mean I hasten to say I

3860
01:25:51,090 --> 01:25:51,100
harm humans and I mean I hasten to say I
 

3861
01:25:51,100 --> 01:25:54,280
harm humans and I mean I hasten to say I
consider those hugely important issues

3862
01:25:54,280 --> 01:25:54,290
consider those hugely important issues
 

3863
01:25:54,290 --> 01:25:57,160
consider those hugely important issues
and there are large sectors of the

3864
01:25:57,160 --> 01:25:57,170
and there are large sectors of the
 

3865
01:25:57,170 --> 01:26:00,010
and there are large sectors of the
research community a deep mind and of

3866
01:26:00,010 --> 01:26:00,020
research community a deep mind and of
 

3867
01:26:00,020 --> 01:26:01,600

01:26:03,940 --> 01:26:03,950
thinking hard all day every day about
 

3871
01:26:03,950 --> 01:26:07,030
thinking hard all day every day about
that but there's a there's I guess I

3872
01:26:07,030 --> 01:26:07,040
that but there's a there's I guess I
 

3873
01:26:07,040 --> 01:26:09,070
that but there's a there's I guess I
guess I would say a positive side to

3874
01:26:09,070 --> 01:26:09,080
guess I would say a positive side to
 

3875
01:26:09,080 --> 01:26:12,670
guess I would say a positive side to
this too which is to say well what would

3876
01:26:12,670 --> 01:26:12,680
this too which is to say well what would
 

3877
01:26:12,680 --> 01:26:16,000
this too which is to say well what would
it mean to make human life better oh and

3878
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:16,010
it mean to make human life better oh and
 

3879
01:26:16,010 --> 01:26:17,860
it mean to make human life better oh and
and how how can we imagine learning

3880
01:26:17,860 --> 01:26:17,870
and how how can we imagine learning
 

3881
01:26:17,870 --> 01:26:22,570
and how how can we imagine learning
systems doing that and and in talking to

3882
01:26:22,570 --> 01:26:22,580
systems doing that and and in talking to
 

3883
01:26:22,580 --> 01:26:24,250
systems doing that and and in talking to
my colleagues about that we reached the

3884
01:26:24,250 --> 01:26:24,260
my colleagues about that we reached the
 

3885
01:26:24,260 --> 01:26:27,640
my colleagues about that we reached the
initial conclusion that it's not

3886
01:26:27,640 --> 01:26:27,650
initial conclusion that it's not
 

3887
01:26:27,650 --> 01:26:29,650
initial conclusion that it's not
sufficient to philosophize about that

3888
01:26:29,650 --> 01:26:29,660
sufficient to philosophize about that
 

3889
01:26:29,660 --> 01:26:31,450
sufficient to philosophize about that
you actually have to take into account

3890
01:26:31,450 --> 01:26:31,460
you actually have to take into account
 

3891
01:26:31,460 --> 01:26:36,400
you actually have to take into account
how humans actually work and what humans

3892
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:36,410
how humans actually work and what humans
 

3893
01:26:36,410 --> 01:26:38,980
how humans actually work and what humans
want and the difficulties of knowing

3894
01:26:38,980 --> 01:26:38,990
want and the difficulties of knowing
 

3895
01:26:38,990 --> 01:26:43,150
want and the difficulties of knowing
what humans want and the difficulties

3896
01:26:43,150 --> 01:26:43,160
what humans want and the difficulties
 

3897
01:26:43,160 --> 01:26:45,250
what humans want and the difficulties
that arise when humans want different

3898
01:26:45,250 --> 01:26:45,260
that arise when humans want different
 

3899
01:26:45,260 --> 01:26:49,330
that arise when humans want different
things and and so human agent

3900
01:26:49,330 --> 01:26:49,340
things and and so human agent
 

3901
01:26:49,340 --> 01:26:52,150
things and and so human agent
interaction has become you know a quite

3902
01:26:52,150 --> 01:26:52,160
interaction has become you know a quite
 

3903
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:54,520
interaction has become you know a quite
a quite intensive focus of my group

3904
01:26:54,520 --> 01:26:54,530
a quite intensive focus of my group
 

3905
01:26:54,530 --> 01:26:59,110
a quite intensive focus of my group
lately if for no other reason that in

3906
01:26:59,110 --> 01:26:59,120
lately if for no other reason that in
 

3907
01:26:59,120 --> 01:27:02,290
lately if for no other reason that in
order to really address that that issue

3908
01:27:02,290 --> 01:27:02,300
order to really address that that issue
 

3909
01:27:02,300 --> 01:27:05,410
order to really address that that issue
in an adequate way you have to I mean

3910
01:27:05,410 --> 01:27:05,420
in an adequate way you have to I mean
 

3911
01:27:05,420 --> 01:27:07,030
in an adequate way you have to I mean
psychology becomes part of the picture

3912
01:27:07,030 --> 01:27:07,040
psychology becomes part of the picture
 

3913
01:27:07,040 --> 01:27:09,910
psychology becomes part of the picture
yeah and then so there's a few elements

3914
01:27:09,910 --> 01:27:09,920
yeah and then so there's a few elements
 

3915
01:27:09,920 --> 01:27:11,980
yeah and then so there's a few elements
there so if you focus on solving into

3916
01:27:11,980 --> 01:27:11,990
there so if you focus on solving into
 

3917
01:27:11,990 --> 01:27:14,230
there so if you focus on solving into
like the if you focus on the robotics

3918
01:27:14,230 --> 01:27:14,240
like the if you focus on the robotics
 

3919
01:27:14,240 --> 01:27:17,020
like the if you focus on the robotics
problem let's say a GI without humans in

3920
01:27:17,020 --> 01:27:17,030
problem let's say a GI without humans in
 

3921
01:27:17,030 --> 01:27:19,710
problem let's say a GI without humans in
the picture is you're missing

3922
01:27:19,710 --> 01:27:19,720
the picture is you're missing
 

3923
01:27:19,720 --> 01:27:22,540
the picture is you're missing
fundamentally the final step you when

3924
01:27:22,540 --> 01:27:22,550
fundamentally the final step you when
 

3925
01:27:22,550 --> 01:27:24,520
fundamentally the final step you when
you do want to help human civilization

3926
01:27:24,520 --> 01:27:24,530
you do want to help human civilization
 

3927
01:27:24,530 --> 01:27:25,810
you do want to help human civilization
you eventually have to interact with

3928
01:27:25,810 --> 01:27:25,820
you eventually have to interact with
 

3929
01:27:25,820 --> 01:27:29,290
you eventually have to interact with
humans and when you create a learning

3930
01:27:29,290 --> 01:27:29,300
humans and when you create a learning
 

3931
01:27:29,300 --> 01:27:30,960
humans and when you create a learning
system just as you said

3932
01:27:30,960 --> 01:27:30,970
system just as you said
 

3933
01:27:30,970 --> 01:27:32,880
system just as you said
that will eventually have to interact

3934
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:32,890
that will eventually have to interact
 

3935
01:27:32,890 --> 01:27:36,720
that will eventually have to interact
with humans the interaction itself has

3936
01:27:36,720 --> 01:27:36,730
with humans the interaction itself has
 

3937
01:27:36,730 --> 01:27:39,480
with humans the interaction itself has
to be become has to become part of the

3938
01:27:39,480 --> 01:27:39,490
to be become has to become part of the
 

3939
01:27:39,490 --> 01:27:41,430
to be become has to become part of the
learning process right so you can't just

3940
01:27:41,430 --> 01:27:41,440
learning process right so you can't just
 

3941
01:27:41,440 --> 01:27:44,400
learning process right so you can't just
watch well my sense is it sounds like

3942
01:27:44,400 --> 01:27:44,410
watch well my sense is it sounds like
 

3943
01:27:44,410 --> 01:27:46,470
watch well my sense is it sounds like
your senses you can't just watch humans

3944
01:27:46,470 --> 01:27:46,480
your senses you can't just watch humans
 

3945
01:27:46,480 --> 01:27:48,630
your senses you can't just watch humans
to learn about humans yeah you have to

3946
01:27:48,630 --> 01:27:48,640
to learn about humans yeah you have to
 

3947
01:27:48,640 --> 01:27:50,430
to learn about humans yeah you have to
also be part of the human world you have

3948
01:27:50,430 --> 01:27:50,440
also be part of the human world you have
 

3949
01:27:50,440 --> 01:27:52,080
also be part of the human world you have
to interact with humans yeah exactly and

3950
01:27:52,080 --> 01:27:52,090
to interact with humans yeah exactly and
 

3951
01:27:52,090 --> 01:27:55,940
to interact with humans yeah exactly and
I mean then questions arise that start

3952
01:27:55,940 --> 01:27:55,950
I mean then questions arise that start
 

3953
01:27:55,950 --> 01:27:59,520
I mean then questions arise that start
imperceptibly but inevitably to slip

3954
01:27:59,520 --> 01:27:59,530
imperceptibly but inevitably to slip
 

3955
01:27:59,530 --> 01:28:02,550
imperceptibly but inevitably to slip
beyond the realm of engineering so

3956
01:28:02,550 --> 01:28:02,560
beyond the realm of engineering so
 

3957
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:06,120
beyond the realm of engineering so
questions like if you have an agent that

3958
01:28:06,120 --> 01:28:06,130
questions like if you have an agent that
 

3959
01:28:06,130 --> 01:28:11,130
questions like if you have an agent that
can do something that you can't do under

3960
01:28:11,130 --> 01:28:11,140
can do something that you can't do under
 

3961
01:28:11,140 --> 01:28:12,600
can do something that you can't do under
what conditions do you want that agent

3962
01:28:12,600 --> 01:28:12,610
what conditions do you want that agent
 

3963
01:28:12,610 --> 01:28:16,560
what conditions do you want that agent
to do it so you know if you know if I if

3964
01:28:16,560 --> 01:28:16,570
to do it so you know if you know if I if
 

3965
01:28:16,570 --> 01:28:22,100
to do it so you know if you know if I if
I have a if I have a robot that can play

3966
01:28:22,100 --> 01:28:22,110

 

3967
01:28:22,110 --> 01:28:25,860

Beethoven sonatas better than any human

3968
01:28:25,860 --> 01:28:25,870
Beethoven sonatas better than any human
 

3969
01:28:25,870 --> 01:28:29,220
Beethoven sonatas better than any human
in the sense that the you know the the

3970
01:28:29,220 --> 01:28:29,230
in the sense that the you know the the
 

3971
01:28:29,230 --> 01:28:32,100
in the sense that the you know the the
sensitivity the express the expression

3972
01:28:32,100 --> 01:28:32,110
sensitivity the express the expression
 

3973
01:28:32,110 --> 01:28:35,280
sensitivity the express the expression
is just beyond what any human do I do I

3974
01:28:35,280 --> 01:28:35,290
is just beyond what any human do I do I
 

3975
01:28:35,290 --> 01:28:36,810
is just beyond what any human do I do I
want to listen to that do I want to go

3976
01:28:36,810 --> 01:28:36,820
want to listen to that do I want to go
 

3977
01:28:36,820 --> 01:28:38,910
want to listen to that do I want to go
to a concert and hear a robot play these

3978
01:28:38,910 --> 01:28:38,920
to a concert and hear a robot play these
 

3979
01:28:38,920 --> 01:28:40,740
to a concert and hear a robot play these
are these are these are an engineering

3980
01:28:40,740 --> 01:28:40,750
are these are these are an engineering
 

3981
01:28:40,750 --> 01:28:43,230
are these are these are an engineering
questions these are questions about

3982
01:28:43,230 --> 01:28:43,240
questions these are questions about
 

3983
01:28:43,240 --> 01:28:45,680
questions these are questions about
human preference and human culture and

3984
01:28:45,680 --> 01:28:45,690
human preference and human culture and
 

3985
01:28:45,690 --> 01:28:48,110
human preference and human culture and
psychology bordering and philosophy yeah

3986
01:28:48,110 --> 01:28:48,120
psychology bordering and philosophy yeah
 

3987
01:28:48,120 --> 01:28:50,600
psychology bordering and philosophy yeah
and then and then you start asking well

3988
01:28:50,600 --> 01:28:50,610
and then and then you start asking well
 

3989
01:28:50,610 --> 01:28:53,310
and then and then you start asking well
well even if we knew the answer to that

3990
01:28:53,310 --> 01:28:53,320
well even if we knew the answer to that
 

3991
01:28:53,320 --> 01:28:57,390
well even if we knew the answer to that
is it our place as AI engineers to build

3992
01:28:57,390 --> 01:28:57,400
is it our place as AI engineers to build
 

3993
01:28:57,400 --> 01:29:00,120
is it our place as AI engineers to build
that into these agents probably the

3994
01:29:00,120 --> 01:29:00,130
that into these agents probably the
 

3995
01:29:00,130 --> 01:29:02,840
that into these agents probably the
agents should interact with humans

3996
01:29:02,840 --> 01:29:02,850
agents should interact with humans
 

3997
01:29:02,850 --> 01:29:05,280
agents should interact with humans
beyond the population of AI engineers

3998
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:05,290
beyond the population of AI engineers
 

3999
01:29:05,290 --> 01:29:07,350
beyond the population of AI engineers
and figure out what those humans want

4000
01:29:07,350 --> 01:29:07,360
and figure out what those humans want
 

4001
01:29:07,360 --> 01:29:10,260
and figure out what those humans want
yeah and then you know when you start I

4002
01:29:10,260 --> 01:29:10,270
yeah and then you know when you start I
 

4003
01:29:10,270 --> 01:29:13,080
yeah and then you know when you start I
referred this the moment ago but even

4004
01:29:13,080 --> 01:29:13,090
referred this the moment ago but even
 

4005
01:29:13,090 --> 01:29:15,150
referred this the moment ago but even
that becomes complicated be quote what

4006
01:29:15,150 --> 01:29:15,160
that becomes complicated be quote what
 

4007
01:29:15,160 --> 01:29:15,840
that becomes complicated be quote what
if what if

4008
01:29:15,840 --> 01:29:15,850
if what if
 

4009
01:29:15,850 --> 01:29:17,850
if what if
2-8 what if two humans want different

4010
01:29:17,850 --> 01:29:17,860
2-8 what if two humans want different
 

4011
01:29:17,860 --> 01:29:20,640
2-8 what if two humans want different
things and and you have only one agent

4012
01:29:20,640 --> 01:29:20,650
things and and you have only one agent
 

4013
01:29:20,650 --> 01:29:22,500
things and and you have only one agent
that's able to interact with them and

4014
01:29:22,500 --> 01:29:22,510
that's able to interact with them and
 

4015
01:29:22,510 --> 01:29:24,780
that's able to interact with them and
try to satisfy their preferences then

4016
01:29:24,780 --> 01:29:24,790
try to satisfy their preferences then
 

4017
01:29:24,790 --> 01:29:29,370
try to satisfy their preferences then
you're into the realm of of of like

4018
01:29:29,370 --> 01:29:29,380
you're into the realm of of of like
 

4019
01:29:29,380 --> 01:29:31,920
you're into the realm of of of like
economics and social choice theory and

4020
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:31,930
economics and social choice theory and
 

4021
01:29:31,930 --> 01:29:35,160
economics and social choice theory and
and even politics so there's a sense in

4022
01:29:35,160 --> 01:29:35,170
and even politics so there's a sense in
 

4023
01:29:35,170 --> 01:29:36,900
and even politics so there's a sense in
which if you if you kind of follow what

4024
01:29:36,900 --> 01:29:36,910
which if you if you kind of follow what
 

4025
01:29:36,910 --> 01:29:39,170
which if you if you kind of follow what
we're doing to its logical conclusion

4026
01:29:39,170 --> 01:29:39,180
we're doing to its logical conclusion
 

4027
01:29:39,180 --> 01:29:43,320
we're doing to its logical conclusion
then it goes beyond questions of

4028
01:29:43,320 --> 01:29:43,330
then it goes beyond questions of
 

4029
01:29:43,330 --> 01:29:45,010
then it goes beyond questions of
engineering and technology

4030
01:29:45,010 --> 01:29:45,020
engineering and technology
 

4031
01:29:45,020 --> 01:29:47,170
engineering and technology
and you know starts to shade and

4032
01:29:47,170 --> 01:29:47,180
and you know starts to shade and
 

4033
01:29:47,180 --> 01:29:49,810
and you know starts to shade and
perceptibly into questions about what

4034
01:29:49,810 --> 01:29:49,820
perceptibly into questions about what
 

4035
01:29:49,820 --> 01:29:52,120
perceptibly into questions about what
kind of society do you want and actually

4036
01:29:52,120 --> 01:29:52,130
kind of society do you want and actually
 

4037
01:29:52,130 --> 01:29:55,570
kind of society do you want and actually
that once once that dawned on me I

4038
01:29:55,570 --> 01:29:55,580
that once once that dawned on me I
 

4039
01:29:55,580 --> 01:29:59,380
that once once that dawned on me I
actually felt I don't know what the

4040
01:29:59,380 --> 01:29:59,390
actually felt I don't know what the
 

4041
01:29:59,390 --> 01:30:01,600
actually felt I don't know what the
right word is quite refreshed in my in

4042
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:01,610
right word is quite refreshed in my in
 

4043
01:30:01,610 --> 01:30:03,130
right word is quite refreshed in my in
my involvement in AI research it's

4044
01:30:03,130 --> 01:30:03,140
my involvement in AI research it's
 

4045
01:30:03,140 --> 01:30:05,860
my involvement in AI research it's
almost like this building this kind of

4046
01:30:05,860 --> 01:30:05,870
almost like this building this kind of
 

4047
01:30:05,870 --> 01:30:08,230
almost like this building this kind of
stuff is gonna lead us back to asking

4048
01:30:08,230 --> 01:30:08,240
stuff is gonna lead us back to asking
 

4049
01:30:08,240 --> 01:30:10,770
stuff is gonna lead us back to asking
really fundamental questions about

4050
01:30:10,770 --> 01:30:10,780
really fundamental questions about
 

4051
01:30:10,780 --> 01:30:13,720
really fundamental questions about
what's you know what is this like look

4052
01:30:13,720 --> 01:30:13,730
what's you know what is this like look
 

4053
01:30:13,730 --> 01:30:15,610
what's you know what is this like look
what's the good life and yeah who gets

4054
01:30:15,610 --> 01:30:15,620
what's the good life and yeah who gets
 

4055
01:30:15,620 --> 01:30:18,700
what's the good life and yeah who gets
to decide and and you know you know

4056
01:30:18,700 --> 01:30:18,710
to decide and and you know you know
 

4057
01:30:18,710 --> 01:30:22,690
to decide and and you know you know
bringing in viewpoints from multiple sub

4058
01:30:22,690 --> 01:30:22,700
bringing in viewpoints from multiple sub
 

4059
01:30:22,700 --> 01:30:25,240
bringing in viewpoints from multiple sub
communities to help us you know shape

4060
01:30:25,240 --> 01:30:25,250
communities to help us you know shape
 

4061
01:30:25,250 --> 01:30:27,190
communities to help us you know shape
the way that we live this it's it's

4062
01:30:27,190 --> 01:30:27,200
the way that we live this it's it's
 

4063
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:29,920
the way that we live this it's it's
there's something it it started making

4064
01:30:29,920 --> 01:30:29,930
there's something it it started making
 

4065
01:30:29,930 --> 01:30:33,280
there's something it it started making
me feel like doing a a I research in you

4066
01:30:33,280 --> 01:30:33,290
me feel like doing a a I research in you
 

4067
01:30:33,290 --> 01:30:38,140
me feel like doing a a I research in you
know fully responsible away would you

4068
01:30:38,140 --> 01:30:38,150
know fully responsible away would you
 

4069
01:30:38,150 --> 01:30:40,410
know fully responsible away would you
know could potentially lead to a kind of

4070
01:30:40,410 --> 01:30:40,420
know could potentially lead to a kind of
 

4071
01:30:40,420 --> 01:30:44,680
know could potentially lead to a kind of
like cultural renewal yeah it's it's the

4072
01:30:44,680 --> 01:30:44,690
like cultural renewal yeah it's it's the
 

4073
01:30:44,690 --> 01:30:46,720
like cultural renewal yeah it's it's the
way done it's the it's the way to

4074
01:30:46,720 --> 01:30:46,730
way done it's the it's the way to
 

4075
01:30:46,730 --> 01:30:48,310
way done it's the it's the way to
understand human beings at the

4076
01:30:48,310 --> 01:30:48,320
understand human beings at the
 

4077
01:30:48,320 --> 01:30:50,500
understand human beings at the
individual at the societal level it may

4078
01:30:50,500 --> 01:30:50,510
individual at the societal level it may
 

4079
01:30:50,510 --> 01:30:53,170
individual at the societal level it may
become a way to answer all the silly

4080
01:30:53,170 --> 01:30:53,180
become a way to answer all the silly
 

4081
01:30:53,180 --> 01:30:54,700
become a way to answer all the silly
human questions of the meaning of life

4082
01:30:54,700 --> 01:30:54,710
human questions of the meaning of life
 

4083
01:30:54,710 --> 01:30:56,440
human questions of the meaning of life
and all the all those kinds of things

4084
01:30:56,440 --> 01:30:56,450
and all the all those kinds of things
 

4085
01:30:56,450 --> 01:30:57,730

narrative that might be relevant which
 

4155
01:32:24,349 --> 01:32:26,879
narrative that might be relevant which
is when we think of when we think of

is when we think of when we think of
 

4157
01:32:26,889 --> 01:32:30,700
is when we think of when we think of
humans gaining more and more information

about you know like human life the the

about you know like human life the the
 

4161
01:32:35,480 --> 01:32:36,729
about you know like human life the the
narrative there is usually that they've

4162
01:32:36,729 --> 01:32:36,739
narrative there is usually that they've
 

4163
01:32:36,739 --> 01:32:39,069
narrative there is usually that they've
gained more and more wisdom and more you

gained more and more wisdom and more you
 

4165
01:32:39,079 --> 01:32:40,240
gained more and more wisdom and more you
know they get closer to enlightenment

4166
01:32:40,240 --> 01:32:40,250
know they get closer to enlightenment
 

4167
01:32:40,250 --> 01:32:42,399
know they get closer to enlightenment
and you know and they become more

4168
01:32:42,399 --> 01:32:42,409
and you know and they become more
 

4169
01:32:42,409 --> 01:32:44,560
and you know and they become more
benevolent and you know like the Buddha

4170
01:32:44,560 --> 01:32:44,570
benevolent and you know like the Buddha
 

4171
01:32:44,570 --> 01:32:46,540
benevolent and you know like the Buddha
is like the like that's that's a totally

4172
01:32:46,540 --> 01:32:46,550
is like the like that's that's a totally
 

4173
01:32:46,550 --> 01:32:48,549
is like the like that's that's a totally
different narrative and why isn't it the

4174
01:32:48,549 --> 01:32:48,559
different narrative and why isn't it the
 

4175
01:32:48,559 --> 01:32:51,189
different narrative and why isn't it the
case that we we imagine that the the AI

4176
01:32:51,189 --> 01:32:51,199
case that we we imagine that the the AI
 

4177
01:32:51,199 --> 01:32:52,810
case that we we imagine that the the AI
systems that we're creating and just

4178
01:32:52,810 --> 01:32:52,820
systems that we're creating and just
 

4179
01:32:52,820 --> 01:32:53,979
systems that we're creating and just
kind of like they're gonna figure out

4180
01:32:53,979 --> 01:32:53,989
kind of like they're gonna figure out
 

4181
01:32:53,989 --> 01:32:55,089
kind of like they're gonna figure out
more and more about the way the world

4182
01:32:55,089 --> 01:32:55,099
more and more about the way the world
 

4183
01:32:55,099 --> 01:32:56,709
more and more about the way the world
works and the way that humans interact

4184
01:32:56,709 --> 01:32:56,719
works and the way that humans interact
 

4185
01:32:56,719 --> 01:32:59,169
works and the way that humans interact
and they'll they'll become beneficent

4186
01:32:59,169 --> 01:32:59,179
and they'll they'll become beneficent
 

4187
01:32:59,179 --> 01:33:01,030
and they'll they'll become beneficent
I'm not saying that will happen I'm not

4188
01:33:01,030 --> 01:33:01,040
I'm not saying that will happen I'm not
 

4189
01:33:01,040 --> 01:33:04,149
I'm not saying that will happen I'm not
you know III I'm I don't honestly expect

4190
01:33:04,149 --> 01:33:04,159
you know III I'm I don't honestly expect
 

4191
01:33:04,159 --> 01:33:06,510
you know III I'm I don't honestly expect
that to happen without some careful

4192
01:33:06,510 --> 01:33:06,520
that to happen without some careful
 

4193
01:33:06,520 --> 01:33:08,979
that to happen without some careful
setting things up very carefully but

4194
01:33:08,979 --> 01:33:08,989
setting things up very carefully but
 

4195
01:33:08,989 --> 01:33:11,080
setting things up very carefully but
it's another way things could go right

4196
01:33:11,080 --> 01:33:11,090
it's another way things could go right
 

4197
01:33:11,090 --> 01:33:13,629
it's another way things could go right
and yeah and I would even push back on

4198
01:33:13,629 --> 01:33:13,639
and yeah and I would even push back on
 

4199
01:33:13,639 --> 01:33:19,379
and yeah and I would even push back on
that I believe that the most

4200
01:33:19,379 --> 01:33:19,389
that I believe that the most

4203
01:33:22,610 --> 01:33:26,280
trajectory's natural human trajectories
will lead us towards progress so for me

4204
01:33:26,280 --> 01:33:26,290
will lead us towards progress so for me
 

4205
01:33:26,290 --> 01:33:28,839
will lead us towards progress so for me
there is a kind of sense that most

there is a kind of sense that most
 

4207
01:33:28,849 --> 01:33:31,120
there is a kind of sense that most
trajectories in AI development will lead

4208
01:33:31,120 --> 01:33:31,130
trajectories in AI development will lead
 

4209
01:33:31,130 --> 01:33:35,350
trajectories in AI development will lead
us into trouble you mean and and we over

4210
01:33:35,350 --> 01:33:35,360
us into trouble you mean and and we over
 

4211
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:37,689
us into trouble you mean and and we over
focus on the worst case it's like in

4212
01:33:37,689 --> 01:33:37,699
focus on the worst case it's like in
 

4213
01:33:37,699 --> 01:33:39,160
focus on the worst case it's like in

science has been this focus on
 

4217
01:33:40,909 --> 01:33:42,580
science has been this focus on
worst-case analysis there's something

4218
01:33:42,580 --> 01:33:42,590
worst-case analysis there's something
 

4219
01:33:42,590 --> 01:33:45,310
worst-case analysis there's something
appealing to our human mind at some

4220
01:33:45,310 --> 01:33:45,320
appealing to our human mind at some
 

4221
01:33:45,320 --> 01:33:48,399
appealing to our human mind at some
lowest level to be mean we don't want to

4222
01:33:48,399 --> 01:33:48,409
lowest level to be mean we don't want to
 

4223
01:33:48,409 --> 01:33:50,709
lowest level to be mean we don't want to
be eaten by the tiger I guess so we want

4224
01:33:50,709 --> 01:33:50,719
be eaten by the tiger I guess so we want
 

4225
01:33:50,719 --> 01:33:52,600
be eaten by the tiger I guess so we want
to do the worst-case analysis but the

4226
01:33:52,600 --> 01:33:52,610
to do the worst-case analysis but the
 

4227
01:33:52,610 --> 01:33:55,780
to do the worst-case analysis but the
reality is that shouldn't stop us from

4228
01:33:55,780 --> 01:33:55,790
reality is that shouldn't stop us from
 

4229
01:33:55,790 --> 01:33:57,819
reality is that shouldn't stop us from
actually building out all the other

the all the Enlightenment this book in
 

4237
01:34:05,090 --> 01:34:06,700

01:34:06,710 --> 01:34:07,709
language now with Steven Pinker and so
on this

4240
01:34:07,709 --> 01:34:07,719
on this
 

4241
01:34:07,719 --> 01:34:09,569
on this
looking generally at human progress and

4242
01:34:09,569 --> 01:34:09,579
looking generally at human progress and
 

4243
01:34:09,579 --> 01:34:12,239
looking generally at human progress and
there's so many ways the human progress

4244
01:34:12,239 --> 01:34:12,249
there's so many ways the human progress
 

4245
01:34:12,249 --> 01:34:14,459
there's so many ways the human progress
can happen with AI it's and I think you

4246
01:34:14,459 --> 01:34:14,469
can happen with AI it's and I think you
 

4247
01:34:14,469 --> 01:34:16,739
can happen with AI it's and I think you
have to do that research you have to do

4248
01:34:16,739 --> 01:34:16,749
have to do that research you have to do
 

4249
01:34:16,749 --> 01:34:19,319
have to do that research you have to do
that work you have to do the not just AI

4250
01:34:19,319 --> 01:34:19,329
that work you have to do the not just AI
 

4251
01:34:19,329 --> 01:34:21,779
that work you have to do the not just AI
safety work of the one worst case

4252
01:34:21,779 --> 01:34:21,789
safety work of the one worst case
 

4253
01:34:21,789 --> 01:34:23,819
safety work of the one worst case
analysis how do we prevent that but the

4254
01:34:23,819 --> 01:34:23,829
analysis how do we prevent that but the
 

4255
01:34:23,829 --> 01:34:27,870
analysis how do we prevent that but the
the actual tools and the glue and the

4256
01:34:27,870 --> 01:34:27,880
the actual tools and the glue and the
 

4257
01:34:27,880 --> 01:34:31,439
the actual tools and the glue and the
mechanisms of human AI interaction that

4258
01:34:31,439 --> 01:34:31,449
mechanisms of human AI interaction that
 

4259
01:34:31,449 --> 01:34:33,390
mechanisms of human AI interaction that
would lead to all the positive yeah

4260
01:34:33,390 --> 01:34:33,400
would lead to all the positive yeah
 

4261
01:34:33,400 --> 01:34:36,359
would lead to all the positive yeah
isn't go yes super exciting area right

4262
01:34:36,359 --> 01:34:36,369
isn't go yes super exciting area right
 

4263
01:34:36,369 --> 01:34:38,430
isn't go yes super exciting area right
yeah you know we should be spending we

4264
01:34:38,430 --> 01:34:38,440
yeah you know we should be spending we
 

4265
01:34:38,440 --> 01:34:39,930
yeah you know we should be spending we
should be spending a lot of our time

4266
01:34:39,930 --> 01:34:39,940
should be spending a lot of our time
 

4267
01:34:39,940 --> 01:34:43,919
should be spending a lot of our time
saying what can go wrong I think it's

4268
01:34:43,919 --> 01:34:43,929
saying what can go wrong I think it's
 

4269
01:34:43,929 --> 01:34:46,140
saying what can go wrong I think it's
harder to see that there's work to be

4270
01:34:46,140 --> 01:34:46,150
harder to see that there's work to be
 

4271
01:34:46,150 --> 01:34:49,680
harder to see that there's work to be
done to bring into focus the question of

4272
01:34:49,680 --> 01:34:49,690
done to bring into focus the question of
 

4273
01:34:49,690 --> 01:34:51,839
done to bring into focus the question of
what what it would look like for things

4274
01:34:51,839 --> 01:34:51,849
what what it would look like for things
 

4275
01:34:51,849 --> 01:34:54,060
what what it would look like for things
to go right yeah that it's you know

4276
01:34:54,060 --> 01:34:54,070
to go right yeah that it's you know
 

4277
01:34:54,070 --> 01:34:58,200
to go right yeah that it's you know
that's not obvious there and we wouldn't

4278
01:34:58,200 --> 01:34:58,210
that's not obvious there and we wouldn't
 

4279
01:34:58,210 --> 01:34:59,399
that's not obvious there and we wouldn't
be doing this if we didn't have the

4280
01:34:59,399 --> 01:34:59,409
be doing this if we didn't have the
 

4281
01:34:59,409 --> 01:35:01,950
be doing this if we didn't have the
sense there was huge potential right

4282
01:35:01,950 --> 01:35:01,960
sense there was huge potential right
 

4283
01:35:01,960 --> 01:35:04,169
sense there was huge potential right
we're not doing this you know you know

4284
01:35:04,169 --> 01:35:04,179
we're not doing this you know you know
 

4285
01:35:04,179 --> 01:35:06,989
we're not doing this you know you know
for no reason we we have a sense that AG

4286
01:35:06,989 --> 01:35:06,999
for no reason we we have a sense that AG
 

4287
01:35:06,999 --> 01:35:10,410
for no reason we we have a sense that AG
I would be a major boom to humanity but

4288
01:35:10,410 --> 01:35:10,420
I would be a major boom to humanity but
 

4289
01:35:10,420 --> 01:35:13,560
I would be a major boom to humanity but
I think I think it's worth starting now

4290
01:35:13,560 --> 01:35:13,570
I think I think it's worth starting now
 

4291
01:35:13,570 --> 01:35:15,390
I think I think it's worth starting now
even when our technology is quite

4292
01:35:15,390 --> 01:35:15,400
even when our technology is quite
 

4293
01:35:15,400 --> 01:35:17,969
even when our technology is quite
primitive asking well exactly what would

4294
01:35:17,969 --> 01:35:17,979
primitive asking well exactly what would
 

4295
01:35:17,979 --> 01:35:20,459
primitive asking well exactly what would
that mean we can start now with

4296
01:35:20,459 --> 01:35:20,469
that mean we can start now with
 

4297
01:35:20,469 --> 01:35:21,959
that mean we can start now with
applications that are already gonna make

4298
01:35:21,959 --> 01:35:21,969
applications that are already gonna make
 

4299
01:35:21,969 --> 01:35:23,520
applications that are already gonna make
the world a better place like you know

4300
01:35:23,520 --> 01:35:23,530
the world a better place like you know
 

4301
01:35:23,530 --> 01:35:25,379
the world a better place like you know
solving protein folding you know I I

4302
01:35:25,379 --> 01:35:25,389
solving protein folding you know I I
 

4303
01:35:25,389 --> 01:35:27,989
solving protein folding you know I I
think this deep mind has gotten heavy

4304
01:35:27,989 --> 01:35:27,999
think this deep mind has gotten heavy
 

4305
01:35:27,999 --> 01:35:30,479
think this deep mind has gotten heavy
into science applications lately which i

4306
01:35:30,479 --> 01:35:30,489
into science applications lately which i
 

4307
01:35:30,489 --> 01:35:32,729
into science applications lately which i
think is you know you know a wonderful

4308
01:35:32,729 --> 01:35:32,739
think is you know you know a wonderful
 

4309
01:35:32,739 --> 01:35:36,390
think is you know you know a wonderful
wonderful move for us to be making but

4310
01:35:36,390 --> 01:35:36,400
wonderful move for us to be making but
 

4311
01:35:36,400 --> 01:35:37,799
wonderful move for us to be making but
when we think about AGI when we think

4312
01:35:37,799 --> 01:35:37,809
when we think about AGI when we think
 

4313
01:35:37,809 --> 01:35:39,479
when we think about AGI when we think
about building you know fully

4314
01:35:39,479 --> 01:35:39,489
about building you know fully
 

4315
01:35:39,489 --> 01:35:41,609
about building you know fully
intelligent agents that are gonna be

4316
01:35:41,609 --> 01:35:41,619
intelligent agents that are gonna be
 

4317
01:35:41,619 --> 01:35:44,479
intelligent agents that are gonna be
able to in a sense do whatever they want

4318
01:35:44,479 --> 01:35:44,489
able to in a sense do whatever they want
 

4319
01:35:44,489 --> 01:35:46,890
able to in a sense do whatever they want
you know we should start thinking about

4320
01:35:46,890 --> 01:35:46,900
you know we should start thinking about
 

4321
01:35:46,900 --> 01:35:49,680
you know we should start thinking about
what do we want them to want what what

4322
01:35:49,680 --> 01:35:49,690
what do we want them to want what what
 

4323
01:35:49,690 --> 01:35:51,770
what do we want them to want what what
what kind of world do we want to live in

4324
01:35:51,770 --> 01:35:51,780
what kind of world do we want to live in
 

4325
01:35:51,780 --> 01:35:55,229
what kind of world do we want to live in
that's not an easy question and if you

4326
01:35:55,229 --> 01:35:55,239
that's not an easy question and if you
 

4327
01:35:55,239 --> 01:35:56,640
that's not an easy question and if you
think we just need to start working on

4328
01:35:56,640 --> 01:35:56,650
think we just need to start working on
 

4329
01:35:56,650 --> 01:35:58,950
think we just need to start working on
it and even on the path to sort of it

4330
01:35:58,950 --> 01:35:58,960
it and even on the path to sort of it
 

4331
01:35:58,960 --> 01:36:00,419
it and even on the path to sort of it
doesn't have to be AG I was just

4332
01:36:00,419 --> 01:36:00,429
doesn't have to be AG I was just
 

4333
01:36:00,429 --> 01:36:02,370
doesn't have to be AG I was just
intelligent agents that interact with us

4334
01:36:02,370 --> 01:36:02,380
intelligent agents that interact with us
 

4335
01:36:02,380 --> 01:36:05,700
intelligent agents that interact with us
and help us enrich our own existence on

4336
01:36:05,700 --> 01:36:05,710
and help us enrich our own existence on
 

4337
01:36:05,710 --> 01:36:07,020
and help us enrich our own existence on
social networks for example on

struggling with this very idea how do
 

4351
01:36:19,690 --> 01:36:22,740
struggling with this very idea how do
you create AI systems that increase the

4352

you create AI systems that increase the
 

4353
01:36:22,750 --> 01:36:24,300
you create AI systems that increase the

human psychology question and how do you
do that without without deception being

how do we face the fact that it's a
small group of people who have the skill

cope with that this is this is a problem

4394
01:37:22,830 --> 01:37:22,840
cope with that this is this is a problem
 

4395
01:37:22,840 --> 01:37:25,740
cope with that this is this is a problem
that has been discussed you know in in

4396
01:37:25,740 --> 01:37:25,750
that has been discussed you know in in
 

4397
01:37:25,750 --> 01:37:29,550
that has been discussed you know in in
Gori extensive detail in social choice

4398
01:37:29,550 --> 01:37:29,560
Gori extensive detail in social choice
 

4399
01:37:29,560 --> 01:37:31,320
Gori extensive detail in social choice
theory you know there one thing I'm

4400
01:37:31,320 --> 01:37:31,330
theory you know there one thing I'm
 

4401
01:37:31,330 --> 01:37:33,960
theory you know there one thing I'm
really enjoying about the recent

4402
01:37:33,960 --> 01:37:33,970
really enjoying about the recent
 

4403
01:37:33,970 --> 01:37:35,670
really enjoying about the recent
direction work has taken in some parts

4404
01:37:35,670 --> 01:37:35,680
direction work has taken in some parts
 

4405
01:37:35,680 --> 01:37:36,510
direction work has taken in some parts
of my team is that

4406
01:37:36,510 --> 01:37:36,520
of my team is that
 

4407
01:37:36,520 --> 01:37:38,490
of my team is that
yeah we're reading the IEEE literature

4408
01:37:38,490 --> 01:37:38,500
yeah we're reading the IEEE literature
 

4409
01:37:38,500 --> 01:37:39,570
yeah we're reading the IEEE literature
we're reading the neuroscience

4410
01:37:39,570 --> 01:37:39,580
we're reading the neuroscience
 

4411
01:37:39,580 --> 01:37:40,740
we're reading the neuroscience
literature but we've also started

4412
01:37:40,740 --> 01:37:40,750
literature but we've also started
 

4413
01:37:40,750 --> 01:37:43,530
literature but we've also started
reading like economics and as I

4414
01:37:43,530 --> 01:37:43,540
reading like economics and as I
 

4415
01:37:43,540 --> 01:37:45,210
reading like economics and as I
mentioned social choice Theory even some

4416
01:37:45,210 --> 01:37:45,220
mentioned social choice Theory even some
 

4417
01:37:45,220 --> 01:37:46,590
mentioned social choice Theory even some
political theory because it turns out

4418
01:37:46,590 --> 01:37:46,600
political theory because it turns out
 

4419
01:37:46,600 --> 01:37:49,710
political theory because it turns out
that it's you know it all becomes

4420
01:37:49,710 --> 01:37:49,720
that it's you know it all becomes
 

4421
01:37:49,720 --> 01:37:53,970
that it's you know it all becomes
relevant it all becomes relevant and but

4422
01:37:53,970 --> 01:37:53,980
relevant it all becomes relevant and but
 

4423
01:37:53,980 --> 01:37:56,340
relevant it all becomes relevant and but
you know at the same time we've been

4424
01:37:56,340 --> 01:37:56,350
you know at the same time we've been
 

4425
01:37:56,350 --> 01:37:59,880
you know at the same time we've been
trying not to write philosophy papers

4426
01:37:59,880 --> 01:37:59,890
trying not to write philosophy papers
 

4427
01:37:59,890 --> 01:38:01,050
trying not to write philosophy papers
right we've been trying not to write

4428
01:38:01,050 --> 01:38:01,060
right we've been trying not to write
 

4429
01:38:01,060 --> 01:38:01,830
right we've been trying not to write
position papers

4430
01:38:01,830 --> 01:38:01,840
position papers
 

4431
01:38:01,840 --> 01:38:03,960
position papers
we're trying to figure out ways of doing

4432
01:38:03,960 --> 01:38:03,970
we're trying to figure out ways of doing
 

4433
01:38:03,970 --> 01:38:06,120
we're trying to figure out ways of doing
actual empirical research that kind of

4434
01:38:06,120 --> 01:38:06,130
actual empirical research that kind of
 

4435
01:38:06,130 --> 01:38:08,940
actual empirical research that kind of
take the first small steps to thinking

4436
01:38:08,940 --> 01:38:08,950
take the first small steps to thinking
 

4437
01:38:08,950 --> 01:38:11,940
take the first small steps to thinking
about what it really means for humans

4438
01:38:11,940 --> 01:38:11,950
about what it really means for humans
 

4439
01:38:11,950 --> 01:38:13,680
about what it really means for humans
with all of their complexity and

4440
01:38:13,680 --> 01:38:13,690
with all of their complexity and
 

4441
01:38:13,690 --> 01:38:17,910
with all of their complexity and
contradiction and you know paradox and

4442
01:38:17,910 --> 01:38:17,920
contradiction and you know paradox and
 

4443
01:38:17,920 --> 01:38:19,800
contradiction and you know paradox and
you know to be bought and to be brought

4444
01:38:19,800 --> 01:38:19,810
you know to be bought and to be brought
 

4445
01:38:19,810 --> 01:38:22,440
you know to be bought and to be brought
into contact with these API systems in a

4446
01:38:22,440 --> 01:38:22,450
into contact with these API systems in a
 

4447
01:38:22,450 --> 01:38:25,020
into contact with these API systems in a
way that then it really makes the world

4448
01:38:25,020 --> 01:38:25,030
way that then it really makes the world
 

4449
01:38:25,030 --> 01:38:26,460
way that then it really makes the world
a better place often reinforcement

4450
01:38:26,460 --> 01:38:26,470
a better place often reinforcement
 

4451
01:38:26,470 --> 01:38:28,080
a better place often reinforcement
learning frameworks actually kind of

4452
01:38:28,080 --> 01:38:28,090
learning frameworks actually kind of
 

4453
01:38:28,090 --> 01:38:29,229
learning frameworks actually kind of
allow you to

4454
01:38:29,229 --> 01:38:29,239
allow you to
 

4455
01:38:29,239 --> 01:38:32,320
allow you to
to do that machine learning and so that

4456
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:32,330
to do that machine learning and so that
 

4457
01:38:32,330 --> 01:38:33,640
to do that machine learning and so that
that's the exciting thing about AI is

4458
01:38:33,640 --> 01:38:33,650
that's the exciting thing about AI is
 

4459
01:38:33,650 --> 01:38:36,190
that's the exciting thing about AI is
allows you to reduce the unsolvable

4460
01:38:36,190 --> 01:38:36,200
allows you to reduce the unsolvable
 

4461
01:38:36,200 --> 01:38:38,350
allows you to reduce the unsolvable
problem philosophical problem into

4462
01:38:38,350 --> 01:38:38,360
problem philosophical problem into
 

4463
01:38:38,360 --> 01:38:40,810
problem philosophical problem into
something more concrete that you can get

4464
01:38:40,810 --> 01:38:40,820
something more concrete that you can get
 

4465
01:38:40,820 --> 01:38:42,940
something more concrete that you can get
ahold of yeah and it allows you to kind

4466
01:38:42,940 --> 01:38:42,950
ahold of yeah and it allows you to kind
 

4467
01:38:42,950 --> 01:38:45,630
ahold of yeah and it allows you to kind
of define the problem in some way that

4468
01:38:45,630 --> 01:38:45,640
of define the problem in some way that
 

4469
01:38:45,640 --> 01:38:50,110
of define the problem in some way that
allows for growth in the system that

4470
01:38:50,110 --> 01:38:50,120
allows for growth in the system that
 

4471
01:38:50,120 --> 01:38:51,910
allows for growth in the system that
sort of beat you know you're not

4472
01:38:51,910 --> 01:38:51,920
sort of beat you know you're not
 

4473
01:38:51,920 --> 01:38:54,190
sort of beat you know you're not
responsible for the details right you

4474
01:38:54,190 --> 01:38:54,200
responsible for the details right you
 

4475
01:38:54,200 --> 01:38:56,020
responsible for the details right you
say this is generally what I want you to

4476
01:38:56,020 --> 01:38:56,030
say this is generally what I want you to
 

4477
01:38:56,030 --> 01:38:58,120
say this is generally what I want you to
do and then learning takes care of the

4478
01:38:58,120 --> 01:38:58,130
do and then learning takes care of the
 

4479
01:38:58,130 --> 01:38:59,170
do and then learning takes care of the
rest

4480
01:38:59,170 --> 01:38:59,180
rest
 

4481
01:38:59,180 --> 01:39:02,260
rest
of course the safety issues are you know

4482
01:39:02,260 --> 01:39:02,270
of course the safety issues are you know
 

4483
01:39:02,270 --> 01:39:04,660
of course the safety issues are you know
arise in that context but I think also

4484
01:39:04,660 --> 01:39:04,670
arise in that context but I think also
 

4485
01:39:04,670 --> 01:39:06,310
arise in that context but I think also
some of these positive issues arise in

4486
01:39:06,310 --> 01:39:06,320
some of these positive issues arise in
 

4487
01:39:06,320 --> 01:39:07,750
some of these positive issues arise in
that context what would it mean for an

4488
01:39:07,750 --> 01:39:07,760
that context what would it mean for an
 

4489
01:39:07,760 --> 01:39:10,720
that context what would it mean for an
AI system to really come to understand

4490
01:39:10,720 --> 01:39:10,730
AI system to really come to understand
 

4491
01:39:10,730 --> 01:39:16,060
AI system to really come to understand
what humans want and you know in if you

4492
01:39:16,060 --> 01:39:16,070
what humans want and you know in if you
 

4493
01:39:16,070 --> 01:39:17,950
what humans want and you know in if you
know in with all of the subtleties of

4494
01:39:17,950 --> 01:39:17,960
know in with all of the subtleties of
 

4495
01:39:17,960 --> 01:39:22,810
know in with all of the subtleties of
that right you know humans humans want

4496
01:39:22,810 --> 01:39:22,820
that right you know humans humans want
 

4497
01:39:22,820 --> 01:39:25,420
that right you know humans humans want
help with certain things but they don't

4498
01:39:25,420 --> 01:39:25,430
help with certain things but they don't
 

4499
01:39:25,430 --> 01:39:27,370
help with certain things but they don't
want everything done for them right

4500
01:39:27,370 --> 01:39:27,380
want everything done for them right
 

4501
01:39:27,380 --> 01:39:29,080
want everything done for them right
there is part of part of the

4502
01:39:29,080 --> 01:39:29,090
there is part of part of the
 

4503
01:39:29,090 --> 01:39:30,550
there is part of part of the
satisfaction that humans get from life

4504
01:39:30,550 --> 01:39:30,560
satisfaction that humans get from life
 

4505
01:39:30,560 --> 01:39:33,130
satisfaction that humans get from life
is in accomplishing things so if there

4506
01:39:33,130 --> 01:39:33,140
is in accomplishing things so if there
 

4507
01:39:33,140 --> 01:39:34,420
is in accomplishing things so if there
were devices around that did everything

4508
01:39:34,420 --> 01:39:34,430
were devices around that did everything
 

4509
01:39:34,430 --> 01:39:36,160
were devices around that did everything
for him you know I often think of the

4510
01:39:36,160 --> 01:39:36,170
for him you know I often think of the
 

4511
01:39:36,170 --> 01:39:38,410
for him you know I often think of the
movie wall-e yeah that's like dystopian

4512
01:39:38,410 --> 01:39:38,420
movie wall-e yeah that's like dystopian
 

4513
01:39:38,420 --> 01:39:40,060
movie wall-e yeah that's like dystopian
in a totally different ways like the

4514
01:39:40,060 --> 01:39:40,070
in a totally different ways like the
 

4515
01:39:40,070 --> 01:39:41,320
in a totally different ways like the
machines are doing everything for us

4516
01:39:41,320 --> 01:39:41,330
machines are doing everything for us
 

4517
01:39:41,330 --> 01:39:43,959
machines are doing everything for us
that's that's not what we want it um you

4518
01:39:43,959 --> 01:39:43,969
that's that's not what we want it um you
 

4519
01:39:43,969 --> 01:39:46,780
that's that's not what we want it um you
know anyway I just I find this you know

4520
01:39:46,780 --> 01:39:46,790
know anyway I just I find this you know
 

4521
01:39:46,790 --> 01:39:47,740
know anyway I just I find this you know
this kind of this opens up a whole

4522
01:39:47,740 --> 01:39:47,750
this kind of this opens up a whole
 

4523
01:39:47,750 --> 01:39:50,920
this kind of this opens up a whole
landscape of research that feels

4524
01:39:50,920 --> 01:39:50,930
landscape of research that feels
 

4525
01:39:50,930 --> 01:39:53,200
landscape of research that feels
affirmative yeah and it's not to me it's

4526
01:39:53,200 --> 01:39:53,210
affirmative yeah and it's not to me it's
 

4527
01:39:53,210 --> 01:39:55,090
affirmative yeah and it's not to me it's
one of the most exciting and it's wide

4528
01:39:55,090 --> 01:39:55,100
one of the most exciting and it's wide
 

4529
01:39:55,100 --> 01:39:55,510
one of the most exciting and it's wide
open

4530
01:39:55,510 --> 01:39:55,520
open
 

4531
01:39:55,520 --> 01:39:57,790
open
yeah we have to because it's a cool

4532
01:39:57,790 --> 01:39:57,800
yeah we have to because it's a cool
 

4533
01:39:57,800 --> 01:39:59,320
yeah we have to because it's a cool
paper talk about dopamine

4534
01:39:59,320 --> 01:39:59,330
paper talk about dopamine
 

4535
01:39:59,330 --> 01:40:01,390
paper talk about dopamine
oh yeah okay so I can let's we were

4536
01:40:01,390 --> 01:40:01,400
oh yeah okay so I can let's we were
 

4537
01:40:01,400 --> 01:40:03,610
oh yeah okay so I can let's we were
gonna we were gonna I was gonna give you

4538
01:40:03,610 --> 01:40:03,620
gonna we were gonna I was gonna give you
 

4539
01:40:03,620 --> 01:40:05,709
gonna we were gonna I was gonna give you
a quick summary here's a quick summary

4540
01:40:05,709 --> 01:40:05,719
a quick summary here's a quick summary
 

4541
01:40:05,719 --> 01:40:10,630
a quick summary here's a quick summary
of uh what's the title of the paper I I

4542
01:40:10,630 --> 01:40:10,640
of uh what's the title of the paper I I
 

4543
01:40:10,640 --> 01:40:13,740
of uh what's the title of the paper I I
think we called it a distributional

4544
01:40:13,740 --> 01:40:13,750
think we called it a distributional
 

4545
01:40:13,750 --> 01:40:15,760
think we called it a distributional
distributional code for value in

4546
01:40:15,760 --> 01:40:15,770
distributional code for value in
 

4547
01:40:15,770 --> 01:40:18,459
distributional code for value in
dopamine based reinforcement learning

4548
01:40:18,459 --> 01:40:18,469
dopamine based reinforcement learning
 

4549
01:40:18,469 --> 01:40:22,540
dopamine based reinforcement learning

yes so that's another project that grew
out of pure AI research a number of

out of pure AI research a number of
 

4553
01:40:26,840 --> 01:40:29,890
out of pure AI research a number of
people that deep mind and a few other

people that deep mind and a few other
 

4555
01:40:29,900 --> 01:40:32,709
people that deep mind and a few other
places had started working on a new

01:40:32,709 --> 01:40:32,719
places had started working on a new
 

4557
01:40:32,719 --> 01:40:34,180
places had started working on a new
version of reinforcement learning it

4558

version of reinforcement learning it
 

4559
01:40:34,190 --> 01:40:36,160
version of reinforcement learning it
would the

4617
01:41:36,890 --> 01:41:40,060
that amount of money and we don't reduce
that to a single number and it had been

01:41:40,060 --> 01:41:40,070
that to a single number and it had been
 

4619
01:41:40,070 --> 01:41:42,700

observed through experiments through you
 

4621
01:41:42,710 --> 01:41:45,520

4627
01:41:50,050 --> 01:41:52,950
representation really accelerated
reinforcement learning and led to better

4628
01:41:52,950 --> 01:41:52,960
reinforcement learning and led to better
 

4629
01:41:52,960 --> 01:41:55,540

policies what's your intuition about so

4630
01:41:55,540 --> 01:41:55,550
policies what's your intuition about so
 

4631
01:41:55,550 --> 01:41:57,400
policies what's your intuition about so
we're talking about rewards yeah so

4632
01:41:57,400 --> 01:41:57,410
we're talking about rewards yeah so
 

4633
01:41:57,410 --> 01:41:59,500
we're talking about rewards yeah so
what's the intuition why that is why

4634
01:41:59,500 --> 01:41:59,510
what's the intuition why that is why
 

4635
01:41:59,510 --> 01:42:01,410
what's the intuition why that is why
what is it well it's an it's kind of a

what is it well it's an it's kind of a
 

4637

what is it well it's an it's kind of a
surprising historical note at least

4638
01:42:04,630 --> 01:42:04,640
surprising historical note at least
 

4639
01:42:04,640 --> 01:42:07,480
surprising historical note at least
surprised me when I learned it that this

4640
01:42:07,480 --> 01:42:07,490
surprised me when I learned it that this
 

4641
01:42:07,490 --> 01:42:08,950
surprised me when I learned it that this
had been tried out in a kind of

4642
01:42:08,950 --> 01:42:08,960
had been tried out in a kind of
 

4643
01:42:08,960 --> 01:42:11,020
had been tried out in a kind of
heuristic way people thought well gee

4644
01:42:11,020 --> 01:42:11,030
heuristic way people thought well gee
 

4645
01:42:11,030 --> 01:42:12,850
heuristic way people thought well gee
what would happen if we tried and then

4646
01:42:12,850 --> 01:42:12,860
what would happen if we tried and then
 

4647
01:42:12,860 --> 01:42:15,030
what would happen if we tried and then
it had this empirically it had this

4648
01:42:15,030 --> 01:42:15,040
it had this empirically it had this
 

4649
01:42:15,040 --> 01:42:17,980
it had this empirically it had this
striking effect and it was only then

4650
01:42:17,980 --> 01:42:17,990
striking effect and it was only then
 

4651
01:42:17,990 --> 01:42:19,540
striking effect and it was only then
that people started thinking well gee

4652
01:42:19,540 --> 01:42:19,550
that people started thinking well gee
 

4653
01:42:19,550 --> 01:42:22,510
that people started thinking well gee
why wait why wait why why is this

4654
01:42:22,510 --> 01:42:22,520
why wait why wait why why is this
 

4655
01:42:22,520 --> 01:42:24,850
why wait why wait why why is this
working and and that's led to a series

4656
01:42:24,850 --> 01:42:24,860
working and and that's led to a series
 

4657
01:42:24,860 --> 01:42:27,340
working and and that's led to a series
of studies just trying to figure out why

4658
01:42:27,340 --> 01:42:27,350
of studies just trying to figure out why
 

4659
01:42:27,350 --> 01:42:29,980
of studies just trying to figure out why
it works it which is ongoing but one

4660
01:42:29,980 --> 01:42:29,990
it works it which is ongoing but one
 

4661
01:42:29,990 --> 01:42:31,210
it works it which is ongoing but one
thing that's already clear from that

4662
01:42:31,210 --> 01:42:31,220
thing that's already clear from that
 

4663
01:42:31,220 --> 01:42:33,940
thing that's already clear from that
research is that one reason that it

4664
01:42:33,940 --> 01:42:33,950
research is that one reason that it
 

4665
01:42:33,950 --> 01:42:36,910
research is that one reason that it
helps is that it drives richer

4666
01:42:36,910 --> 01:42:36,920
helps is that it drives richer
 

4667
01:42:36,920 --> 01:42:40,180
helps is that it drives richer
representation learning so if you

4668
01:42:40,180 --> 01:42:40,190
representation learning so if you
 

4669
01:42:40,190 --> 01:42:43,240
representation learning so if you
imagine imagine two situations that have

4670
01:42:43,240 --> 01:42:43,250
imagine imagine two situations that have
 

4671
01:42:43,250 --> 01:42:45,490
imagine imagine two situations that have
the same expected value they're the same

4672
01:42:45,490 --> 01:42:45,500
the same expected value they're the same
 

4673
01:42:45,500 --> 01:42:49,350
the same expected value they're the same
kind of weighted average value Stan

deep reinforcement learning algorithms
 

4677
01:42:51,190 --> 01:42:52,680
deep reinforcement learning algorithms
are going to take those two situations

4678
01:42:52,680 --> 01:42:52,690
are going to take those two situations
 

4679
01:42:52,690 --> 01:42:55,080
are going to take those two situations
and kind of in terms of the way they're

4680
01:42:55,080 --> 01:42:55,090
and kind of in terms of the way they're
 

4681
01:42:55,090 --> 01:42:57,000
and kind of in terms of the way they're
represented internally dozen ex-squeeze

4682
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:57,010
represented internally dozen ex-squeeze
 

4683
01:42:57,010 --> 01:42:59,790
represented internally dozen ex-squeeze
them together because the the thing that

4684
01:42:59,790 --> 01:42:59,800
them together because the the thing that
 

4685
01:42:59,800 --> 01:43:02,790
them together because the the thing that
you're trying to represent which is

4686
01:43:02,790 --> 01:43:02,800
you're trying to represent which is
 

4687
01:43:02,800 --> 01:43:04,979
you're trying to represent which is
their expected value is the same so all

4688
01:43:04,979 --> 01:43:04,989
their expected value is the same so all
 

4689
01:43:04,989 --> 01:43:06,540
their expected value is the same so all
the way through the system things are

4690
01:43:06,540 --> 01:43:06,550
the way through the system things are
 

4691
01:43:06,550 --> 01:43:08,729
the way through the system things are
going to be mushed together but what if

4692
01:43:08,729 --> 01:43:08,739
going to be mushed together but what if
 

4693
01:43:08,739 --> 01:43:10,950
going to be mushed together but what if
in what if what if those two situations

4694
01:43:10,950 --> 01:43:10,960
in what if what if those two situations
 

4695
01:43:10,960 --> 01:43:12,479
in what if what if those two situations
actually have different value

4696
01:43:12,479 --> 01:43:12,489
actually have different value
 

4697
01:43:12,489 --> 01:43:15,530
actually have different value
distributions they have the same average

4698
01:43:15,530 --> 01:43:15,540
distributions they have the same average
 

4699
01:43:15,540 --> 01:43:17,520

4701
01:43:17,530 --> 01:43:20,810

distributions of value in that situation

4702
01:43:20,810 --> 01:43:20,820
distributions of value in that situation
 

4703
01:43:20,820 --> 01:43:22,830
distributions of value in that situation
distributional learning will will

4704
01:43:22,830 --> 01:43:22,840
distributional learning will will
 

4705
01:43:22,840 --> 01:43:24,510
distributional learning will will
maintain the distinction between these

4706
01:43:24,510 --> 01:43:24,520
maintain the distinction between these
 

4707
01:43:24,520 --> 01:43:26,580
maintain the distinction between these
two things so to make a long story short

01:43:53,459 --> 01:43:53,469
all what is dopamine why is this why is
 

4729
01:43:53,469 --> 01:43:59,490
all what is dopamine why is this why is
it all useful to to think about in the

01:43:59,490 --> 01:43:59,500
it all useful to to think about in the
 

4731
01:43:59,500 --> 01:44:01,439
it all useful to to think about in the
artificial intelligence sense but what

4732
01:44:01,439 --> 01:44:01,449
artificial intelligence sense but what
 

4733
01:44:01,449 --> 01:44:03,450
artificial intelligence sense but what
do we know about dopamine in the human

4734
01:44:03,450 --> 01:44:03,460
do we know about dopamine in the human
 

4735

01:44:08,679 --> 01:44:12,120
have to do with the prefrontal cortex
and learning in general yeah so well

4742
01:44:12,120 --> 01:44:12,130
and learning in general yeah so well

01:44:14,970 --> 01:44:14,980
there's this hint this is also some a
 

4745
01:44:14,980 --> 01:44:17,930
there's this hint this is also some a

4760
01:44:41,100 --> 01:44:41,110
reward prediction error so I was talking
 

4761
01:44:41,110 --> 01:44:43,140
reward prediction error so I was talking
a moment ago about these value

4762
01:44:43,140 --> 01:44:43,150
a moment ago about these value
 

4763
01:44:43,150 --> 01:44:45,149
a moment ago about these value
representations how do you learn them

4764
01:44:45,149 --> 01:44:45,159
representations how do you learn them
 

4765
01:44:45,159 --> 01:44:46,350

how do you update them based on

4766
01:44:46,350 --> 01:44:46,360
how do you update them based on
 

4767
01:44:46,360 --> 01:44:49,740
how do you update them based on
experience well if you if you made some

4768
01:44:49,740 --> 01:44:49,750
experience well if you if you made some
 

4769
01:44:49,750 --> 01:44:51,720
experience well if you if you made some
prediction about a future reward and

4770
01:44:51,720 --> 01:44:51,730
prediction about a future reward and
 

4771
01:44:51,730 --> 01:44:53,370
prediction about a future reward and
then you get more reward than you were

4772
01:44:53,370 --> 01:44:53,380
then you get more reward than you were
 

4773
01:44:53,380 --> 01:44:55,830
then you get more reward than you were
expecting then probably retrospectively

4774
01:44:55,830 --> 01:44:55,840
expecting then probably retrospectively
 

4775
01:44:55,840 --> 01:44:58,820
expecting then probably retrospectively
you want to go back and increase the

4776
01:44:58,820 --> 01:44:58,830
you want to go back and increase the
 

4777
01:44:58,830 --> 01:45:01,200
you want to go back and increase the
value representation that you attached

4778
01:45:01,200 --> 01:45:01,210
value representation that you attached
 

4779
01:45:01,210 --> 01:45:02,390
value representation that you attached
to the

4780
01:45:02,390 --> 01:45:02,400
to the
 

4781
01:45:02,400 --> 01:45:05,180
to the
earlier situation if you got less reward

4782
01:45:05,180 --> 01:45:05,190
earlier situation if you got less reward
 

4783
01:45:05,190 --> 01:45:06,080
earlier situation if you got less reward
than you were expecting

4784
01:45:06,080 --> 01:45:06,090
than you were expecting
 

4785
01:45:06,090 --> 01:45:07,610
than you were expecting
you should probably decrement that

4786
01:45:07,610 --> 01:45:07,620
you should probably decrement that
 

4787
01:45:07,620 --> 01:45:09,380
you should probably decrement that
estimate and that's the process of

4788
01:45:09,380 --> 01:45:09,390
estimate and that's the process of
 

4789
01:45:09,390 --> 01:45:11,060
estimate and that's the process of
temporal difference exactly this is the

01:45:11,060 --> 01:45:11,070
temporal difference exactly this is the
 

4791
01:45:11,070 --> 01:45:12,620

4849
01:46:25,890 --> 01:46:28,160
guy in my group will Chris Nelson who's
a computational neuroscientist and said

4850
01:46:28,160 --> 01:46:28,170
a computational neuroscientist and said
 

4851
01:46:28,170 --> 01:46:29,780
a computational neuroscientist and said
gee you know is it possible that

4852
01:46:29,780 --> 01:46:29,790
gee you know is it possible that
 

4853
01:46:29,790 --> 01:46:31,790
gee you know is it possible that
dopamine might be doing something like

4854
01:46:31,790 --> 01:46:31,800
dopamine might be doing something like
 

4855
01:46:31,800 --> 01:46:33,470
dopamine might be doing something like
this distributional coding thing and

4856
01:46:33,470 --> 01:46:33,480
this distributional coding thing and
 

4857
01:46:33,480 --> 01:46:35,330
this distributional coding thing and
they started looking at what was in the

4858
01:46:35,330 --> 01:46:35,340
they started looking at what was in the
 

4859
01:46:35,340 --> 01:46:36,890
they started looking at what was in the
literature and then they brought me in

4860
01:46:36,890 --> 01:46:36,900
literature and then they brought me in
 

4861
01:46:36,900 --> 01:46:39,470

we started talking to now ochita and we

4862
01:46:39,470 --> 01:46:39,480
we started talking to now ochita and we
 

4863
01:46:39,480 --> 01:46:40,760
we started talking to now ochita and we
came up some with some specific

4864
01:46:40,760 --> 01:46:40,770
came up some with some specific
 

4865
01:46:40,770 --> 01:46:43,070
came up some with some specific
predictions about you know if the brain

4866
01:46:43,070 --> 01:46:43,080
predictions about you know if the brain

01:46:43,080 --> 01:46:44,510
predictions about you know if the brain
is using this kind of distributional

4868
01:46:44,510 --> 01:46:44,520
is using this kind of distributional
 

4869
01:46:44,520 --> 01:46:46,880
is using this kind of distributional
coding then in the tasks that now has

4870
01:46:46,880 --> 01:46:46,890
coding then in the tasks that now has
 

4871
01:46:46,890 --> 01:46:48,439
coding then in the tasks that now has
studied you should see this this this

4872
01:46:48,439 --> 01:46:48,449
studied you should see this this this
 

4873
01:46:48,449 --> 01:46:50,390
studied you should see this this this
and this and that's where the paper came

4874
01:46:50,390 --> 01:46:50,400
and this and that's where the paper came
 

4875
01:46:50,400 --> 01:46:52,189
and this and that's where the paper came
from we kind of enumerated a set of

4876
01:46:52,189 --> 01:46:52,199
from we kind of enumerated a set of
 

4877
01:46:52,199 --> 01:46:54,439
from we kind of enumerated a set of
predictions all of which ended up being

4878
01:46:54,439 --> 01:46:54,449
predictions all of which ended up being
 

4879
01:46:54,449 --> 01:46:57,860
predictions all of which ended up being
fairly clearly confirmed and all of

4880
01:46:57,860 --> 01:46:57,870
fairly clearly confirmed and all of
 

4881
01:46:57,870 --> 01:46:59,660
fairly clearly confirmed and all of
which leads to at least some initial

4882
01:46:59,660 --> 01:46:59,670
which leads to at least some initial
 

4883
01:46:59,670 --> 01:47:01,850
which leads to at least some initial
indication that the brain might be doing

4884
01:47:01,850 --> 01:47:01,860
indication that the brain might be doing
 

4885
01:47:01,860 --> 01:47:03,229
indication that the brain might be doing
something like this distributional

4886
01:47:03,229 --> 01:47:03,239
something like this distributional
 

4887
01:47:03,239 --> 01:47:04,990
something like this distributional
coding that dopamine might be

4888
01:47:04,990 --> 01:47:05,000
coding that dopamine might be
 

4889
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:07,100
coding that dopamine might be
representing surprise signals in a way

4890
01:47:07,100 --> 01:47:07,110
representing surprise signals in a way
 

4891
01:47:07,110 --> 01:47:10,010
representing surprise signals in a way
that is not just collapsing everything

4892
01:47:10,010 --> 01:47:10,020
that is not just collapsing everything
 

4893
01:47:10,020 --> 01:47:11,419
that is not just collapsing everything
to a single number but instead it's kind

4894
01:47:11,419 --> 01:47:11,429
to a single number but instead it's kind
 

4895
01:47:11,429 --> 01:47:12,640
to a single number but instead it's kind
of respecting the

4896
01:47:12,640 --> 01:47:12,650
of respecting the
 

4897
01:47:12,650 --> 01:47:16,030
of respecting the
the variety of future outcomes if that

4898
01:47:16,030 --> 01:47:16,040
the variety of future outcomes if that
 

4899
01:47:16,040 --> 01:47:17,470
the variety of future outcomes if that
makes sense so yeah so that's we're

4900
01:47:17,470 --> 01:47:17,480
makes sense so yeah so that's we're
 

4901
01:47:17,480 --> 01:47:19,780
makes sense so yeah so that's we're
showing suggesting possibly that

4902
01:47:19,780 --> 01:47:19,790
showing suggesting possibly that
 

4903
01:47:19,790 --> 01:47:21,870
showing suggesting possibly that
dopamine has a really interesting

4904
01:47:21,870 --> 01:47:21,880
dopamine has a really interesting
 

4905
01:47:21,880 --> 01:47:25,450
dopamine has a really interesting
representation scheme for for in in the

4906
01:47:25,450 --> 01:47:25,460
representation scheme for for in in the
 

4907
01:47:25,460 --> 01:47:27,100
representation scheme for for in in the
human brain for its reward signal

4908
01:47:27,100 --> 01:47:27,110
human brain for its reward signal
 

4909
01:47:27,110 --> 01:47:29,560
human brain for its reward signal
exactly that's fascinating it's just

4910
01:47:29,560 --> 01:47:29,570
exactly that's fascinating it's just
 

4911
01:47:29,570 --> 01:47:31,990
exactly that's fascinating it's just
that's another beautiful example of AI

4912
01:47:31,990 --> 01:47:32,000
that's another beautiful example of AI
 

4913
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:33,430
that's another beautiful example of AI
revealing something that's about

4914
01:47:33,430 --> 01:47:33,440
revealing something that's about
 

4915
01:47:33,440 --> 01:47:35,590
revealing something that's about
neuroscience potentially suggesting

01:47:35,600 --> 01:47:37,230
neuroscience potentially suggesting
possibilities well you never know so a

4918
01:47:37,230 --> 01:47:37,240
possibilities well you never know so a
 

4919
01:47:37,240 --> 01:47:39,400
possibilities well you never know so a
minute you published paper like that the

4920
01:47:39,400 --> 01:47:39,410
minute you published paper like that the
 

4921
01:47:39,410 --> 01:47:41,320
minute you published paper like that the
next thing you think is I hope that

4922
01:47:41,320 --> 01:47:41,330
next thing you think is I hope that
 

4923
01:47:41,330 --> 01:47:43,720
next thing you think is I hope that
replicates like I hope I hope we see

4924
01:47:43,720 --> 01:47:43,730
replicates like I hope I hope we see
 

4925
01:47:43,730 --> 01:47:45,160
replicates like I hope I hope we see
that same thing in other datasets but of

4926
01:47:45,160 --> 01:47:45,170
that same thing in other datasets but of
 

4927
01:47:45,170 --> 01:47:48,370
that same thing in other datasets but of
course several labs now are doing the

4928
01:47:48,370 --> 01:47:48,380
course several labs now are doing the
 

4929
01:47:48,380 --> 01:47:49,780
course several labs now are doing the
follow-up experiment so we'll know soon

4930
01:47:49,780 --> 01:47:49,790
follow-up experiment so we'll know soon
 

4931
01:47:49,790 --> 01:47:52,150
follow-up experiment so we'll know soon
but it has been it has been a lot of fun

4932
01:47:52,150 --> 01:47:52,160
but it has been it has been a lot of fun
 

4933
01:47:52,160 --> 01:47:54,010
but it has been it has been a lot of fun
for us to you know to take these ideas

4934
01:47:54,010 --> 01:47:54,020
for us to you know to take these ideas
 

4935
01:47:54,020 --> 01:47:56,020
for us to you know to take these ideas
from AI and kind of bring them into

4936
01:47:56,020 --> 01:47:56,030
from AI and kind of bring them into
 

4937
01:47:56,030 --> 01:47:57,910
from AI and kind of bring them into
neuroscience and and you know see how

4938
01:47:57,910 --> 01:47:57,920
neuroscience and and you know see how
 

4939
01:47:57,920 --> 01:48:00,400
neuroscience and and you know see how
far we can get so we kind of talked

4940
01:48:00,400 --> 01:48:00,410
far we can get so we kind of talked
 

4941
01:48:00,410 --> 01:48:01,840
far we can get so we kind of talked
about it a little bit but where do you

4942
01:48:01,840 --> 01:48:01,850
about it a little bit but where do you
 

4943
01:48:01,850 --> 01:48:04,120
about it a little bit but where do you
see the field of neuroscience and

4944
01:48:04,120 --> 01:48:04,130
see the field of neuroscience and
 

4945
01:48:04,130 --> 01:48:07,630
see the field of neuroscience and

involved a lot of interesting behavior
 

4981
01:49:12,710 --> 01:49:16,180
involved a lot of interesting behavior
and this is for a variety of reasons you

4982
01:49:16,180 --> 01:49:16,190
and this is for a variety of reasons you
 

4983
01:49:16,190 --> 01:49:18,670
and this is for a variety of reasons you
know one of which is in order to employ

4984
01:49:18,670 --> 01:49:18,680
know one of which is in order to employ
 

4985
01:49:18,680 --> 01:49:20,290
know one of which is in order to employ
some of these technologies you actually

4986
01:49:20,290 --> 01:49:20,300
some of these technologies you actually
 

4987
01:49:20,300 --> 01:49:22,090
some of these technologies you actually
have to if you're if you're studying a

4988
01:49:22,090 --> 01:49:22,100
have to if you're if you're studying a
 

4989
01:49:22,100 --> 01:49:23,710
have to if you're if you're studying a
mouse you have to head fix the mouse in

4990
01:49:23,710 --> 01:49:23,720
mouse you have to head fix the mouse in
 

4991
01:49:23,720 --> 01:49:24,910
mouse you have to head fix the mouse in
other words you know you have to like

4992
01:49:24,910 --> 01:49:24,920
other words you know you have to like
 

4993
01:49:24,920 --> 01:49:26,330
other words you know you have to like
immobilize the mouse

4994
01:49:26,330 --> 01:49:26,340
immobilize the mouse
 

4995
01:49:26,340 --> 01:49:28,280
immobilize the mouse
and so it's been it's been tricky to

4996
01:49:28,280 --> 01:49:28,290
and so it's been it's been tricky to
 

4997
01:49:28,290 --> 01:49:30,109
and so it's been it's been tricky to
come up with ways of eliciting

4998
01:49:30,109 --> 01:49:30,119
come up with ways of eliciting
 

4999
01:49:30,119 --> 01:49:31,609
come up with ways of eliciting
interesting behavior from a mouse that's

5000
01:49:31,609 --> 01:49:31,619
interesting behavior from a mouse that's
 

5001
01:49:31,619 --> 01:49:34,100
interesting behavior from a mouse that's
that's restrained in this way but people

5002
01:49:34,100 --> 01:49:34,110
that's restrained in this way but people
 

5003
01:49:34,110 --> 01:49:37,780
that's restrained in this way but people
have begun to you know create very

5004
01:49:37,780 --> 01:49:37,790
have begun to you know create very
 

5005
01:49:37,790 --> 01:49:39,649
have begun to you know create very
interesting solutions to this like

5006
01:49:39,649 --> 01:49:39,659
interesting solutions to this like
 

5007
01:49:39,659 --> 01:49:41,660
interesting solutions to this like
virtual reality environments where the

5008
01:49:41,660 --> 01:49:41,670
virtual reality environments where the
 

5009
01:49:41,670 --> 01:49:43,100
virtual reality environments where the
animal can kind of move a trackball and

5010
01:49:43,100 --> 01:49:43,110
animal can kind of move a trackball and
 

5011
01:49:43,110 --> 01:49:48,229
animal can kind of move a trackball and
and and and as people have kind of begun

5012
01:49:48,229 --> 01:49:48,239
and and and as people have kind of begun
 

5013
01:49:48,239 --> 01:49:49,399
and and and as people have kind of begun
to explore what you can do with these

5014
01:49:49,399 --> 01:49:49,409
to explore what you can do with these
 

5015
01:49:49,409 --> 01:49:50,180
to explore what you can do with these
technologies

5016
01:49:50,180 --> 01:49:50,190
technologies
 

5017
01:49:50,190 --> 01:49:51,500
technologies
I feel like more and more people are

5018
01:49:51,500 --> 01:49:51,510
I feel like more and more people are
 

5019
01:49:51,510 --> 01:49:54,320
I feel like more and more people are
asking well let's try to bring behavior

5020
01:49:54,320 --> 01:49:54,330
asking well let's try to bring behavior
 

5021
01:49:54,330 --> 01:49:56,870
asking well let's try to bring behavior
into the picture let's try to like

5022
01:49:56,870 --> 01:49:56,880
into the picture let's try to like
 

5023
01:49:56,880 --> 01:49:59,450
into the picture let's try to like
reintroduce behavior which was supposed

5024
01:49:59,450 --> 01:49:59,460
reintroduce behavior which was supposed
 

5025
01:49:59,460 --> 01:50:00,680
reintroduce behavior which was supposed
to be what this whole thing was about

5026
01:50:00,680 --> 01:50:00,690
to be what this whole thing was about
 

5027
01:50:00,690 --> 01:50:06,859
to be what this whole thing was about
and I'm hoping that those two trends the

5028
01:50:06,859 --> 01:50:06,869
and I'm hoping that those two trends the
 

5029
01:50:06,869 --> 01:50:09,439
and I'm hoping that those two trends the
the kind of growing interest in behavior

5030
01:50:09,439 --> 01:50:09,449
the kind of growing interest in behavior
 

5031
01:50:09,449 --> 01:50:13,010
the kind of growing interest in behavior
and the widespread widespread interest

5032
01:50:13,010 --> 01:50:13,020
and the widespread widespread interest
 

5033
01:50:13,020 --> 01:50:15,410
and the widespread widespread interest
in what's going on in AI will come

5034
01:50:15,410 --> 01:50:15,420
in what's going on in AI will come
 

5035
01:50:15,420 --> 01:50:18,080
in what's going on in AI will come
together to kind of open a new chapter

5036
01:50:18,080 --> 01:50:18,090
together to kind of open a new chapter
 

5037
01:50:18,090 --> 01:50:21,919
together to kind of open a new chapter
in neuroscience research where there's a

5038
01:50:21,919 --> 01:50:21,929
in neuroscience research where there's a
 

5039
01:50:21,929 --> 01:50:25,520
in neuroscience research where there's a
kind of rebirth of interest in the

5040
01:50:25,520 --> 01:50:25,530
kind of rebirth of interest in the
 

5041
01:50:25,530 --> 01:50:27,200
kind of rebirth of interest in the
structure of behavior and its underlying

5042
01:50:27,200 --> 01:50:27,210
structure of behavior and its underlying
 

5043
01:50:27,210 --> 01:50:29,750
structure of behavior and its underlying
substrates but that that research is

5044
01:50:29,750 --> 01:50:29,760
substrates but that that research is
 

5045
01:50:29,760 --> 01:50:33,770
substrates but that that research is
being informed by computational

5046
01:50:33,770 --> 01:50:33,780
being informed by computational
 

5047
01:50:33,780 --> 01:50:35,000
being informed by computational
mechanisms that were coming to

5048
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:35,010
mechanisms that were coming to
 

5049
01:50:35,010 --> 01:50:38,270
mechanisms that were coming to
understand in AI you know if we can do

5050
01:50:38,270 --> 01:50:38,280
understand in AI you know if we can do
 

5051
01:50:38,280 --> 01:50:39,709
understand in AI you know if we can do
that then we might be taking a step

5052
01:50:39,709 --> 01:50:39,719
that then we might be taking a step
 

5053
01:50:39,719 --> 01:50:43,100
that then we might be taking a step
closer to this utopian future that we

5054
01:50:43,100 --> 01:50:43,110
closer to this utopian future that we
 

5055
01:50:43,110 --> 01:50:44,689
closer to this utopian future that we
were talking about earlier where there's

5056
01:50:44,689 --> 01:50:44,699
were talking about earlier where there's
 

5057
01:50:44,699 --> 01:50:46,070
were talking about earlier where there's
really no distinction between psychology

5058
01:50:46,070 --> 01:50:46,080
really no distinction between psychology
 

5059
01:50:46,080 --> 01:50:48,800
really no distinction between psychology
and neuroscience night neuroscience is

5060
01:50:48,800 --> 01:50:48,810
and neuroscience night neuroscience is
 

5061
01:50:48,810 --> 01:50:51,709
and neuroscience night neuroscience is
about studying the mechanisms that

5062
01:50:51,709 --> 01:50:51,719
about studying the mechanisms that
 

5063
01:50:51,719 --> 01:50:54,859
about studying the mechanisms that
underlie whenever it is the brain is for

5064
01:50:54,859 --> 01:50:54,869
underlie whenever it is the brain is for
 

5065
01:50:54,869 --> 01:50:57,080
underlie whenever it is the brain is for
and you know what is the brain for it's

5066
01:50:57,080 --> 01:50:57,090
and you know what is the brain for it's
 

5067
01:50:57,090 --> 01:50:59,810
and you know what is the brain for it's
for behavior now I feel like we could I

5068
01:50:59,810 --> 01:50:59,820
for behavior now I feel like we could I
 

5069
01:50:59,820 --> 01:51:01,760
for behavior now I feel like we could I
feel like we could maybe take a step

5070
01:51:01,760 --> 01:51:01,770
feel like we could maybe take a step
 

5071
01:51:01,770 --> 01:51:04,520
feel like we could maybe take a step
toward that now if people are motivated

5072
01:51:04,520 --> 01:51:04,530
toward that now if people are motivated
 

5073
01:51:04,530 --> 01:51:08,839
toward that now if people are motivated
in the right way you also ask Betty I so

5074
01:51:08,839 --> 01:51:08,849
in the right way you also ask Betty I so
 

5075
01:51:08,849 --> 01:51:10,850
in the right way you also ask Betty I so
that is very science question you said

5076
01:51:10,850 --> 01:51:10,860
that is very science question you said
 

5077
01:51:10,860 --> 01:51:12,620
that is very science question you said
neuroscience that's right and especially

5078
01:51:12,620 --> 01:51:12,630
neuroscience that's right and especially
 

5079
01:51:12,630 --> 01:51:14,330
neuroscience that's right and especially
place like deep mind are interested in

5080
01:51:14,330 --> 01:51:14,340
place like deep mind are interested in
 

5081
01:51:14,340 --> 01:51:16,490
place like deep mind are interested in
both branches sort of what what about

5082
01:51:16,490 --> 01:51:16,500
both branches sort of what what about
 

5083
01:51:16,500 --> 01:51:18,290
both branches sort of what what about
the engineering or intelligence systems

5084
01:51:18,290 --> 01:51:18,300
the engineering or intelligence systems
 

5085
01:51:18,300 --> 01:51:23,000
the engineering or intelligence systems
I think I think the one of the key

5086
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:23,010
I think I think the one of the key
 

5087
01:51:23,010 --> 01:51:26,330
I think I think the one of the key
challenges that a lot of people are

5088
01:51:26,330 --> 01:51:26,340
challenges that a lot of people are
 

5089
01:51:26,340 --> 01:51:30,680
challenges that a lot of people are
seeing now in AI is to build systems

5090
01:51:30,680 --> 01:51:30,690
seeing now in AI is to build systems
 

5091
01:51:30,690 --> 01:51:32,770
seeing now in AI is to build systems
that have the kind of

5092
01:51:32,770 --> 01:51:32,780
that have the kind of
 

5093
01:51:32,780 --> 01:51:36,590
that have the kind of
flexibility and the kind of flexibility

5094
01:51:36,590 --> 01:51:36,600
flexibility and the kind of flexibility
 

5095
01:51:36,600 --> 01:51:38,870
flexibility and the kind of flexibility
that humans have in two senses one is

5096
01:51:38,870 --> 01:51:38,880
that humans have in two senses one is
 

5097
01:51:38,880 --> 01:51:40,960
that humans have in two senses one is
that humans can be good at many things

5098
01:51:40,960 --> 01:51:40,970
that humans can be good at many things
 

5099
01:51:40,970 --> 01:51:43,910
that humans can be good at many things
they're not just expert at one thing and

5100
01:51:43,910 --> 01:51:43,920
they're not just expert at one thing and
 

5101
01:51:43,920 --> 01:51:45,620
they're not just expert at one thing and
they're also flexible in the sense that

5102
01:51:45,620 --> 01:51:45,630
they're also flexible in the sense that
 

5103
01:51:45,630 --> 01:51:48,740
they're also flexible in the sense that
they can switch between things very

5104
01:51:48,740 --> 01:51:48,750
they can switch between things very
 

5105
01:51:48,750 --> 01:51:50,930
they can switch between things very
easily and they can pick up new things

5106
01:51:50,930 --> 01:51:50,940
easily and they can pick up new things
 

5107
01:51:50,940 --> 01:51:53,840
easily and they can pick up new things
very quickly because they they very they

5108
01:51:53,840 --> 01:51:53,850
very quickly because they they very they
 

5109
01:51:53,850 --> 01:51:56,870
very quickly because they they very they
very able see what a new task has in

5110
01:51:56,870 --> 01:51:56,880
very able see what a new task has in
 

5111
01:51:56,880 --> 01:51:58,520
very able see what a new task has in
common with other things that they've

01:51:58,520 --> 01:51:58,530
common with other things that they've
 

5113
01:51:58,530 --> 01:52:04,220
common with other things that they've
done and and that's something that our

5114
01:52:04,220 --> 01:52:04,230
done and and that's something that our
 

5115
01:52:04,230 --> 01:52:07,370
done and and that's something that our
AI systems to you know blatantly do not

5116
01:52:07,370 --> 01:52:07,380
AI systems to you know blatantly do not
 

5117
01:52:07,380 --> 01:52:10,970
AI systems to you know blatantly do not
have there are some people who like to

5118
01:52:10,970 --> 01:52:10,980
have there are some people who like to
 

5119
01:52:10,980 --> 01:52:13,760
have there are some people who like to
argue that deep learning and deep RL are

5120
01:52:13,760 --> 01:52:13,770
argue that deep learning and deep RL are
 

5121
01:52:13,770 --> 01:52:16,400
argue that deep learning and deep RL are
simply wrong for getting that kind of

5122
01:52:16,400 --> 01:52:16,410
simply wrong for getting that kind of
 

5123
01:52:16,410 --> 01:52:19,190
simply wrong for getting that kind of
flexibility I don't share that belief

5124
01:52:19,190 --> 01:52:19,200
flexibility I don't share that belief
 

5125
01:52:19,200 --> 01:52:22,550
flexibility I don't share that belief
but the simpler fact of the matter is

5126
01:52:22,550 --> 01:52:22,560
but the simpler fact of the matter is
 

5127
01:52:22,560 --> 01:52:24,020
but the simpler fact of the matter is
we're not building things yet that do

5128
01:52:24,020 --> 01:52:24,030
we're not building things yet that do
 

5129
01:52:24,030 --> 01:52:26,630
we're not building things yet that do
have that kind of flexibility and and I

5130
01:52:26,630 --> 01:52:26,640
have that kind of flexibility and and I
 

5131
01:52:26,640 --> 01:52:28,610
have that kind of flexibility and and I
think the the attention of a large part

5132
01:52:28,610 --> 01:52:28,620
think the the attention of a large part
 

5133
01:52:28,620 --> 01:52:30,230
think the the attention of a large part
of the AI community is starting to pivot

5134
01:52:30,230 --> 01:52:30,240
of the AI community is starting to pivot
 

5135
01:52:30,240 --> 01:52:32,530
of the AI community is starting to pivot
to that question how do we get that

5136
01:52:32,530 --> 01:52:32,540
to that question how do we get that
 

5137
01:52:32,540 --> 01:52:36,110
to that question how do we get that
that's going to lead to a focus on

5138
01:52:36,110 --> 01:52:36,120
that's going to lead to a focus on
 

5139
01:52:36,120 --> 01:52:39,260
that's going to lead to a focus on
abstraction it's gonna lead to a focus

5140
01:52:39,260 --> 01:52:39,270
abstraction it's gonna lead to a focus
 

5141
01:52:39,270 --> 01:52:42,380
abstraction it's gonna lead to a focus
on what in psychology we call cognitive

5142
01:52:42,380 --> 01:52:42,390
on what in psychology we call cognitive
 

5143
01:52:42,390 --> 01:52:44,840
on what in psychology we call cognitive
control which is the ability to switch

5144
01:52:44,840 --> 01:52:44,850
control which is the ability to switch
 

5145
01:52:44,850 --> 01:52:47,540
control which is the ability to switch
between tasks the ability to quickly put

5146
01:52:47,540 --> 01:52:47,550
between tasks the ability to quickly put
 

5147
01:52:47,550 --> 01:52:49,160
between tasks the ability to quickly put
together a program of behavior that

5148
01:52:49,160 --> 01:52:49,170
together a program of behavior that
 

5149
01:52:49,170 --> 01:52:51,950
together a program of behavior that
you've never executed before but you

5150
01:52:51,950 --> 01:52:51,960
you've never executed before but you
 

5151
01:52:51,960 --> 01:52:53,570
you've never executed before but you
know makes sense for a particular set of

5152
01:52:53,570 --> 01:52:53,580
know makes sense for a particular set of
 

5153
01:52:53,580 --> 01:52:56,330
know makes sense for a particular set of
demands it's very closely related to

5154
01:52:56,330 --> 01:52:56,340
demands it's very closely related to
 

5155
01:52:56,340 --> 01:52:59,330
demands it's very closely related to
what the prefrontal cortex does on the

5156
01:52:59,330 --> 01:52:59,340
what the prefrontal cortex does on the
 

5157
01:52:59,340 --> 01:53:01,580
what the prefrontal cortex does on the
neuroscience side so I think it's going

5158
01:53:01,580 --> 01:53:01,590
neuroscience side so I think it's going
 

5159
01:53:01,590 --> 01:53:03,950
neuroscience side so I think it's going
to be an interesting and interesting new

5160
01:53:03,950 --> 01:53:03,960
to be an interesting and interesting new
 

5161
01:53:03,960 --> 01:53:06,560
to be an interesting and interesting new
chapter so that's the reasoning side and

5162
01:53:06,560 --> 01:53:06,570
chapter so that's the reasoning side and
 

5163
01:53:06,570 --> 01:53:08,900
chapter so that's the reasoning side and
cognition side but let me ask the over

5164
01:53:08,900 --> 01:53:08,910
cognition side but let me ask the over
 

5165
01:53:08,910 --> 01:53:10,970
cognition side but let me ask the over
romanticize question do you think we'll

5166
01:53:10,970 --> 01:53:10,980
romanticize question do you think we'll
 

5167
01:53:10,980 --> 01:53:14,300
romanticize question do you think we'll
ever engineer an AGI system that we

5168
01:53:14,300 --> 01:53:14,310
ever engineer an AGI system that we
 

5169
01:53:14,310 --> 01:53:17,390
ever engineer an AGI system that we
humans would be able to love and that

5170
01:53:17,390 --> 01:53:17,400
humans would be able to love and that
 

5171
01:53:17,400 --> 01:53:20,840
humans would be able to love and that
would love us back so I have that level

5172
01:53:20,840 --> 01:53:20,850
would love us back so I have that level
 

5173
01:53:20,850 --> 01:53:26,600
would love us back so I have that level
and depth of connection I love that

5174
01:53:26,600 --> 01:53:26,610
and depth of connection I love that
 

5175
01:53:26,610 --> 01:53:30,880
and depth of connection I love that
question and it it it relates closely to

5176
01:53:30,880 --> 01:53:30,890
question and it it it relates closely to
 

5177
01:53:30,890 --> 01:53:32,960
question and it it it relates closely to
things that I've been thinking about a

5178
01:53:32,960 --> 01:53:32,970
things that I've been thinking about a
 

5179
01:53:32,970 --> 01:53:34,610
things that I've been thinking about a
lot lately you know in the context of

5180
01:53:34,610 --> 01:53:34,620
lot lately you know in the context of
 

5181
01:53:34,620 --> 01:53:37,570
lot lately you know in the context of
this human AI research there there's

5182
01:53:37,570 --> 01:53:37,580
this human AI research there there's
 

5183
01:53:37,580 --> 01:53:42,080
this human AI research there there's
social psychology research in particular

5184
01:53:42,080 --> 01:53:42,090
social psychology research in particular
 

5185
01:53:42,090 --> 01:53:45,050
social psychology research in particular
by Susan Fiske at Princeton in the

5186
01:53:45,050 --> 01:53:45,060
by Susan Fiske at Princeton in the
 

5187
01:53:45,060 --> 01:53:46,340
by Susan Fiske at Princeton in the
department I used to

5188
01:53:46,340 --> 01:53:46,350
department I used to
 

5189
01:53:46,350 --> 01:53:49,670
department I used to
where I used to work where she she

5190
01:53:49,670 --> 01:53:49,680
where I used to work where she she
 

5191
01:53:49,680 --> 01:53:53,150
where I used to work where she she
dissects human attitudes toward other

5192
01:53:53,150 --> 01:53:53,160
dissects human attitudes toward other
 

5193
01:53:53,160 --> 01:53:56,090
dissects human attitudes toward other
humans into a sort of two-dimensional

5194
01:53:56,090 --> 01:53:56,100
humans into a sort of two-dimensional
 

5195
01:53:56,100 --> 01:53:58,100
humans into a sort of two-dimensional
you know a two-dimensional

5196
01:53:58,100 --> 01:53:58,110
you know a two-dimensional
 

5197
01:53:58,110 --> 01:54:02,210
you know a two-dimensional
two-dimensional scheme and one dimension

5198
01:54:02,210 --> 01:54:02,220
two-dimensional scheme and one dimension
 

5199
01:54:02,220 --> 01:54:05,120
two-dimensional scheme and one dimension
is about ability you know how able how

5200
01:54:05,120 --> 01:54:05,130
is about ability you know how able how
 

5201
01:54:05,130 --> 01:54:10,070
is about ability you know how able how
capable is is this other person and the

5202
01:54:10,070 --> 01:54:10,080
capable is is this other person and the
 

5203
01:54:10,080 --> 01:54:12,950
capable is is this other person and the
but the other dimension is warmth so you

5204
01:54:12,950 --> 01:54:12,960
but the other dimension is warmth so you
 

5205
01:54:12,960 --> 01:54:16,040
but the other dimension is warmth so you
can imagine another person who's very

5206
01:54:16,040 --> 01:54:16,050
can imagine another person who's very
 

5207
01:54:16,050 --> 01:54:18,110
can imagine another person who's very
skilled and capable but it's very cold

5208
01:54:18,110 --> 01:54:18,120
skilled and capable but it's very cold
 

5209
01:54:18,120 --> 01:54:21,590
skilled and capable but it's very cold
right and you wouldn't you wouldn't

5210
01:54:21,590 --> 01:54:21,600
right and you wouldn't you wouldn't
 

5211
01:54:21,600 --> 01:54:24,290
right and you wouldn't you wouldn't
really like highly you might have some

5212
01:54:24,290 --> 01:54:24,300
really like highly you might have some
 

5213
01:54:24,300 --> 01:54:25,400
really like highly you might have some
reservations about that other person

5214
01:54:25,400 --> 01:54:25,410
reservations about that other person
 

5215
01:54:25,410 --> 01:54:29,330
reservations about that other person
right but there's also a kind of

5216
01:54:29,330 --> 01:54:29,340
right but there's also a kind of
 

5217
01:54:29,340 --> 01:54:30,740
right but there's also a kind of
reservation that we might have about

5218
01:54:30,740 --> 01:54:30,750
reservation that we might have about
 

5219
01:54:30,750 --> 01:54:33,530
reservation that we might have about
another person who who elicits in us or

5220
01:54:33,530 --> 01:54:33,540
another person who who elicits in us or
 

5221
01:54:33,540 --> 01:54:36,140
another person who who elicits in us or
displays a lot of human warmth but is

5222
01:54:36,140 --> 01:54:36,150
displays a lot of human warmth but is
 

5223
01:54:36,150 --> 01:54:38,570
displays a lot of human warmth but is
you know not good at getting things done

5224
01:54:38,570 --> 01:54:38,580
you know not good at getting things done
 

5225
01:54:38,580 --> 01:54:41,690
you know not good at getting things done
right that that like the the greatest

5226
01:54:41,690 --> 01:54:41,700
right that that like the the greatest
 

5227
01:54:41,700 --> 01:54:43,850
right that that like the the greatest
esteem that we we reserved our greatest

5228
01:54:43,850 --> 01:54:43,860
esteem that we we reserved our greatest
 

5229
01:54:43,860 --> 01:54:46,280
esteem that we we reserved our greatest
esteem really for people who are both

5230
01:54:46,280 --> 01:54:46,290
esteem really for people who are both
 

5231
01:54:46,290 --> 01:54:51,200
esteem really for people who are both
highly capable and also quite warm right

5232
01:54:51,200 --> 01:54:51,210
highly capable and also quite warm right
 

5233
01:54:51,210 --> 01:54:53,270
highly capable and also quite warm right
that that's that's like the best of the

5234
01:54:53,270 --> 01:54:53,280
that that's that's like the best of the
 

5235
01:54:53,280 --> 01:54:55,610
that that's that's like the best of the
best this is I mean I'm just this isn't

5236
01:54:55,610 --> 01:54:55,620
best this is I mean I'm just this isn't
 

5237
01:54:55,620 --> 01:54:57,590
best this is I mean I'm just this isn't
a normative statement I'm making this is

5238
01:54:57,590 --> 01:54:57,600
a normative statement I'm making this is
 

5239
01:54:57,600 --> 01:54:59,090
a normative statement I'm making this is
just an empirical it's an empirical

5240
01:54:59,090 --> 01:54:59,100
just an empirical it's an empirical
 

5241
01:54:59,100 --> 01:55:01,040
just an empirical it's an empirical
statement this is what humans seem this

5242
01:55:01,040 --> 01:55:01,050
statement this is what humans seem this
 

5243
01:55:01,050 --> 01:55:02,390
statement this is what humans seem this
is these are the two dimensions that

5244
01:55:02,390 --> 01:55:02,400
is these are the two dimensions that
 

5245
01:55:02,400 --> 01:55:04,370
is these are the two dimensions that
people seem to kind of like along which

5246
01:55:04,370 --> 01:55:04,380
people seem to kind of like along which
 

5247
01:55:04,380 --> 01:55:07,460
people seem to kind of like along which
people size other people up in an in AI

5248
01:55:07,460 --> 01:55:07,470
people size other people up in an in AI
 

5249
01:55:07,470 --> 01:55:09,110
people size other people up in an in AI
research we really focus on this

5250
01:55:09,110 --> 01:55:09,120
research we really focus on this
 

5251
01:55:09,120 --> 01:55:11,090
research we really focus on this
capability thing you like we want our

5252
01:55:11,090 --> 01:55:11,100
capability thing you like we want our
 

5253
01:55:11,100 --> 01:55:12,500
capability thing you like we want our
agents to be able to do stuff you know

5254
01:55:12,500 --> 01:55:12,510
agents to be able to do stuff you know
 

5255
01:55:12,510 --> 01:55:14,450
agents to be able to do stuff you know
this thing can play go at a superhuman

5256
01:55:14,450 --> 01:55:14,460
this thing can play go at a superhuman
 

5257
01:55:14,460 --> 01:55:16,580
this thing can play go at a superhuman
level that's awesome and but that's only

5258
01:55:16,580 --> 01:55:16,590
level that's awesome and but that's only
 

5259
01:55:16,590 --> 01:55:18,890
level that's awesome and but that's only
one dimension what's the what about the

5260
01:55:18,890 --> 01:55:18,900
one dimension what's the what about the
 

5261
01:55:18,900 --> 01:55:19,930
one dimension what's the what about the
other dimension what would it mean for

5262
01:55:19,930 --> 01:55:19,940
other dimension what would it mean for
 

5263
01:55:19,940 --> 01:55:24,710
other dimension what would it mean for
Nai system to be warm and you know I

5264
01:55:24,710 --> 01:55:24,720
Nai system to be warm and you know I
 

5265
01:55:24,720 --> 01:55:26,210
Nai system to be warm and you know I
don't know maybe there are easy

5266
01:55:26,210 --> 01:55:26,220
don't know maybe there are easy
 

5267
01:55:26,220 --> 01:55:27,920
don't know maybe there are easy
solutions here like we can put them put

5268
01:55:27,920 --> 01:55:27,930
solutions here like we can put them put
 

5269
01:55:27,930 --> 01:55:30,560
solutions here like we can put them put
a face on rei systems it's cute it has

5270
01:55:30,560 --> 01:55:30,570
a face on rei systems it's cute it has
 

5271
01:55:30,570 --> 01:55:32,570
a face on rei systems it's cute it has
big years I mean that's probably part of

5272
01:55:32,570 --> 01:55:32,580
big years I mean that's probably part of
 

5273
01:55:32,580 --> 01:55:34,670
big years I mean that's probably part of
it but I think it also has to do with a

5274
01:55:34,670 --> 01:55:34,680
it but I think it also has to do with a
 

5275
01:55:34,680 --> 01:55:38,360
it but I think it also has to do with a
pattern of behavior a pattern of you

5276
01:55:38,360 --> 01:55:38,370
pattern of behavior a pattern of you
 

5277
01:55:38,370 --> 01:55:40,100
pattern of behavior a pattern of you
know what would it mean for an AI system

5278
01:55:40,100 --> 01:55:40,110
know what would it mean for an AI system
 

5279
01:55:40,110 --> 01:55:42,700
know what would it mean for an AI system
to display caring compassionate behavior

5280
01:55:42,700 --> 01:55:42,710
to display caring compassionate behavior
 

5281
01:55:42,710 --> 01:55:45,350
to display caring compassionate behavior
in a way that actually made us feel like

5282
01:55:45,350 --> 01:55:45,360
in a way that actually made us feel like
 

5283
01:55:45,360 --> 01:55:48,440
in a way that actually made us feel like
it was for real yeah that we didn't feel

5284
01:55:48,440 --> 01:55:48,450
it was for real yeah that we didn't feel
 

5285
01:55:48,450 --> 01:55:50,390
it was for real yeah that we didn't feel
like it was simulated we didn't feel

5286
01:55:50,390 --> 01:55:50,400
like it was simulated we didn't feel
 

5287
01:55:50,400 --> 01:55:53,840
like it was simulated we didn't feel
like we were being duped to me that you

5288
01:55:53,840 --> 01:55:53,850
like we were being duped to me that you
 

5289
01:55:53,850 --> 01:55:55,340
like we were being duped to me that you
know people talk about the Turing test

5290
01:55:55,340 --> 01:55:55,350
know people talk about the Turing test
 

5291
01:55:55,350 --> 01:55:58,220
know people talk about the Turing test
or some some descendant of it I feel

5292
01:55:58,220 --> 01:55:58,230
or some some descendant of it I feel
 

5293
01:55:58,230 --> 01:55:59,139
or some some descendant of it I feel
like

5294
01:55:59,139 --> 01:55:59,149
like
 

5295
01:55:59,149 --> 01:56:01,330
like
that's the ultimate Turing test you know

5296
01:56:01,330 --> 01:56:01,340
that's the ultimate Turing test you know
 

5297
01:56:01,340 --> 01:56:04,389
that's the ultimate Turing test you know
is there is there an AI system that can

5298
01:56:04,389 --> 01:56:04,399
is there is there an AI system that can
 

5299
01:56:04,399 --> 01:56:06,310
is there is there an AI system that can
not only convince us that it knows how

5300
01:56:06,310 --> 01:56:06,320
not only convince us that it knows how
 

5301
01:56:06,320 --> 01:56:08,139
not only convince us that it knows how
to reason and it knows how to interpret

5302
01:56:08,139 --> 01:56:08,149
to reason and it knows how to interpret
 

5303
01:56:08,149 --> 01:56:11,409
to reason and it knows how to interpret
language but that we're comfortable

5304
01:56:11,409 --> 01:56:11,419
language but that we're comfortable
 

5305
01:56:11,419 --> 01:56:14,199
language but that we're comfortable
saying yeah that AI system is a good guy

5306
01:56:14,199 --> 01:56:14,209
saying yeah that AI system is a good guy
 

5307
01:56:14,209 --> 01:56:17,169
saying yeah that AI system is a good guy
you know like I'm the warmth scale

5308
01:56:17,169 --> 01:56:17,179
you know like I'm the warmth scale
 

5309
01:56:17,179 --> 01:56:19,179
you know like I'm the warmth scale
yeah whatever warmth is we kind of

5310
01:56:19,179 --> 01:56:19,189
yeah whatever warmth is we kind of
 

5311
01:56:19,189 --> 01:56:21,520
yeah whatever warmth is we kind of
intuitively understand it but we also

5312
01:56:21,520 --> 01:56:21,530
intuitively understand it but we also
 

5313
01:56:21,530 --> 01:56:25,600
intuitively understand it but we also
want to be able to yeah we don't even

5314
01:56:25,600 --> 01:56:25,610
want to be able to yeah we don't even
 

5315
01:56:25,610 --> 01:56:29,229
want to be able to yeah we don't even
understand it explicitly enough yet to

5316
01:56:29,229 --> 01:56:29,239
understand it explicitly enough yet to
 

5317
01:56:29,239 --> 01:56:31,509
understand it explicitly enough yet to
be able to engineer it exactly and

5318
01:56:31,509 --> 01:56:31,519
be able to engineer it exactly and
 

5319
01:56:31,519 --> 01:56:33,040
be able to engineer it exactly and
that's and that's an open scientific

5320
01:56:33,040 --> 01:56:33,050
that's and that's an open scientific
 

5321
01:56:33,050 --> 01:56:34,869
that's and that's an open scientific
question you kind of alluded it several

5322
01:56:34,869 --> 01:56:34,879
question you kind of alluded it several
 

5323
01:56:34,879 --> 01:56:37,359
question you kind of alluded it several
times in the human AI interaction that's

5324
01:56:37,359 --> 01:56:37,369
times in the human AI interaction that's
 

5325
01:56:37,369 --> 01:56:38,979
times in the human AI interaction that's
the question that should be studied and

5326
01:56:38,979 --> 01:56:38,989
the question that should be studied and
 

5327
01:56:38,989 --> 01:56:40,929
the question that should be studied and
probably one of the most important

5328
01:56:40,929 --> 01:56:40,939
probably one of the most important
 

5329
01:56:40,939 --> 01:56:43,600
probably one of the most important
questions and usually and human to AG we

5330
01:56:43,600 --> 01:56:43,610
questions and usually and human to AG we
 

5331
01:56:43,610 --> 01:56:46,389
questions and usually and human to AG we
humans are so good at it yeah you know

given you know whatever genes they
 

5341
01:56:54,679 --> 01:56:57,219
given you know whatever genes they
manage to inherit but there's also

5342
01:56:57,219 --> 01:56:57,229
manage to inherit but there's also
 

5343
01:56:57,229 --> 01:56:59,350

there's also there are also learned

5344

there's also there are also learned
 

5345
01:56:59,360 --> 01:57:02,020
there's also there are also learned
skills involved right I mean there are

5346
01:57:02,020 --> 01:57:02,030
skills involved right I mean there are
 

5347
01:57:02,030 --> 01:57:04,179
skills involved right I mean there are
ways of communicating to other people

5348

ways of communicating to other people
 

5349
01:57:04,189 --> 01:57:07,479

that you care that they matter to you

5350
01:57:07,479 --> 01:57:07,489
that you care that they matter to you

that you're enjoying interacting with
 

5353
01:57:09,409 --> 01:57:12,310
that you're enjoying interacting with
them yeah right and we learn these

5354
01:57:12,310 --> 01:57:12,320
them yeah right and we learn these
 

5355
01:57:12,320 --> 01:57:15,429
them yeah right and we learn these
skills from one another and it's not out

5356
01:57:15,429 --> 01:57:15,439
skills from one another and it's not out
 

5357
01:57:15,439 --> 01:57:17,799
skills from one another and it's not out
of the question that we could build

5358
01:57:17,799 --> 01:57:17,809
of the question that we could build
 

5359
01:57:17,809 --> 01:57:19,299

5361
01:57:19,309 --> 01:57:21,699

I think it's hopeless as you say that we

5362
01:57:21,699 --> 01:57:21,709
I think it's hopeless as you say that we
 

5363
01:57:21,709 --> 01:57:24,129
I think it's hopeless as you say that we
could somehow hand design these sorts of

could somehow hand design these sorts of
 

5365
01:57:24,139 --> 01:57:26,409
could somehow hand design these sorts of
these sorts of behaviors but it's not

5366
01:57:26,409 --> 01:57:26,419
these sorts of behaviors but it's not
 

5367
01:57:26,419 --> 01:57:27,489
these sorts of behaviors but it's not
out of the question that we could build

out of the question that we could build
 

5369
01:57:27,499 --> 01:57:32,350
out of the question that we could build
systems that kind of we-we-we in instill

5370
01:57:32,350 --> 01:57:32,360
systems that kind of we-we-we in instill
 

5371
01:57:32,360 --> 01:57:34,509
systems that kind of we-we-we in instill
in them something that sets them out in

5372
01:57:34,509 --> 01:57:34,519
in them something that sets them out in
 

5373
01:57:34,519 --> 01:57:37,389
in them something that sets them out in
the right direction so that they they

5374
01:57:37,389 --> 01:57:37,399
the right direction so that they they
