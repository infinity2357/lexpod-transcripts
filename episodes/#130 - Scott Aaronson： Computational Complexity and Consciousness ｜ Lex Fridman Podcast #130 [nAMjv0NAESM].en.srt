erinson let's start with the most absurd
 

189
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,309
erinson let's start with the most absurd
question but i've read you write some

190
00:03:34,309 --> 00:03:34,319
question but i've read you write some
 

191
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,390
question but i've read you write some
fascinating stuff about it so uh let's

192
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:36,400
fascinating stuff about it so uh let's
 

193
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,110
fascinating stuff about it so uh let's
go there

194
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:37,120
go there
 

195
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,750
go there
are we living in a simulation what

196
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:39,760
are we living in a simulation what
 

197
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,589
are we living in a simulation what
difference does it make lex

198
00:03:41,589 --> 00:03:41,599
difference does it make lex
 

199
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,750
difference does it make lex
i mean i'm serious what difference

200
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:43,760
i mean i'm serious what difference
 

201
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,710
i mean i'm serious what difference
because if we are

202
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:44,720
because if we are
 

203
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,430
because if we are
living in a simulation it raises the

204
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:47,440
living in a simulation it raises the
 

205
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,229
living in a simulation it raises the
question

206
00:03:48,229 --> 00:03:48,239
question
 

207
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,470
question
how real does something have to be in

208
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:50,480
how real does something have to be in
 

209
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,149
how real does something have to be in
stimulation for in it to be

210
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:52,159
stimulation for in it to be
 

211
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:54,710
stimulation for in it to be
sufficiently immersive for us humans but

212
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:54,720
sufficiently immersive for us humans but
 

213
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,470
sufficiently immersive for us humans but
i mean even in principle how could we

214
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:56,480
i mean even in principle how could we
 

215
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,149
i mean even in principle how could we
ever know if we were in one

216
00:03:58,149 --> 00:03:58,159
ever know if we were in one
 

217
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:00,869
ever know if we were in one
right a perfect simulation by definition

218
00:04:00,869 --> 00:04:00,879
right a perfect simulation by definition
 

219
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,390
right a perfect simulation by definition
is something that's indistinguishable

220
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:02,400
is something that's indistinguishable
 

221
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,830
is something that's indistinguishable
from the real thing well we didn't say

222
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:03,840
from the real thing well we didn't say
 

223
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,110
from the real thing well we didn't say
anything about perfect it could be

224
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:05,120
anything about perfect it could be
 

225
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,429
anything about perfect it could be
no no that's that's right well if it was

226
00:04:07,429 --> 00:04:07,439
no no that's that's right well if it was
 

227
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,910
no no that's that's right well if it was
an imperfect simulation if we could hack

228
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:09,920
an imperfect simulation if we could hack
 

229
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,309
an imperfect simulation if we could hack
it

230
00:04:10,309 --> 00:04:10,319
it
 

231
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,149
it
you know find a bug in it then that

232
00:04:12,149 --> 00:04:12,159
you know find a bug in it then that
 

233
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:13,750
you know find a bug in it then that
would be one thing right if

234
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:13,760
would be one thing right if
 

235
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,670
would be one thing right if
if this was like the matrix and there

236
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:15,680
if this was like the matrix and there
 

237
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,189
if this was like the matrix and there
was a way for me to

238
00:04:17,189 --> 00:04:17,199
was a way for me to
 

239
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:19,909
was a way for me to
you know do flying kung fu moves or

240
00:04:19,909 --> 00:04:19,919
you know do flying kung fu moves or
 

241
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:21,830
you know do flying kung fu moves or
something by hacking the simulation

242
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:21,840
something by hacking the simulation
 

243
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:22,950
something by hacking the simulation
well then you know we would have to

244
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:22,960
well then you know we would have to
 

245
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,550
well then you know we would have to
cross that bridge when we came to it

246
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:24,560
cross that bridge when we came to it
 

247
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,350
cross that bridge when we came to it
wouldn't we

248
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:25,360
wouldn't we
 

249
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,749
wouldn't we
right i mean at that point you know i

250
00:04:27,749 --> 00:04:27,759
right i mean at that point you know i
 

251
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:28,710
right i mean at that point you know i
it's

252
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:28,720
it's
 

253
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,550
it's
it's uh hard to see the difference

254
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:30,560
it's uh hard to see the difference
 

255
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,550
it's uh hard to see the difference
between that and just uh

256
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:32,560
between that and just uh
 

257
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,950
between that and just uh
uh what people would ordinarily refer to

258
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:34,960
uh what people would ordinarily refer to
 

259
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,550
uh what people would ordinarily refer to
as a world with miracles

260
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:36,560
as a world with miracles
 

261
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,230
as a world with miracles
you know uh what about from a different

262
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:38,240
you know uh what about from a different
 

263
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,390
you know uh what about from a different
perspective thinking about the universe

264
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:40,400
perspective thinking about the universe
 

265
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,870
perspective thinking about the universe
as a computation like a program running

266
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:42,880
as a computation like a program running
 

267
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,070
as a computation like a program running
on a computer

268
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:44,080
on a computer
 

269
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,230
on a computer
that's kind of a neighboring concept it

270
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:46,240
that's kind of a neighboring concept it
 

271
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,310
that's kind of a neighboring concept it
is it is an interesting and reasonably

272
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:48,320
is it is an interesting and reasonably
 

273
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,469
is it is an interesting and reasonably
well-defined question to ask

274
00:04:50,469 --> 00:04:50,479
well-defined question to ask
 

275
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:52,710
well-defined question to ask
is the world computable you know you

276
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:52,720
is the world computable you know you
 

277
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,790
is the world computable you know you
know does the world satisfy

278
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:54,800
know does the world satisfy

283
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,469
touring thesis
yeah that is you know uh could we take

284
00:05:00,469 --> 00:05:00,479
yeah that is you know uh could we take
 

285
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,310
yeah that is you know uh could we take
any physical system

286
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:02,320
any physical system
 

287
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,510
any physical system
and simulate it to uh you know any

288
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:05,520
and simulate it to uh you know any
 

289
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,990
and simulate it to uh you know any
desired precision by a touring machine

290
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:08,000
desired precision by a touring machine
 

291
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,670
desired precision by a touring machine
you know given the appropriate input

292
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:09,680
you know given the appropriate input
 

293
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,590
you know given the appropriate input
data right and

294
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:11,600
data right and
 

295
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,909
data right and
so far i think the indications are

296
00:05:13,909 --> 00:05:13,919
so far i think the indications are
 

297
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:15,110
so far i think the indications are
pretty strong that

298
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:15,120
pretty strong that
 

299
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,950
pretty strong that
our world does seem to satisfy the

00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:16,960
our world does seem to satisfy the

303
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,629

uh at least if it doesn't then we

304
00:05:20,629 --> 00:05:20,639
uh at least if it doesn't then we
 

305
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,790
uh at least if it doesn't then we
haven't yet discovered why not

00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:22,800
haven't yet discovered why not
 

307
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,270
haven't yet discovered why not
uh but now does that mean that our

308
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:25,280
uh but now does that mean that our
 

309
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,430
uh but now does that mean that our
universe is a simulation

310
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:27,440
universe is a simulation
 

311
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,310
universe is a simulation
well you know that word seems to suggest

312
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:30,320
well you know that word seems to suggest
 

313
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,590
well you know that word seems to suggest
that there is some other

314
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:31,600
that there is some other
 

315
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,150
that there is some other
larger universe in which it is running

316
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:34,160
larger universe in which it is running
 

317
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:34,790
larger universe in which it is running
right right

318
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:34,800
right right
 

319
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,950
right right
and the problem there is that if the

320
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:36,960
and the problem there is that if the
 

321
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,710
and the problem there is that if the
simulation is perfect

322
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:38,720
simulation is perfect
 

323
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,870
simulation is perfect
then we're never going to be able to get

324
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:40,880
then we're never going to be able to get
 

325
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,310
then we're never going to be able to get
any direct evidence

about that other universe you know we

about that other universe you know we

will only be able to see
uh the effects of the computation that

well let's imagine an analogy let's

336
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:53,440
well let's imagine an analogy let's
 

337
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,749
well let's imagine an analogy let's
imagine a pc a personal computer a

00:05:55,749 --> 00:05:55,759
imagine a pc a personal computer a

341
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,990
computer
is it possible with the advent of

342
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:00,000
is it possible with the advent of
 

343
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,350
is it possible with the advent of
artificial intelligence

344
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:01,360
artificial intelligence
 

345
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,110

00:06:09,189 --> 00:06:09,199
to understand its creator i mean that's
 

351
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:11,189
to understand its creator i mean that's
a simple is that is that a ridiculous

00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:13,360
connection well i mean with the
 

355
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,350

computers that we actually have
 

357
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,870
computers that we actually have
i mean first of all uh we we all know

00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:18,880
i mean first of all uh we we all know
 

359
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,510
i mean first of all uh we we all know
that uh humans have done an imperfect

program to a playpen
 

371
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,950
program to a playpen
but you know as soon as there's one uh

372
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:32,960
but you know as soon as there's one uh
 

373
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:33,990

right this is how most hacks work you

384
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:43,680
right this is how most hacks work you
 

385
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,790
right this is how most hacks work you
know

386
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:44,800
know
 

387
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,670
know
viruses and worms and exploits and you

388
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:47,680
viruses and worms and exploits and you
 

389
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,510
viruses and worms and exploits and you
know you would have to imagine that

390
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:49,520
know you would have to imagine that
 

391
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,510
know you would have to imagine that
an ai would be able to discover

392
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:51,520
an ai would be able to discover
 

393
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,790
an ai would be able to discover
something like that

394
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:52,800
something like that
 

395
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,950
something like that
now you know of course if we could

396
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:54,960
now you know of course if we could
 

397
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,469
now you know of course if we could
actually discover some

398
00:06:56,469 --> 00:06:56,479
actually discover some
 

399
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:59,909
actually discover some
exploit of reality itself then you know

400
00:06:59,909 --> 00:06:59,919
exploit of reality itself then you know
 

401
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,029
exploit of reality itself then you know
then this whole

402
00:07:01,029 --> 00:07:01,039
then this whole
 

403
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:04,070
then this whole
i mean we we then in some sense we we

404
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:04,080
i mean we we then in some sense we we
 

405
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,390
i mean we we then in some sense we we
wouldn't have to philosophize about this

406
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:06,400
wouldn't have to philosophize about this
 

407
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,830
wouldn't have to philosophize about this
right this would no longer be a

408
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:07,840
right this would no longer be a
 

409
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,670
right this would no longer be a
metaphysical conversation

410
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:09,680
metaphysical conversation
 

411
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,790
metaphysical conversation
right this would just but that's

412
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:12,800
right this would just but that's
 

413
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,230
right this would just but that's
the question is what is what would that

414
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:14,240
the question is what is what would that
 

415
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,790
the question is what is what would that
hack look like yeah well i have no idea

416
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:16,800
hack look like yeah well i have no idea
 

417
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,589
hack look like yeah well i have no idea
i mean

418
00:07:17,589 --> 00:07:17,599
i mean
 

419
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:20,629
i mean
uh uh peter shore uh you know the

420
00:07:20,629 --> 00:07:20,639
uh uh peter shore uh you know the
 

421
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,629
uh uh peter shore uh you know the
you know very famous person in quantum

422
00:07:22,629 --> 00:07:22,639
you know very famous person in quantum
 

423
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,870
you know very famous person in quantum
computing of course has a joked

424
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:24,880
computing of course has a joked
 

425
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,589
computing of course has a joked
that uh maybe the reason why we haven't

426
00:07:27,589 --> 00:07:27,599
that uh maybe the reason why we haven't
 

427
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:27,909
that uh maybe the reason why we haven't
yet

428
00:07:27,909 --> 00:07:27,919
yet
 

429
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:29,990
yet
you know integrated general relativity

430
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:30,000
you know integrated general relativity
 

431
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,510
you know integrated general relativity
in quantum mechanics

432
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:31,520
in quantum mechanics
 

433
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,870
in quantum mechanics
is that you know the part of the

434
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:32,880
is that you know the part of the
 

435
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,790
is that you know the part of the
universe that depends on both of them

436
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:34,800
universe that depends on both of them
 

437
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,350
universe that depends on both of them
was that

438
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:35,360
was that
 

439
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,990
was that
was actually left unspecified and if we

440
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:38,000
was actually left unspecified and if we
 

441
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,150
was actually left unspecified and if we
ever tried to do an experiment

442
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:40,160
ever tried to do an experiment
 

443
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,629
ever tried to do an experiment
uh involving the singularity of a black

444
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:42,639
uh involving the singularity of a black
 

445
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:44,230
uh involving the singularity of a black
hole or something like that

446
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:44,240
hole or something like that
 

447
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,070
hole or something like that
then you know the universe would just uh

448
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:46,080
then you know the universe would just uh
 

449
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,749
then you know the universe would just uh
generate an overflow error

450
00:07:47,749 --> 00:07:47,759
generate an overflow error
 

451
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,550
generate an overflow error
or something right yeah we would just

452
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:50,560
or something right yeah we would just
 

453
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,830
or something right yeah we would just
crash the universe

454
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:51,840
crash the universe
 

455
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,189
crash the universe
now um you know the the the universe you

456
00:07:55,189 --> 00:07:55,199
now um you know the the the universe you
 

457
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,430
now um you know the the the universe you
know has seemed to hold up pretty well

458
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:57,440
know has seemed to hold up pretty well
 

459
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,629
know has seemed to hold up pretty well
for you know 14 billion years right so

460
00:08:00,629 --> 00:08:00,639
for you know 14 billion years right so
 

461
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:03,830
for you know 14 billion years right so
you know my uh you know uh

462
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:03,840
you know my uh you know uh
 

463
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,950
you know my uh you know uh
occam's razor kind of guess has to be

464
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:06,960
occam's razor kind of guess has to be
 

465
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,110
occam's razor kind of guess has to be
that you know it will continue to hold

466
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:09,120
that you know it will continue to hold
 

467
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,029
that you know it will continue to hold
up you know that the fact that we don't

468
00:08:11,029 --> 00:08:11,039
up you know that the fact that we don't
 

469
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:12,629
up you know that the fact that we don't
know the laws of physics

470
00:08:12,629 --> 00:08:12,639
know the laws of physics
 

471
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:15,110
know the laws of physics
governing some phenomenon is not a

472
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:15,120
governing some phenomenon is not a
 

473
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,070
governing some phenomenon is not a
strong sign

474
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:16,080
strong sign
 

475
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,390
strong sign
that probing that phenomenon is going to

476
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:18,400
that probing that phenomenon is going to
 

477
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,909
that probing that phenomenon is going to
crash the universe

478
00:08:19,909 --> 00:08:19,919
crash the universe
 

479
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:22,070
crash the universe
right but you know of course i could be

480
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:22,080
right but you know of course i could be
 

481
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,589
right but you know of course i could be
wrong but do you think

482
00:08:23,589 --> 00:08:23,599
wrong but do you think
 

483
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:25,749
wrong but do you think
on the physics side of things you know

484
00:08:25,749 --> 00:08:25,759
on the physics side of things you know
 

485
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:27,430
on the physics side of things you know
there's been uh

486
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:27,440
there's been uh
 

487
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,469
there's been uh
recently a few folks eric weinstein

488
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:30,479
recently a few folks eric weinstein
 

489
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,389
recently a few folks eric weinstein
and stephen wolfram that came out with a

490
00:08:32,389 --> 00:08:32,399
and stephen wolfram that came out with a
 

491
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,550
and stephen wolfram that came out with a
theory of everything i think there's a

492
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:34,560
theory of everything i think there's a
 

493
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,029
theory of everything i think there's a
history of physicists dreaming and

494
00:08:37,029 --> 00:08:37,039
history of physicists dreaming and
 

495
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:37,990
history of physicists dreaming and
working on

496
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:38,000
working on
 

497
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,589
working on
the unification of all the laws of

498
00:08:39,589 --> 00:08:39,599
the unification of all the laws of
 

499
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,909
the unification of all the laws of
physics do you think it's possible that

500
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:41,919
physics do you think it's possible that
 

501
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,470
physics do you think it's possible that
once we understand

502
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:44,480
once we understand
 

503
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,310
once we understand
uh more physics not necessarily the

504
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:46,320
uh more physics not necessarily the
 

505
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,070
uh more physics not necessarily the
unification of the laws but just

506
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:48,080
unification of the laws but just
 

507
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,670
unification of the laws but just
understand physics more deeply at the

508
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:49,680
understand physics more deeply at the
 

509
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,030
understand physics more deeply at the
fundamental level

510
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:51,040
fundamental level
 

511
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,550
fundamental level
we'll be able to start you know uh

512
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:54,560
we'll be able to start you know uh
 

513
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,269
we'll be able to start you know uh
i mean part of this is humorous but uh

514
00:08:57,269 --> 00:08:57,279
i mean part of this is humorous but uh
 

515
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:57,750
i mean part of this is humorous but uh
looking

516
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:57,760
looking
 

517
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,269
looking
to see if there's any bugs in the

00:08:59,269 --> 00:08:59,279
to see if there's any bugs in the
 

519
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:01,350
to see if there's any bugs in the
universe that can be exploited for

00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:01,360
universe that can be exploited for
 

521
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,790
universe that can be exploited for
uh you know traveling at uh

522
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:04,800
uh you know traveling at uh
 

523
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,230
uh you know traveling at uh
not just speed of light but just

524
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:06,240
not just speed of light but just
 

525
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,990
not just speed of light but just
traveling faster than our current

526
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:08,000
traveling faster than our current
 

527
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,230
traveling faster than our current
uh spaceships can travel all that kind

528
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:10,240
uh spaceships can travel all that kind
 

529
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,030
uh spaceships can travel all that kind
of stuff

530
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:11,040
of stuff
 

531
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,430
of stuff
well i mean to travel faster than our

532
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:13,440
well i mean to travel faster than our
 

533
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,550
well i mean to travel faster than our
current spaceships

534
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:14,560
current spaceships
 

535
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,310
current spaceships
could travel you wouldn't need to find

00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:16,320
could travel you wouldn't need to find

00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,310
could travel you wouldn't need to find
any bug in the universe right the known

00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:18,320
any bug in the universe right the known

00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:19,600
laws of physics
 

541
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,829
laws of physics
you know let us go much faster up to the

542
00:09:21,829 --> 00:09:21,839
you know let us go much faster up to the
 

543
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:22,710
you know let us go much faster up to the
speed of light

544
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:22,720
speed of light
 

545
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,870
speed of light
right and you know when people want to

546
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:24,880
right and you know when people want to
 

547
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,790
right and you know when people want to
go faster than the speed of light

548
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:26,800
go faster than the speed of light
 

549
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,630
go faster than the speed of light
well we actually know something about

550
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:28,640
well we actually know something about
 

551
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,990
well we actually know something about
what that would entail

552
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:30,000
what that would entail
 

553
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,910
what that would entail
namely that you know according to

554
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:31,920
namely that you know according to
 

555
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,110
namely that you know according to
relativity

556
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:33,120
relativity
 

557
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,269
relativity
that seems to entail communication

558
00:09:35,269 --> 00:09:35,279
that seems to entail communication
 

559
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:36,550
that seems to entail communication
backwards in time

560
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:36,560
backwards in time
 

561
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,030
backwards in time
okay so then you have to worry about uh

562
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:39,040
okay so then you have to worry about uh
 

563
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,790
okay so then you have to worry about uh
close time like curves and all of that

564
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:40,800
close time like curves and all of that
 

565
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,550
close time like curves and all of that
stuff so you know in some sense we

566
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:42,560
stuff so you know in some sense we
 

567
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,630
stuff so you know in some sense we
we sort of know the price that you have

568
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:44,640
we sort of know the price that you have
 

569
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,230
we sort of know the price that you have
to pay for these things

570
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:46,240
to pay for these things
 

571
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,190
to pay for these things
right understanding of physics that's

572
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:49,200
right understanding of physics that's
 

573
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,630
right understanding of physics that's
right that's right we can't

574
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:50,640
right that's right we can't
 

575
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,949
right that's right we can't
you know say that they're impossible but

576
00:09:52,949 --> 00:09:52,959
you know say that they're impossible but
 

577
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,470
you know say that they're impossible but
we you know we know that

578
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:54,480
we you know we know that
 

579
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,509
we you know we know that
sort of a lot else in physics breaks

580
00:09:57,509 --> 00:09:57,519
sort of a lot else in physics breaks
 

581
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:00,949
sort of a lot else in physics breaks
right so uh now regarding uh eric

582
00:10:00,949 --> 00:10:00,959
right so uh now regarding uh eric
 

583
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:03,269
right so uh now regarding uh eric
weinstein and stephen wolfram like i

584
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:03,279
weinstein and stephen wolfram like i
 

585
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,430
weinstein and stephen wolfram like i
wouldn't say that either of them has a

586
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:05,440
wouldn't say that either of them has a
 

587
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,069
wouldn't say that either of them has a
theory of

588
00:10:06,069 --> 00:10:06,079
theory of
 

589
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:07,990
theory of
everything i would say that they have

590
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:08,000
everything i would say that they have
 

591
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,590
everything i would say that they have
ideas that they hope

592
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:09,600
ideas that they hope
 

593
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,509
ideas that they hope
you know could someday lead to a theory

594
00:10:11,509 --> 00:10:11,519
you know could someday lead to a theory
 

595
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,750
you know could someday lead to a theory
of everything is that a worthy pursuit

596
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:13,760
of everything is that a worthy pursuit
 

597
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,069
of everything is that a worthy pursuit
well i mean certainly let's say by

598
00:10:16,069 --> 00:10:16,079
well i mean certainly let's say by
 

599
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:17,430
well i mean certainly let's say by
theory of everything

600
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:17,440
theory of everything
 

601
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,190
theory of everything
you know we don't literally mean a

602
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:19,200
you know we don't literally mean a
 

603
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,710
you know we don't literally mean a
theory of cats and

604
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:20,720
theory of cats and
 

605
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,110
theory of cats and
of baseball and you know but we just

606
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:23,120
of baseball and you know but we just
 

607
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:23,910
of baseball and you know but we just
mean it in the

608
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:23,920
mean it in the
 

609
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,230
mean it in the
in the more limited sense of everything

610
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:26,240
in the more limited sense of everything
 

611
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,030
in the more limited sense of everything
a fun

612
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:27,040
a fun
 

613
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,829
a fun
a fundamental theory of physics right of

614
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:29,839
a fundamental theory of physics right of
 

615
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:30,710
a fundamental theory of physics right of
all of the

616
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:30,720
all of the
 

617
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,110
all of the
fundamental interactions of physics of

00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:33,120
fundamental interactions of physics of
 

619
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,389
fundamental interactions of physics of
course such a theory

course such a theory
 

621
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:37,030
course such a theory
even after we had it uh you know would

622
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:37,040
even after we had it uh you know would
 

623
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,150
even after we had it uh you know would
would leave

624
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:38,160
would leave
 

625
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,310
would leave
the entire question of all the emergent

626
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:40,320
the entire question of all the emergent
 

627
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,670
the entire question of all the emergent
behavior right

628
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:41,680
behavior right
 

629
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,870
behavior right
you know to uh to be explored uh so it's

630
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:44,880
you know to uh to be explored uh so it's
 

631
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,949
you know to uh to be explored uh so it's
so it's only everything for a specific

632
00:10:46,949 --> 00:10:46,959
so it's only everything for a specific
 

633
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:48,470
so it's only everything for a specific
definition of everything

634
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:48,480
definition of everything
 

635
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,150
definition of everything
okay but in that sense i would say of

636
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:50,160
okay but in that sense i would say of
 

637
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,670
okay but in that sense i would say of
course that's worth pursuing

638
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:51,680
course that's worth pursuing
 

639
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,750
course that's worth pursuing
i mean that is the entire program of

640
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:53,760
i mean that is the entire program of
 

641
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,350
i mean that is the entire program of
fundamental physics

642
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:55,360
fundamental physics
 

643
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,430
fundamental physics
right all of my friends who do quantum

644
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:57,440
right all of my friends who do quantum
 

645
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,829
right all of my friends who do quantum
gravity who do string theory who do

646
00:10:59,829 --> 00:10:59,839
gravity who do string theory who do
 

647
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:01,030
gravity who do string theory who do
anything like that

648
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:01,040
anything like that
 

649
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,350
anything like that
that is what's motivating them yeah it's

650
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:03,360
that is what's motivating them yeah it's
 

651
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,389
that is what's motivating them yeah it's
it's funny though but

652
00:11:04,389 --> 00:11:04,399
it's funny though but
 

653
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:06,310
it's funny though but
i mean eric weinstein talks about this

654
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:06,320
i mean eric weinstein talks about this
 

655
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,990
i mean eric weinstein talks about this
it is i don't know much about the

656
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:08,000
it is i don't know much about the
 

657
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,430
it is i don't know much about the
physics world but i know about the

658
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:09,440
physics world but i know about the
 

659
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,310
physics world but i know about the
ai world it is a little it is a little

660
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:12,320
ai world it is a little it is a little
 

661
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,630
ai world it is a little it is a little
bit taboo

662
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:14,640
bit taboo
 

663
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,430
bit taboo
uh to talk about agi for example on the

664
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:17,440
uh to talk about agi for example on the
 

665
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:17,990
uh to talk about agi for example on the
ai

666
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:18,000
ai
 

667
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,509
ai
side so really to talk about

668
00:11:21,509 --> 00:11:21,519
side so really to talk about
 

669
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:24,150
side so really to talk about
uh the big dream of the community i

670
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:24,160
uh the big dream of the community i
 

671
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:24,949
uh the big dream of the community i
would say

672
00:11:24,949 --> 00:11:24,959
would say
 

673
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,030
would say
because it seems so far away it's almost

674
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:27,040
because it seems so far away it's almost
 

675
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,710
because it seems so far away it's almost
taboo to bring it up because

676
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:28,720
taboo to bring it up because
 

677
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,110
taboo to bring it up because
uh you know it's seen as the kind of

678
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:31,120
uh you know it's seen as the kind of
 

679
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,509
uh you know it's seen as the kind of
people that dream about creating a truly

680
00:11:33,509 --> 00:11:33,519
people that dream about creating a truly
 

681
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,750
people that dream about creating a truly
superhuman level intelligence that's

682
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:35,760
superhuman level intelligence that's
 

683
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,269
superhuman level intelligence that's
really far out there

684
00:11:37,269 --> 00:11:37,279
really far out there
 

685
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,790
really far out there
people because we're not even close to

686
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:38,800
people because we're not even close to
 

687
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,110
people because we're not even close to
that and it feels like the same thing is

688
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:41,120
that and it feels like the same thing is
 

689
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:41,990
that and it feels like the same thing is
true for the physics

690
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:42,000
true for the physics
 

691
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,949
true for the physics
community i mean stephen hawking

692
00:11:44,949 --> 00:11:44,959
community i mean stephen hawking
 

693
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:47,350
community i mean stephen hawking
certainly talked uh constantly about

694
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:47,360
certainly talked uh constantly about
 

695
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,630
certainly talked uh constantly about
theory of everything

696
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:48,640
theory of everything
 

697
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,350
theory of everything
right uh uh uh you know i mean i mean

698
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:51,360
right uh uh uh you know i mean i mean
 

699
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,110
right uh uh uh you know i mean i mean
people you know used those terms who

700
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:53,120
people you know used those terms who
 

701
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,949
people you know used those terms who
were you know some of the most respected

702
00:11:54,949 --> 00:11:54,959
were you know some of the most respected
 

703
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:55,990
were you know some of the most respected
people in the

704
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:56,000
people in the
 

705
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,389
people in the
in the in the whole world of physics

706
00:11:58,389 --> 00:11:58,399
in the in the whole world of physics
 

707
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,069
in the in the whole world of physics
right but i mean i think that

708
00:12:00,069 --> 00:12:00,079
right but i mean i think that
 

709
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:01,910
right but i mean i think that
the distinction that i would make is

710
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:01,920
the distinction that i would make is
 

711
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,110
the distinction that i would make is
that people

712
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:03,120
that people
 

713
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,750
that people
might react badly if you use the term in

714
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:05,760
might react badly if you use the term in
 

715
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,269
might react badly if you use the term in
a way that suggests

716
00:12:07,269 --> 00:12:07,279
a way that suggests
 

717
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:09,910
a way that suggests
that that you you know thinking about it

718
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:09,920
that that you you know thinking about it
 

719
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,910
that that you you know thinking about it
for five minutes have come up with this

720
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:11,920
for five minutes have come up with this
 

721
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,750
for five minutes have come up with this
major new insight about it yeah

722
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:13,760
major new insight about it yeah
 

723
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,629
major new insight about it yeah
right it's it's difficult stephen hawk

724
00:12:16,629 --> 00:12:16,639
right it's it's difficult stephen hawk
 

725
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:16,870
right it's it's difficult stephen hawk
is

726
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:16,880
is
 

727
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,870
is
is a not a great example because i think

728
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:20,880
is a not a great example because i think
 

729
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,030
is a not a great example because i think
you can do whatever the heck you want

730
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:23,040
you can do whatever the heck you want
 

731
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,949
you can do whatever the heck you want
when you get to that level

732
00:12:24,949 --> 00:12:24,959
when you get to that level
 

733
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,389
when you get to that level
and i certainly see like seeing your

734
00:12:26,389 --> 00:12:26,399
and i certainly see like seeing your
 

735
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,550
and i certainly see like seeing your
faculty you know

736
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:28,560
faculty you know
 

737
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,710
faculty you know
that you know at that point that's the

738
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:30,720
that you know at that point that's the
 

739
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,069
that you know at that point that's the
one of the nice things about getting

740
00:12:32,069 --> 00:12:32,079
one of the nice things about getting
 

741
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:33,430
one of the nice things about getting
older is you

742
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:33,440
older is you
 

743
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,550
older is you
stop giving a damn but community as a

744
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:36,560
stop giving a damn but community as a
 

745
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,190
stop giving a damn but community as a
whole

746
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:37,200
whole
 

747
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,629
whole
they tend to roll their eyes very

748
00:12:38,629 --> 00:12:38,639
they tend to roll their eyes very
 

749
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,629
they tend to roll their eyes very
quickly at stuff that's outside the

750
00:12:40,629 --> 00:12:40,639
quickly at stuff that's outside the

quote-unquote mainstream well well let

752
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:42,240
quote-unquote mainstream well well let
 

753
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,990
quote-unquote mainstream well well let
me let me put it this way i mean if you

754
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:44,000
me let me put it this way i mean if you
 

755
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,150
me let me put it this way i mean if you
asked you know ed whitton let's say

756
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:46,160
asked you know ed whitton let's say
 

757
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,069
asked you know ed whitton let's say
who is you know you might consider the

758
00:12:48,069 --> 00:12:48,079
who is you know you might consider the
 

759
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:49,750
who is you know you might consider the
leader of the string community

760
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:49,760
leader of the string community
 

761
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,910
leader of the string community
and thus you know very very mainstream

762
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:51,920
and thus you know very very mainstream
 

763
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,269
and thus you know very very mainstream
in a certain sense but

764
00:12:53,269 --> 00:12:53,279
in a certain sense but
 

765
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,430
in a certain sense but
he would have no hesitation in saying

766
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:55,440
he would have no hesitation in saying
 

767
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,710
he would have no hesitation in saying
you know of course

768
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:56,720
you know of course
 

769
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,870
you know of course
you know they're looking for a you know

770
00:12:58,870 --> 00:12:58,880
you know they're looking for a you know
 

771
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,230
you know they're looking for a you know
uh uh you know a

772
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:00,240
uh uh you know a
 

773
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,670
uh uh you know a
a a unified description of nature of

774
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:03,680
a a unified description of nature of
 

775
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,670
a a unified description of nature of
you know of general relativity of

776
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:05,680
you know of general relativity of
 

777
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,829
you know of general relativity of
quantum mechanics of all the fundamental

778
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:07,839
quantum mechanics of all the fundamental
 

779
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:09,190
quantum mechanics of all the fundamental
interactions of nature

780
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:09,200
interactions of nature
 

781
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,069
interactions of nature
right now you know whether people would

782
00:13:12,069 --> 00:13:12,079
right now you know whether people would
 

783
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:14,389
right now you know whether people would
call that a theory of everything whether

784
00:13:14,389 --> 00:13:14,399
call that a theory of everything whether
 

785
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:15,509
call that a theory of everything whether
they would use that

786
00:13:15,509 --> 00:13:15,519
they would use that
 

787
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:17,910
they would use that
that term that might vary you know lenny

788
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:17,920
that term that might vary you know lenny
 

789
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,829
that term that might vary you know lenny
suskin would definitely have no problem

790
00:13:19,829 --> 00:13:19,839
suskin would definitely have no problem
 

791
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:21,269
suskin would definitely have no problem
telling you that you know if that's what

792
00:13:21,269 --> 00:13:21,279
telling you that you know if that's what
 

793
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,389
telling you that you know if that's what
we want right

794
00:13:22,389 --> 00:13:22,399
we want right
 

795
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,470
we want right
for me who loves human beings in

796
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:24,480
for me who loves human beings in
 

797
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,750
for me who loves human beings in
psychology

798
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:25,760
psychology
 

799
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,509
psychology
it's kind of ridiculous to say

800
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:29,519
it's kind of ridiculous to say
 

801
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,430
it's kind of ridiculous to say
a theory that unifies the laws of

802
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:31,440
a theory that unifies the laws of
 

803
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,509
a theory that unifies the laws of
physics gets you to understand

804
00:13:33,509 --> 00:13:33,519
physics gets you to understand
 

805
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,269
physics gets you to understand
everything i would say you're not even

806
00:13:35,269 --> 00:13:35,279
everything i would say you're not even
 

807
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:36,870
everything i would say you're not even
close to understanding everything

808
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:36,880
close to understanding everything
 

809
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,269
close to understanding everything
yeah right well yeah i mean the word

810
00:13:39,269 --> 00:13:39,279
yeah right well yeah i mean the word
 

811
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:41,350
yeah right well yeah i mean the word
everything is a little ambiguous here

812
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:41,360
everything is a little ambiguous here
 

813
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,870
everything is a little ambiguous here
right because you know and then people

814
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:42,880
right because you know and then people
 

815
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,710
right because you know and then people
will get into debates about

816
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:44,720
will get into debates about
 

817
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,670
will get into debates about
you know reductionism versus emergentism

818
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:47,680
you know reductionism versus emergentism
 

819
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,949
you know reductionism versus emergentism
and blah blah blah

820
00:13:48,949 --> 00:13:48,959
and blah blah blah
 

821
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,750
and blah blah blah
and so in in not wanting to say theory

822
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:51,760
and so in in not wanting to say theory
 

823
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,350
and so in in not wanting to say theory
of everything people might just be

824
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:53,360
of everything people might just be
 

825
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,509
of everything people might just be
trying to short-circuit that debate

826
00:13:55,509 --> 00:13:55,519
trying to short-circuit that debate
 

827
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:57,590
trying to short-circuit that debate
and say you know look you know yes we

828
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:57,600
and say you know look you know yes we
 

829
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,670
and say you know look you know yes we
want a fundamental theory of

830
00:13:59,670 --> 00:13:59,680
want a fundamental theory of
 

831
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,829
want a fundamental theory of
you know the particles and interactions

832
00:14:01,829 --> 00:14:01,839
you know the particles and interactions
 

833
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:03,829
you know the particles and interactions
of nature let me bring up the next topic

834
00:14:03,829 --> 00:14:03,839
of nature let me bring up the next topic
 

835
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:05,110
of nature let me bring up the next topic
that people don't want to mention

836
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:05,120
that people don't want to mention
 

837
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:05,910
that people don't want to mention
although they're getting more

838
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:05,920
although they're getting more
 

839
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,910
although they're getting more
comfortable with it it's consciousness

840
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:07,920
comfortable with it it's consciousness
 

841
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,430
comfortable with it it's consciousness
you mentioned that you have a talk on

842
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:09,440
you mentioned that you have a talk on
 

843
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,230
you mentioned that you have a talk on
consciousness

844
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:10,240
consciousness
 

845
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,790
consciousness
that i watched five minutes of but the

846
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:12,800
that i watched five minutes of but the
 

847
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,230
that i watched five minutes of but the
internet connection was really bad

848
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:14,240
internet connection was really bad
 

849
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,310
internet connection was really bad
was this my talk about you know uh

850
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:16,320
was this my talk about you know uh
 

851
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,310
was this my talk about you know uh
refuting the integrated information

852
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:18,320
refuting the integrated information
 

853
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:18,710
refuting the integrated information
theory

854
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:18,720
theory
 

855
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,389
theory
yes which is a particular account of

856
00:14:20,389 --> 00:14:20,399
yes which is a particular account of
 

857
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:21,829
yes which is a particular account of
consciousness that yeah i think

858
00:14:21,829 --> 00:14:21,839
consciousness that yeah i think
 

859
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,829
consciousness that yeah i think
one can just show it doesn't work right

860
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:23,839
one can just show it doesn't work right
 

861
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:25,430
one can just show it doesn't work right
so let me much harder to say what does

862
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:25,440
so let me much harder to say what does
 

863
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,030
so let me much harder to say what does
work what doesn't work yeah yeah

864
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:27,040
work what doesn't work yeah yeah
 

865
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,509
work what doesn't work yeah yeah
let me ask maybe it'd be nice to uh

866
00:14:29,509 --> 00:14:29,519
let me ask maybe it'd be nice to uh
 

867
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:30,949
let me ask maybe it'd be nice to uh
comment on

868
00:14:30,949 --> 00:14:30,959
comment on
 

869
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:33,990
comment on
you talk about also like the semi hard

870
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:34,000
you talk about also like the semi hard
 

871
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,509
you talk about also like the semi hard
problem of consciousness or like almost

872
00:14:35,509 --> 00:14:35,519
problem of consciousness or like almost
 

873
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,350
problem of consciousness or like almost
hard pro or kind of hard pretty pretty

874
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:37,360
hard pro or kind of hard pretty pretty
 

875
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,710
hard pro or kind of hard pretty pretty
hard pretty hard one i think i call it

876
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:38,720
hard pretty hard one i think i call it
 

877
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,110
hard pretty hard one i think i call it
so maybe can you uh talk about that uh

878
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:41,120
so maybe can you uh talk about that uh
 

879
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,150
so maybe can you uh talk about that uh
their idea of um

880
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:44,160
their idea of um
 

881
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,310
their idea of um
of the approach to modeling

882
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:46,320
of the approach to modeling
 

883
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,069
of the approach to modeling
consciousness and why you don't find it

884
00:14:48,069 --> 00:14:48,079
consciousness and why you don't find it
 

885
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:48,870
consciousness and why you don't find it
convincing

886
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:48,880
convincing
 

887
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,430
convincing
what is it first of all okay well so so

888
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:51,440
what is it first of all okay well so so
 

889
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,750
what is it first of all okay well so so
what what what i called the pretty hard

890
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:53,760
what what what i called the pretty hard
 

891
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,670
what what what i called the pretty hard
problem of consciousness this is my

892
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:55,680
problem of consciousness this is my
 

893
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,269
problem of consciousness this is my
term although many other people have

894
00:14:57,269 --> 00:14:57,279
term although many other people have
 

895
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,910
term although many other people have
said something equivalent to this okay

896
00:14:59,910 --> 00:14:59,920
said something equivalent to this okay
 

897
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:04,310
said something equivalent to this okay
uh but uh it's just you know the the

898
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:04,320
uh but uh it's just you know the the
 

899
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,350
uh but uh it's just you know the the
problem of you know giving an account of

900
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:07,360
problem of you know giving an account of
 

901
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,189
problem of you know giving an account of
just which physical systems are

902
00:15:09,189 --> 00:15:09,199
just which physical systems are
 

903
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,030
just which physical systems are
conscious and which are not

904
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:11,040
conscious and which are not
 

905
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,790
conscious and which are not
or you know if there are degrees of

906
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:12,800
or you know if there are degrees of
 

907
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,110
or you know if there are degrees of
consciousness then quantifying how

908
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:15,120
consciousness then quantifying how
 

909
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:15,829
consciousness then quantifying how
conscious

910
00:15:15,829 --> 00:15:15,839
conscious
 

911
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:18,389
conscious
a given system is oh awesome so that's

912
00:15:18,389 --> 00:15:18,399
a given system is oh awesome so that's
 

913
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:19,269
a given system is oh awesome so that's
the pretty hard

914
00:15:19,269 --> 00:15:19,279
the pretty hard
 

915
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:20,949
the pretty hard
yeah that's what i mean that's it i'm

916
00:15:20,949 --> 00:15:20,959
yeah that's what i mean that's it i'm
 

917
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:22,790
yeah that's what i mean that's it i'm
adopting it i love it that's a good

918
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:22,800
adopting it i love it that's a good
 

919
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,629
adopting it i love it that's a good
a good ring to it and so you know the

920
00:15:24,629 --> 00:15:24,639
a good ring to it and so you know the
 

921
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:25,990
a good ring to it and so you know the
infamous hard problem

922
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:26,000
infamous hard problem
 

923
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,110
infamous hard problem
of consciousness is to explain how

924
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:29,120
of consciousness is to explain how
 

925
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,030
of consciousness is to explain how
something like consciousness could arise

926
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:31,040
something like consciousness could arise
 

927
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,590
something like consciousness could arise
at all you know in a material universe

928
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:33,600
at all you know in a material universe
 

929
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,749
at all you know in a material universe
right or you know why does it ever feel

930
00:15:35,749 --> 00:15:35,759
right or you know why does it ever feel
 

931
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:36,710
right or you know why does it ever feel
like anything

932
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:36,720
like anything
 

933
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,069
like anything
to to experience anything right and

934
00:15:40,069 --> 00:15:40,079
to to experience anything right and
 

935
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:41,590
to to experience anything right and
you know so i'm trying to distinguish

936
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:41,600
you know so i'm trying to distinguish
 

937
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,269
you know so i'm trying to distinguish
from that problem right

938
00:15:43,269 --> 00:15:43,279
from that problem right
 

939
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:45,670
from that problem right
and say you know no okay i am i would

940
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:45,680
and say you know no okay i am i would
 

941
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,670
and say you know no okay i am i would
merely settle for an account

942
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:47,680
merely settle for an account
 

943
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,150
merely settle for an account
that could say you know is a fetus

944
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:50,160
that could say you know is a fetus
 

945
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,829
that could say you know is a fetus
conscious you know if so at which

946
00:15:51,829 --> 00:15:51,839
conscious you know if so at which
 

947
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:54,629
conscious you know if so at which
trimester you know is a uh

948
00:15:54,629 --> 00:15:54,639
trimester you know is a uh
 

949
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:57,350
trimester you know is a uh
is a dog conscious you know what about a

950
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:57,360
is a dog conscious you know what about a
 

951
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:57,990
is a dog conscious you know what about a
frog

952
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:58,000
frog
 

953
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,990
frog
right or or even as a precondition you

954
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:00,000
right or or even as a precondition you
 

955
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,189
right or or even as a precondition you
take that both these things are

956
00:16:01,189 --> 00:16:01,199
take that both these things are
 

957
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:02,150
take that both these things are
conscious

958
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:02,160
conscious
 

959
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,550
conscious
tell me which is more conscious yeah for

960
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:04,560
tell me which is more conscious yeah for
 

961
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,749
tell me which is more conscious yeah for
example yes

962
00:16:05,749 --> 00:16:05,759
example yes
 

963
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:07,670
example yes
yeah yeah i mean if consciousness is

964
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:07,680
yeah yeah i mean if consciousness is
 

965
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,069
yeah yeah i mean if consciousness is
some multi-dimensional vector well just

966
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:10,079
some multi-dimensional vector well just
 

967
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:11,910
some multi-dimensional vector well just
tell me in which respects these things

968
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:11,920
tell me in which respects these things
 

969
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,590
tell me in which respects these things
are conscious and in which respect they

970
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:13,600
are conscious and in which respect they
 

971
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,310
are conscious and in which respect they
aren't

972
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:14,320
aren't
 

973
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,389
aren't
right and you know and have some

974
00:16:16,389 --> 00:16:16,399
right and you know and have some
 

975
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:18,629
right and you know and have some
principled way to do it where you're not

976
00:16:18,629 --> 00:16:18,639
principled way to do it where you're not
 

977
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:20,710
principled way to do it where you're not
you know carving out exceptions for

978
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:20,720
you know carving out exceptions for
 

979
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,069
you know carving out exceptions for
things that you like or don't

980
00:16:22,069 --> 00:16:22,079
things that you like or don't
 

981
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:23,990
things that you like or don't
like but could somehow take a

982
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:24,000
like but could somehow take a
 

983
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,310
like but could somehow take a
description of an arbitrary physical

984
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:26,320
description of an arbitrary physical
 

985
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,189
description of an arbitrary physical

system
 

987
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:30,230
system
and then just based on the physical

988
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:30,240
and then just based on the physical
 

989
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,069
and then just based on the physical
properties of that system

properties of that system
 

991
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:34,550
properties of that system
or the informational properties or how

00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:38,800
like that just in principle calculate
 

997
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,949
like that just in principle calculate
you know its degree of consciousness

998
00:16:40,949 --> 00:16:40,959
you know its degree of consciousness
 

999
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,110
you know its degree of consciousness
right i mean this this this would be the

1000
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:43,120
right i mean this this this would be the
 

1001
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,030
right i mean this this this would be the
kind of thing that we would need

1002
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:45,040
kind of thing that we would need
 

1003
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,710
kind of thing that we would need
you know if we wanted to address

1004
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:46,720
you know if we wanted to address
 

1005
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,949
you know if we wanted to address
questions like you know

1006
00:16:48,949 --> 00:16:48,959
questions like you know
 

1007
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:50,550
questions like you know
what does it take for a machine to be

1008
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:50,560
what does it take for a machine to be
 

1009
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,150
what does it take for a machine to be
conscious right or when or

1010
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:52,160
conscious right or when or
 

1011
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,150
conscious right or when or
you know when when when should we regard

1012
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:54,160
you know when when when should we regard
 

1013
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,150
you know when when when should we regard
ais as being conscious

1014
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:56,160
ais as being conscious
 

1015
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,269
ais as being conscious
um so now this iit

1016
00:16:59,269 --> 00:16:59,279
um so now this iit
 

1017
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:01,910
um so now this iit
this integrated information theory uh

pretty hard problem
 

1037
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,069
pretty hard problem
right and they give a uh a criterion

1038
00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:26,079
right and they give a uh a criterion
 

1039
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,789
right and they give a uh a criterion
that's just based on how a system is

1040
00:17:28,789 --> 00:17:28,799
that's just based on how a system is
 

1041
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,870
that's just based on how a system is
connected so you so it's up to you

1042
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:30,880
connected so you so it's up to you
 

1043
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,350
connected so you so it's up to you
to sort of abstract the system like a

1044
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:33,360
to sort of abstract the system like a
 

1045
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:33,909
to sort of abstract the system like a

pattern of connections you know and and
 

1055
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,630
pattern of connections you know and and
to specify how the components can

1056
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:44,640
to specify how the components can
 

1057
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,990
to specify how the components can
influence each other

1058
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:46,000
influence each other
 

1059
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,230
influence each other
you know like where the inputs go you

1060
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:48,240
you know like where the inputs go you
 

1061
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,909
you know like where the inputs go you
know where they affect the outputs but

1062
00:17:49,909 --> 00:17:49,919
know where they affect the outputs but
 

1063
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:51,990
know where they affect the outputs but
then once you've specified that

1064
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:52,000
then once you've specified that
 

1065
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,150
then once you've specified that
then they give this quantity that they

1066
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:54,160
then they give this quantity that they
 

1067
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,070
then they give this quantity that they
call fee you know the greek letter

1068
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:56,080
call fee you know the greek letter

00:17:58,549 --> 00:17:58,559
phi and the definition of phi is
 

1071
00:17:58,559 --> 00:17:59,909
phi and the definition of phi is
actually changed over

1072
00:17:59,909 --> 00:17:59,919
actually changed over
 

1073
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:02,230
actually changed over
time it changes from one paper to

1074
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:02,240
time it changes from one paper to
 

1075
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:02,950
time it changes from one paper to
another

1076
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:02,960
another
 

1077
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,669
another
but in all of the variations it involves

1078
00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:05,679
but in all of the variations it involves
 

1079
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:07,029
but in all of the variations it involves
something about

1080
00:18:07,029 --> 00:18:07,039
something about
 

1081
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:09,190
something about
what we in computer science would call

1082
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:09,200
what we in computer science would call
 

1083
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,710
what we in computer science would call
graph expansion

1084
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:10,720
graph expansion
 

1085
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,390
graph expansion
so basically what this means is that

1086
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:12,400
so basically what this means is that
 

1087
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,070
so basically what this means is that
they want it uh

1088
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:14,080
they want it uh
 

1089
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,110
they want it uh
in order to get a large value of fee uh

1090
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:17,120
in order to get a large value of fee uh
 

1091
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,190
in order to get a large value of fee uh
it should not be possible to

1092
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:19,200
it should not be possible to
 

1093
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,909
it should not be possible to
take your system and partition it into

1094
00:18:21,909 --> 00:18:21,919
take your system and partition it into
 

1095
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:23,110
take your system and partition it into
two components

1096
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:23,120
two components
 

1097
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,430
two components
that are only weakly connected to each

1098
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:25,440
that are only weakly connected to each
 

1099
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,150
that are only weakly connected to each
other

1100
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:26,160
other
 

1101
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,789
other
okay so whenever we take our system and

1102
00:18:28,789 --> 00:18:28,799
okay so whenever we take our system and
 

1103
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:29,270
okay so whenever we take our system and
sort of

1104
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:29,280
sort of
 

1105
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,430
sort of
try to split it up into two then there

1106
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:31,440
try to split it up into two then there
 

1107
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,270
try to split it up into two then there
should be lots and lots of connections

1108
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:33,280
should be lots and lots of connections
 

1109
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,110
should be lots and lots of connections
going between the two components

1110
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:35,120
going between the two components
 

1111
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,470
going between the two components
okay well i understand what that means

1112
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:36,480
okay well i understand what that means
 

1113
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,110
okay well i understand what that means
on a graph do they formalize

1114
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:39,120
on a graph do they formalize
 

1115
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,150
on a graph do they formalize
what uh how to construct such a graph or

1116
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:42,160
what uh how to construct such a graph or
 

1117
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,750
what uh how to construct such a graph or
data structure whatever

1118
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:43,760
data structure whatever
 

1119
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,470
data structure whatever
uh or is this well one of the criticism

1120
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:46,480
uh or is this well one of the criticism
 

1121
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,270
uh or is this well one of the criticism
uh

1122
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:47,280
uh
 

1123
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,510
uh
i i've heard you kind of say is that a

1124
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:49,520
i i've heard you kind of say is that a
 

1125
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,270
i i've heard you kind of say is that a
lot of the very interesting specifics

1126
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:51,280
lot of the very interesting specifics
 

1127
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,270
lot of the very interesting specifics
are usually communicated through

1128
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:53,280
are usually communicated through
 

1129
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,990
are usually communicated through
like natural language like like through

1130
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:56,000
like natural language like like through
 

1131
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:56,950
like natural language like like through
words

1132
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:56,960
words
 

1133
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,470
words
so it's like the details aren't always

1134
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:58,480
so it's like the details aren't always
 

1135
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,470
so it's like the details aren't always
well they well it's true i mean they

1136
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:00,480
well they well it's true i mean they
 

1137
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,630
well they well it's true i mean they
they they they have nothing even

1138
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:02,640
they they they have nothing even
 

1139
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,549
they they they have nothing even
resembling a derivation

1140
00:19:04,549 --> 00:19:04,559
resembling a derivation
 

1141
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:07,510
resembling a derivation
of this fee okay so what they do is they

1142
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:07,520
of this fee okay so what they do is they
 

1143
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,990
of this fee okay so what they do is they
state a whole bunch of postulates

1144
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:10,000
state a whole bunch of postulates
 

1145
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,830
state a whole bunch of postulates
you know axioms that they think that

1146
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:11,840
you know axioms that they think that
 

1147
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,750
you know axioms that they think that
consciousness should satisfy

1148
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:13,760
consciousness should satisfy
 

1149
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,150
consciousness should satisfy
and then there's some verbal discussion

1150
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:16,160
and then there's some verbal discussion
 

1151
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,270
and then there's some verbal discussion
and then at some point

1152
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:17,280
and then at some point
 

1153
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,070
and then at some point
fee appears right right and this this

1154
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:20,080
fee appears right right and this this
 

1155
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,150
fee appears right right and this this
was one the first thing that really made

1156
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:22,160
was one the first thing that really made
 

1157
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,230
was one the first thing that really made
the hair stand on my neck to be honest

1158
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:24,240
the hair stand on my neck to be honest
 

1159
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:24,870
the hair stand on my neck to be honest
because

1160
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:24,880
because
 

1161
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,630
because
they are acting as if there is a

1162
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:26,640
they are acting as if there is a
 

1163
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,630
they are acting as if there is a
derivation they're acting as if you know

1164
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:28,640
derivation they're acting as if you know
 

1165
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,870
derivation they're acting as if you know
you're supposed to think that this is a

1166
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:30,880
you're supposed to think that this is a
 

1167
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,470
you're supposed to think that this is a
derivation and there's nothing even

1168
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:32,480
derivation and there's nothing even
 

1169
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,990
derivation and there's nothing even
remotely resembling

1170
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:34,000
remotely resembling
 

1171
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,310
remotely resembling
a derby they just pull the fee out of a

1172
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:36,320
a derby they just pull the fee out of a
 

1173
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,070
a derby they just pull the fee out of a
hat completely is one of

1174
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:38,080
hat completely is one of
 

1175
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,669
hat completely is one of
the key criticisms to you is that

1176
00:19:39,669 --> 00:19:39,679
the key criticisms to you is that
 

1177
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,270
the key criticisms to you is that
details are missing or is that exactly

1178
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:41,280
details are missing or is that exactly
 

1179
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:41,830
details are missing or is that exactly
more fun

1180
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:41,840
more fun
 

1181
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,669
more fun
that's not even the key criticism that's

1182
00:19:43,669 --> 00:19:43,679
that's not even the key criticism that's
 

1183
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:45,110
that's not even the key criticism that's
just that's just a side point

1184
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:45,120
just that's just a side point
 

1185
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,230
just that's just a side point
okay the the core of it is that i think

1186
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:48,240
okay the the core of it is that i think
 

1187
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,830
okay the the core of it is that i think
that the you know that they want to say

1188
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:49,840
that the you know that they want to say
 

1189
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,990
that the you know that they want to say
that a system is more conscious the

1190
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:52,000
that a system is more conscious the
 

1191
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,070
that a system is more conscious the
larger its value of fee

1192
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:54,080
larger its value of fee
 

1193
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,750
larger its value of fee
and i think that that is obvious

1194
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:55,760
and i think that that is obvious
 

1195
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,230
and i think that that is obvious
nonsense okay as soon as you think about

1196
00:19:58,230 --> 00:19:58,240
nonsense okay as soon as you think about
 

1197
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,510
nonsense okay as soon as you think about
it for like a minute

1198
00:19:59,510 --> 00:19:59,520
it for like a minute
 

1199
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,190
it for like a minute
as soon as you think about it in terms

1200
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:01,200
as soon as you think about it in terms
 

1201
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,830
as soon as you think about it in terms
of could i construct a system

1202
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:03,840
of could i construct a system
 

1203
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,630
of could i construct a system
that had an enormous value of fee like

1204
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:06,640
that had an enormous value of fee like
 

1205
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,950
that had an enormous value of fee like
you know even larger than the brain has

1206
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:08,960
you know even larger than the brain has
 

1207
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,590
you know even larger than the brain has
but that is just implementing an error

1208
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:11,600
but that is just implementing an error
 

1209
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,669
but that is just implementing an error
correcting code you know doing nothing

1210
00:20:13,669 --> 00:20:13,679
correcting code you know doing nothing
 

1211
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:14,630
correcting code you know doing nothing
that we would

1212
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:14,640
that we would
 

1213
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,190
that we would
associate with you know intelligence or

1214
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:17,200
associate with you know intelligence or
 

1215
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,870
associate with you know intelligence or
consciousness or any of it

1216
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:18,880
consciousness or any of it
 

1217
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,669
consciousness or any of it
the answer is yes it is easy to do that

1218
00:20:21,669 --> 00:20:21,679
the answer is yes it is easy to do that
 

1219
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:22,230
the answer is yes it is easy to do that
right

1220
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:22,240
right
 

1221
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,230
right
and so i wrote blog posts just making

1222
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:24,240
and so i wrote blog posts just making
 

1223
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,070
and so i wrote blog posts just making
this point that yeah it's easy to do

1224
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:26,080
this point that yeah it's easy to do
 

1225
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:26,630
this point that yeah it's easy to do
that

1226
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:26,640
that
 

1227
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,870
that
now you know tanoni's response to that

1228
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:28,880
now you know tanoni's response to that
 

1229
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,710
now you know tanoni's response to that
was actually kind of incredible

1230
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:30,720
was actually kind of incredible
 

1231
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,669
was actually kind of incredible
right i mean i i admired it in a way

1232
00:20:33,669 --> 00:20:33,679
right i mean i i admired it in a way
 

1233
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:33,990
right i mean i i admired it in a way
because

1234
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:34,000
because
 

1235
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,470
because
instead of disputing any of it he just

1236
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:36,480
instead of disputing any of it he just
 

1237
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,669
instead of disputing any of it he just
bit the bullet

1238
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:37,679
bit the bullet
 

1239
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:39,430
bit the bullet
in the sense you know he was one of the

1240
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:39,440
in the sense you know he was one of the
 

1241
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,950
in the sense you know he was one of the
the uh the most

1242
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:40,960
the uh the most
 

1243
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,590
the uh the most
uh audacious bullet bitings i've ever

1244
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:43,600
uh audacious bullet bitings i've ever
 

1245
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,789
uh audacious bullet bitings i've ever
seen in my career

1246
00:20:44,789 --> 00:20:44,799
seen in my career
 

1247
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:48,149
seen in my career
okay he said okay then fine

1248
00:20:48,149 --> 00:20:48,159
okay he said okay then fine
 

1249
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:50,230
okay he said okay then fine
you know this system that just applies

1250
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:50,240
you know this system that just applies
 

1251
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,750
you know this system that just applies
this error correcting code it's

1252
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:51,760
this error correcting code it's
 

1253
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,789
this error correcting code it's
conscious

1254
00:20:52,789 --> 00:20:52,799
conscious
 

1255
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:54,470
conscious
you know and if it has a much larger

1256
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:54,480
you know and if it has a much larger
 

1257
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,909
you know and if it has a much larger
value of fee then

1258
00:20:55,909 --> 00:20:55,919
value of fee then
 

1259
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:58,070
value of fee then
you or me it's much more conscious than

1260
00:20:58,070 --> 00:20:58,080
you or me it's much more conscious than
 

1261
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,110
you or me it's much more conscious than
you want me

1262
00:20:59,110 --> 00:20:59,120
you want me
 

1263
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,950
you want me
you know you we just have to accept what

1264
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:00,960
you know you we just have to accept what
 

1265
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,630
you know you we just have to accept what
the theory says because

1266
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:02,640
the theory says because
 

1267
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,710
the theory says because
you know science is not about confirming

1268
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:04,720
you know science is not about confirming
 

1269
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,710
you know science is not about confirming
our intuitions it's about challenging

1270
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:06,720
our intuitions it's about challenging
 

1271
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,350
our intuitions it's about challenging
them

1272
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:07,360
them
 

1273
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,430
them
and you know this is what my theory

1274
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:09,440
and you know this is what my theory
 

1275
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,270
and you know this is what my theory
predicts that this thing is conscious

1276
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:11,280
predicts that this thing is conscious
 

1277
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:11,669
predicts that this thing is conscious
and

1278
00:21:11,669 --> 00:21:11,679
and
 

1279
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:14,149
and
you know or super duper conscious and

1280
00:21:14,149 --> 00:21:14,159
you know or super duper conscious and
 

1281
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:15,990
you know or super duper conscious and
how are you going to prove me wrong see

1282
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:16,000
how are you going to prove me wrong see
 

1283
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:16,390
how are you going to prove me wrong see
i would

1284
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:16,400
i would
 

1285
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,710
i would
so the way i would argue against your

1286
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:18,720
so the way i would argue against your
 

1287
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,909
so the way i would argue against your
blog post

1288
00:21:19,909 --> 00:21:19,919
blog post
 

1289
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:22,230
blog post
is i would say yes sure you're right in

1290
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:22,240
is i would say yes sure you're right in
 

1291
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,430
is i would say yes sure you're right in
general but

1292
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:23,440
general but
 

1293
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,710
general but
for naturally arising systems developed

1294
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:26,720
for naturally arising systems developed
 

1295
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,390
for naturally arising systems developed
through the process of evolution on

1296
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:28,400
through the process of evolution on
 

1297
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,270
through the process of evolution on
earth

1298
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:29,280
earth
 

1299
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,750
earth
the this rule of the larger fee being

1300
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:31,760
the this rule of the larger fee being
 

1301
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,190
the this rule of the larger fee being
associated being associated with more

1302
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:33,200
associated being associated with more
 

1303
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,470
associated being associated with more
consciousness is correct

1304
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:34,480
consciousness is correct
 

1305
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,470
consciousness is correct
yeah so that's not what he said at all

1306
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:36,480
yeah so that's not what he said at all
 

1307
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,630
yeah so that's not what he said at all
right right because he wants this to be

1308
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:38,640
right right because he wants this to be
 

1309
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,830
right right because he wants this to be
completely general

1310
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:39,840
completely general
 

1311
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,830
completely general
right so we can apply to even computers

1312
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:41,840
right so we can apply to even computers
 

1313
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,590
right so we can apply to even computers
yeah i mean i mean the whole interest of

1314
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:43,600
yeah i mean i mean the whole interest of
 

1315
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,230
yeah i mean i mean the whole interest of
the theory

1316
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:44,240
the theory
 

1317
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,310
the theory
is the you know the hope that it could

1318
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:46,320
is the you know the hope that it could
 

1319
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,110
is the you know the hope that it could
be completely general apply to aliens to

1320
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:49,120
be completely general apply to aliens to
 

1321
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,270
be completely general apply to aliens to
computers to uh

1322
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:51,280
computers to uh
 

1323
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:54,390
computers to uh
uh animals coma patients to any of it

1324
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:54,400
uh animals coma patients to any of it
 

1325
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,149
uh animals coma patients to any of it
right yeah and uh uh so so so he just

1326
00:21:58,149 --> 00:21:58,159
right yeah and uh uh so so so he just
 

1327
00:21:58,159 --> 00:21:59,029
right yeah and uh uh so so so he just
said well

1328
00:21:59,029 --> 00:21:59,039
said well
 

1329
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:01,510
said well
you know uh scott is relying on his

1330
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:01,520
you know uh scott is relying on his
 

1331
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,590
you know uh scott is relying on his
intuition but you know i'm relying on

1332
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:03,600
intuition but you know i'm relying on
 

1333
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,630
intuition but you know i'm relying on
this theory

1334
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:04,640
this theory
 

1335
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,950
this theory
and you know to me it was almost like

1336
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:06,960
and you know to me it was almost like
 

1337
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,110
and you know to me it was almost like
you know are we being serious here

1338
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:09,120
you know are we being serious here
 

1339
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,870
you know are we being serious here
like like like you know like like okay

1340
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:12,880
like like like you know like like okay
 

1341
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,510
like like like you know like like okay
yes in science we try to learn highly

1342
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:15,520
yes in science we try to learn highly
 

1343
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,590
yes in science we try to learn highly
non-intuitive things but what we do is

1344
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:17,600
non-intuitive things but what we do is
 

1345
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,149
non-intuitive things but what we do is
we

1346
00:22:18,149 --> 00:22:18,159
we
 

1347
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:20,870
we
first test the theory on cases where we

1348
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:20,880
first test the theory on cases where we
 

1349
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,310
first test the theory on cases where we
already know the answer

1350
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:22,320
already know the answer
 

1351
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,630
already know the answer
right like if if someone had a new

1352
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:24,640
right like if if someone had a new
 

1353
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,549
right like if if someone had a new
theory of temperature right

1354
00:22:26,549 --> 00:22:26,559
theory of temperature right
 

1355
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:28,310
theory of temperature right
then you know maybe we could check that

1356
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:28,320
then you know maybe we could check that
 

1357
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,950
then you know maybe we could check that
it says that boiling water is hotter

1358
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:30,960
it says that boiling water is hotter
 

1359
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:31,830
it says that boiling water is hotter
than ice

1360
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:31,840
than ice
 

1361
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,669
than ice
and then if it says that the sun is

1362
00:22:33,669 --> 00:22:33,679
and then if it says that the sun is
 

1363
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:35,350
and then if it says that the sun is
hotter than anything you know you've

1364
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:35,360
hotter than anything you know you've
 

1365
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:35,990
hotter than anything you know you've
ever

1366
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:36,000
ever
 

1367
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,830
ever
experienced then maybe we we trust that

1368
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:38,840
experienced then maybe we we trust that
 

1369
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,470
experienced then maybe we we trust that
extrapolation right

1370
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:40,480
extrapolation right
 

1371
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,590
extrapolation right
but like this this theory like if if you

1372
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:43,600
but like this this theory like if if you
 

1373
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:43,909
but like this this theory like if if you
know

1374
00:22:43,909 --> 00:22:43,919
know
 

1375
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:47,029
know
it it's now saying that you know a

1376
00:22:47,029 --> 00:22:47,039
it it's now saying that you know a
 

1377
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:49,669
it it's now saying that you know a
a gigantic grit like regular grid of

1378
00:22:49,669 --> 00:22:49,679
a gigantic grit like regular grid of
 

1379
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:51,350
a gigantic grit like regular grid of
exclusive or gates

1380
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:51,360
exclusive or gates
 

1381
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,830
exclusive or gates
can be way more conscious than a you

1382
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:53,840
can be way more conscious than a you
 

1383
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:54,870
can be way more conscious than a you
know a person

1384
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:54,880
know a person
 

1385
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,750
know a person
or than any animal can be you know even

1386
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:57,760
or than any animal can be you know even
 

1387
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58,149
or than any animal can be you know even
if it

1388
00:22:58,149 --> 00:22:58,159
if it
 

1389
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:01,350
if it
you know is you know is is is is so

1390
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:01,360
you know is you know is is is is so
 

1391
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,350
you know is you know is is is is so
uniform that it might as just well just

1392
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:03,360
uniform that it might as just well just
 

1393
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,549
uniform that it might as just well just
be a blank wall

1394
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:04,559
be a blank wall
 

1395
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:06,950
be a blank wall
right and and so now the point is if

1396
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:06,960
right and and so now the point is if
 

1397
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,110
right and and so now the point is if
this theory is sort of getting wrong

1398
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:09,120
this theory is sort of getting wrong
 

1399
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,190
this theory is sort of getting wrong
the question is a blank wall you know

1400
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:11,200
the question is a blank wall you know
 

1401
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,950
the question is a blank wall you know
more conscious than a person

1402
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:12,960
more conscious than a person
 

1403
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,630
more conscious than a person
then i would say what is what is there

1404
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:14,640
then i would say what is what is there
 

1405
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,990
then i would say what is what is there
for it to get right

1406
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:16,000
for it to get right
 

1407
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,669
for it to get right
so your sense is a blank wall uh

1408
00:23:19,669 --> 00:23:19,679
so your sense is a blank wall uh
 

1409
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:22,230
so your sense is a blank wall uh
is not more conscious than a human being

1410
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:22,240
is not more conscious than a human being
 

1411
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,190
is not more conscious than a human being
yeah i mean i mean i mean

1412
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:23,200
yeah i mean i mean i mean
 

1413
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,789
yeah i mean i mean i mean
you could say that i am taking that as

1414
00:23:24,789 --> 00:23:24,799
you could say that i am taking that as
 

1415
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:27,430
you could say that i am taking that as
one of my axioms

1416
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:27,440
one of my axioms
 

1417
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,190
one of my axioms
i'm saying i'm saying that if if a

1418
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:29,200
i'm saying i'm saying that if if a
 

1419
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,870
i'm saying i'm saying that if if a
theory of consciousness

1420
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:30,880
theory of consciousness
 

1421
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,909
theory of consciousness
is is get getting that wrong then

1422
00:23:33,909 --> 00:23:33,919
is is get getting that wrong then
 

1423
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:36,149
is is get getting that wrong then
whatever it is talking about at that

1424
00:23:36,149 --> 00:23:36,159
whatever it is talking about at that
 

1425
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:37,110
whatever it is talking about at that
point i

1426
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:37,120
point i
 

1427
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,750
point i
i i'm not going to call it consciousness

1428
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:39,760
i i'm not going to call it consciousness
 

1429
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,870
i i'm not going to call it consciousness
i'm going to use a different word you

1430
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:40,880
i'm going to use a different word you
 

1431
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,149
i'm going to use a different word you
have to use a different word i mean yeah

1432
00:23:42,149 --> 00:23:42,159
have to use a different word i mean yeah
 

1433
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:42,710
have to use a different word i mean yeah
it's all

1434
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:42,720
it's all
 

1435
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,070
it's all
it's possible just like with

1436
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:44,080
it's possible just like with
 

1437
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,710
it's possible just like with
intelligence that us humans conveniently

1438
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:46,720
intelligence that us humans conveniently
 

1439
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,990
intelligence that us humans conveniently
define these very difficult to

1440
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:48,000
define these very difficult to
 

1441
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,190
define these very difficult to
understand concepts

1442
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:49,200
understand concepts
 

1443
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,269
understand concepts
in a very human-centric way just like

1444
00:23:51,269 --> 00:23:51,279
in a very human-centric way just like
 

1445
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:52,710
in a very human-centric way just like
the touring test

1446
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:52,720
the touring test
 

1447
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,190
the touring test
really seems to define intelligence as a

1448
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:55,200
really seems to define intelligence as a
 

1449
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,950
really seems to define intelligence as a
thing that's human-like

1450
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:56,960
thing that's human-like
 

1451
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,269
thing that's human-like
right but i would say that with any uh

1452
00:23:59,269 --> 00:23:59,279
right but i would say that with any uh
 

1453
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:00,070
right but i would say that with any uh
concept

1454
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:00,080
concept
 

1455
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,190
concept
you know there's uh uh uh

1456
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:03,200
you know there's uh uh uh
 

1457
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,350
you know there's uh uh uh
you know like we we we first need to

1458
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:05,360
you know like we we we first need to
 

1459
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,350
you know like we we we first need to
define it right and a definition

1460
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:07,360
define it right and a definition
 

1461
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,909
define it right and a definition
is only a good definition if it matches

1462
00:24:09,909 --> 00:24:09,919
is only a good definition if it matches
 

1463
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:11,510
is only a good definition if it matches
what we thought we were talking about

1464
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:11,520
what we thought we were talking about
 

1465
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:11,909
what we thought we were talking about
you know

1466
00:24:11,909 --> 00:24:11,919
you know
 

1467
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:14,230
you know
prior to having a definition right yeah

1468
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:14,240
prior to having a definition right yeah
 

1469
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,070
prior to having a definition right yeah
and i would say that you know

1470
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:16,080
and i would say that you know
 

1471
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,110
and i would say that you know
uh fee as a definition of consciousness

1472
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:19,120
uh fee as a definition of consciousness
 

1473
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:22,470
uh fee as a definition of consciousness
fails that test that is my argument

1474
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:22,480
fails that test that is my argument
 

1475
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,269
fails that test that is my argument
so okay let's so let's take a further

1476
00:24:25,269 --> 00:24:25,279
so okay let's so let's take a further
 

1477
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:27,029
so okay let's so let's take a further
step so you mentioned that the universe

1478
00:24:27,029 --> 00:24:27,039
step so you mentioned that the universe
 

1479
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:27,590
step so you mentioned that the universe
might be

1480
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:27,600
might be
 

1481
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,070
might be
uh the touring machine so like it might

1482
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:30,080
uh the touring machine so like it might
 

1483
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,149
uh the touring machine so like it might
be computational or simulatable by one

1484
00:24:32,149 --> 00:24:32,159
be computational or simulatable by one
 

1485
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:32,549
be computational or simulatable by one
anyway

1486
00:24:32,549 --> 00:24:32,559
anyway
 

1487
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:35,750
anyway
simulated by one so yeah do you what's

1488
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:35,760
simulated by one so yeah do you what's
 

1489
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:36,549
simulated by one so yeah do you what's
your sense

1490
00:24:36,549 --> 00:24:36,559
your sense
 

1491
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:38,230
your sense
about consciousness do you think

1492
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:38,240
about consciousness do you think
 

1493
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,630
about consciousness do you think
consciousness is computation

1494
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:40,640
consciousness is computation
 

1495
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,110
consciousness is computation
that we don't need to go to any place

1496
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:43,120
that we don't need to go to any place
 

1497
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:46,070
that we don't need to go to any place
outside of the computable universe

1498
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:46,080
outside of the computable universe
 

1499
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,350
outside of the computable universe
to uh you know to to understand

1500
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:49,360
to uh you know to to understand
 

1501
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,750
to uh you know to to understand
consciousness to build consciousness to

1502
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:51,760
consciousness to build consciousness to
 

1503
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,430
consciousness to build consciousness to
measure consciousness all those kinds of

1504
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:53,440
measure consciousness all those kinds of
 

1505
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,950
measure consciousness all those kinds of
things i don't know

1506
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:54,960
things i don't know
 

1507
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,190
things i don't know
these are what uh you know have been

1508
00:24:57,190 --> 00:24:57,200
these are what uh you know have been
 

1509
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,950
these are what uh you know have been
called the the vertigonous

1510
00:24:58,950 --> 00:24:58,960
called the the vertigonous
 

1511
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,710
called the the vertigonous
questions right there's the questions

1512
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:00,720
questions right there's the questions
 

1513
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,549
questions right there's the questions
like like uh you know

1514
00:25:02,549 --> 00:25:02,559
like like uh you know
 

1515
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:04,230
like like uh you know
you get a feeling of vertigo and

1516
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:04,240
you get a feeling of vertigo and
 

1517
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,750
you get a feeling of vertigo and
thinking about them right

1518
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:05,760
thinking about them right
 

1519
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:09,029
thinking about them right
i mean i certainly feel like uh i

1520
00:25:09,029 --> 00:25:09,039
i mean i certainly feel like uh i
 

1521
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:10,870
i mean i certainly feel like uh i
am conscious in a way that is not

1522
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:10,880
am conscious in a way that is not
 

1523
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,789
am conscious in a way that is not
reducible to computation

1524
00:25:12,789 --> 00:25:12,799
reducible to computation
 

1525
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:15,510
reducible to computation
but why should you believe me right i

1526
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:15,520
but why should you believe me right i
 

1527
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:15,990
but why should you believe me right i
mean

1528
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:16,000
mean
 

1529
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,909
mean
and and if you said the same to me then

1530
00:25:17,909 --> 00:25:17,919
and and if you said the same to me then
 

1531
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:19,350
and and if you said the same to me then
why should i believe you

1532
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:19,360
why should i believe you
 

1533
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,230
why should i believe you
but as computer scientists yeah i feel

1534
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:22,240
but as computer scientists yeah i feel
 

1535
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:22,870
but as computer scientists yeah i feel
like

1536
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:22,880
like
 

1537
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,110
like
a computer could be intel could achieve

1538
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:25,120
a computer could be intel could achieve
 

1539
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,669
a computer could be intel could achieve
human level intelligence

1540
00:25:27,669 --> 00:25:27,679
human level intelligence
 

1541
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:30,630
human level intelligence
but and that's actually a feeling and a

1542
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:30,640
but and that's actually a feeling and a
 

1543
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,029
but and that's actually a feeling and a
hope

1544
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:31,039
hope
 

1545
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:33,590
hope
that's not a scientific belief it's just

1546
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:33,600
that's not a scientific belief it's just
 

1547
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,269
that's not a scientific belief it's just
we've built up enough intuition the same

1548
00:25:35,269 --> 00:25:35,279
we've built up enough intuition the same
 

1549
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:37,430
we've built up enough intuition the same
kind of intuition you use in your blog

1550
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:37,440
kind of intuition you use in your blog
 

1551
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,870
kind of intuition you use in your blog
it's you know that's what scientists do

1552
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:38,880
it's you know that's what scientists do
 

1553
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,789
it's you know that's what scientists do
they i mean some of it is a scientific

1554
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:40,799
they i mean some of it is a scientific
 

1555
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:42,390
they i mean some of it is a scientific
method but some of it is just damn good

1556
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:42,400
method but some of it is just damn good
 

1557
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,669
method but some of it is just damn good
intuition

1558
00:25:43,669 --> 00:25:43,679
intuition
 

1559
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:45,029
intuition
i don't have a good intuition about

1560
00:25:45,029 --> 00:25:45,039
i don't have a good intuition about
 

1561
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:46,950
i don't have a good intuition about
consciousness yeah i'm not sure that

1562
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:46,960
consciousness yeah i'm not sure that
 

1563
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,710
consciousness yeah i'm not sure that
anyone does or or has

1564
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:48,720
anyone does or or has
 

1565
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,350
anyone does or or has
in the you know 2500 years that these

1566
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:51,360
in the you know 2500 years that these
 

1567
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,789
in the you know 2500 years that these
things have been discussed lex

1568
00:25:52,789 --> 00:25:52,799
things have been discussed lex
 

1569
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:55,110
things have been discussed lex
uh but do you think we will like one of

1570
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:55,120
uh but do you think we will like one of
 

1571
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,029
uh but do you think we will like one of
the i got a chance to

1572
00:25:57,029 --> 00:25:57,039
the i got a chance to
 

1573
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:59,269
the i got a chance to
attend i can't wait to hear your opinion

1574
00:25:59,269 --> 00:25:59,279
attend i can't wait to hear your opinion
 

1575
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:01,990
attend i can't wait to hear your opinion
on this but attend the neuralink event

1576
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:02,000
on this but attend the neuralink event
 

1577
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,029
on this but attend the neuralink event
and uh one of the dreams there is to uh

1578
00:26:05,029 --> 00:26:05,039
and uh one of the dreams there is to uh
 

1579
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:06,630
and uh one of the dreams there is to uh
you know basically push neuroscience

1580
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:06,640
you know basically push neuroscience
 

1581
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,430
you know basically push neuroscience
forward and the hope with neuroscience

1582
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:09,440
forward and the hope with neuroscience
 

1583
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:13,190
forward and the hope with neuroscience
is that we can inspect the machinery

1584
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:13,200
is that we can inspect the machinery
 

1585
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:13,750
is that we can inspect the machinery
from which

1586
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:13,760
from which
 

1587
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,310
from which
all this fun stuff emerges and see we're

1588
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:16,320
all this fun stuff emerges and see we're
 

1589
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,909
all this fun stuff emerges and see we're
going to notice something

1590
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:17,919
going to notice something
 

1591
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:19,990
going to notice something
special some special sauce from which

1592
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:20,000
special some special sauce from which
 

1593
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,430
special some special sauce from which
something like consciousness or

1594
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:21,440
something like consciousness or
 

1595
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,710
something like consciousness or
cognition emerges

1596
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:22,720
cognition emerges
 

1597
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,470
cognition emerges
yeah well it's clear that we've learned

1598
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:24,480
yeah well it's clear that we've learned
 

1599
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,110
yeah well it's clear that we've learned
an enormous amount about neuroscience

1600
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:27,120
an enormous amount about neuroscience
 

1601
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,110
an enormous amount about neuroscience
we've learned an enormous amount about

1602
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:29,120
we've learned an enormous amount about
 

1603
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,110
we've learned an enormous amount about
computation you know about machine

1604
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:31,120
computation you know about machine
 

1605
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,470
computation you know about machine
learning about you'll know

1606
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:32,480
learning about you'll know
 

1607
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,029
learning about you'll know
ai how to get it to work we've learned

1608
00:26:35,029 --> 00:26:35,039
ai how to get it to work we've learned
 

1609
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:37,830
ai how to get it to work we've learned
uh an enormous amount about the

1610
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:37,840
uh an enormous amount about the
 

1611
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,070
uh an enormous amount about the
underpinnings of the physical world you

1612
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:40,080
underpinnings of the physical world you
 

1613
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,190
underpinnings of the physical world you
know and

1614
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:41,200
know and
 

1615
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,950
know and
you know it from one point of view

1616
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:42,960
you know it from one point of view
 

1617
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,269
you know it from one point of view
that's like an enormous distance that

1618
00:26:45,269 --> 00:26:45,279
that's like an enormous distance that
 

1619
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:47,029
that's like an enormous distance that
we've traveled along the road to

1620
00:26:47,029 --> 00:26:47,039
we've traveled along the road to
 

1621
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:48,710
we've traveled along the road to
understanding consciousness

1622
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:48,720
understanding consciousness
 

1623
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,310
understanding consciousness
from another point of view you know the

1624
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:50,320
from another point of view you know the
 

1625
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,070
from another point of view you know the
distance still to be traveled on the

1626
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:52,080
distance still to be traveled on the
 

1627
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:52,549
distance still to be traveled on the
road

1628
00:26:52,549 --> 00:26:52,559
road
 

1629
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:54,470
road
you know maybe seems no shorter than it

1630
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:54,480
you know maybe seems no shorter than it
 

1631
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,750
you know maybe seems no shorter than it
was at the beginning yeah

1632
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:55,760
was at the beginning yeah
 

1633
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,630
was at the beginning yeah
right so it's very hard to say i mean

1634
00:26:58,630 --> 00:26:58,640
right so it's very hard to say i mean
 

1635
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,350
right so it's very hard to say i mean
you know these are

1636
00:26:59,350 --> 00:26:59,360
you know these are
 

1637
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,909
you know these are
questions like like in in in sort of

1638
00:27:01,909 --> 00:27:01,919
questions like like in in in sort of
 

1639
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:03,990
questions like like in in in sort of
trying to have a theory of consciousness

1640
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:04,000
trying to have a theory of consciousness
 

1641
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,750
trying to have a theory of consciousness
there's sort of a problem where it feels

1642
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:05,760
there's sort of a problem where it feels
 

1643
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,470
there's sort of a problem where it feels
like

1644
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:06,480
like
 

1645
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,310
like
it's not just that we don't know how to

1646
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:08,320
it's not just that we don't know how to
 

1647
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,909
it's not just that we don't know how to
make progress it's that it's hard to

1648
00:27:09,909 --> 00:27:09,919
make progress it's that it's hard to
 

1649
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:11,029
make progress it's that it's hard to
specify

1650
00:27:11,029 --> 00:27:11,039
specify
 

1651
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:13,590
specify
what could even count as progress right

1652
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:13,600
what could even count as progress right
 

1653
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,590
what could even count as progress right
because no matter what scientific theory

1654
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:15,600
because no matter what scientific theory
 

1655
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,789
because no matter what scientific theory
someone proposed

1656
00:27:16,789 --> 00:27:16,799
someone proposed
 

1657
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:18,549
someone proposed
someone else could come along and say

1658
00:27:18,549 --> 00:27:18,559
someone else could come along and say
 

1659
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:20,230
someone else could come along and say
well you've just talked about the

1660
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:20,240
well you've just talked about the
 

1661
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,070
well you've just talked about the
mechanism you haven't said anything

1662
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:22,080
mechanism you haven't said anything
 

1663
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:22,630
mechanism you haven't said anything
about

1664
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:22,640
about
 

1665
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,110
about
what breathes fire into the mechanism

1666
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:25,120
what breathes fire into the mechanism
 

1667
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,630
what breathes fire into the mechanism
right really makes there's something

1668
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:26,640
right really makes there's something
 

1669
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,669
right really makes there's something
that it's like to be

1670
00:27:27,669 --> 00:27:27,679
that it's like to be
 

1671
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:29,029
that it's like to be
it right and that seems like an

1672
00:27:29,029 --> 00:27:29,039
it right and that seems like an
 

1673
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:30,870
it right and that seems like an
objection that you could always raise

1674
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:30,880
objection that you could always raise
 

1675
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,269
objection that you could always raise
yes no matter you know how much someone

1676
00:27:33,269 --> 00:27:33,279
yes no matter you know how much someone
 

1677
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:33,990
yes no matter you know how much someone
elucidated

1678
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:34,000
elucidated
 

1679
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,070
elucidated
the details of how the brain works okay

1680
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:36,080
the details of how the brain works okay
 

1681
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,510
the details of how the brain works okay
let's go touring tests and love the

1682
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:37,520
let's go touring tests and love the
 

1683
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,190
let's go touring tests and love the
prize i have this intuition

1684
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:39,200
prize i have this intuition
 

1685
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,549
prize i have this intuition
call me crazy but we

1686
00:27:42,549 --> 00:27:42,559
call me crazy but we
 

1687
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:44,470
call me crazy but we
that a machine to pass the touring test

1688
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:44,480
that a machine to pass the touring test
 

1689
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,470
that a machine to pass the touring test
and is full

1690
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:46,480
and is full
 

1691
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,789
and is full
whatever the spirit of it is we can talk

1692
00:27:48,789 --> 00:27:48,799
whatever the spirit of it is we can talk
 

1693
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:50,310
whatever the spirit of it is we can talk
about how to formulate

1694
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:50,320
about how to formulate
 

1695
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,990
about how to formulate
the perfect touring test that that

1696
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:52,000
the perfect touring test that that
 

1697
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,149
the perfect touring test that that
machine has to

1698
00:27:54,149 --> 00:27:54,159
machine has to
 

1699
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:58,310
machine has to
be conscious or we at least have to uh

1700
00:27:58,310 --> 00:27:58,320
be conscious or we at least have to uh
 

1701
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,990
be conscious or we at least have to uh
i have a very low bar of what

1702
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:00,000
i have a very low bar of what
 

1703
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,750
i have a very low bar of what
consciousness is a dentist

1704
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:01,760
consciousness is a dentist
 

1705
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,389
consciousness is a dentist
i tend to think that the emulation of

1706
00:28:04,389 --> 00:28:04,399
i tend to think that the emulation of
 

1707
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:05,750
i tend to think that the emulation of
consciousness is as good as

1708
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:05,760
consciousness is as good as
 

1709
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,110
consciousness is as good as
consciousness

1710
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:07,120
consciousness
 

1711
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,269
consciousness
so like consciousness is just a dance a

1712
00:28:09,269 --> 00:28:09,279
so like consciousness is just a dance a
 

1713
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:11,029
so like consciousness is just a dance a
social

1714
00:28:11,029 --> 00:28:11,039
social
 

1715
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:14,149
social
a social uh shortcut like a nice useful

1716
00:28:14,149 --> 00:28:14,159
a social uh shortcut like a nice useful
 

1717
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:14,710
a social uh shortcut like a nice useful
tool

1718
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:14,720
tool
 

1719
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,310
tool
but i tend to connect intelligence

1720
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:16,320
but i tend to connect intelligence
 

1721
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,389
but i tend to connect intelligence
consciousness together so by

1722
00:28:18,389 --> 00:28:18,399
consciousness together so by
 

1723
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:22,470
consciousness together so by
by that do you uh maybe just

1724
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:22,480
by that do you uh maybe just
 

1725
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,110
by that do you uh maybe just
to ask what uh what role does

1726
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:25,120
to ask what uh what role does
 

1727
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,630
to ask what uh what role does
consciousness play do you think in

1728
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:26,640
consciousness play do you think in
 

1729
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,990
consciousness play do you think in
passing the touring test well look i

1730
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:28,000
passing the touring test well look i
 

1731
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,149
passing the touring test well look i
mean it's almost tautologically true

1732
00:28:30,149 --> 00:28:30,159
mean it's almost tautologically true
 

1733
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:32,149
mean it's almost tautologically true
that if we had a machine that passed the

1734
00:28:32,149 --> 00:28:32,159
that if we had a machine that passed the
 

1735
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:33,990
that if we had a machine that passed the
turing test then it would be emulating

1736
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:34,000
turing test then it would be emulating
 

1737
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,190
turing test then it would be emulating
consciousness

1738
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:35,200
consciousness
 

1739
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,269
consciousness
right so if your position is that you

1740
00:28:37,269 --> 00:28:37,279
right so if your position is that you
 

1741
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:39,269
right so if your position is that you
know emulation of consciousness is

1742
00:28:39,269 --> 00:28:39,279
know emulation of consciousness is
 

1743
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:40,389
know emulation of consciousness is
consciousness

1744
00:28:40,389 --> 00:28:40,399
consciousness
 

1745
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:42,950
consciousness
then so you know by by definition any

1746
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:42,960
then so you know by by definition any
 

1747
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,549
then so you know by by definition any
machine that passed the touring test

1748
00:28:44,549 --> 00:28:44,559
machine that passed the touring test
 

1749
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:45,830
machine that passed the touring test
would be conscious

1750
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:45,840
would be conscious
 

1751
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,310
would be conscious
but it's uh uh but i mean we know that

1752
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:48,320
but it's uh uh but i mean we know that
 

1753
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,669
but it's uh uh but i mean we know that
you could say that you know that that is

1754
00:28:49,669 --> 00:28:49,679
you could say that you know that that is
 

1755
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:51,750
you could say that you know that that is
just a way to rephrase the original

1756
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:51,760
just a way to rephrase the original
 

1757
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,590
just a way to rephrase the original
question you know is an emulation of

1758
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:53,600
question you know is an emulation of
 

1759
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,710
question you know is an emulation of
consciousness

1760
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:54,720
consciousness
 

1761
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,190
consciousness
you know necessarily conscious right and

1762
00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:57,200
you know necessarily conscious right and
 

1763
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,149
you know necessarily conscious right and
you can you know

1764
00:28:58,149 --> 00:28:58,159
you can you know
 

1765
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:00,310
you can you know
i hear i'm not saying anything new that

1766
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:00,320
i hear i'm not saying anything new that
 

1767
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,190
i hear i'm not saying anything new that
hasn't been

1768
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:01,200
hasn't been
 

1769
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,510
hasn't been
debated ad nauseum in the literature

1770
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:03,520
debated ad nauseum in the literature
 

1771
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,389
debated ad nauseum in the literature
okay but

1772
00:29:04,389 --> 00:29:04,399
okay but
 

1773
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:06,710
okay but
you know you could uh imagine some very

1774
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:06,720
you know you could uh imagine some very
 

1775
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,950
you know you could uh imagine some very
hard cases like imagine a machine

1776
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:08,960
hard cases like imagine a machine
 

1777
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,029
hard cases like imagine a machine
that passed the touring test but it did

1778
00:29:11,029 --> 00:29:11,039
that passed the touring test but it did
 

1779
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:11,990
that passed the touring test but it did
so just

1780
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:12,000
so just
 

1781
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,950
so just
by an enormous cosmological sized

1782
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:14,960
by an enormous cosmological sized
 

1783
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,230
by an enormous cosmological sized
look-up table

1784
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:16,240
look-up table
 

1785
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,230
look-up table
that just cached every possible

1786
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:18,240
that just cached every possible
 

1787
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,310
that just cached every possible
conversation that could be had the old

1788
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:20,320
conversation that could be had the old
 

1789
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,110
conversation that could be had the old
chinese room

1790
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:21,120
chinese room
 

1791
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,750
chinese room
well well yeah yeah but but this is uh

1792
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:23,760
well well yeah yeah but but this is uh
 

1793
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,430
well well yeah yeah but but this is uh
uh i mean i mean the chinese room

1794
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:25,440
uh i mean i mean the chinese room
 

1795
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,430
uh i mean i mean the chinese room
actually would be doing some computation

1796
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:27,440
actually would be doing some computation
 

1797
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,269
actually would be doing some computation
at least in searle's version right

1798
00:29:29,269 --> 00:29:29,279
at least in searle's version right
 

1799
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:30,950
at least in searle's version right
here i'm just talking about a table

1800
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:30,960
here i'm just talking about a table
 

1801
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,389
here i'm just talking about a table
lookup okay now

1802
00:29:32,389 --> 00:29:32,399
lookup okay now
 

1803
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:34,389
lookup okay now
it's true that for conversations of a

1804
00:29:34,389 --> 00:29:34,399
it's true that for conversations of a
 

1805
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:35,909
it's true that for conversations of a
reasonable length this

1806
00:29:35,909 --> 00:29:35,919
reasonable length this
 

1807
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:37,590
reasonable length this
you know lookup table would be so

1808
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:37,600
you know lookup table would be so
 

1809
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,269
you know lookup table would be so
enormous that wouldn't even fit in the

1810
00:29:39,269 --> 00:29:39,279
enormous that wouldn't even fit in the
 

1811
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:39,909
enormous that wouldn't even fit in the
observable

1812
00:29:39,909 --> 00:29:39,919
observable
 

1813
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:42,230
observable
universe okay but supposing that you

1814
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:42,240
universe okay but supposing that you
 

1815
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,549
universe okay but supposing that you
could build a big enough look-up table

1816
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:44,559
could build a big enough look-up table
 

1817
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:47,590
could build a big enough look-up table
and then just you know pass the touring

1818
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:47,600
and then just you know pass the touring
 

1819
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,669
and then just you know pass the touring
test just by looking up what the person

1820
00:29:49,669 --> 00:29:49,679
test just by looking up what the person
 

1821
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:50,070
test just by looking up what the person
said

1822
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:50,080
said
 

1823
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,070
said
right are you going to regard that as

1824
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:52,080
right are you going to regard that as
 

1825
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,510
right are you going to regard that as
conscious okay

1826
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:53,520
conscious okay
 

1827
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,750
conscious okay
let me try to make this yeah yeah formal

1828
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:55,760
let me try to make this yeah yeah formal
 

1829
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,830
let me try to make this yeah yeah formal
and then you can shut it down

1830
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:57,840
and then you can shut it down
 

1831
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:01,430
and then you can shut it down
i think that the emulation of something

1832
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:01,440
i think that the emulation of something
 

1833
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,149
i think that the emulation of something
is that something if there exists in

1834
00:30:04,149 --> 00:30:04,159
is that something if there exists in
 

1835
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:05,909
is that something if there exists in
that system a black box

1836
00:30:05,909 --> 00:30:05,919
that system a black box
 

1837
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:09,350
that system a black box
that's full of mystery so like

1838
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:09,360
that's full of mystery so like
 

1839
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:12,470
that's full of mystery so like
uh full of mystery to whom to uh human

1840
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:12,480
uh full of mystery to whom to uh human
 

1841
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,990
uh full of mystery to whom to uh human
in inspectors

1842
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:14,000
in inspectors
 

1843
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,590
in inspectors
so does that mean that consciousness is

1844
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:15,600
so does that mean that consciousness is
 

1845
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,350
so does that mean that consciousness is
relative to the observer like could

1846
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:17,360
relative to the observer like could
 

1847
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,190
relative to the observer like could
something be conscious for us

1848
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:19,200
something be conscious for us
 

1849
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,269
something be conscious for us
but not conscious for an alien that

1850
00:30:21,269 --> 00:30:21,279
but not conscious for an alien that
 

1851
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:23,029
but not conscious for an alien that
understood better what was happening

1852
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:23,039
understood better what was happening
 

1853
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:24,230
understood better what was happening
inside the black box

1854
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:24,240
inside the black box
 

1855
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,789
inside the black box
yes so that if inside the black box is

1856
00:30:26,789 --> 00:30:26,799
yes so that if inside the black box is
 

1857
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:28,230
yes so that if inside the black box is
just a look-up table

1858
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:28,240
just a look-up table
 

1859
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,070
just a look-up table
the alien that saw that would say this

1860
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:30,080
the alien that saw that would say this
 

1861
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,870
the alien that saw that would say this
is not conscious to us

1862
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:32,880
is not conscious to us
 

1863
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,470
is not conscious to us
another way to phrase the black box is

1864
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:34,480
another way to phrase the black box is
 

1865
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,990
another way to phrase the black box is
layers of abstraction

1866
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:36,000
layers of abstraction
 

1867
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,750
layers of abstraction
which make it very difficult to see to

1868
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:37,760
which make it very difficult to see to
 

1869
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,029
which make it very difficult to see to
the actual underlying

1870
00:30:39,029 --> 00:30:39,039
the actual underlying
 

1871
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:41,110
the actual underlying
functionality of the system and then we

1872
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:41,120
functionality of the system and then we
 

1873
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,870
functionality of the system and then we
observe just the abstraction

1874
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:42,880
observe just the abstraction
 

1875
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,269
observe just the abstraction
and so it looks like magic to us but

1876
00:30:45,269 --> 00:30:45,279
and so it looks like magic to us but
 

1877
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:46,389
and so it looks like magic to us but
once we understand the

1878
00:30:46,389 --> 00:30:46,399
once we understand the
 

1879
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:49,350
once we understand the
inner machinery it stops being magic and

1880
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:49,360
inner machinery it stops being magic and
 

1881
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,230
inner machinery it stops being magic and
so like

1882
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:50,240
so like
 

1883
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,950
so like
that's a prerequisite is that you can't

1884
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:52,960
that's a prerequisite is that you can't
 

1885
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:53,430
that's a prerequisite is that you can't
know

1886
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:53,440
know
 

1887
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,230
know
how it works some part of it because

1888
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:56,240
how it works some part of it because
 

1889
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,710
how it works some part of it because
then there has to be in our human mind

1890
00:30:58,710 --> 00:30:58,720
then there has to be in our human mind
 

1891
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,230
then there has to be in our human mind
uh entry point for the magic

1892
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:02,240
uh entry point for the magic
 

1893
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,830
uh entry point for the magic
so that that's that's a formal

1894
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:03,840
so that that's that's a formal
 

1895
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,509
so that that's that's a formal
definition of the system

1896
00:31:05,509 --> 00:31:05,519
definition of the system
 

1897
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:08,149
definition of the system
yeah well look i mean i i explored a

1898
00:31:08,149 --> 00:31:08,159
yeah well look i mean i i explored a
 

1899
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:09,750
yeah well look i mean i i explored a
view and this essay i wrote

1900
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:09,760
view and this essay i wrote
 

1901
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,430
view and this essay i wrote
called the ghost and the quantum touring

1902
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:11,440
called the ghost and the quantum touring
 

1903
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,430
called the ghost and the quantum touring
machine uh seven years ago

1904
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:13,440
machine uh seven years ago
 

1905
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,070
machine uh seven years ago
that is uh related to that except that i

1906
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:16,080
that is uh related to that except that i
 

1907
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,190
that is uh related to that except that i
did not want to

1908
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:17,200
did not want to
 

1909
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,190
did not want to
have consciousness be relative to the

1910
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:19,200
have consciousness be relative to the
 

1911
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,029
have consciousness be relative to the
observer right because i think that

1912
00:31:21,029 --> 00:31:21,039
observer right because i think that
 

1913
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:22,950
observer right because i think that
you know if consciousness means anything

1914
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:22,960
you know if consciousness means anything
 

1915
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,110
you know if consciousness means anything
it is something that is experienced by

1916
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:25,120
it is something that is experienced by
 

1917
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,870
it is something that is experienced by
the entity that is conscious

1918
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:26,880
the entity that is conscious
 

1919
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,029
the entity that is conscious
right you know like i don't need you to

1920
00:31:29,029 --> 00:31:29,039
right you know like i don't need you to
 

1921
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:30,950
right you know like i don't need you to
tell me that i'm conscious right

1922
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:30,960
tell me that i'm conscious right
 

1923
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:34,149
tell me that i'm conscious right
nor do you need me to to to

1924
00:31:34,149 --> 00:31:34,159
nor do you need me to to to
 

1925
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:37,509
nor do you need me to to to
to tell you that you are right so uh

1926
00:31:37,509 --> 00:31:37,519
to tell you that you are right so uh
 

1927
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:39,509
to tell you that you are right so uh
so but but basically what i explored

1928
00:31:39,509 --> 00:31:39,519
so but but basically what i explored
 

1929
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:41,909
so but but basically what i explored
there is you know are there uh

1930
00:31:41,909 --> 00:31:41,919
there is you know are there uh
 

1931
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:45,110
there is you know are there uh
aspects of a of a system like uh like a

1932
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:45,120
aspects of a of a system like uh like a
 

1933
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:45,990
aspects of a of a system like uh like a
brain

1934
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:46,000
brain
 

1935
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,549
brain
that uh that just could not be predicted

1936
00:31:48,549 --> 00:31:48,559
that uh that just could not be predicted
 

1937
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:50,870
that uh that just could not be predicted
even with arbitrarily advanced future

1938
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:50,880
even with arbitrarily advanced future
 

1939
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:51,830
even with arbitrarily advanced future
technologies

1940
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:51,840
technologies
 

1941
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,310
technologies
yes because of chaos combined with

1942
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:54,320
yes because of chaos combined with
 

1943
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,389
yes because of chaos combined with
quantum mechanical uncertainty

1944
00:31:56,389 --> 00:31:56,399
quantum mechanical uncertainty
 

1945
00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:57,509
quantum mechanical uncertainty
you know and things like that i mean

1946
00:31:57,509 --> 00:31:57,519
you know and things like that i mean
 

1947
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:00,389
you know and things like that i mean
that that actually could be a

1948
00:32:00,389 --> 00:32:00,399
that that actually could be a
 

1949
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:03,350
that that actually could be a
a property of the brain you know if true

1950
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:03,360
a property of the brain you know if true
 

1951
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,870
a property of the brain you know if true
that would distinguish it in a

1952
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:04,880
that would distinguish it in a
 

1953
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,070
that would distinguish it in a
principled way

1954
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:06,080
principled way
 

1955
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,909
principled way
at least from any currently existing

1956
00:32:07,909 --> 00:32:07,919
at least from any currently existing
 

1957
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:10,389
at least from any currently existing
computer not from any possible computer

1958
00:32:10,389 --> 00:32:10,399
computer not from any possible computer
 

1959
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:11,430
computer not from any possible computer
but from yeah yeah

1960
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:11,440
but from yeah yeah
 

1961
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,430
but from yeah yeah
let's do a thought experiment so yeah if

1962
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:13,440
let's do a thought experiment so yeah if
 

1963
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,110
let's do a thought experiment so yeah if
i gave you

1964
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:15,120
i gave you
 

1965
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,669
i gave you
information that you're in the entire

1966
00:32:17,669 --> 00:32:17,679
information that you're in the entire
 

1967
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:20,070
information that you're in the entire
history of your life

1968
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:20,080
history of your life
 

1969
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,950
history of your life
basically explain away free will with a

1970
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:22,960
basically explain away free will with a
 

1971
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,310
basically explain away free will with a
look-up table say that

1972
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:24,320
look-up table say that
 

1973
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,310
look-up table say that
this was all predetermined that

1974
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:26,320
this was all predetermined that
 

1975
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,590
this was all predetermined that
everything you experienced has already

1976
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:27,600
everything you experienced has already
 

1977
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,950
everything you experienced has already
been predetermined

1978
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:28,960
been predetermined
 

1979
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,230
been predetermined
wouldn't that take away your

1980
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:30,240
wouldn't that take away your
 

1981
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,149
wouldn't that take away your
consciousness wouldn't you yourself that

1982
00:32:32,149 --> 00:32:32,159
consciousness wouldn't you yourself that
 

1983
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:32,870
consciousness wouldn't you yourself that
wouldn't

1984
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:32,880
wouldn't
 

1985
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,950
wouldn't
experience of the world change for you

1986
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:34,960
experience of the world change for you
 

1987
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:35,990
experience of the world change for you
in a way that's

1988
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:36,000
in a way that's
 

1989
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,950
in a way that's
you you can't well let me put it this

1990
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:38,960
you you can't well let me put it this
 

1991
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,870
you you can't well let me put it this
way if you could do like in a greek

1992
00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:40,880
way if you could do like in a greek
 

1993
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,029
way if you could do like in a greek
tragedy where you know you would just

1994
00:32:43,029 --> 00:32:43,039
tragedy where you know you would just
 

1995
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:45,029
tragedy where you know you would just
write down a prediction for what i'm

1996
00:32:45,029 --> 00:32:45,039
write down a prediction for what i'm
 

1997
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:45,909
write down a prediction for what i'm
going to do

1998
00:32:45,909 --> 00:32:45,919
going to do
 

1999
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:48,149
going to do
and then maybe you put the prediction in

2000
00:32:48,149 --> 00:32:48,159
and then maybe you put the prediction in
 

2001
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:49,430
and then maybe you put the prediction in
a sealed box

2002
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:49,440
a sealed box
 

2003
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,230
a sealed box
and maybe you know you you uh open it

2004
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:52,240
and maybe you know you you uh open it
 

2005
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,110
and maybe you know you you uh open it
later and you

2006
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:53,120
later and you
 

2007
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,789
later and you
show that you knew everything i was

2008
00:32:54,789 --> 00:32:54,799
show that you knew everything i was
 

2009
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:56,149
show that you knew everything i was
going to do or you know

2010
00:32:56,149 --> 00:32:56,159
going to do or you know
 

2011
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:57,830
going to do or you know
of course the even creepier version

2012
00:32:57,830 --> 00:32:57,840
of course the even creepier version
 

2013
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,750
of course the even creepier version
would be you tell me the prediction

2014
00:32:59,750 --> 00:32:59,760
would be you tell me the prediction
 

2015
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,230
would be you tell me the prediction
and then i try to falsify it and my very

2016
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:02,240
and then i try to falsify it and my very
 

2017
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,630
and then i try to falsify it and my very
effort to falsify it makes it come true

2018
00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:04,640
effort to falsify it makes it come true
 

2019
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,870
effort to falsify it makes it come true
right but let's let's you know let's

2020
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:06,880
right but let's let's you know let's
 

2021
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,710
right but let's let's you know let's
even forget that you know that version

2022
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:08,720
even forget that you know that version
 

2023
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,549
even forget that you know that version
is as convenient as it is for fiction

2024
00:33:10,549 --> 00:33:10,559
is as convenient as it is for fiction
 

2025
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:11,909
is as convenient as it is for fiction
writers right let's just

2026
00:33:11,909 --> 00:33:11,919
writers right let's just
 

2027
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:13,430
writers right let's just
let's just do the version where you put

2028
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:13,440
let's just do the version where you put
 

2029
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,430
let's just do the version where you put
the prediction into a sealed envelope

2030
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:15,440
the prediction into a sealed envelope
 

2031
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:18,470
the prediction into a sealed envelope
okay but uh if you could reliably

2032
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:18,480
okay but uh if you could reliably
 

2033
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,310
okay but uh if you could reliably
predict everything that i was going to

2034
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:20,320
predict everything that i was going to
 

2035
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:20,870
predict everything that i was going to
do

2036
00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:20,880
do
 

2037
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,870
do
i'm not sure that that would destroy my

2038
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:22,880
i'm not sure that that would destroy my
 

2039
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,389
i'm not sure that that would destroy my
sense of being conscious

2040
00:33:24,389 --> 00:33:24,399
sense of being conscious
 

2041
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:26,389
sense of being conscious
but i think it really would destroy my

2042
00:33:26,389 --> 00:33:26,399
but i think it really would destroy my
 

2043
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:28,070
but i think it really would destroy my
sense of having free will

2044
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:28,080
sense of having free will
 

2045
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:31,269
sense of having free will
you know and much much more than any

2046
00:33:31,269 --> 00:33:31,279
you know and much much more than any
 

2047
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:33,029
you know and much much more than any
philosophical conversation could

2048
00:33:33,029 --> 00:33:33,039
philosophical conversation could
 

2049
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:35,110
philosophical conversation could
possibly do that

2050
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:35,120
possibly do that
 

2051
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,110
possibly do that
right and so i think it becomes

2052
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:37,120
right and so i think it becomes
 

2053
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,190
right and so i think it becomes
extremely interesting to ask

2054
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:39,200
extremely interesting to ask
 

2055
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,750
extremely interesting to ask
you know could such predictions be done

2056
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:41,760
you know could such predictions be done
 

2057
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,350
you know could such predictions be done
you know even in principle

2058
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:43,360
you know even in principle
 

2059
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,870
you know even in principle
is it consistent with the laws of

2060
00:33:44,870 --> 00:33:44,880
is it consistent with the laws of
 

2061
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:47,110
is it consistent with the laws of
physics to make such predictions

2062
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:47,120
physics to make such predictions
 

2063
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,430
physics to make such predictions
to get enough data about someone that

2064
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:49,440
to get enough data about someone that
 

2065
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,950
to get enough data about someone that
you could actually generate such

2066
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:50,960
you could actually generate such
 

2067
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,789
you could actually generate such
predictions without having to kill them

2068
00:33:52,789 --> 00:33:52,799
predictions without having to kill them
 

2069
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:54,470
predictions without having to kill them
in the process to you know

2070
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:54,480
in the process to you know

00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,789
in the process to you know
slice their brain up into little slivers

2072
00:33:56,789 --> 00:33:56,799
slice their brain up into little slivers
 

2073
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:57,830
slice their brain up into little slivers
or something i mean

2074
00:33:57,830 --> 00:33:57,840
or something i mean
 

2075
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,909
or something i mean
theoretically possible right well um i

2076
00:33:59,909 --> 00:33:59,919
theoretically possible right well um i
 

2077
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:01,110
theoretically possible right well um i
don't know i mean i mean it might be

2078
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:01,120
don't know i mean i mean it might be
 

2079
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,630
don't know i mean i mean it might be
possible but only at the cost of

2080
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:02,640
possible but only at the cost of
 

2081
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,310
possible but only at the cost of
destroying the person

2082
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:04,320
destroying the person
 

2083
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:07,190
destroying the person
right i mean it depends on how low you

2084
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:07,200
right i mean it depends on how low you
 

2085
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,310
right i mean it depends on how low you
have to go

2086
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:08,320
have to go
 

2087
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,790
have to go
in sort of the substrate like if there

2088
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:10,800
in sort of the substrate like if there
 

2089
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,669
in sort of the substrate like if there
was a nice

2090
00:34:11,669 --> 00:34:11,679
was a nice
 

2091
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:14,069
was a nice
digital abstraction layer if you could

2092
00:34:14,069 --> 00:34:14,079
digital abstraction layer if you could
 

2093
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:16,149
digital abstraction layer if you could
think of each neuron as a kind of

2094
00:34:16,149 --> 00:34:16,159
think of each neuron as a kind of
 

2095
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:16,950
think of each neuron as a kind of
transistor

2096
00:34:16,950 --> 00:34:16,960
transistor
 

2097
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,190
transistor
computing a digital function then you

2098
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:19,200
computing a digital function then you
 

2099
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:19,990
computing a digital function then you
could imagine

2100
00:34:19,990 --> 00:34:20,000
could imagine
 

2101
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,550
could imagine
some nanorobots that would go in and we

2102
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:22,560
some nanorobots that would go in and we
 

2103
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,030
some nanorobots that would go in and we
just scan the state of each transistor

2104
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:25,040
just scan the state of each transistor
 

2105
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,470
just scan the state of each transistor
you know of each neuron

2106
00:34:26,470 --> 00:34:26,480
you know of each neuron
 

2107
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:29,030
you know of each neuron
and then you know make a a good enough

2108
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:29,040
and then you know make a a good enough
 

2109
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:29,669
and then you know make a a good enough
copy

2110
00:34:29,669 --> 00:34:29,679
copy
 

2111
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:32,069
copy
right but if it was actually important

2112
00:34:32,069 --> 00:34:32,079
right but if it was actually important
 

2113
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:33,990
right but if it was actually important
to get down to the molecular

2114
00:34:33,990 --> 00:34:34,000
to get down to the molecular
 

2115
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,230
to get down to the molecular
or the atomic level then you know

2116
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:36,240
or the atomic level then you know
 

2117
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,990
or the atomic level then you know
eventually you would be up against

2118
00:34:37,990 --> 00:34:38,000
eventually you would be up against
 

2119
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,669
eventually you would be up against
quantum effects you would be up against

2120
00:34:39,669 --> 00:34:39,679
quantum effects you would be up against
 

2121
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:42,389
quantum effects you would be up against
the unclonability of quantum states

2122
00:34:42,389 --> 00:34:42,399
the unclonability of quantum states
 

2123
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:44,790
the unclonability of quantum states
so i think it's a question of uh how

2124
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:44,800
so i think it's a question of uh how
 

2125
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,069
so i think it's a question of uh how
good of a replica

00:34:46,069 --> 00:34:46,079
good of a replica
 

2127
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:48,230
good of a replica
how good does the replica have to be

2128
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:48,240
how good does the replica have to be
 

2129
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:49,829
how good does the replica have to be
before you're going to count it as

00:34:49,829 --> 00:34:49,839
before you're going to count it as
 

2131
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:51,430
before you're going to count it as
actually a copy of you

2132
00:34:51,430 --> 00:34:51,440
actually a copy of you
 

2133
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,829
actually a copy of you
or as being able to predict your actions

00:34:53,829 --> 00:34:53,839
or as being able to predict your actions
 

2135
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:55,829
or as being able to predict your actions
uh that's a totally open question then

2136
00:34:55,829 --> 00:34:55,839
uh that's a totally open question then
 

2137
00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:57,030
uh that's a totally open question then
yeah yeah yeah and

2138
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:57,040
yeah yeah yeah and
 

2139
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,990
yeah yeah yeah and
and especially once we say that well

2140
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:00,000
and especially once we say that well
 

2141
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,150
and especially once we say that well
look maybe there's no way to pre

00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:02,160
look maybe there's no way to pre
 

2143

look maybe there's no way to pre
you know to make a deterministic

00:35:03,829 --> 00:35:03,839
you know to make a deterministic
 

2145
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:05,430
you know to make a deterministic
prediction because you know there's all

00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:06,960
there you know we know that there's
 

2149
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,190
there you know we know that there's
noise buffeting the brain around

00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:14,160
you know affecting the sodium ion

00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,230

channels for example whether they open

2158
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:16,240
channels for example whether they open
 

2159
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,430

or they close

2160
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:17,440
or they close
 

2161
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:21,190
or they close
um you know there's no reason why

2162
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:21,200
um you know there's no reason why
 

2163
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,430
um you know there's no reason why
over a certain time scale that shouldn't

00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,589
over a certain time scale that shouldn't
be amplified just like we imagine

2169
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:29,030

2173
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:33,990

so um so if if that stuff

2174
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:34,000
so um so if if that stuff
 

2175
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,430
so um so if if that stuff
is is important right then uh

2176
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:37,440
is is important right then uh
 

2177
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,069
is is important right then uh
then then you know we would say uh well

2178
00:35:40,069 --> 00:35:40,079
then then you know we would say uh well
 

2179
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:40,710
then then you know we would say uh well
you know you

2180
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:40,720
you know you
 

2181
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:43,109
you know you
you you can't uh uh you know you're

2182
00:35:43,109 --> 00:35:43,119
you you can't uh uh you know you're
 

2183
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:44,630
you you can't uh uh you know you're
you're never going to be able to make an

00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:44,640
you're never going to be able to make an
 

2185
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,069
you're never going to be able to make an

2186
00:35:46,069 --> 00:35:46,079
accurate enough copy
 

2187
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:47,589
accurate enough copy
but now the hard part is well what if

2188
00:35:47,589 --> 00:35:47,599
but now the hard part is well what if
 

2189
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:49,190
but now the hard part is well what if
someone can make a copy

2190
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:49,200
someone can make a copy
 

2191
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,270
someone can make a copy
that sort of no one else can tell apart

2192
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:51,280
that sort of no one else can tell apart
 

2193
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,390
that sort of no one else can tell apart
from you right

2194
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:52,400
from you right
 

2195
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,710
from you right
it says the same kinds of things that

2196
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:54,720
it says the same kinds of things that
 

2197
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:55,990
it says the same kinds of things that
you would have said

2198
00:35:55,990 --> 00:35:56,000
you would have said
 

2199
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,069
you would have said
maybe not exactly the same things

2200
00:35:58,069 --> 00:35:58,079
maybe not exactly the same things
 

2201
00:35:58,079 --> 00:35:59,829
maybe not exactly the same things
because we agree that there's noise

2202
00:35:59,829 --> 00:35:59,839
because we agree that there's noise
 

2203
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:02,150
because we agree that there's noise
but it says the same kinds of things and

2204
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:02,160
but it says the same kinds of things and
 

2205
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,069
but it says the same kinds of things and
maybe you alone would say no

2206
00:36:04,069 --> 00:36:04,079
maybe you alone would say no
 

2207
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:06,470
maybe you alone would say no
i know that that's not me you know it's

00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:06,480
i know that that's not me you know it's

i haven't felt my consciousness leap

over to that other thing
 

2215
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:13,430
over to that other thing
i still feel it localized in this

2216
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:13,440
i still feel it localized in this
 

2217
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,390
i still feel it localized in this
version right

2218
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:14,400
version right
 

2219
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,550
version right
then why should anyone else believe you

2220
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:16,560
then why should anyone else believe you
 

2221
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,829
then why should anyone else believe you
what are your thoughts

2222
00:36:17,829 --> 00:36:17,839
what are your thoughts
 

2223
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:19,510
what are your thoughts
i'd be curious you're a good person to

2224
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:19,520
i'd be curious you're a good person to
 

2225
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,950
i'd be curious you're a good person to
ask which is uh

2226
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:20,960
ask which is uh
 

2227
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,589
ask which is uh

00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,750
saying that there you know there is some
with axons and so on there might be some

2234
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:29,760
with axons and so on there might be some
 

2235
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,589
with axons and so on there might be some
biological places where quantum

2236
00:36:31,589 --> 00:36:31,599
biological places where quantum
 

2237
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:33,109
biological places where quantum
mechanics can come into play

2238

and through that create consciousness
 

2241
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,230
and through that create consciousness
somehow yeah

2242
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:36,240
somehow yeah
 

2243
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,870
somehow yeah
okay well um uh familiar with his work

2244
00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:38,880
okay well um uh familiar with his work
 

2245
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,069
okay well um uh familiar with his work
of course you know i read

2246
00:36:40,069 --> 00:36:40,079
of course you know i read
 

2247
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:42,390
of course you know i read
penrose's books as a teenager they had a

2248
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:42,400
penrose's books as a teenager they had a
 

2249
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,750
penrose's books as a teenager they had a
huge impact on me

2250
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:43,760
huge impact on me
 

2251
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,310
huge impact on me
uh uh five or six years ago i had the

2252

uh uh five or six years ago i had the
 

2253
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,910
uh uh five or six years ago i had the
privilege to actually talk these things

2254
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:47,920
privilege to actually talk these things
 

2255
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,670

was even raising such uh audacious

2266
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:00,800
was even raising such uh audacious
 

2267
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,069
was even raising such uh audacious
questions at all

2268
00:37:02,069 --> 00:37:02,079
questions at all
 

2269
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:04,069
questions at all
uh but you know to to to answer your

2270
00:37:04,069 --> 00:37:04,079
uh but you know to to to answer your
 

2271
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:05,829
uh but you know to to to answer your
question i think the first thing we need

2272
00:37:05,829 --> 00:37:05,839
question i think the first thing we need
 

2273
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:06,390
question i think the first thing we need
to

2274
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:06,400
to
 

2275
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,190
to
get clear on is that he is not merely

2276
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:09,200
get clear on is that he is not merely
 

2277
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,790
get clear on is that he is not merely
saying that quantum mechanics is

2278
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:10,800
saying that quantum mechanics is
 

2279
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,310
saying that quantum mechanics is
relevant to consciousness

2280
00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:12,320
relevant to consciousness
 

2281
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,710
relevant to consciousness
right that would be like um you know

2282
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:14,720
right that would be like um you know
 

2283
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:15,829
right that would be like um you know
that would be tame

2284
00:37:15,829 --> 00:37:15,839
that would be tame
 

2285
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:18,150
that would be tame
compared to what he is saying right he

2286
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:18,160
compared to what he is saying right he
 

2287
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,270
compared to what he is saying right he
is saying that

2288
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:19,280
is saying that
 

2289
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,190
is saying that
you know even quantum mechanics is not

2290
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:21,200
you know even quantum mechanics is not
 

2291
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,109
you know even quantum mechanics is not
good enough right if because if

2292
00:37:23,109 --> 00:37:23,119
good enough right if because if
 

2293
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:24,950
good enough right if because if
supposing for example that the brain

2294
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:24,960
supposing for example that the brain
 

2295
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,310
supposing for example that the brain
were a quantum computer

2296
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:26,320
were a quantum computer
 

2297
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,390
were a quantum computer
maybe that's still a computer you know

2298
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:28,400
maybe that's still a computer you know
 

2299
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,630
maybe that's still a computer you know
in fact a quantum computer can be

2300
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:30,640
in fact a quantum computer can be
 

2301
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,790
in fact a quantum computer can be
simulated by an ordinary computer it

2302
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:32,800
simulated by an ordinary computer it
 

2303
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,990
simulated by an ordinary computer it
might merely need

2304
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:34,000
might merely need
 

2305
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,829
might merely need
exponentially more time in order to do

2306
00:37:35,829 --> 00:37:35,839
exponentially more time in order to do
 

2307
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:37,990
exponentially more time in order to do
so right so that's simply not good

2308
00:37:37,990 --> 00:37:38,000
so right so that's simply not good
 

2309
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:38,950
so right so that's simply not good
enough for him

2310
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:38,960
enough for him
 

2311
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,750
enough for him
okay so what he wants is for the brain

2312
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:41,760
okay so what he wants is for the brain
 

2313
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:45,270
okay so what he wants is for the brain
to be a quantum gravitational computer

2314
00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:45,280
to be a quantum gravitational computer
 

2315
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:48,390
to be a quantum gravitational computer
or or uh he wants the brain to be

2316
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:48,400
or or uh he wants the brain to be
 

2317
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,589
or or uh he wants the brain to be
exploiting

2318
00:37:49,589 --> 00:37:49,599
exploiting
 

2319
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:52,710
exploiting
as yet unknown laws of quantum gravity

2320
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:52,720
as yet unknown laws of quantum gravity
 

2321
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,230
as yet unknown laws of quantum gravity
okay which would which would be

2322
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:54,240
okay which would which would be
 

2323
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,069
okay which would which would be
uncomputable

2324
00:37:56,069 --> 00:37:56,079
uncomputable
 

2325
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:58,230
uncomputable
that's the key point okay yes yes that

2326
00:37:58,230 --> 00:37:58,240
that's the key point okay yes yes that
 

2327
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,310
that's the key point okay yes yes that
would be literally uncomputable

2328
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:00,320
would be literally uncomputable
 

2329
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,390
would be literally uncomputable
and i've asked him you know to clarify

2330
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:02,400
and i've asked him you know to clarify
 

2331
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,390
and i've asked him you know to clarify
this but uncomputable

2332
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:04,400
this but uncomputable
 

2333
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,390
this but uncomputable
even if you had an oracle for the

2334
00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:06,400
even if you had an oracle for the
 

2335
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,829
even if you had an oracle for the
halting problem

00:38:07,829 --> 00:38:07,839
halting problem
 

2337
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:10,630

or you know and and or you know as high

2338
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:10,640
or you know and and or you know as high
 

2339
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,390
or you know and and or you know as high
up as you want to go and the sort of

2345
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:18,230
the usual hierarchy of uncomputability
he wants to go beyond all of that okay

2346
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:18,240
he wants to go beyond all of that okay
 

2347
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:18,790
he wants to go beyond all of that okay
so

2348
00:38:18,790 --> 00:38:18,800
so
 

2349
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,870
so
so you know just to be clear like you

2350
00:38:20,870 --> 00:38:20,880
so you know just to be clear like you
 

2351
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,030
so you know just to be clear like you
know if we're keeping count of how many

2352
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:23,040
know if we're keeping count of how many
 

2353
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,310
know if we're keeping count of how many
speculations

2354
00:38:24,310 --> 00:38:24,320
speculations
 

2355
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,990
speculations
you know there's probably like at least

2356
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:26,000
you know there's probably like at least
 

2357
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,510
you know there's probably like at least
five or six of them right

2358
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:27,520
five or six of them right
 

2359
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,349
five or six of them right
there's first of all that there is some

2360
00:38:29,349 --> 00:38:29,359
there's first of all that there is some
 

2361
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:31,030
there's first of all that there is some
quantum gravity theory that would

2362
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:31,040
quantum gravity theory that would
 

2363
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,030
quantum gravity theory that would
involve this kind of

2364
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:32,040
involve this kind of
 

2365
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:34,550
involve this kind of
uncomputability right most people who

2366
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:34,560
uncomputability right most people who
 

2367
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,550
uncomputability right most people who
study quantum gravity would not agree

2368
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:36,560
study quantum gravity would not agree
 

2369
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:37,190
study quantum gravity would not agree
with that

2370
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:37,200
with that
 

2371
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,510
with that
they would say that what we've learned

00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:39,520
they would say that what we've learned
 

2373
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,950
they would say that what we've learned
you know what little we know about

00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:40,960
you know what little we know about
 

2375
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,630
you know what little we know about
quantum gravity from the

this ads cft correspondence for example
 

2379
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,470
this ads cft correspondence for example
has been very much consistent with the

00:38:48,470 --> 00:38:48,480
has been very much consistent with the
 

2381
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:51,030
has been very much consistent with the

00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:54,790
broad idea of nature being computable
right um but uh but all right but but

00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:54,800
right um but uh but all right but but

supposing that he's right about that
 

2387
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,150
supposing that he's right about that
then you know

00:38:58,150 --> 00:38:58,160
then you know
 

2389
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,710
then you know
what most physicists would say is that

00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:15,109
might be relevant at the big bang
uh they are plainly not relevant

uh they are plainly not relevant
 

2403
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:17,190
uh they are plainly not relevant

would say that we have you know the
 

2417
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,190
would say that we have you know the

right but that like we have you know

2450
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:01,040
right but that like we have you know
 

2451
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,030
right but that like we have you know
that in like in the standard model of

2452
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:03,040
that in like in the standard model of
 

2453
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,309
that in like in the standard model of
elementary particles

2454
00:40:04,309 --> 00:40:04,319
elementary particles
 

2455
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:07,349
elementary particles
right we have a quantum field theory

2456
00:40:07,349 --> 00:40:07,359
right we have a quantum field theory
 

2457
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:10,390
right we have a quantum field theory
that seems totally adequate for all of

2458
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:10,400
that seems totally adequate for all of
 

2459
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,990
that seems totally adequate for all of
the terrestrial phenomena

the terrestrial phenomena
 

2461
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,069
the terrestrial phenomena
right the only things that it doesn't

2462
00:40:14,069 --> 00:40:14,079
right the only things that it doesn't
 

2463
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:15,190
right the only things that it doesn't
you know explain

if you were to probe it like at a uh you
 

2471
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,510
if you were to probe it like at a uh you
know extremes of you know

doesn't explain black hole singularities
 

2481
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,430
doesn't explain black hole singularities
right but these are all very exotic

2482
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:33,440
right but these are all very exotic
 

2483
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,430
right but these are all very exotic
things very you know far removed from

right so for penrose to be right he

2488
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:39,520
right so for penrose to be right he
 

2489
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,150
right so for penrose to be right he
needs

2490
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:40,160
needs
 

2491
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:42,630
needs
you know these phenomena to somehow

2492
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:42,640
you know these phenomena to somehow
 

2493
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,790
you know these phenomena to somehow
affect the brain he needs the brain to

2494
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:44,800
affect the brain he needs the brain to
 

2495
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,670
affect the brain he needs the brain to
contain

2496
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:45,680
contain
 

2497
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:48,230
contain
antenna that are sensitive to the black

to this as yet unknown physics right and

2502
00:40:51,589 --> 00:40:51,599
to this as yet unknown physics right and
 

2503
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:52,710
to this as yet unknown physics right and
then he needs

2504
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:52,720
then he needs
 

2505
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:55,430
then he needs
a modification of quantum mechanics okay

2506
00:40:55,430 --> 00:40:55,440
a modification of quantum mechanics okay
 

2507
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,390
a modification of quantum mechanics okay
so he needs

2508
00:40:56,390 --> 00:40:56,400
so he needs
 

2509
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,870
so he needs
quantum mechanics to actually be wrong

2510
00:40:58,870 --> 00:40:58,880
quantum mechanics to actually be wrong
 

2511
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,150
quantum mechanics to actually be wrong
okay he needs

2512
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:00,160
okay he needs
 

2513
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,309
okay he needs
uh uh what what he wants is what he

2514
00:41:02,309 --> 00:41:02,319
uh uh what what he wants is what he
 

2515
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:04,870
uh uh what what he wants is what he
calls an objective reduction mechanism

2516
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:04,880
calls an objective reduction mechanism
 

2517
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:05,190
calls an objective reduction mechanism
or

2518
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:05,200
or
 

2519
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,589
or
an objective collapse so this is the

2520
00:41:07,589 --> 00:41:07,599
an objective collapse so this is the
 

2521
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:10,150
an objective collapse so this is the
idea that once quantum states get large

2522
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:10,160
idea that once quantum states get large
 

2523
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:10,870
idea that once quantum states get large
enough

2524
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:10,880
enough
 

2525
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:15,190
enough
then they somehow spontaneously collapse

2526
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:15,200
then they somehow spontaneously collapse
 

2527
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:18,150
then they somehow spontaneously collapse
right that uh uh um you know and and

2528
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:18,160
right that uh uh um you know and and
 

2529
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,069
right that uh uh um you know and and
this is an idea that lots of people have

2530
00:41:20,069 --> 00:41:20,079
this is an idea that lots of people have
 

2531
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:21,109
this is an idea that lots of people have
explored

2532
00:41:21,109 --> 00:41:21,119
explored
 

2533
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:23,030
explored
uh you know there's uh something called

2534
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:23,040
uh you know there's uh something called
 

2535
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,309
uh you know there's uh something called
the grw

2536
00:41:24,309 --> 00:41:24,319
the grw
 

2537
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:27,349
the grw
proposal that tries to uh you know

2538
00:41:27,349 --> 00:41:27,359
proposal that tries to uh you know
 

2539
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:28,870
proposal that tries to uh you know
say something along those lines you know

2540
00:41:28,870 --> 00:41:28,880
say something along those lines you know
 

2541
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,230
say something along those lines you know
and these are theories that actually

2542
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:30,240
and these are theories that actually
 

2543
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,990
and these are theories that actually
make testable predictions

2544
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:32,000
make testable predictions
 

2545
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,589
make testable predictions
right which is a nice feature that they

2546
00:41:33,589 --> 00:41:33,599
right which is a nice feature that they
 

2547
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:35,510
right which is a nice feature that they
have but you know the very fact that

2548
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:35,520
have but you know the very fact that
 

2549
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,750
have but you know the very fact that
they're testable may mean that in the

2550
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:37,760
they're testable may mean that in the
 

2551
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,910
they're testable may mean that in the
uh you know in the in the coming decades

2552
00:41:39,910 --> 00:41:39,920
uh you know in the in the coming decades
 

2553
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,510
uh you know in the in the coming decades
we may well be able to test these

2554
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:41,520
we may well be able to test these
 

2555
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:42,870
we may well be able to test these
theories and show that they're they're

2556
00:41:42,870 --> 00:41:42,880
theories and show that they're they're
 

2557
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:43,829
theories and show that they're they're
they're wrong

2558
00:41:43,829 --> 00:41:43,839
they're wrong
 

2559
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:46,309
they're wrong
right uh you know we may be able to test

2560
00:41:46,309 --> 00:41:46,319
right uh you know we may be able to test
 

2561
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:47,990
right uh you know we may be able to test
some of penrose's ideas

2562
00:41:47,990 --> 00:41:48,000
some of penrose's ideas
 

2563
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,550
some of penrose's ideas
if not not his ideas about consciousness

2564
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:50,560
if not not his ideas about consciousness
 

2565
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,630
if not not his ideas about consciousness
but at least his ideas that about an

2566
00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:52,640
but at least his ideas that about an
 

2567
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:55,190
but at least his ideas that about an
objective collapse of quantum states

2568
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:55,200
objective collapse of quantum states
 

2569
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,630
objective collapse of quantum states
right and people have actually

2570
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:56,640
right and people have actually
 

2571
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,630
right and people have actually
like dick balmester have actually been

2572
00:41:58,630 --> 00:41:58,640
like dick balmester have actually been
 

2573
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,950
like dick balmester have actually been
working to try to do these experiments

2574
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:00,960
working to try to do these experiments
 

2575
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,710
working to try to do these experiments
they haven't been able to do it yet to

2576
00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:02,720
they haven't been able to do it yet to
 

2577
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,630
they haven't been able to do it yet to
attest penrose's proposal

2578
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:04,640
attest penrose's proposal
 

2579
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,710
attest penrose's proposal
okay but penrose would need more than

2580
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:06,720
okay but penrose would need more than
 

2581
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:09,109
okay but penrose would need more than
just an objective collapse of quantum

2582
00:42:09,109 --> 00:42:09,119
just an objective collapse of quantum
 

2583
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:09,670
just an objective collapse of quantum
states

2584
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:09,680
states
 

2585
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,270
states
which would already be the biggest

2586
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:11,280
which would already be the biggest
 

2587
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,510
which would already be the biggest
development in physics for a century

2588
00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:13,520
development in physics for a century
 

2589
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,670
development in physics for a century
since quantum mechanics itself okay he

2590
00:42:15,670 --> 00:42:15,680
since quantum mechanics itself okay he
 

2591
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:16,790
since quantum mechanics itself okay he
would need

2592
00:42:16,790 --> 00:42:16,800
would need
 

2593
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,589
would need
for consciousness to somehow be able to

2594
00:42:19,589 --> 00:42:19,599
for consciousness to somehow be able to
 

2595
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:20,630
for consciousness to somehow be able to
influence

2596
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:20,640
influence
 

2597
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:23,270
influence
the direction of the collapse so that it

2598
00:42:23,270 --> 00:42:23,280
the direction of the collapse so that it
 

2599
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,030
the direction of the collapse so that it
wouldn't be completely random

2600
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:25,040
wouldn't be completely random
 

2601
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,109
wouldn't be completely random
but that you know your dispositions

2602
00:42:27,109 --> 00:42:27,119
but that you know your dispositions
 

2603
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:28,870
but that you know your dispositions
would somehow influence the quantum

2604
00:42:28,870 --> 00:42:28,880
would somehow influence the quantum
 

2605
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:29,510
would somehow influence the quantum
state

2606
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:29,520
state
 

2607
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:31,990
state
to collapse more likely this way or that

2608
00:42:31,990 --> 00:42:32,000
to collapse more likely this way or that
 

2609
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:32,630
to collapse more likely this way or that
way

2610
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:32,640
way
 

2611
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:36,069
way
okay finally penrose you know says that

2612
00:42:36,069 --> 00:42:36,079
okay finally penrose you know says that
 

2613
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:36,630
okay finally penrose you know says that
all of this

2614
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:36,640
all of this
 

2615
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:39,349
all of this
has to be true because of an argument

2616
00:42:39,349 --> 00:42:39,359
has to be true because of an argument
 

2617
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:41,030
has to be true because of an argument
that he makes based on girdle's

2618
00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:41,040
that he makes based on girdle's
 

2619
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,309
that he makes based on girdle's
incompleteness theorem

2620
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:42,319
incompleteness theorem
 

2621
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:44,870
incompleteness theorem
okay right now like i would say the

2622
00:42:44,870 --> 00:42:44,880
okay right now like i would say the
 

2623
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:47,030
okay right now like i would say the
overwhelming majority of computer

2624
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:47,040
overwhelming majority of computer
 

2625
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,109
overwhelming majority of computer
scientists and mathematicians

2626
00:42:49,109 --> 00:42:49,119
scientists and mathematicians
 

2627
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:51,589
scientists and mathematicians
who have thought about this i don't

2628
00:42:51,589 --> 00:42:51,599
who have thought about this i don't
 

2629
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:53,030
who have thought about this i don't
think that girdles and completeness

2630
00:42:53,030 --> 00:42:53,040
think that girdles and completeness
 

2631
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,950
think that girdles and completeness
theorem can do what he needs it to do

2632
00:42:54,950 --> 00:42:54,960
theorem can do what he needs it to do
 

2633
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,630
theorem can do what he needs it to do
here right i don't think that that

2634
00:42:56,630 --> 00:42:56,640
here right i don't think that that
 

2635
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,390
here right i don't think that that
argument is sound okay

2636
00:42:58,390 --> 00:42:58,400
argument is sound okay
 

2637
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,950
argument is sound okay
but that is you know that is sort of the

2638
00:43:00,950 --> 00:43:00,960
but that is you know that is sort of the
 

2639
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,870
but that is you know that is sort of the
tower that you have to ascend to if

2640
00:43:02,870 --> 00:43:02,880
tower that you have to ascend to if
 

2641
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,630
tower that you have to ascend to if
you're going to go where penrose goes

2642
00:43:04,630 --> 00:43:04,640
you're going to go where penrose goes
 

2643
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:05,030
you're going to go where penrose goes
and the

2644
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:05,040
and the
 

2645
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,589
and the
intuition uses with uh yeah the

2646
00:43:07,589 --> 00:43:07,599
intuition uses with uh yeah the
 

2647
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:09,510
intuition uses with uh yeah the
completeness theorem is that basically

2648
00:43:09,510 --> 00:43:09,520
completeness theorem is that basically
 

2649
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,190
completeness theorem is that basically
that there's important stuff that's not

2650
00:43:11,190 --> 00:43:11,200
that there's important stuff that's not
 

2651
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:13,430
that there's important stuff that's not
computable

2652
00:43:13,430 --> 00:43:13,440
computable
 

2653
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:14,950
computable
it's not just that because i mean

2654
00:43:14,950 --> 00:43:14,960
it's not just that because i mean
 

2655
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,950
it's not just that because i mean
everyone agrees that there are problems

2656
00:43:16,950 --> 00:43:16,960
everyone agrees that there are problems
 

2657
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,630
everyone agrees that there are problems
that are uncomputable right that's a

2658
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:18,640
that are uncomputable right that's a
 

2659
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:20,069
that are uncomputable right that's a
mathematical theorem

2660
00:43:20,069 --> 00:43:20,079
mathematical theorem
 

2661
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:22,950
mathematical theorem
right that but what penrose wants to say

2662
00:43:22,950 --> 00:43:22,960
right that but what penrose wants to say
 

2663
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:24,390
right that but what penrose wants to say
is that uh

2664
00:43:24,390 --> 00:43:24,400
is that uh
 

2665
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:27,190
is that uh
uh you know the um you know for example

2666
00:43:27,190 --> 00:43:27,200
uh you know the um you know for example
 

2667
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:28,630
uh you know the um you know for example
there are statements

2668
00:43:28,630 --> 00:43:28,640
there are statements
 

2669
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:31,430
there are statements
uh you know for you know given any uh

2670
00:43:31,430 --> 00:43:31,440
uh you know for you know given any uh
 

2671
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:32,470
uh you know for you know given any uh
formal system

2672
00:43:32,470 --> 00:43:32,480
formal system
 

2673
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,710
formal system
you know for doing math right there will

2674
00:43:34,710 --> 00:43:34,720
you know for doing math right there will
 

2675
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:37,190
you know for doing math right there will
be true statements of arithmetic

2676
00:43:37,190 --> 00:43:37,200
be true statements of arithmetic
 

2677
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:39,670
be true statements of arithmetic
that that formal system you know if it's

2678
00:43:39,670 --> 00:43:39,680
that that formal system you know if it's
 

2679
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:41,270
that that formal system you know if it's
adequate for math at all

2680
00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:41,280
adequate for math at all
 

2681
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,430
adequate for math at all
if it's consistent and so on will not be

2682
00:43:43,430 --> 00:43:43,440
if it's consistent and so on will not be
 

2683
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:44,630
if it's consistent and so on will not be
able to prove

2684
00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:44,640
able to prove
 

2685
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:47,030
able to prove
uh a famous example being the statement

2686
00:43:47,030 --> 00:43:47,040
uh a famous example being the statement
 

2687
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:49,589
uh a famous example being the statement
that that system itself is consistent

2688
00:43:49,589 --> 00:43:49,599
that that system itself is consistent
 

2689
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:52,390
that that system itself is consistent
right no you know good formal system can

2690
00:43:52,390 --> 00:43:52,400
right no you know good formal system can
 

2691
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:55,109
right no you know good formal system can
actually prove its own consistency

2692
00:43:55,109 --> 00:43:55,119
actually prove its own consistency
 

2693
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:57,030
actually prove its own consistency
that can only be done from a stronger

2694
00:43:57,030 --> 00:43:57,040
that can only be done from a stronger
 

2695
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:59,510
that can only be done from a stronger
formal system which then can't prove its

2696
00:43:59,510 --> 00:43:59,520
formal system which then can't prove its
 

2697
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:00,550
formal system which then can't prove its
own consistency

2698
00:44:00,550 --> 00:44:00,560
own consistency
 

2699
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:03,109
own consistency
and so on forever okay that's gurdle's

2700
00:44:03,109 --> 00:44:03,119
and so on forever okay that's gurdle's
 

2701
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:03,670
and so on forever okay that's gurdle's
theorem

2702
00:44:03,670 --> 00:44:03,680
theorem
 

2703
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:07,270
theorem
but now why is that relevant to uh

2704
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:07,280
but now why is that relevant to uh
 

2705
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:09,990
but now why is that relevant to uh
consciousness right uh uh well you know

2706
00:44:09,990 --> 00:44:10,000
consciousness right uh uh well you know
 

2707
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,750
consciousness right uh uh well you know
i mean i mean the the idea that it might

2708
00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:11,760
i mean i mean the the idea that it might
 

2709
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,349
i mean i mean the the idea that it might
have something to do with consciousness

2710
00:44:13,349 --> 00:44:13,359
have something to do with consciousness
 

2711
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:14,390
have something to do with consciousness
as an old one

2712
00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:14,400
as an old one
 

2713
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,230
as an old one
girdle himself apparently thought that

2714
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:16,240
girdle himself apparently thought that
 

2715
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:18,150
girdle himself apparently thought that
it didn't really um you know uh

2716
00:44:18,150 --> 00:44:18,160
it didn't really um you know uh
 

2717
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:21,349
it didn't really um you know uh
lucas uh uh um um

2718
00:44:21,349 --> 00:44:21,359
lucas uh uh um um
 

2719
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:23,670
lucas uh uh um um
thought so i think in the 60s and

2720
00:44:23,670 --> 00:44:23,680
thought so i think in the 60s and
 

2721
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:25,589
thought so i think in the 60s and
penrose is really just you know sort of

2722
00:44:25,589 --> 00:44:25,599
penrose is really just you know sort of
 

2723
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:28,550
penrose is really just you know sort of
updating what what uh uh what what they

2724
00:44:28,550 --> 00:44:28,560
updating what what uh uh what what they
 

2725
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:29,670
updating what what uh uh what what they
and others had said

2726
00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:29,680
and others had said
 

2727
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:31,109
and others had said
i mean you know the idea that girdle's

2728
00:44:31,109 --> 00:44:31,119
i mean you know the idea that girdle's
 

2729
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:32,870
i mean you know the idea that girdle's
theorem could have something to do with

2730
00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:32,880
theorem could have something to do with
 

2731
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:34,069
theorem could have something to do with
consciousness was

2732
00:44:34,069 --> 00:44:34,079
consciousness was

you know um in in 1950 when alan turing

2734
00:44:37,190 --> 00:44:37,200
you know um in in 1950 when alan turing
 

2735
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:38,390
you know um in in 1950 when alan turing
wrote his article

2736
00:44:38,390 --> 00:44:38,400
wrote his article
 

2737
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,870
wrote his article
uh about the touring test he already you

2738
00:44:40,870 --> 00:44:40,880
uh about the touring test he already you
 

2739
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:41,510
uh about the touring test he already you
know

2740
00:44:41,510 --> 00:44:41,520
know
 

2741
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:43,430
know
was writing about that as like an old

2742
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:43,440
was writing about that as like an old
 

2743
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,750
was writing about that as like an old
and well-known idea and as one that he

2744
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:45,760
and well-known idea and as one that he
 

2745
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,829
and well-known idea and as one that he
was as a wrong one that he wanted to

2746
00:44:47,829 --> 00:44:47,839
was as a wrong one that he wanted to
 

2747
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:50,550
was as a wrong one that he wanted to
dispense with okay but

2748
00:44:50,550 --> 00:44:50,560
dispense with okay but
 

2749
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:52,630
dispense with okay but
the basic problem with this idea is you

2750
00:44:52,630 --> 00:44:52,640
the basic problem with this idea is you
 

2751
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,470
the basic problem with this idea is you
know penrose wants to say

2752
00:44:54,470 --> 00:44:54,480
know penrose wants to say
 

2753
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:56,710
know penrose wants to say
that uh and and all of his predecessors

2754
00:44:56,710 --> 00:44:56,720
that uh and and all of his predecessors
 

2755
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:58,390
that uh and and all of his predecessors
your you know want to say

2756
00:44:58,390 --> 00:44:58,400
your you know want to say
 

2757
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,790
your you know want to say
that you know even though you know this

2758
00:45:00,790 --> 00:45:00,800
that you know even though you know this
 

2759
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,630
that you know even though you know this
given formal system cannot

00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:05,829
given formal system cannot
prove uh its own consistency we

2762
00:45:05,829 --> 00:45:05,839
prove uh its own consistency we
 

2763
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:08,069
prove uh its own consistency we
as humans sort of looking at it from the

2764
00:45:08,069 --> 00:45:08,079
as humans sort of looking at it from the
 

2765
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:08,950
as humans sort of looking at it from the
outside

2766
00:45:08,950 --> 00:45:08,960
outside
 

2767
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:11,750
outside
can just somehow see its consistency

2768
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:11,760
can just somehow see its consistency
 

2769
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:12,550
can just somehow see its consistency
right

2770
00:45:12,550 --> 00:45:12,560
right
 

2771
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:15,910
right
and the you know the rejoinder to that

2772
00:45:15,910 --> 00:45:15,920
and the you know the rejoinder to that
 

2773
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:17,430
and the you know the rejoinder to that
you know from the very beginning has

2774
00:45:17,430 --> 00:45:17,440
you know from the very beginning has
 

2775
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:19,349
you know from the very beginning has
been well can we really

2776
00:45:19,349 --> 00:45:19,359
been well can we really
 

2777
00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:21,190
been well can we really
yeah i mean maybe or maybe maybe you

2778
00:45:21,190 --> 00:45:21,200
yeah i mean maybe or maybe maybe you
 

2779
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:22,630
yeah i mean maybe or maybe maybe you
know maybe maybe he

2780
00:45:22,630 --> 00:45:22,640
know maybe maybe he
 

2781
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:25,109
know maybe maybe he
penrose can but you know can the rest of

2782
00:45:25,109 --> 00:45:25,119
penrose can but you know can the rest of
 

2783
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:25,670
penrose can but you know can the rest of
us

2784
00:45:25,670 --> 00:45:25,680
us
 

2785
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:28,790
us
right uh and you know i i noticed that

2786
00:45:28,790 --> 00:45:28,800
right uh and you know i i noticed that
 

2787
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,150
right uh and you know i i noticed that
that um

2788
00:45:30,150 --> 00:45:30,160
that um
 

2789
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:32,550
that um
you know i mean it is perfectly

2790
00:45:32,550 --> 00:45:32,560
you know i mean it is perfectly
 

2791
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:33,990
you know i mean it is perfectly
plausible to imagine

2792
00:45:33,990 --> 00:45:34,000
plausible to imagine
 

2793
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,870
plausible to imagine
a computer that could say you know it

2794
00:45:36,870 --> 00:45:36,880
a computer that could say you know it
 

2795
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:38,950
a computer that could say you know it
would not be limited to working within a

00:45:38,950 --> 00:45:38,960
would not be limited to working within a
 

2797
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:40,309
would not be limited to working within a

2798
00:45:40,309 --> 00:45:40,319
single formal system
 

2799
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:42,550
single formal system
right they could say i am now going to

2800
00:45:42,550 --> 00:45:42,560
right they could say i am now going to
 

2801
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:44,230
right they could say i am now going to
adopt the hypothesis

2802
00:45:44,230 --> 00:45:44,240
adopt the hypothesis
 

2803
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:46,150
adopt the hypothesis
that this that my formal system is

2804
00:45:46,150 --> 00:45:46,160
that this that my formal system is
 

2805
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,990
that this that my formal system is
consistent right and i'm now going to

2806
00:45:47,990 --> 00:45:48,000
consistent right and i'm now going to
 

2807
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,910
consistent right and i'm now going to
see what can be done from that stronger

2808
00:45:49,910 --> 00:45:49,920
see what can be done from that stronger

00:45:52,390 --> 00:45:52,400
and and so on and you know when i'm
 

2813
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:55,109
and and so on and you know when i'm
going to add new axioms to my system

2814
00:45:55,109 --> 00:45:55,119
going to add new axioms to my system

00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:57,910
going to add new axioms to my system
totally plausible there's absolutely

that when the ai adds new axioms that it

00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,150
that when the ai adds new axioms that it

will always be right
 

2833
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:13,349
will always be right
right okay and you know and that's of

2834
00:46:13,349 --> 00:46:13,359
right okay and you know and that's of
 

2835
00:46:13,359 --> 00:46:15,589
right okay and you know and that's of
course the point that penrose pounces on

2836
00:46:15,589 --> 00:46:15,599
course the point that penrose pounces on
 

2837
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:17,750
course the point that penrose pounces on
but the reply is obvious and you know

2838
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:17,760
but the reply is obvious and you know
 

2839
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:19,829
but the reply is obvious and you know
it's one that that alan turing made 70

00:46:19,829 --> 00:46:19,839
it's one that that alan turing made 70

00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:20,630
it's one that that alan turing made 70
years ago

so on alan turing you took part in the

2854
00:46:30,950 --> 00:46:30,960
so on alan turing you took part in the

uh uh not really no i didn't i mean

there was this
 

2861
00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:39,349
there was this
uh uh kind of ridiculous claim that was

or was eugene uh
 

2881
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,630
or was eugene uh
eugene gusman that was just me writing a

called me to ask about it did you ever
chat with him i thought

2888
00:47:03,270 --> 00:47:03,280
chat with him i thought
 

2889
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:04,950
chat with him i thought
i did chat with eugene gooseman i mean

2890
00:47:04,950 --> 00:47:04,960
i did chat with eugene gooseman i mean
 

2891
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:06,790
i did chat with eugene gooseman i mean
it was available on the web the chat

2892
00:47:06,790 --> 00:47:06,800
it was available on the web the chat
 

2893
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:09,030
it was available on the web the chat
oh interesting i didn't so yeah so all

2894
00:47:09,030 --> 00:47:09,040
oh interesting i didn't so yeah so all
 

2895
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:10,870
oh interesting i didn't so yeah so all
that happened was that uh

2896

that happened was that uh
 

2897
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:12,550
that happened was that uh
so you know a bunch of journalists

so you know a bunch of journalists
 

2899
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:14,390
so you know a bunch of journalists

00:47:20,150 --> 00:47:20,160
right and it was this thing called
 

2907

old boy
 

2913
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:27,510
old boy
and um you know and apparently someone

2914
00:47:27,510 --> 00:47:27,520
and um you know and apparently someone
 

2915
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:28,069
and um you know and apparently someone
had done

2916
00:47:28,069 --> 00:47:28,079
had done
 

2917
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:30,390
had done
some tests where you know people

2918
00:47:30,390 --> 00:47:30,400
some tests where you know people
 

2919
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:31,589
some tests where you know people
couldn't you know

2920
00:47:31,589 --> 00:47:31,599
couldn't you know
 

2921
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:33,510
couldn't you know
you know were less than perfect let's

2922
00:47:33,510 --> 00:47:33,520
you know were less than perfect let's
 

2923
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:35,430
you know were less than perfect let's
say distinguishing it from a human

2924
00:47:35,430 --> 00:47:35,440
say distinguishing it from a human
 

2925
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:37,510
say distinguishing it from a human
and they said well if you look at

2926
00:47:37,510 --> 00:47:37,520
and they said well if you look at
 

2927
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:38,710
and they said well if you look at
touring's paper

2928
00:47:38,710 --> 00:47:38,720
touring's paper
 

2929
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:40,950
touring's paper
and you look at you know the percentages

2930
00:47:40,950 --> 00:47:40,960
and you look at you know the percentages
 

2931
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,630
and you look at you know the percentages
that he that he talked about then you

2932
00:47:42,630 --> 00:47:42,640
that he that he talked about then you
 

2933
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:44,069
that he that he talked about then you
know it seemed like we're past that

2934
00:47:44,069 --> 00:47:44,079
know it seemed like we're past that
 

2935
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:44,950
know it seemed like we're past that
threshold

2936
00:47:44,950 --> 00:47:44,960
threshold
 

2937
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:48,630
threshold
right and you know i had a sort of

2938
00:47:48,630 --> 00:47:48,640
right and you know i had a sort of
 

2939
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:50,470
right and you know i had a sort of
you know different way to look at it

2940
00:47:50,470 --> 00:47:50,480
you know different way to look at it
 

2941
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:52,390
you know different way to look at it
instead of the legalistic way

2942
00:47:52,390 --> 00:47:52,400
instead of the legalistic way
 

2943
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,950
instead of the legalistic way
like let's just try the actual thing out

2944
00:47:54,950 --> 00:47:54,960
like let's just try the actual thing out
 

2945
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:56,790
like let's just try the actual thing out
and let's see what it can do with

2946
00:47:56,790 --> 00:47:56,800
and let's see what it can do with
 

2947
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:59,510
and let's see what it can do with
questions like you know is mount everest

2948
00:47:59,510 --> 00:47:59,520
questions like you know is mount everest
 

2949
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:01,349
questions like you know is mount everest
bigger than a shoebox

2950
00:48:01,349 --> 00:48:01,359
bigger than a shoebox
 

2951
00:48:01,359 --> 00:48:03,349
bigger than a shoebox
okay or just you know like the most

2952
00:48:03,349 --> 00:48:03,359
okay or just you know like the most
 

2953
00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:06,150
okay or just you know like the most
obvious questions right and then and you

2954
00:48:06,150 --> 00:48:06,160
obvious questions right and then and you
 

2955
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:07,349
obvious questions right and then and you
know and the answer is

2956
00:48:07,349 --> 00:48:07,359
know and the answer is
 

2957
00:48:07,359 --> 00:48:09,270
know and the answer is
well it just kind of parries you because

2958
00:48:09,270 --> 00:48:09,280
well it just kind of parries you because
 

2959
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:10,390
well it just kind of parries you because
it doesn't know what you're talking

2960
00:48:10,390 --> 00:48:10,400
it doesn't know what you're talking
 

2961
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:11,190
it doesn't know what you're talking
about right

2962
00:48:11,190 --> 00:48:11,200
about right
 

2963
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:13,990
about right
so just clarify exactly in which way

2964
00:48:13,990 --> 00:48:14,000
so just clarify exactly in which way
 

2965
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,990
so just clarify exactly in which way
they're obvious they're obvious

2966
00:48:15,990 --> 00:48:16,000
they're obvious they're obvious
 

2967
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,790
they're obvious they're obvious
in the sense that you convert the

2968
00:48:18,790 --> 00:48:18,800
in the sense that you convert the
 

2969
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:19,589
in the sense that you convert the
sentences

2970
00:48:19,589 --> 00:48:19,599
sentences
 

2971
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:21,349
sentences
into the meaning of the objects they

2972
00:48:21,349 --> 00:48:21,359
into the meaning of the objects they
 

2973
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:23,670
into the meaning of the objects they
represent and then do some basic

2974
00:48:23,670 --> 00:48:23,680
represent and then do some basic
 

2975
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:25,990
represent and then do some basic
obvious we mean your common sense

2976
00:48:25,990 --> 00:48:26,000
obvious we mean your common sense
 

2977
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:26,710
obvious we mean your common sense
reasoning

2978
00:48:26,710 --> 00:48:26,720
reasoning
 

2979
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:28,230
reasoning
with the objects that the sentences

2980
00:48:28,230 --> 00:48:28,240
with the objects that the sentences
 

2981
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:30,549
with the objects that the sentences
represent uh right right it was not able

2982
00:48:30,549 --> 00:48:30,559
represent uh right right it was not able
 

2983
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:31,430

you know or even intelligently respond
 

2987
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:35,750
you know or even intelligently respond
to basic common sense questions but let

2988
00:48:35,750 --> 00:48:35,760
to basic common sense questions but let
 

2989
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:37,430
to basic common sense questions but let
me say something stronger than that

2990

would pour their hearts out
 

3003
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:50,870
would pour their hearts out
into this elisa because it simulated a

3004
00:48:50,870 --> 00:48:50,880
into this elisa because it simulated a
 

3005
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:51,670
into this elisa because it simulated a
therapist

3006
00:48:51,670 --> 00:48:51,680
therapist
 

3007
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:53,670
therapist
right and most of what it would do is it

3008
00:48:53,670 --> 00:48:53,680
right and most of what it would do is it
 

3009

right maybe you know therapists know
this this is you know one of their

3020

this this is you know one of their
 

3021
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:04,710
this this is you know one of their
tricks

3022
00:49:04,710 --> 00:49:04,720
tricks
 

3023
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:08,790
tricks
but uh it um um you know it it really

3024
00:49:08,790 --> 00:49:08,800
but uh it um um you know it it really
 

3025
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:10,630
but uh it um um you know it it really
had some people convinced

had some people convinced
 

3027
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:12,630
had some people convinced
uh but you know this this thing was just

3028
00:49:12,630 --> 00:49:12,640
uh but you know this this thing was just
 

3029
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:15,030
uh but you know this this thing was just
like i think it was literally just a few

3030
00:49:15,030 --> 00:49:15,040
like i think it was literally just a few
 

3031
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:15,990
like i think it was literally just a few
hundred lines

3032

hundred lines
 

3033
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,190
hundred lines
of lisp code right it was not only was

3034
00:49:19,190 --> 00:49:19,200
of lisp code right it was not only was
 

3035
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:20,870
of lisp code right it was not only was
it not intelligent it wasn't

3036
00:49:20,870 --> 00:49:20,880
it not intelligent it wasn't
 

3037
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:23,109
it not intelligent it wasn't
especially sophisticated it was like a

3038

especially sophisticated it was like a
 

3039
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:25,670
especially sophisticated it was like a
it was a simple little hobbyist program

3040
00:49:25,670 --> 00:49:25,680
it was a simple little hobbyist program
 

3041
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:27,910
it was a simple little hobbyist program
and eugene gusman from what i could see

3042
00:49:27,910 --> 00:49:27,920
and eugene gusman from what i could see
 

3043
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:30,470
and eugene gusman from what i could see
was not a significant advance compared

3044
00:49:30,470 --> 00:49:30,480
was not a significant advance compared
 

3045

that was
 

3051
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:36,950
that was
that was really the point i was making

3052
00:49:36,950 --> 00:49:36,960
that was really the point i was making
 

3053
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:37,910
that was really the point i was making

00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:57,030
yeah and i think that anyone who denies
that is just not engaging with what's

3256
00:52:57,030 --> 00:52:57,040
that is just not engaging with what's
 

3257
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:57,589
that is just not engaging with what's
there

3258
00:52:57,589 --> 00:52:57,599
there
 

3259
00:52:57,599 --> 00:53:01,109
there
so their model it takes a large part of

3260
00:53:01,109 --> 00:53:01,119
so their model it takes a large part of
 

3261
00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:01,829
so their model it takes a large part of
the internet

3262
00:53:01,829 --> 00:53:01,839
the internet
 

3263
00:53:01,839 --> 00:53:04,390
the internet
and compresses it in a small number of

3264
00:53:04,390 --> 00:53:04,400
and compresses it in a small number of
 

3265
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:05,190
and compresses it in a small number of
parameters

3266
00:53:05,190 --> 00:53:05,200
parameters
 

3267
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:07,910
parameters
relative to the size of the internet and

3268
00:53:07,910 --> 00:53:07,920
relative to the size of the internet and
 

3269
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:09,190
relative to the size of the internet and
is able to

3270
00:53:09,190 --> 00:53:09,200
is able to
 

3271
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:12,309
is able to
without fine-tuning uh

3272
00:53:12,309 --> 00:53:12,319
without fine-tuning uh
 

3273
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:15,670
without fine-tuning uh
do a basic kind of a quarrying mechanism

3274
00:53:15,670 --> 00:53:15,680
do a basic kind of a quarrying mechanism
 

3275
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:16,950
do a basic kind of a quarrying mechanism
just like you described where you

3276
00:53:16,950 --> 00:53:16,960
just like you described where you
 

3277
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:18,710
just like you described where you
specify a kind of poet and then

3278
00:53:18,710 --> 00:53:18,720
specify a kind of poet and then
 

3279
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:20,470
specify a kind of poet and then
you want to write a poem and somehow i

3280
00:53:20,470 --> 00:53:20,480
you want to write a poem and somehow i
 

3281
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:22,069
you want to write a poem and somehow i
was able to do basically a lookup on the

3282
00:53:22,069 --> 00:53:22,079
was able to do basically a lookup on the
 

3283
00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:22,790
was able to do basically a lookup on the
internet

3284
00:53:22,790 --> 00:53:22,800
internet
 

3285
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,710
internet
well of relevant things i mean that's

3286
00:53:24,710 --> 00:53:24,720
well of relevant things i mean that's
 

3287
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:26,470
well of relevant things i mean that's
what i mean i mean i mean

3288
00:53:26,470 --> 00:53:26,480
what i mean i mean i mean
 

3289
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:28,150
what i mean i mean i mean
how else do you explain it well okay i

3290
00:53:28,150 --> 00:53:28,160
how else do you explain it well okay i
 

3291
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:29,750
how else do you explain it well okay i
mean i mean the the training

3292
00:53:29,750 --> 00:53:29,760
mean i mean the the training
 

3293
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:31,829
mean i mean the the training
involved you know massive amounts of

3294
00:53:31,829 --> 00:53:31,839
involved you know massive amounts of
 

3295
00:53:31,839 --> 00:53:34,069
involved you know massive amounts of
data from the internet and actually took

3296
00:53:34,069 --> 00:53:34,079
data from the internet and actually took
 

3297
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:36,390
data from the internet and actually took
lots and lots of computer power lots of

3298
00:53:36,390 --> 00:53:36,400
lots and lots of computer power lots of
 

3299
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:37,349
lots and lots of computer power lots of
electricity

3300
00:53:37,349 --> 00:53:37,359
electricity
 

3301
00:53:37,359 --> 00:53:39,430
electricity
right you know there are some some very

3302
00:53:39,430 --> 00:53:39,440
right you know there are some some very
 

3303
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:41,430
right you know there are some some very
prosaic reasons why this wasn't done

3304
00:53:41,430 --> 00:53:41,440
prosaic reasons why this wasn't done
 

3305
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:41,990
prosaic reasons why this wasn't done
earlier

3306
00:53:41,990 --> 00:53:42,000
earlier
 

3307
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,470
earlier
right right but um you know it costs

3308
00:53:44,470 --> 00:53:44,480
right right but um you know it costs
 

3309
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:46,470
right right but um you know it costs
some tens of millions of dollars i think

3310
00:53:46,470 --> 00:53:46,480
some tens of millions of dollars i think
 

3311
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:47,829
some tens of millions of dollars i think
you know that's just for

3312
00:53:47,829 --> 00:53:47,839
you know that's just for
 

3313
00:53:47,839 --> 00:53:49,589
you know that's just for
approximately like a few million dollars

3314
00:53:49,589 --> 00:53:49,599
approximately like a few million dollars
 

3315
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:52,790
approximately like a few million dollars
oh okay okay oh really okay

3316
00:53:52,790 --> 00:53:52,800
oh okay okay oh really okay
 

3317
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:54,630
oh okay okay oh really okay
you know oh all right all right thank

3318
00:53:54,630 --> 00:53:54,640
you know oh all right all right thank
 

3319
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:56,870
you know oh all right all right thank
you i mean as they as they scale it up

3320
00:53:56,870 --> 00:53:56,880
you i mean as they as they scale it up
 

3321
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:57,670
you i mean as they as they scale it up
you know it will

3322
00:53:57,670 --> 00:53:57,680
you know it will
 

3323
00:53:57,680 --> 00:53:59,990
you know it will
cost but then the hope is cost comes

3324
00:53:59,990 --> 00:54:00,000
cost but then the hope is cost comes
 

3325
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,390
cost but then the hope is cost comes
down and all that kind of stuff

3326
00:54:02,390 --> 00:54:02,400
down and all that kind of stuff
 

3327
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:05,430
down and all that kind of stuff
but um basically you know it is a

3328
00:54:05,430 --> 00:54:05,440
but um basically you know it is a
 

3329
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:07,589
but um basically you know it is a
neural net you know so i mean i mean or

3330
00:54:07,589 --> 00:54:07,599
neural net you know so i mean i mean or
 

3331
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:09,430
neural net you know so i mean i mean or
what's now called a deep net but you

3332
00:54:09,430 --> 00:54:09,440
what's now called a deep net but you
 

3333
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:10,870
what's now called a deep net but you
know they're basically the same thing

3334
00:54:10,870 --> 00:54:10,880
know they're basically the same thing
 

3335
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:11,829
know they're basically the same thing
right so it's a

3336
00:54:11,829 --> 00:54:11,839
right so it's a
 

3337
00:54:11,839 --> 00:54:15,030
right so it's a
it's a form of you know uh algorithm

3338
00:54:15,030 --> 00:54:15,040
it's a form of you know uh algorithm
 

3339
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:15,589
it's a form of you know uh algorithm
that people

3340
00:54:15,589 --> 00:54:15,599
that people
 

3341
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:18,309
that people
have known about for decades right uh

3342
00:54:18,309 --> 00:54:18,319
have known about for decades right uh
 

3343
00:54:18,319 --> 00:54:18,630
have known about for decades right uh
but

3344
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:18,640
but
 

3345
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:21,030
but
it is constantly trying to solve the

3346
00:54:21,030 --> 00:54:21,040
it is constantly trying to solve the
 

3347
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:21,990
it is constantly trying to solve the
problem

3348
00:54:21,990 --> 00:54:22,000
problem
 

3349
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,710
problem
predict the next word right so it's just

3350
00:54:24,710 --> 00:54:24,720
predict the next word right so it's just
 

3351
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:27,270
predict the next word right so it's just
trying to

3352
00:54:27,270 --> 00:54:27,280
trying to
 

3353
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:29,910
trying to
predict what comes next it's not trying

3354
00:54:29,910 --> 00:54:29,920
predict what comes next it's not trying
 

3355
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:30,950
predict what comes next it's not trying
to decide

3356
00:54:30,950 --> 00:54:30,960
to decide
 

3357
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:33,430
to decide
what what it should say what ought to be

3358
00:54:33,430 --> 00:54:33,440
what what it should say what ought to be
 

3359
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:34,069
what what it should say what ought to be
true

3360
00:54:34,069 --> 00:54:34,079
true
 

3361
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:36,549
true
it's trying to predict what someone who

3362
00:54:36,549 --> 00:54:36,559
it's trying to predict what someone who
 

3363
00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:38,150
it's trying to predict what someone who
had said all of the words

3364
00:54:38,150 --> 00:54:38,160
had said all of the words
 

3365
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:40,710
had said all of the words
up to the preceding one would say next

3366
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:40,720
up to the preceding one would say next
 

3367
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:42,549
up to the preceding one would say next
although to push back on that that's how

3368
00:54:42,549 --> 00:54:42,559
although to push back on that that's how
 

3369
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:43,349
although to push back on that that's how
it's trained

3370
00:54:43,349 --> 00:54:43,359
it's trained
 

3371
00:54:43,359 --> 00:54:45,349
it's trained
but that's right no but it's arguable

3372
00:54:45,349 --> 00:54:45,359
but that's right no but it's arguable
 

3373
00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:46,710
but that's right no but it's arguable
arguable yeah

3374
00:54:46,710 --> 00:54:46,720
arguable yeah
 

3375
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:49,190
arguable yeah
that our very cognition could be a

3376
00:54:49,190 --> 00:54:49,200
that our very cognition could be a
 

3377
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:50,870
that our very cognition could be a
mechanism as that simple

3378
00:54:50,870 --> 00:54:50,880
mechanism as that simple
 

3379
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:52,630
mechanism as that simple
of course of course i never said that it

3380
00:54:52,630 --> 00:54:52,640
of course of course i never said that it
 

3381
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:54,549
of course of course i never said that it
wasn't right but right

3382
00:54:54,549 --> 00:54:54,559
wasn't right but right
 

3383
00:54:54,559 --> 00:54:56,950
wasn't right but right
but yeah i mean i mean and sometimes

3384
00:54:56,950 --> 00:54:56,960
but yeah i mean i mean and sometimes
 

3385
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:57,829
but yeah i mean i mean and sometimes
that that is

3386
00:54:57,829 --> 00:54:57,839
that that is
 

3387
00:54:57,839 --> 00:54:58,950
that that is
you know if there is a deep

3388
00:54:58,950 --> 00:54:58,960
you know if there is a deep
 

3389
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:00,870
you know if there is a deep
philosophical question that's raised by

3390
00:55:00,870 --> 00:55:00,880
philosophical question that's raised by
 

3391
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:02,870
philosophical question that's raised by
gpt3 then that is it

3392
00:55:02,870 --> 00:55:02,880
gpt3 then that is it
 

3393
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:04,789
gpt3 then that is it
right are we doing anything other than

3394
00:55:04,789 --> 00:55:04,799
right are we doing anything other than
 

3395
00:55:04,799 --> 00:55:07,190
right are we doing anything other than
you know this predictive processing just

3396
00:55:07,190 --> 00:55:07,200
you know this predictive processing just
 

3397
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:08,069
you know this predictive processing just
trying to

3398
00:55:08,069 --> 00:55:08,079
trying to
 

3399
00:55:08,079 --> 00:55:10,789
trying to
constantly trying to fill in a blank of

3400
00:55:10,789 --> 00:55:10,799
constantly trying to fill in a blank of
 

3401
00:55:10,799 --> 00:55:12,069
constantly trying to fill in a blank of
what would come next

3402
00:55:12,069 --> 00:55:12,079
what would come next
 

3403
00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:14,230
what would come next
after what we just said up to this point

3404
00:55:14,230 --> 00:55:14,240
after what we just said up to this point
 

3405
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:16,549
after what we just said up to this point
is that what i'm doing right now

3406
00:55:16,549 --> 00:55:16,559
is that what i'm doing right now
 

3407
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:19,190
is that what i'm doing right now
it's impossible so the intuition that a

3408
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:19,200
it's impossible so the intuition that a
 

3409
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:20,230
it's impossible so the intuition that a
lot of people have will

3410
00:55:20,230 --> 00:55:20,240
lot of people have will
 

3411
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:21,750
lot of people have will
look this thing is not going to be able

3412
00:55:21,750 --> 00:55:21,760
look this thing is not going to be able
 

3413
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:24,069
look this thing is not going to be able
to reason the mountain everest

3414
00:55:24,069 --> 00:55:24,079
to reason the mountain everest
 

3415
00:55:24,079 --> 00:55:26,349
to reason the mountain everest
question do you think it's possible that

3416
00:55:26,349 --> 00:55:26,359
question do you think it's possible that
 

3417
00:55:26,359 --> 00:55:27,510
question do you think it's possible that
gbt5

3418
00:55:27,510 --> 00:55:27,520
gbt5
 

3419
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:30,789
gbt5
6 and 7 would be able to with this exact

3420
00:55:30,789 --> 00:55:30,799
6 and 7 would be able to with this exact
 

3421
00:55:30,799 --> 00:55:33,589
6 and 7 would be able to with this exact
same process begin to

3422
00:55:33,589 --> 00:55:33,599
same process begin to
 

3423
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:36,390
same process begin to
do something that looks like is

3424
00:55:36,390 --> 00:55:36,400
do something that looks like is
 

3425
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:38,230
do something that looks like is
indistinguishable to us humans from

3426
00:55:38,230 --> 00:55:38,240
indistinguishable to us humans from
 

3427
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:39,430
indistinguishable to us humans from
reasoning

3428
00:55:39,430 --> 00:55:39,440
reasoning
 

3429
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:41,349
reasoning
i mean the truth is that we don't really

3430
00:55:41,349 --> 00:55:41,359
i mean the truth is that we don't really
 

3431
00:55:41,359 --> 00:55:42,710
i mean the truth is that we don't really
know what the limits are

3432
00:55:42,710 --> 00:55:42,720
know what the limits are
 

3433
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:44,789
know what the limits are
right because exactly because you know

3434
00:55:44,789 --> 00:55:44,799
right because exactly because you know
 

3435
00:55:44,799 --> 00:55:46,390
right because exactly because you know
what we've seen so far

3436
00:55:46,390 --> 00:55:46,400
what we've seen so far
 

3437
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:49,270
what we've seen so far
is that you know gbt3 was basically the

3438
00:55:49,270 --> 00:55:49,280
is that you know gbt3 was basically the
 

3439
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:51,190
is that you know gbt3 was basically the
same thing as gpt-2

3440
00:55:51,190 --> 00:55:51,200
same thing as gpt-2
 

3441
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:54,230
same thing as gpt-2
but just with you know a much larger uh

3442
00:55:54,230 --> 00:55:54,240
but just with you know a much larger uh
 

3443
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:57,750
but just with you know a much larger uh
uh network you know more training time

3444
00:55:57,750 --> 00:55:57,760
uh network you know more training time
 

3445
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:00,789
uh network you know more training time
bigger training corpus right and it was

3446
00:56:00,789 --> 00:56:00,799
bigger training corpus right and it was
 

3447
00:56:00,799 --> 00:56:03,510
bigger training corpus right and it was
you know very noticeably better right

3448
00:56:03,510 --> 00:56:03,520
you know very noticeably better right
 

3449
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:05,750
you know very noticeably better right
than its immediate predecessor

3450
00:56:05,750 --> 00:56:05,760
than its immediate predecessor
 

3451
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:08,069
than its immediate predecessor
so uh we you know we don't know where

3452
00:56:08,069 --> 00:56:08,079
so uh we you know we don't know where
 

3453
00:56:08,079 --> 00:56:09,670
so uh we you know we don't know where
you hit the ceiling here right i mean

3454
00:56:09,670 --> 00:56:09,680
you hit the ceiling here right i mean
 

3455
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:10,470
you hit the ceiling here right i mean
that's the

3456
00:56:10,470 --> 00:56:10,480
that's the
 

3457
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:12,630
that's the
that's the amazing part and maybe also

3458
00:56:12,630 --> 00:56:12,640
that's the amazing part and maybe also
 

3459
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:13,670
that's the amazing part and maybe also
the scary part

3460
00:56:13,670 --> 00:56:13,680
the scary part
 

3461
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:15,910
the scary part
right that uh you know now my guess

3462
00:56:15,910 --> 00:56:15,920
right that uh you know now my guess
 

3463
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:17,589
right that uh you know now my guess
would be that that you know at some

3464
00:56:17,589 --> 00:56:17,599
would be that that you know at some
 

3465
00:56:17,599 --> 00:56:18,390
would be that that you know at some
point

3466
00:56:18,390 --> 00:56:18,400
point
 

3467
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:20,470
point
like there has to be diminishing returns

3468
00:56:20,470 --> 00:56:20,480
like there has to be diminishing returns
 

3469
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:22,150
like there has to be diminishing returns
like it can't be that simple

3470
00:56:22,150 --> 00:56:22,160
like it can't be that simple
 

3471
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:25,510
like it can't be that simple
can it right right but i i i i wish that

3472
00:56:25,510 --> 00:56:25,520
can it right right but i i i i wish that
 

3473
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:27,589
can it right right but i i i i wish that
i had more to base that guess on

3474
00:56:27,589 --> 00:56:27,599
i had more to base that guess on
 

3475
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:29,670
i had more to base that guess on
right yeah i mean some people say that

3476
00:56:29,670 --> 00:56:29,680
right yeah i mean some people say that
 

3477
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:31,430
right yeah i mean some people say that
there will be a limitation on the

3478
00:56:31,430 --> 00:56:31,440
there will be a limitation on the
 

3479
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:33,030
there will be a limitation on the
we're going to hit a limit on the amount

3480
00:56:33,030 --> 00:56:33,040
we're going to hit a limit on the amount
 

3481
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:34,710
we're going to hit a limit on the amount
of data that's on the internet

3482
00:56:34,710 --> 00:56:34,720
of data that's on the internet
 

3483
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:36,950
of data that's on the internet
yes yeah yeah so sure so so there's

3484
00:56:36,950 --> 00:56:36,960
yes yeah yeah so sure so so there's
 

3485
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:38,470
yes yeah yeah so sure so so there's
certainly that limit

3486
00:56:38,470 --> 00:56:38,480
certainly that limit
 

3487
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:41,990
certainly that limit
i mean there's also um you know like if

3488
00:56:41,990 --> 00:56:42,000
i mean there's also um you know like if
 

3489
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,990
i mean there's also um you know like if
you are looking for questions that will

3490
00:56:43,990 --> 00:56:44,000
you are looking for questions that will
 

3491
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,470
you are looking for questions that will
stump gpt3 right you can come up with

3492
00:56:46,470 --> 00:56:46,480
stump gpt3 right you can come up with
 

3493
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:47,829
stump gpt3 right you can come up with
some without you know

3494
00:56:47,829 --> 00:56:47,839
some without you know
 

3495
00:56:47,839 --> 00:56:50,390
some without you know
like you know even getting it to learn

3496
00:56:50,390 --> 00:56:50,400
like you know even getting it to learn
 

3497
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:52,230
like you know even getting it to learn
how to balance parentheses

3498
00:56:52,230 --> 00:56:52,240
how to balance parentheses
 

3499
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:54,549
how to balance parentheses
right like it can you know it doesn't do

3500
00:56:54,549 --> 00:56:54,559
right like it can you know it doesn't do
 

3501
00:56:54,559 --> 00:56:55,750
right like it can you know it doesn't do
such a great job

3502
00:56:55,750 --> 00:56:55,760
such a great job
 

3503
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:58,470
such a great job
right uh you know like like you know and

3504
00:56:58,470 --> 00:56:58,480
right uh you know like like you know and
 

3505
00:56:58,480 --> 00:56:59,190
right uh you know like like you know and
you know and

3506
00:56:59,190 --> 00:56:59,200
you know and
 

3507
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:02,150
you know and
its failures are are are ironic right

3508
00:57:02,150 --> 00:57:02,160
its failures are are are ironic right
 

3509
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:03,910
its failures are are are ironic right
like like basic arithmetic

3510
00:57:03,910 --> 00:57:03,920
like like basic arithmetic
 

3511
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:05,829
like like basic arithmetic
right and you think you know isn't that

3512
00:57:05,829 --> 00:57:05,839
right and you think you know isn't that
 

3513
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:07,510
right and you think you know isn't that
what computers are supposed to be best

3514
00:57:07,510 --> 00:57:07,520
what computers are supposed to be best
 

3515
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:07,750
what computers are supposed to be best
at

3516
00:57:07,750 --> 00:57:07,760
at
 

3517
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:09,589
at
yeah isn't that where computers already

3518
00:57:09,589 --> 00:57:09,599
yeah isn't that where computers already
 

3519
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:12,230
yeah isn't that where computers already
had us beat a century ago yeah right

3520
00:57:12,230 --> 00:57:12,240
had us beat a century ago yeah right
 

3521
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:14,309
had us beat a century ago yeah right
and yeah and yet that's where gpt-3

3522
00:57:14,309 --> 00:57:14,319
and yeah and yet that's where gpt-3
 

3523
00:57:14,319 --> 00:57:15,829
and yeah and yet that's where gpt-3
struggles right but it's

3524
00:57:15,829 --> 00:57:15,839
struggles right but it's
 

3525
00:57:15,839 --> 00:57:17,349
struggles right but it's
it's amazing you know that it's almost

3526
00:57:17,349 --> 00:57:17,359
it's amazing you know that it's almost
 

3527
00:57:17,359 --> 00:57:19,270
it's amazing you know that it's almost
like a young child in that way

3528
00:57:19,270 --> 00:57:19,280
like a young child in that way
 

3529
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:22,309
like a young child in that way
right that uh uh um but

3530
00:57:22,309 --> 00:57:22,319
right that uh uh um but
 

3531
00:57:22,319 --> 00:57:24,710
right that uh uh um but
but uh somehow you know because it is

3532
00:57:24,710 --> 00:57:24,720
but uh somehow you know because it is
 

3533
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:26,150
but uh somehow you know because it is
just trying to predict

3534
00:57:26,150 --> 00:57:26,160
just trying to predict
 

3535
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:29,349
just trying to predict
what what uh comes next it doesn't know

3536
00:57:29,349 --> 00:57:29,359
what what uh comes next it doesn't know
 

3537
00:57:29,359 --> 00:57:30,390
what what uh comes next it doesn't know
when it should stop

3538
00:57:30,390 --> 00:57:30,400
when it should stop
 

3539
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:32,470
when it should stop
doing that and start doing something

3540
00:57:32,470 --> 00:57:32,480
doing that and start doing something
 

3541
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:33,910
doing that and start doing something
very different like some

3542
00:57:33,910 --> 00:57:33,920
very different like some
 

3543
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:36,549
very different like some
more exact logical reasoning right and

3544
00:57:36,549 --> 00:57:36,559
more exact logical reasoning right and
 

3545
00:57:36,559 --> 00:57:37,190
more exact logical reasoning right and
so

3546
00:57:37,190 --> 00:57:37,200
so
 

3547
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:40,230
so
so you know the uh uh you know you one

3548
00:57:40,230 --> 00:57:40,240
so you know the uh uh you know you one
 

3549
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:42,470
so you know the uh uh you know you one
one is naturally led to guess

3550
00:57:42,470 --> 00:57:42,480
one is naturally led to guess
 

3551
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:45,190
one is naturally led to guess
that our brain sort of has some element

3552
00:57:45,190 --> 00:57:45,200
that our brain sort of has some element
 

3553
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:46,870
that our brain sort of has some element
of predictive processing

3554
00:57:46,870 --> 00:57:46,880
of predictive processing
 

3555
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:48,390
of predictive processing
but that it's coupled to other

3556
00:57:48,390 --> 00:57:48,400
but that it's coupled to other
 

3557
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:50,630
but that it's coupled to other
mechanisms right that it's coupled to

3558
00:57:50,630 --> 00:57:50,640
mechanisms right that it's coupled to
 

3559
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:52,470
mechanisms right that it's coupled to
you know first of all visual reasoning

3560
00:57:52,470 --> 00:57:52,480
you know first of all visual reasoning
 

3561
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:54,549
you know first of all visual reasoning
which gpt3 also doesn't have

3562
00:57:54,549 --> 00:57:54,559
which gpt3 also doesn't have
 

3563
00:57:54,559 --> 00:57:55,829
which gpt3 also doesn't have
any of right although there's some

3564
00:57:55,829 --> 00:57:55,839
any of right although there's some
 

3565
00:57:55,839 --> 00:57:57,430
any of right although there's some
demonstration that there's a lot of

3566
00:57:57,430 --> 00:57:57,440
demonstration that there's a lot of
 

3567
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:58,630
demonstration that there's a lot of
promise there

3568
00:57:58,630 --> 00:57:58,640
promise there
 

3569
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:00,549
promise there
oh yeah it can complete images that's

3570
00:58:00,549 --> 00:58:00,559
oh yeah it can complete images that's
 

3571
00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:02,630
oh yeah it can complete images that's
right and using the exact same kind of

3572
00:58:02,630 --> 00:58:02,640
right and using the exact same kind of
 

3573
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:04,630
right and using the exact same kind of
transformer mechanisms to like watch

3574
00:58:04,630 --> 00:58:04,640
transformer mechanisms to like watch
 

3575
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:06,150
transformer mechanisms to like watch
videos on youtube

3576
00:58:06,150 --> 00:58:06,160
videos on youtube
 

3577
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:09,030
videos on youtube
and uh so the same uh the same

3578
00:58:09,030 --> 00:58:09,040
and uh so the same uh the same
 

3579
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:10,950
and uh so the same uh the same
self-supervised mechanism to be able to

3580
00:58:10,950 --> 00:58:10,960
self-supervised mechanism to be able to
 

3581
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:12,789
self-supervised mechanism to be able to
look it'd be fascinating to think what

3582
00:58:12,789 --> 00:58:12,799
look it'd be fascinating to think what
 

3583
00:58:12,799 --> 00:58:14,630
look it'd be fascinating to think what
kind of completions you could do oh yeah

3584
00:58:14,630 --> 00:58:14,640
kind of completions you could do oh yeah
 

3585
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:15,910
kind of completions you could do oh yeah
no absolutely although like

3586
00:58:15,910 --> 00:58:15,920
no absolutely although like
 

3587
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:18,470
no absolutely although like
if we ask it to like you know a word

3588
00:58:18,470 --> 00:58:18,480
if we ask it to like you know a word
 

3589
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:19,589
if we ask it to like you know a word
problem that involve

3590
00:58:19,589 --> 00:58:19,599
problem that involve
 

3591
00:58:19,599 --> 00:58:21,670
problem that involve
reasoning about the locations of things

3592
00:58:21,670 --> 00:58:21,680
reasoning about the locations of things
 

3593
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:23,430
reasoning about the locations of things
in space i don't think it does such a

3594
00:58:23,430 --> 00:58:23,440
in space i don't think it does such a
 

3595
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:24,549
in space i don't think it does such a
great job on those

3596
00:58:24,549 --> 00:58:24,559
great job on those
 

3597
00:58:24,559 --> 00:58:27,109
great job on those
right to take an example and so so the

3598
00:58:27,109 --> 00:58:27,119
right to take an example and so so the
 

3599
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:27,910
right to take an example and so so the
guess would be

3600
00:58:27,910 --> 00:58:27,920
guess would be
 

3601
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:29,990
guess would be
well you know humans have a lot of

3602
00:58:29,990 --> 00:58:30,000
well you know humans have a lot of
 

3603
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,829
well you know humans have a lot of
predictive processing a lot of just

3604
00:58:31,829 --> 00:58:31,839
predictive processing a lot of just
 

3605
00:58:31,839 --> 00:58:33,430
predictive processing a lot of just
filling in the blanks but we also have

3606
00:58:33,430 --> 00:58:33,440
filling in the blanks but we also have
 

3607
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:35,430
filling in the blanks but we also have
these other mechanisms that we can

3608
00:58:35,430 --> 00:58:35,440
these other mechanisms that we can
 

3609
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:37,670
these other mechanisms that we can
couple to or that we can sort of call

3610
00:58:37,670 --> 00:58:37,680
couple to or that we can sort of call
 

3611
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:39,750
couple to or that we can sort of call
the subroutines when we need to

3612
00:58:39,750 --> 00:58:39,760
the subroutines when we need to
 

3613
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:42,309
the subroutines when we need to
and that maybe maybe you know uh to go

3614
00:58:42,309 --> 00:58:42,319
and that maybe maybe you know uh to go
 

3615
00:58:42,319 --> 00:58:43,990
and that maybe maybe you know uh to go
further that one would one would want to

3616
00:58:43,990 --> 00:58:44,000
further that one would one would want to
 

3617
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,870
further that one would one would want to
integrate other forms of reasoning

3618
00:58:46,870 --> 00:58:46,880
integrate other forms of reasoning
 

3619
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:49,589
integrate other forms of reasoning
let me go on another topic that is

3620
00:58:49,589 --> 00:58:49,599
let me go on another topic that is
 

3621
00:58:49,599 --> 00:58:50,390
let me go on another topic that is
amazing

3622
00:58:50,390 --> 00:58:50,400
amazing
 

3623
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:53,670
amazing
uh which is complexity uh

3624
00:58:53,670 --> 00:58:53,680
uh which is complexity uh
 

3625
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:57,270
uh which is complexity uh
what uh and then start with the most

3626
00:58:57,270 --> 00:58:57,280
what uh and then start with the most
 

3627
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:59,349
what uh and then start with the most
absurdly romantic question of what's the

3628
00:58:59,349 --> 00:58:59,359
absurdly romantic question of what's the
 

3629
00:58:59,359 --> 00:59:00,630
absurdly romantic question of what's the
most beautiful idea in

3630
00:59:00,630 --> 00:59:00,640
most beautiful idea in
 

3631
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:02,470
most beautiful idea in
computer science or theoretical computer

3632
00:59:02,470 --> 00:59:02,480
computer science or theoretical computer
 

3633
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:04,870
computer science or theoretical computer
science to you like what just

3634
00:59:04,870 --> 00:59:04,880
science to you like what just
 

3635
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:06,470
science to you like what just
early on in your life or in general i've

3636
00:59:06,470 --> 00:59:06,480
early on in your life or in general i've
 

3637
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:08,549
early on in your life or in general i've
captivated you and just grabbed you

3638
00:59:08,549 --> 00:59:08,559
captivated you and just grabbed you
 

3639
00:59:08,559 --> 00:59:10,309
captivated you and just grabbed you
i think i'm gonna have to go with the

3640
00:59:10,309 --> 00:59:10,319
i think i'm gonna have to go with the
 

3641
00:59:10,319 --> 00:59:12,309
i think i'm gonna have to go with the
idea of universality

3642
00:59:12,309 --> 00:59:12,319
idea of universality
 

3643
00:59:12,319 --> 00:59:14,309
idea of universality
uh you know if you're really asking for

3644
00:59:14,309 --> 00:59:14,319
uh you know if you're really asking for
 

3645
00:59:14,319 --> 00:59:15,589
uh you know if you're really asking for
the most beautiful

3646
00:59:15,589 --> 00:59:15,599
the most beautiful
 

3647
00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:18,630
the most beautiful
i mean uh so universality

3648
00:59:18,630 --> 00:59:18,640
i mean uh so universality
 

3649
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:20,710
i mean uh so universality
uh is the idea that you know you put

3650
00:59:20,710 --> 00:59:20,720
uh is the idea that you know you put
 

3651
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:21,829
uh is the idea that you know you put
together a few

3652
00:59:21,829 --> 00:59:21,839
together a few
 

3653
00:59:21,839 --> 00:59:25,430
together a few
simple operations like in the case of

3654
00:59:25,430 --> 00:59:25,440
simple operations like in the case of
 

3655
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:28,150
simple operations like in the case of
boolean logic that might be the and gate

3656
00:59:28,150 --> 00:59:28,160
boolean logic that might be the and gate
 

3657
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:30,630
boolean logic that might be the and gate
the or gate the not gate right and then

3658
00:59:30,630 --> 00:59:30,640
the or gate the not gate right and then
 

3659
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:31,190
the or gate the not gate right and then
your first

3660
00:59:31,190 --> 00:59:31,200
your first
 

3661
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:34,150
your first
guess is okay this is a good start but

3662
00:59:34,150 --> 00:59:34,160
guess is okay this is a good start but
 

3663
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:35,109
guess is okay this is a good start but
obviously

3664
00:59:35,109 --> 00:59:35,119
obviously
 

3665
00:59:35,119 --> 00:59:37,109
obviously
as i want to do more complicated things

3666
00:59:37,109 --> 00:59:37,119
as i want to do more complicated things
 

3667
00:59:37,119 --> 00:59:38,630
as i want to do more complicated things
i'm going to need more complicated

3668
00:59:38,630 --> 00:59:38,640
i'm going to need more complicated
 

3669
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:40,710
i'm going to need more complicated
building blocks to express that

3670
00:59:40,710 --> 00:59:40,720
building blocks to express that
 

3671
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:42,950
building blocks to express that
right and and that was actually my guess

3672
00:59:42,950 --> 00:59:42,960
right and and that was actually my guess
 

3673
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:44,710
right and and that was actually my guess
when i first learned what programming

3674
00:59:44,710 --> 00:59:44,720
when i first learned what programming
 

3675
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:45,109
when i first learned what programming
was

3676
00:59:45,109 --> 00:59:45,119
was
 

3677
00:59:45,119 --> 00:59:47,270
was
i mean when i was you know an adolescent

3678
00:59:47,270 --> 00:59:47,280
i mean when i was you know an adolescent
 

3679
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:48,870
i mean when i was you know an adolescent
and i someone showed me

3680
00:59:48,870 --> 00:59:48,880
and i someone showed me
 

3681
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:51,990
and i someone showed me
uh uh apple basic and then you know

3682
00:59:51,990 --> 00:59:52,000
uh uh apple basic and then you know
 

3683
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:55,589
uh uh apple basic and then you know
uh gw basic if any any anyone listening

3684
00:59:55,589 --> 00:59:55,599
uh gw basic if any any anyone listening
 

3685
00:59:55,599 --> 00:59:56,710
uh gw basic if any any anyone listening
remembers that

3686
00:59:56,710 --> 00:59:56,720
remembers that
 

3687
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:58,789
remembers that
okay but uh you know i thought okay well

3688
00:59:58,789 --> 00:59:58,799
okay but uh you know i thought okay well
 

3689
00:59:58,799 --> 00:59:59,990
okay but uh you know i thought okay well
now you know i mean i

3690
00:59:59,990 --> 01:00:00,000
now you know i mean i
 

3691
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,710
now you know i mean i
i thought i felt like um this is a

3692
01:00:02,710 --> 01:00:02,720
i thought i felt like um this is a
 

3693
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:04,549
i thought i felt like um this is a
revelation you know it's like

3694
01:00:04,549 --> 01:00:04,559
revelation you know it's like
 

3695
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:06,309
revelation you know it's like
finding out where babies come from it's

3696
01:00:06,309 --> 01:00:06,319
finding out where babies come from it's
 

3697
01:00:06,319 --> 01:00:07,990
finding out where babies come from it's
like that level of you know why didn't

3698
01:00:07,990 --> 01:00:08,000
like that level of you know why didn't
 

3699
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,589
like that level of you know why didn't
anyone tell me this before

3700
01:00:09,589 --> 01:00:09,599
anyone tell me this before
 

3701
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:11,430
anyone tell me this before
right but i thought okay this is just

3702
01:00:11,430 --> 01:00:11,440
right but i thought okay this is just
 

3703
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:13,270
right but i thought okay this is just
the beginning now i know how to write a

3704
01:00:13,270 --> 01:00:13,280
the beginning now i know how to write a
 

3705
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:14,630
the beginning now i know how to write a
basic program

3706
01:00:14,630 --> 01:00:14,640
basic program
 

3707
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:16,789
basic program
but to you know really write a an

3708
01:00:16,789 --> 01:00:16,799
but to you know really write a an
 

3709
01:00:16,799 --> 01:00:18,789
but to you know really write a an
interesting program like a you know a

3710
01:00:18,789 --> 01:00:18,799
interesting program like a you know a
 

3711
01:00:18,799 --> 01:00:20,789
interesting program like a you know a
video game which had always been my my

3712
01:00:20,789 --> 01:00:20,799
video game which had always been my my
 

3713
01:00:20,799 --> 01:00:22,549
video game which had always been my my
dream as a kid to you know

3714
01:00:22,549 --> 01:00:22,559
dream as a kid to you know
 

3715
01:00:22,559 --> 01:00:24,870
dream as a kid to you know
create my own nintendo games right that

3716
01:00:24,870 --> 01:00:24,880
create my own nintendo games right that
 

3717
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:25,829
create my own nintendo games right that
you know but

3718
01:00:25,829 --> 01:00:25,839
you know but
 

3719
01:00:25,839 --> 01:00:27,589
you know but
you know obviously i'm going to need to

3720
01:00:27,589 --> 01:00:27,599
you know obviously i'm going to need to
 

3721
01:00:27,599 --> 01:00:29,829
you know obviously i'm going to need to
learn some way more complicated form of

3722
01:00:29,829 --> 01:00:29,839
learn some way more complicated form of
 

3723
01:00:29,839 --> 01:00:31,109
learn some way more complicated form of
programming than that

3724
01:00:31,109 --> 01:00:31,119
programming than that
 

3725
01:00:31,119 --> 01:00:34,069
programming than that
okay but you know eventually i learned

3726
01:00:34,069 --> 01:00:34,079
okay but you know eventually i learned
 

3727
01:00:34,079 --> 01:00:36,870
okay but you know eventually i learned
this incredible idea of universality

3728
01:00:36,870 --> 01:00:36,880
this incredible idea of universality
 

3729
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:39,829
this incredible idea of universality
and that says that no you throw in a few

3730
01:00:39,829 --> 01:00:39,839
and that says that no you throw in a few
 

3731
01:00:39,839 --> 01:00:40,390
and that says that no you throw in a few
rules

3732
01:00:40,390 --> 01:00:40,400
rules
 

3733
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:42,710
rules
and then you can you already have enough

3734
01:00:42,710 --> 01:00:42,720
and then you can you already have enough
 

3735
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:43,430
and then you can you already have enough
to express

3736
01:00:43,430 --> 01:00:43,440
to express
 

3737
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:46,470
to express
everything okay so for example the and

3738
01:00:46,470 --> 01:00:46,480
everything okay so for example the and
 

3739
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:47,670
everything okay so for example the and
the or and the not

3740
01:00:47,670 --> 01:00:47,680
the or and the not
 

3741
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:50,309
the or and the not
gate uh can all or in fact even just the

3742
01:00:50,309 --> 01:00:50,319
gate uh can all or in fact even just the
 

3743
01:00:50,319 --> 01:00:51,109
gate uh can all or in fact even just the
and in the not

3744
01:00:51,109 --> 01:00:51,119
and in the not
 

3745
01:00:51,119 --> 01:00:53,510
and in the not
gate or even just even just the nand

3746
01:00:53,510 --> 01:00:53,520
gate or even just even just the nand
 

3747
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:54,789
gate or even just even just the nand
gate for example

3748
01:00:54,789 --> 01:00:54,799
gate for example
 

3749
01:00:54,799 --> 01:00:57,109
gate for example
uh is already enough to express any

3750
01:00:57,109 --> 01:00:57,119
uh is already enough to express any
 

3751
01:00:57,119 --> 01:00:58,150
uh is already enough to express any
boolean function

3752
01:00:58,150 --> 01:00:58,160
boolean function
 

3753
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:00,230
boolean function
on any number of bits you just have to

3754
01:01:00,230 --> 01:01:00,240
on any number of bits you just have to
 

3755
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:01,670
on any number of bits you just have to
string together enough of them because

3756
01:01:01,670 --> 01:01:01,680
string together enough of them because
 

3757
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:03,430
string together enough of them because
you can build a universe with nand gates

3758
01:01:03,430 --> 01:01:03,440
you can build a universe with nand gates
 

3759
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:05,109
you can build a universe with nand gates
you can build the universe out of nand

3760
01:01:05,109 --> 01:01:05,119
you can build the universe out of nand
 

3761
01:01:05,119 --> 01:01:05,990
you can build the universe out of nand
gates yeah

3762
01:01:05,990 --> 01:01:06,000
gates yeah
 

3763
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,470
gates yeah
uh you know the the simple instructions

3764
01:01:08,470 --> 01:01:08,480
uh you know the the simple instructions
 

3765
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:09,270
uh you know the the simple instructions
of basic

3766
01:01:09,270 --> 01:01:09,280
of basic
 

3767
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:12,630

are already enough at least in principle

3768
01:01:12,630 --> 01:01:12,640
are already enough at least in principle
 

3769
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:14,789
are already enough at least in principle
you know if we ignore details like how

3770
01:01:14,789 --> 01:01:14,799
you know if we ignore details like how
 

3771
01:01:14,799 --> 01:01:17,109
you know if we ignore details like how
much memory can be accessed and stuff

01:01:17,829 --> 01:01:17,839
like that
 

3775
01:01:17,839 --> 01:01:19,750
like that
that is enough to express what could be

3776
01:01:19,750 --> 01:01:19,760
that is enough to express what could be
 

3777
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:21,750
that is enough to express what could be
expressed by any programming language

3778

and the way to prove that is very simple

3782
01:01:25,109 --> 01:01:25,119
and the way to prove that is very simple
 

3783
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:26,630
and the way to prove that is very simple
we simply need to show

3784
01:01:26,630 --> 01:01:26,640
we simply need to show
 

3785
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:29,270
we simply need to show
that in basic or whatever we could write

3786
01:01:29,270 --> 01:01:29,280
that in basic or whatever we could write
 

3787
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:29,670

01:01:35,109 --> 01:01:35,119
other programming language we care about
 

3795
01:01:35,119 --> 01:01:36,230
other programming language we care about
like c or

3796
01:01:36,230 --> 01:01:36,240
like c or
 

3797
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:38,309
like c or
or java or whatever and as soon as we

3798
01:01:38,309 --> 01:01:38,319
or java or whatever and as soon as we
 

3799
01:01:38,319 --> 01:01:40,710
or java or whatever and as soon as we
had done that then ipso facto

3800
01:01:40,710 --> 01:01:40,720
had done that then ipso facto
 

3801
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:43,430
had done that then ipso facto
anything that's expressible in c or java

3802
01:01:43,430 --> 01:01:43,440
anything that's expressible in c or java
 

3803
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:45,670
anything that's expressible in c or java
is also expressible and basic

3804
01:01:45,670 --> 01:01:45,680
is also expressible and basic
 

3805
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:49,589
is also expressible and basic
okay and so this idea of universality

3806
01:01:49,589 --> 01:01:49,599
okay and so this idea of universality
 

3807
01:01:49,599 --> 01:01:51,990
okay and so this idea of universality
you know goes back at least to alan

3808
01:01:51,990 --> 01:01:52,000
you know goes back at least to alan

01:02:04,870 --> 01:02:04,880
right which uh you know he pared down
 

3821
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:06,069
right which uh you know he pared down
the instruction set

to just read a symbol you know go to
 

3825
01:02:09,599 --> 01:02:12,230
to just read a symbol you know go to
write a symbol move to the left move to

uh halt change your internal state right

3830
01:02:15,990 --> 01:02:16,000
uh halt change your internal state right
 

3831
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:16,950
uh halt change your internal state right
that's it

3832
01:02:16,950 --> 01:02:16,960
that's it
 

3833
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:20,230
that's it
okay and anybody proved that um

3834
01:02:20,230 --> 01:02:20,240
okay and anybody proved that um
 

3835
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:22,309
okay and anybody proved that um
you know this could simulate all kinds

3836

uh you know and so so in fact today we
 

3841
01:02:26,079 --> 01:02:26,950
uh you know and so so in fact today we
would say

3842
01:02:26,950 --> 01:02:26,960
would say
 

3843
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:28,470
would say
well we would call it a touring

3844
01:02:28,470 --> 01:02:28,480
well we would call it a touring
 

3845
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:30,789

01:03:25,190 --> 01:03:25,200
what that felt like uh you know learning
 

3899
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:26,789
what that felt like uh you know learning
that there's no santa claus or something

3900
01:03:26,789 --> 01:03:26,799
that there's no santa claus or something
 

3901
01:03:26,799 --> 01:03:28,150
that there's no santa claus or something
uh

3902
01:03:28,150 --> 01:03:28,160
uh
 

3903
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:29,990
uh
uh because i i don't know if that's

3904
01:03:29,990 --> 01:03:30,000
uh because i i don't know if that's
 

3905
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,630
uh because i i don't know if that's
empowering or paralyzing

3906
01:03:32,630 --> 01:03:32,640
empowering or paralyzing
 

3907
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:34,789
empowering or paralyzing
because it it doesn't uh give you any

3908
01:03:34,789 --> 01:03:34,799
because it it doesn't uh give you any
 

3909
01:03:34,799 --> 01:03:35,910
because it it doesn't uh give you any
ins it's uh

3910
01:03:35,910 --> 01:03:35,920
ins it's uh
 

3911
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:37,190
ins it's uh
like you can't write a software

3912
01:03:37,190 --> 01:03:37,200
like you can't write a software
 

3913
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:38,950
like you can't write a software
engineering book and make that

3914
01:03:38,950 --> 01:03:38,960
engineering book and make that
 

3915
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:41,109
engineering book and make that
the first chapter and say we're done

3916
01:03:41,109 --> 01:03:41,119
the first chapter and say we're done
 

3917
01:03:41,119 --> 01:03:43,029
the first chapter and say we're done
well i mean i mean right i mean i mean

3918
01:03:43,029 --> 01:03:43,039
well i mean i mean right i mean i mean
 

3919
01:03:43,039 --> 01:03:45,190
well i mean i mean right i mean i mean
in one sense it was this enormous

3920
01:03:45,190 --> 01:03:45,200
in one sense it was this enormous
 

3921
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:46,950
in one sense it was this enormous
flattening of the universe

3922
01:03:46,950 --> 01:03:46,960
flattening of the universe
 

3923
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:48,950
flattening of the universe
yes right i had imagined that there was

3924
01:03:48,950 --> 01:03:48,960
yes right i had imagined that there was
 

3925
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:51,270
yes right i had imagined that there was
going to be some infinite hierarchy

3926
01:03:51,270 --> 01:03:51,280
going to be some infinite hierarchy
 

3927
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:53,510
going to be some infinite hierarchy
of more and more powerful programming

3928
01:03:53,510 --> 01:03:53,520
of more and more powerful programming
 

3929
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:54,470
of more and more powerful programming
languages

3930
01:03:54,470 --> 01:03:54,480
languages
 

3931
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:56,150
languages
you know and then i kicked myself for

3932
01:03:56,150 --> 01:03:56,160
you know and then i kicked myself for
 

3933
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:57,990
you know and then i kicked myself for
you know for having such a stupid idea

3934
01:03:57,990 --> 01:03:58,000
you know for having such a stupid idea
 

3935
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,150
you know for having such a stupid idea
but apparently girdle had had the same

3936
01:04:00,150 --> 01:04:00,160
but apparently girdle had had the same
 

3937
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:01,990
but apparently girdle had had the same
conjecture in the 30s

3938
01:04:01,990 --> 01:04:02,000
conjecture in the 30s
 

3939
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,510
conjecture in the 30s
and then you know you're in good company

3940
01:04:03,510 --> 01:04:03,520
and then you know you're in good company
 

3941
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:05,430
and then you know you're in good company
well yeah and then and then and then

3942
01:04:05,430 --> 01:04:05,440
well yeah and then and then and then
 

3943
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:05,829
well yeah and then and then and then
tori

3944
01:04:05,829 --> 01:04:05,839
tori
 

3945
01:04:05,839 --> 01:04:08,069
tori
and then girdle read toring's paper and

3946
01:04:08,069 --> 01:04:08,079
and then girdle read toring's paper and
 

3947
01:04:08,079 --> 01:04:09,589
and then girdle read toring's paper and
he kicked himself and he said yeah i was

3948
01:04:09,589 --> 01:04:09,599
he kicked himself and he said yeah i was
 

3949
01:04:09,599 --> 01:04:11,109
he kicked himself and he said yeah i was
completely wrong about that

3950
01:04:11,109 --> 01:04:11,119
completely wrong about that
 

3951
01:04:11,119 --> 01:04:13,510
completely wrong about that
okay but um but you know i had thought

3952
01:04:13,510 --> 01:04:13,520
okay but um but you know i had thought
 

3953
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:14,150
okay but um but you know i had thought
that you know

3954
01:04:14,150 --> 01:04:14,160
that you know
 

3955
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:16,549
that you know
maybe maybe where i can contribute will

3956
01:04:16,549 --> 01:04:16,559
maybe maybe where i can contribute will
 

3957
01:04:16,559 --> 01:04:18,630
maybe maybe where i can contribute will
be to invent a new more powerful

3958
01:04:18,630 --> 01:04:18,640
be to invent a new more powerful
 

3959
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:19,990
be to invent a new more powerful
programming language

3960
01:04:19,990 --> 01:04:20,000
programming language
 

3961
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,750
programming language
that lets you express things that could

3962
01:04:21,750 --> 01:04:21,760
that lets you express things that could
 

3963
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:23,589
that lets you express things that could
never be expressed in basic

3964
01:04:23,589 --> 01:04:23,599
never be expressed in basic
 

3965
01:04:23,599 --> 01:04:24,950
never be expressed in basic
yeah right and you know and then you

3966
01:04:24,950 --> 01:04:24,960
yeah right and you know and then you
 

3967
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:26,630
yeah right and you know and then you
know how would you do that obviously you

3968
01:04:26,630 --> 01:04:26,640
know how would you do that obviously you
 

3969
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:28,309
know how would you do that obviously you
couldn't do it itself in basic

3970
01:04:28,309 --> 01:04:28,319
couldn't do it itself in basic
 

3971
01:04:28,319 --> 01:04:30,870
couldn't do it itself in basic
right but uh uh but you know there is

3972
01:04:30,870 --> 01:04:30,880
right but uh uh but you know there is
 

3973
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:31,910
right but uh uh but you know there is
this incredible

3974
01:04:31,910 --> 01:04:31,920
this incredible
 

3975
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:33,750
this incredible
flattening that happens once you learn

3976
01:04:33,750 --> 01:04:33,760
flattening that happens once you learn
 

3977
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:35,349
flattening that happens once you learn
what is universality

3978
01:04:35,349 --> 01:04:35,359
what is universality
 

3979
01:04:35,359 --> 01:04:38,549
what is universality
but then it's also um uh like

3980
01:04:38,549 --> 01:04:38,559
but then it's also um uh like
 

3981
01:04:38,559 --> 01:04:41,029
but then it's also um uh like
um an opportunity because it means once

3982
01:04:41,029 --> 01:04:41,039
um an opportunity because it means once
 

3983
01:04:41,039 --> 01:04:42,549
um an opportunity because it means once
you know these rules

3984
01:04:42,549 --> 01:04:42,559
you know these rules
 

3985
01:04:42,559 --> 01:04:44,789
you know these rules
then you know the sky is the limit right

3986
01:04:44,789 --> 01:04:44,799
then you know the sky is the limit right
 

3987
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:47,190
then you know the sky is the limit right
then you have kind of the same

3988
01:04:47,190 --> 01:04:47,200
then you have kind of the same
 

3989
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:49,430
then you have kind of the same
weapons at your disposal that the

3990
01:04:49,430 --> 01:04:49,440
weapons at your disposal that the
 

3991
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:51,510
weapons at your disposal that the
world's greatest programmer has

3992
01:04:51,510 --> 01:04:51,520
world's greatest programmer has
 

3993
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:53,510
world's greatest programmer has
it's now all just a question of how you

3994
01:04:53,510 --> 01:04:53,520
it's now all just a question of how you
 

3995
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:54,630
it's now all just a question of how you
wield them right

3996
01:04:54,630 --> 01:04:54,640
wield them right
 

3997
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:57,750
wield them right
exactly but so every problem is

3998
01:04:57,750 --> 01:04:57,760
exactly but so every problem is
 

3999
01:04:57,760 --> 01:04:59,990
exactly but so every problem is
solvable but some problems are harder

4000
01:04:59,990 --> 01:05:00,000
solvable but some problems are harder
 

4001
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:00,789
solvable but some problems are harder
than others

4002
01:05:00,789 --> 01:05:00,799
than others
 

4003
01:05:00,799 --> 01:05:02,630
than others
and well yeah there's the question of

4004
01:05:02,630 --> 01:05:02,640
and well yeah there's the question of
 

4005
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:04,309
and well yeah there's the question of
how much time you know

4006
01:05:04,309 --> 01:05:04,319
how much time you know
 

4007
01:05:04,319 --> 01:05:06,150
how much time you know
well of how hard is it to write a

4008
01:05:06,150 --> 01:05:06,160
well of how hard is it to write a
 

4009
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:07,910
well of how hard is it to write a
program and then there's also the

4010
01:05:07,910 --> 01:05:07,920
program and then there's also the
 

4011
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:08,789
program and then there's also the
questions of

4012
01:05:08,789 --> 01:05:08,799
questions of
 

4013
01:05:08,799 --> 01:05:11,190
questions of
what resources does the program need you

4014
01:05:11,190 --> 01:05:11,200
what resources does the program need you
 

4015
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:13,190
what resources does the program need you
know how much time how much memory

4016
01:05:13,190 --> 01:05:13,200
know how much time how much memory
 

4017
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:14,630
know how much time how much memory
those are much more complicated

4018
01:05:14,630 --> 01:05:14,640
those are much more complicated
 

4019
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:15,910
those are much more complicated
questions of course ones that we're

4020
01:05:15,910 --> 01:05:15,920
questions of course ones that we're
 

4021
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:17,349
questions of course ones that we're
still struggling with today

4022
01:05:17,349 --> 01:05:17,359
still struggling with today
 

4023
01:05:17,359 --> 01:05:19,430
still struggling with today
exactly so you've uh i don't know if you

4024
01:05:19,430 --> 01:05:19,440
exactly so you've uh i don't know if you
 

4025
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:21,190
exactly so you've uh i don't know if you
created complexity zoo or

4026
01:05:21,190 --> 01:05:21,200
created complexity zoo or
 

4027
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:23,510
created complexity zoo or
i did create the complexity zoo what is

4028
01:05:23,510 --> 01:05:23,520
i did create the complexity zoo what is
 

4029
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:24,950
i did create the complexity zoo what is
it what's complexity

4030
01:05:24,950 --> 01:05:24,960
it what's complexity
 

4031
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:27,589
it what's complexity
oh all right all right complexity theory

4032
01:05:27,589 --> 01:05:27,599
oh all right all right complexity theory
 

4033
01:05:27,599 --> 01:05:28,870
oh all right all right complexity theory
is the study of

4034
01:05:28,870 --> 01:05:28,880
is the study of
 

4035
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:31,910
is the study of
sort of the inherent resources needed to

4036
01:05:31,910 --> 01:05:31,920
sort of the inherent resources needed to
 

4037
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:32,390
sort of the inherent resources needed to
solve

4038
01:05:32,390 --> 01:05:32,400
solve
 

4039
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:36,150
solve
uh computational problems okay so uh uh

4040
01:05:36,150 --> 01:05:36,160
uh computational problems okay so uh uh
 

4041
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:39,190
uh computational problems okay so uh uh
it's easiest to give an example uh like

4042
01:05:39,190 --> 01:05:39,200
it's easiest to give an example uh like
 

4043
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:42,470
it's easiest to give an example uh like
uh let's say we want to um um add two

4044
01:05:42,470 --> 01:05:42,480
uh let's say we want to um um add two
 

4045
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:45,109
uh let's say we want to um um add two
two numbers right if i want to add them

4046
01:05:45,109 --> 01:05:45,119
two numbers right if i want to add them
 

4047
01:05:45,119 --> 01:05:45,589
two numbers right if i want to add them
uh

4048
01:05:45,589 --> 01:05:45,599
uh
 

4049
01:05:45,599 --> 01:05:47,750
uh
um you know if the numbers are twice as

4050
01:05:47,750 --> 01:05:47,760
um you know if the numbers are twice as
 

4051
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:48,950
um you know if the numbers are twice as
long then it only

4052
01:05:48,950 --> 01:05:48,960
long then it only
 

4053
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:50,789
long then it only
it will take me twice as long to add

4054
01:05:50,789 --> 01:05:50,799
it will take me twice as long to add
 

4055
01:05:50,799 --> 01:05:52,549
it will take me twice as long to add
them but only twice as long

4056
01:05:52,549 --> 01:05:52,559
them but only twice as long
 

4057
01:05:52,559 --> 01:05:55,670
them but only twice as long
right it's no worse than that for a

4058
01:05:55,670 --> 01:05:55,680
right it's no worse than that for a
 

4059
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:56,630
right it's no worse than that for a
computer or

4060
01:05:56,630 --> 01:05:56,640
computer or
 

4061
01:05:56,640 --> 01:05:58,230
computer or
or for a person we're using pencil and

4062
01:05:58,230 --> 01:05:58,240
or for a person we're using pencil and
 

4063
01:05:58,240 --> 01:05:59,750
or for a person we're using pencil and
paper for that matter if you have a good

4064
01:05:59,750 --> 01:05:59,760
paper for that matter if you have a good
 

4065
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:00,390
paper for that matter if you have a good
algorithm

4066
01:06:00,390 --> 01:06:00,400
algorithm
 

4067
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:02,069
algorithm
yeah that's right i mean even if you

4068
01:06:02,069 --> 01:06:02,079
yeah that's right i mean even if you
 

4069
01:06:02,079 --> 01:06:03,670
yeah that's right i mean even if you
just if you just use the elementary

4070
01:06:03,670 --> 01:06:03,680
just if you just use the elementary
 

4071
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:04,069
just if you just use the elementary
school

4072
01:06:04,069 --> 01:06:04,079
school
 

4073
01:06:04,079 --> 01:06:06,390
school
algorithm of just carrying you know then

4074
01:06:06,390 --> 01:06:06,400
algorithm of just carrying you know then
 

4075
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:08,789
algorithm of just carrying you know then
it it takes time that is linear in the

4076
01:06:08,789 --> 01:06:08,799
it it takes time that is linear in the
 

4077
01:06:08,799 --> 01:06:09,829
it it takes time that is linear in the
length of the numbers

4078
01:06:09,829 --> 01:06:09,839
length of the numbers
 

4079
01:06:09,839 --> 01:06:12,549
length of the numbers
right now multiplication if you use the

4080
01:06:12,549 --> 01:06:12,559
right now multiplication if you use the
 

4081
01:06:12,559 --> 01:06:14,150
right now multiplication if you use the
elementary school algorithm

4082
01:06:14,150 --> 01:06:14,160
elementary school algorithm
 

4083
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:17,109
elementary school algorithm
is harder because you have to multiply

4084
01:06:17,109 --> 01:06:17,119
is harder because you have to multiply
 

4085
01:06:17,119 --> 01:06:19,190
is harder because you have to multiply
each digit of the first number by each

4086
01:06:19,190 --> 01:06:19,200
each digit of the first number by each
 

4087
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:20,710
each digit of the first number by each
digit of the second one

4088
01:06:20,710 --> 01:06:20,720
digit of the second one
 

4089
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:22,789
digit of the second one
yeah and then deal with all the carries

4090
01:06:22,789 --> 01:06:22,799
yeah and then deal with all the carries
 

4091
01:06:22,799 --> 01:06:25,109
yeah and then deal with all the carries
so that's what we call a quadratic time

4092
01:06:25,109 --> 01:06:25,119
so that's what we call a quadratic time
 

4093
01:06:25,119 --> 01:06:28,309
so that's what we call a quadratic time
algorithm right if um the numbers become

4094
01:06:28,309 --> 01:06:28,319
algorithm right if um the numbers become
 

4095
01:06:28,319 --> 01:06:30,390
algorithm right if um the numbers become
twice as long now you need four times as

4096
01:06:30,390 --> 01:06:30,400
twice as long now you need four times as
 

4097
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:31,349
twice as long now you need four times as
much time

4098
01:06:31,349 --> 01:06:31,359
much time
 

4099
01:06:31,359 --> 01:06:35,349
much time
okay so now as it turns out we

4100
01:06:35,349 --> 01:06:35,359
okay so now as it turns out we
 

4101
01:06:35,359 --> 01:06:39,029
okay so now as it turns out we
uh people discovered much faster ways to

4102
01:06:39,029 --> 01:06:39,039
uh people discovered much faster ways to
 

4103
01:06:39,039 --> 01:06:41,589
uh people discovered much faster ways to
multiply numbers using computers

4104
01:06:41,589 --> 01:06:41,599
multiply numbers using computers
 

4105
01:06:41,599 --> 01:06:44,549
multiply numbers using computers
and today we know how to multiply two

4106
01:06:44,549 --> 01:06:44,559
and today we know how to multiply two
 

4107
01:06:44,559 --> 01:06:46,870
and today we know how to multiply two
numbers that are n digits long

4108
01:06:46,870 --> 01:06:46,880
numbers that are n digits long
 

4109
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:48,870
numbers that are n digits long
using a number of steps that's nearly

4110
01:06:48,870 --> 01:06:48,880
using a number of steps that's nearly
 

4111
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:49,990
using a number of steps that's nearly
linear in n

4112
01:06:49,990 --> 01:06:50,000
linear in n
 

4113
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,150
linear in n
these are questions you can ask but now

4114
01:06:52,150 --> 01:06:52,160
these are questions you can ask but now
 

4115
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:53,829
these are questions you can ask but now
let's think about a different thing that

4116
01:06:53,829 --> 01:06:53,839
let's think about a different thing that
 

4117
01:06:53,839 --> 01:06:54,309
let's think about a different thing that
people

4118
01:06:54,309 --> 01:06:54,319
people
 

4119
01:06:54,319 --> 01:06:56,390
people
uh you know they've encountered in

4120
01:06:56,390 --> 01:06:56,400
uh you know they've encountered in
 

4121
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:58,789
uh you know they've encountered in
elementary school uh factoring a number

4122
01:06:58,789 --> 01:06:58,799
elementary school uh factoring a number
 

4123
01:06:58,799 --> 01:07:01,589
elementary school uh factoring a number
okay take a number and find its prime

4124
01:07:01,589 --> 01:07:01,599
okay take a number and find its prime
 

4125
01:07:01,599 --> 01:07:02,470
okay take a number and find its prime
factors

4126
01:07:02,470 --> 01:07:02,480
factors
 

4127
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:04,630
factors
right and here you know if i give you a

4128
01:07:04,630 --> 01:07:04,640
right and here you know if i give you a
 

4129
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:06,390
right and here you know if i give you a
number with 10 digits

4130
01:07:06,390 --> 01:07:06,400
number with 10 digits
 

4131
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:08,950
number with 10 digits
i ask you for its prime factors well

4132
01:07:08,950 --> 01:07:08,960
i ask you for its prime factors well
 

4133
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:11,029
i ask you for its prime factors well
maybe it's even so you know that two is

4134
01:07:11,029 --> 01:07:11,039
maybe it's even so you know that two is
 

4135
01:07:11,039 --> 01:07:11,750
maybe it's even so you know that two is
a factor

4136
01:07:11,750 --> 01:07:11,760
a factor
 

4137
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:13,990
a factor
you know maybe it ends in zero so you

4138
01:07:13,990 --> 01:07:14,000
you know maybe it ends in zero so you
 

4139
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,230
you know maybe it ends in zero so you
know that ten is a factor right but

4140
01:07:16,230 --> 01:07:16,240
know that ten is a factor right but
 

4141
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:18,230
know that ten is a factor right but
you know other than a few obvious things

4142
01:07:18,230 --> 01:07:18,240
you know other than a few obvious things
 

4143
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:19,510
you know other than a few obvious things
like that you know if

4144
01:07:19,510 --> 01:07:19,520
like that you know if
 

4145
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:21,990
like that you know if
the prime factors are all very large

4146
01:07:21,990 --> 01:07:22,000
the prime factors are all very large
 

4147
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:23,670
the prime factors are all very large
then it's not clear how you even get

4148
01:07:23,670 --> 01:07:23,680
then it's not clear how you even get
 

4149

right you know you it seems like you

4152
01:07:26,309 --> 01:07:26,319
right you know you it seems like you
 

4153
01:07:26,319 --> 01:07:27,990
right you know you it seems like you
have to do an exhaustive search

4154
01:07:27,990 --> 01:07:28,000
have to do an exhaustive search
 

4155
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:31,109
have to do an exhaustive search
among an enormous number of factors now

among an enormous number of factors now
 

4157

theorem
 

4173
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:49,829
theorem
it's a belief that uh that factoring is

4174
01:07:49,829 --> 01:07:49,839
it's a belief that uh that factoring is
 

4175
01:07:49,839 --> 01:07:51,670
it's a belief that uh that factoring is
an inherently hard problem

4176
01:07:51,670 --> 01:07:51,680
an inherently hard problem
 

4177
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:54,230
an inherently hard problem
uh for our computers we do know

4178
01:07:54,230 --> 01:07:54,240
uh for our computers we do know
 

4179
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:56,309
uh for our computers we do know
algorithms that are better than just

4180
01:07:56,309 --> 01:07:56,319
algorithms that are better than just
 

4181
01:07:56,319 --> 01:07:58,710
algorithms that are better than just
trial division and just trying all the

4182
01:07:58,710 --> 01:07:58,720
trial division and just trying all the
 

4183
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:02,069
trial division and just trying all the
possible divisors uh but they are still

4184
01:08:02,069 --> 01:08:02,079
possible divisors uh but they are still
 

4185
01:08:02,079 --> 01:08:04,950
possible divisors uh but they are still
basically exponential exponential is

4186
01:08:04,950 --> 01:08:04,960
basically exponential exponential is
 

4187
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:05,910
basically exponential exponential is
hard

4188
01:08:05,910 --> 01:08:05,920
hard
 

4189
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:08,309
hard
yeah exactly so this so the the fastest

4190
01:08:08,309 --> 01:08:08,319
yeah exactly so this so the the fastest
 

4191
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:10,549
yeah exactly so this so the the fastest
algorithms that anyone has discovered

4192
01:08:10,549 --> 01:08:10,559
algorithms that anyone has discovered
 

4193
01:08:10,559 --> 01:08:12,470
algorithms that anyone has discovered
at least publicly discovered you know

4194
01:08:12,470 --> 01:08:12,480
at least publicly discovered you know
 

4195
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:14,470
at least publicly discovered you know
i'm assuming that the nsa doesn't know

4196
01:08:14,470 --> 01:08:14,480
i'm assuming that the nsa doesn't know
 

4197
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:15,349
i'm assuming that the nsa doesn't know
something better

4198
01:08:15,349 --> 01:08:15,359
something better
 

4199
01:08:15,359 --> 01:08:17,829
something better
yeah okay but they they take time that

4200
01:08:17,829 --> 01:08:17,839
yeah okay but they they take time that
 

4201
01:08:17,839 --> 01:08:18,950
yeah okay but they they take time that
basically grows

4202
01:08:18,950 --> 01:08:18,960
basically grows
 

4203
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:21,590
basically grows
exponentially with the cube root of the

4204
01:08:21,590 --> 01:08:21,600
exponentially with the cube root of the
 

4205
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:23,669
exponentially with the cube root of the
size of the number that you're factoring

4206
01:08:23,669 --> 01:08:23,679
size of the number that you're factoring
 

4207
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:26,149
size of the number that you're factoring
right so that cube root that's the part

4208
01:08:26,149 --> 01:08:26,159
right so that cube root that's the part
 

4209
01:08:26,159 --> 01:08:27,990
right so that cube root that's the part
that takes all the cleverness okay but

4210
01:08:27,990 --> 01:08:28,000
that takes all the cleverness okay but
 

4211
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:29,669
that takes all the cleverness okay but
there's still an exponential

4212
01:08:29,669 --> 01:08:29,679
there's still an exponential
 

4213
01:08:29,679 --> 01:08:31,269
there's still an exponential
there's still an exponentiality there

4214
01:08:31,269 --> 01:08:31,279
there's still an exponentiality there
 

4215
01:08:31,279 --> 01:08:33,110
there's still an exponentiality there
but what that means is that like

4216
01:08:33,110 --> 01:08:33,120
but what that means is that like
 

4217
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:36,070
but what that means is that like
when people use a thousand bit keys for

4218
01:08:36,070 --> 01:08:36,080

01:08:39,590 --> 01:08:39,600
that can probably be broken using the
 

4223
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:41,269
that can probably be broken using the
resources of the nsa

agencies you know people have done

4228
01:08:44,550 --> 01:08:44,560
agencies you know people have done

analyses that say

4230
01:08:46,070 --> 01:08:46,080
analyses that say
 

4231
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:47,669
analyses that say
you know with a few hundred million

4232
01:08:47,669 --> 01:08:47,679
you know with a few hundred million
 

4233
01:08:47,679 --> 01:08:49,510
you know with a few hundred million
dollars of computer power they could

4234
01:08:49,510 --> 01:08:49,520
dollars of computer power they could
 

4235
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:50,789
dollars of computer power they could
totally do this

4236
01:08:50,789 --> 01:08:50,799
totally do this
 

4237
01:08:50,799 --> 01:08:52,470
totally do this
and if you look at the documents that

4238
01:08:52,470 --> 01:08:52,480
and if you look at the documents that
 

4239
01:08:52,480 --> 01:08:53,990
and if you look at the documents that
snowden released

4240
01:08:53,990 --> 01:08:54,000
snowden released
 

4241
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,550
snowden released
you know it it it look it looks a lot

4242
01:08:56,550 --> 01:08:56,560
you know it it it look it looks a lot
 

4243
01:08:56,560 --> 01:08:58,309
you know it it it look it looks a lot
like they are doing that or something

4244
01:08:58,309 --> 01:08:58,319
like they are doing that or something
 

4245
01:08:58,319 --> 01:08:58,950
like they are doing that or something
like that

4246
01:08:58,950 --> 01:08:58,960
like that
 

4247
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:00,550
like that
it would kind of be surprising if they

4248
01:09:00,550 --> 01:09:00,560
it would kind of be surprising if they
 

4249
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:02,149
it would kind of be surprising if they
weren't okay but

4250
01:09:02,149 --> 01:09:02,159
weren't okay but
 

4251
01:09:02,159 --> 01:09:04,950
weren't okay but
you know if that's true then in in some

4252
01:09:04,950 --> 01:09:04,960
you know if that's true then in in some
 

4253
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:06,309
you know if that's true then in in some
ways that's reassuring

4254
01:09:06,309 --> 01:09:06,319
ways that's reassuring
 

4255
01:09:06,319 --> 01:09:07,829
ways that's reassuring
because if that's the best that they can

4256
01:09:07,829 --> 01:09:07,839
because if that's the best that they can
 

4257
01:09:07,839 --> 01:09:09,749
because if that's the best that they can
do then that would say that they can't

4258
01:09:09,749 --> 01:09:09,759
do then that would say that they can't
 

4259
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:11,910
do then that would say that they can't
break two thousand bit numbers

4260
01:09:11,910 --> 01:09:11,920
break two thousand bit numbers
 

4261
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:13,910
break two thousand bit numbers
right exactly exactly right then two

4262
01:09:13,910 --> 01:09:13,920
right exactly exactly right then two
 

4263
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:15,349
right exactly exactly right then two
thousand bit numbers would be

4264
01:09:15,349 --> 01:09:15,359
thousand bit numbers would be
 

4265
01:09:15,359 --> 01:09:17,030
thousand bit numbers would be
would be beyond what even they could do

4266
01:09:17,030 --> 01:09:17,040
would be beyond what even they could do
 

4267
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:18,070
would be beyond what even they could do
they haven't found an efficient

4268
01:09:18,070 --> 01:09:18,080
they haven't found an efficient
 

4269
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:19,110
they haven't found an efficient
algorithm that's where

4270
01:09:19,110 --> 01:09:19,120
algorithm that's where
 

4271
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:21,430
algorithm that's where
all the worries and the concerns of

4272
01:09:21,430 --> 01:09:21,440
all the worries and the concerns of
 

4273
01:09:21,440 --> 01:09:23,030
all the worries and the concerns of
quantum computing came in that there's

4274
01:09:23,030 --> 01:09:23,040
quantum computing came in that there's
 

4275
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:24,709
quantum computing came in that there's
some kind of shortcut around that right

4276
01:09:24,709 --> 01:09:24,719
some kind of shortcut around that right
 

4277
01:09:24,719 --> 01:09:26,309
some kind of shortcut around that right
so complexity theory

4278
01:09:26,309 --> 01:09:26,319
so complexity theory
 

4279
01:09:26,319 --> 01:09:29,669
so complexity theory
is a you know is is a huge part of let's

4280
01:09:29,669 --> 01:09:29,679
is a you know is is a huge part of let's
 

4281
01:09:29,679 --> 01:09:31,910
is a you know is is a huge part of let's
say the theoretical core of computer

4282
01:09:31,910 --> 01:09:31,920
say the theoretical core of computer
 

4283
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:32,630
say the theoretical core of computer
science

4284
01:09:32,630 --> 01:09:32,640
science
 

4285
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:35,669
science
you know it it started in the 60s and

4286
01:09:35,669 --> 01:09:35,679
you know it it started in the 60s and
 

4287
01:09:35,679 --> 01:09:36,630
you know it it started in the 60s and
70s

4288
01:09:36,630 --> 01:09:36,640
70s
 

4289
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:38,070
70s
as you know sort of a you know

4290
01:09:38,070 --> 01:09:38,080
as you know sort of a you know
 

4291
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:39,749
as you know sort of a you know
autonomous field so it was

4292
01:09:39,749 --> 01:09:39,759
autonomous field so it was
 

4293
01:09:39,759 --> 01:09:41,349
autonomous field so it was
you know already you know i mean you

4294
01:09:41,349 --> 01:09:41,359
you know already you know i mean you
 

4295
01:09:41,359 --> 01:09:42,950
you know already you know i mean you
know it was

4296
01:09:42,950 --> 01:09:42,960
know it was
 

4297
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:45,269
know it was
well developed even by the time that i

4298
01:09:45,269 --> 01:09:45,279
well developed even by the time that i
 

4299
01:09:45,279 --> 01:09:46,149
well developed even by the time that i
was born

4300
01:09:46,149 --> 01:09:46,159
was born
 

4301
01:09:46,159 --> 01:09:50,630
was born
okay but uh um uh i in 2002 i made a

4302
01:09:50,630 --> 01:09:50,640
okay but uh um uh i in 2002 i made a
 

4303
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:52,870
okay but uh um uh i in 2002 i made a
website called the complexities zoo

4304
01:09:52,870 --> 01:09:52,880
website called the complexities zoo
 

4305
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:55,270
website called the complexities zoo
uh to answer your question uh where i

4306
01:09:55,270 --> 01:09:55,280
uh to answer your question uh where i
 

4307
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:57,189
uh to answer your question uh where i
just tried to catalog

4308
01:09:57,189 --> 01:09:57,199
just tried to catalog
 

4309
01:09:57,199 --> 01:09:59,830
just tried to catalog
the different complexity classes which

4310
01:09:59,830 --> 01:09:59,840
the different complexity classes which
 

4311
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:01,669
the different complexity classes which
are classes of problems that are

4312
01:10:01,669 --> 01:10:01,679
are classes of problems that are
 

4313
01:10:01,679 --> 01:10:03,189
are classes of problems that are
solvable with different kinds of

4314
01:10:03,189 --> 01:10:03,199
solvable with different kinds of
 

4315
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:04,149
solvable with different kinds of
resources

4316
01:10:04,149 --> 01:10:04,159
resources
 

4317
01:10:04,159 --> 01:10:06,870
resources
right okay so these are kind of um you

4318
01:10:06,870 --> 01:10:06,880
right okay so these are kind of um you
 

4319
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:08,310
right okay so these are kind of um you
know you could think of complexity

4320
01:10:08,310 --> 01:10:08,320
know you could think of complexity
 

4321
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:08,950
know you could think of complexity
classes

4322
01:10:08,950 --> 01:10:08,960
classes
 

4323
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:11,669
classes
as like being almost to to to

4324
01:10:11,669 --> 01:10:11,679
as like being almost to to to
 

4325
01:10:11,679 --> 01:10:13,669
as like being almost to to to
theoretical computer science like what

4326
01:10:13,669 --> 01:10:13,679
theoretical computer science like what
 

4327
01:10:13,679 --> 01:10:15,510
theoretical computer science like what
the elements are to chemistry

4328
01:10:15,510 --> 01:10:15,520
the elements are to chemistry
 

4329
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:17,750
the elements are to chemistry
right they're sort of you know there are

4330
01:10:17,750 --> 01:10:17,760
right they're sort of you know there are
 

4331
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:18,870
right they're sort of you know there are
our most basic

4332
01:10:18,870 --> 01:10:18,880
our most basic
 

4333
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:21,830
our most basic
objects in in a certain way i feel like

4334
01:10:21,830 --> 01:10:21,840
objects in in a certain way i feel like
 

4335
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:23,750
objects in in a certain way i feel like
the elements

4336
01:10:23,750 --> 01:10:23,760
the elements
 

4337
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:26,550
the elements
have uh have a characteristic to them

4338
01:10:26,550 --> 01:10:26,560
have uh have a characteristic to them
 

4339
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:27,990
have uh have a characteristic to them
where you can't just add

4340
01:10:27,990 --> 01:10:28,000
where you can't just add
 

4341
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,550
where you can't just add
an infinite number well you could but

4342
01:10:30,550 --> 01:10:30,560
an infinite number well you could but
 

4343
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:32,070
an infinite number well you could but
beyond a certain point they become

4344
01:10:32,070 --> 01:10:32,080
beyond a certain point they become
 

4345
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:33,669
beyond a certain point they become
unstable

4346
01:10:33,669 --> 01:10:33,679
unstable
 

4347
01:10:33,679 --> 01:10:35,590
unstable
right right so it's like you know in

4348
01:10:35,590 --> 01:10:35,600
right right so it's like you know in
 

4349
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:37,510
right right so it's like you know in
theory you can have atoms with

4350
01:10:37,510 --> 01:10:37,520
theory you can have atoms with
 

4351
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:39,110
theory you can have atoms with
yeah and look look i mean i mean i mean

4352
01:10:39,110 --> 01:10:39,120
yeah and look look i mean i mean i mean
 

4353
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:41,990
yeah and look look i mean i mean i mean
a neutron star you know is a nucleus

4354
01:10:41,990 --> 01:10:42,000
a neutron star you know is a nucleus
 

4355
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:42,870
a neutron star you know is a nucleus
with you know

4356
01:10:42,870 --> 01:10:42,880
with you know
 

4357
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:45,990
with you know
uncalled billions of of of of nuke of

4358
01:10:45,990 --> 01:10:46,000
uncalled billions of of of of nuke of
 

4359
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:49,350
uncalled billions of of of of nuke of
of uh of of of of neutrons in it of of

4360
01:10:49,350 --> 01:10:49,360
of uh of of of of neutrons in it of of
 

4361
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:51,110
of uh of of of of neutrons in it of of
hadrons in it okay but

4362
01:10:51,110 --> 01:10:51,120
hadrons in it okay but
 

4363
01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:54,310
hadrons in it okay but
uh um you know for for sort of normal

4364
01:10:54,310 --> 01:10:54,320
uh um you know for for sort of normal
 

4365
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:56,470
uh um you know for for sort of normal
atoms right probably you can't get

4366
01:10:56,470 --> 01:10:56,480
atoms right probably you can't get
 

4367
01:10:56,480 --> 01:10:59,189
atoms right probably you can't get
much above 100 you know atomic weight

4368
01:10:59,189 --> 01:10:59,199
much above 100 you know atomic weight
 

4369
01:10:59,199 --> 01:11:00,790
much above 100 you know atomic weight
150 or so

4370
01:11:00,790 --> 01:11:00,800
150 or so
 

4371
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:03,430
150 or so
or sorry sorry i mean i mean beyond 150

4372
01:11:03,430 --> 01:11:03,440
or sorry sorry i mean i mean beyond 150
 

4373
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:05,110
or sorry sorry i mean i mean beyond 150
or so protons without it

4374
01:11:05,110 --> 01:11:05,120
or so protons without it
 

4375
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:07,590
or so protons without it
you know very quickly fissioning uh with

4376
01:11:07,590 --> 01:11:07,600
you know very quickly fissioning uh with
 

4377
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:09,669
you know very quickly fissioning uh with
complexity classes well yeah you

4378
01:11:09,669 --> 01:11:09,679
complexity classes well yeah you
 

4379
01:11:09,679 --> 01:11:11,750
complexity classes well yeah you
you can have an infinity of complexity

4380
01:11:11,750 --> 01:11:11,760
you can have an infinity of complexity
 

4381
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:14,229
you can have an infinity of complexity
classes uh but you know maybe

4382
01:11:14,229 --> 01:11:14,239
classes uh but you know maybe
 

4383
01:11:14,239 --> 01:11:15,990
classes uh but you know maybe
there's only a finite number of them

4384
01:11:15,990 --> 01:11:16,000
there's only a finite number of them
 

4385
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:17,590
there's only a finite number of them
that are particularly interesting

4386
01:11:17,590 --> 01:11:17,600
that are particularly interesting
 

4387
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:19,750
that are particularly interesting
right just like with anything else you

4388
01:11:19,750 --> 01:11:19,760
right just like with anything else you
 

4389
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:20,709
right just like with anything else you
know you uh

4390
01:11:20,709 --> 01:11:20,719
know you uh
 

4391
01:11:20,719 --> 01:11:22,709
know you uh
uh you care about some more than about

4392
01:11:22,709 --> 01:11:22,719
uh you care about some more than about
 

4393
01:11:22,719 --> 01:11:24,149
uh you care about some more than about
others so what kind of interesting

4394
01:11:24,149 --> 01:11:24,159
others so what kind of interesting
 

4395
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:25,270
others so what kind of interesting
classes are there

4396
01:11:25,270 --> 01:11:25,280
classes are there
 

4397
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:27,669
classes are there
yeah i mean you could have just maybe

4398
01:11:27,669 --> 01:11:27,679
yeah i mean you could have just maybe
 

4399
01:11:27,679 --> 01:11:28,709
yeah i mean you could have just maybe
say what are the

4400
01:11:28,709 --> 01:11:28,719
say what are the
 

4401
01:11:28,719 --> 01:11:30,390
say what are the
if you you take any kind of computer

4402
01:11:30,390 --> 01:11:30,400
if you you take any kind of computer
 

4403
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:32,149
if you you take any kind of computer
science class what are the classes you

4404
01:11:32,149 --> 01:11:32,159
science class what are the classes you
 

4405
01:11:32,159 --> 01:11:32,630
science class what are the classes you
learn

4406
01:11:32,630 --> 01:11:32,640
learn
 

4407
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:35,110
learn
good let me let me tell you sort of the

4408
01:11:35,110 --> 01:11:35,120
good let me let me tell you sort of the
 

4409
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:37,030
good let me let me tell you sort of the
the the biggest ones the ones that you

4410
01:11:37,030 --> 01:11:37,040
the the biggest ones the ones that you
 

4411
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:37,590
the the biggest ones the ones that you
would learn

4412
01:11:37,590 --> 01:11:37,600
would learn
 

4413
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:40,149
would learn
first so you know first of all there is

4414
01:11:40,149 --> 01:11:40,159
first so you know first of all there is
 

4415
01:11:40,159 --> 01:11:40,870
first so you know first of all there is
p

4416
01:11:40,870 --> 01:11:40,880
p
 

4417
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:42,630
p
that's what it's called okay it stands

4418
01:11:42,630 --> 01:11:42,640
that's what it's called okay it stands
 

4419
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:44,470
that's what it's called okay it stands
for polynomial time

4420
01:11:44,470 --> 01:11:44,480
for polynomial time
 

4421
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:46,630
for polynomial time
and this is just the class of all of the

4422
01:11:46,630 --> 01:11:46,640
and this is just the class of all of the
 

4423
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:47,510
and this is just the class of all of the
problems

4424
01:11:47,510 --> 01:11:47,520
problems
 

4425
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:49,990
problems
that you could solve with a conventional

4426
01:11:49,990 --> 01:11:50,000
that you could solve with a conventional
 

4427
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:51,030
that you could solve with a conventional
computer

4428
01:11:51,030 --> 01:11:51,040
computer
 

4429
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:53,990
computer
like your iphone or your laptop uh you

4430
01:11:53,990 --> 01:11:54,000
like your iphone or your laptop uh you
 

4431
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,149
like your iphone or your laptop uh you
know by a completely deterministic

4432
01:11:56,149 --> 01:11:56,159
know by a completely deterministic
 

4433
01:11:56,159 --> 01:11:59,830
know by a completely deterministic
algorithm right using a number of steps

4434
01:11:59,830 --> 01:11:59,840
algorithm right using a number of steps
 

4435
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:02,470
algorithm right using a number of steps
that grows only like the size of the

4436
01:12:02,470 --> 01:12:02,480
that grows only like the size of the
 

4437
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:03,189
that grows only like the size of the
input

4438
01:12:03,189 --> 01:12:03,199
input
 

4439
01:12:03,199 --> 01:12:06,470
input
raised to some fixed power okay so

4440
01:12:06,470 --> 01:12:06,480
raised to some fixed power okay so
 

4441
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:09,510
raised to some fixed power okay so
uh if your algorithm is linear time like

4442
01:12:09,510 --> 01:12:09,520
uh if your algorithm is linear time like
 

4443
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:11,110
uh if your algorithm is linear time like
you know for adding numbers

4444
01:12:11,110 --> 01:12:11,120
you know for adding numbers
 

4445
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:13,590
you know for adding numbers
okay that that problem is in p if you

4446
01:12:13,590 --> 01:12:13,600
okay that that problem is in p if you
 

4447
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:16,310
okay that that problem is in p if you
have an algorithm that's quadratic time

4448
01:12:16,310 --> 01:12:16,320
have an algorithm that's quadratic time
 

4449
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:18,390
have an algorithm that's quadratic time
like the uh elementary school algorithm

4450
01:12:18,390 --> 01:12:18,400
like the uh elementary school algorithm
 

4451
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:20,550
like the uh elementary school algorithm
for multiplying two numbers that's also

4452
01:12:20,550 --> 01:12:20,560
for multiplying two numbers that's also
 

4453
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:21,430
for multiplying two numbers that's also
in p

4454
01:12:21,430 --> 01:12:21,440
in p
 

4455
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:23,350
in p
even if it was the size of the input to

4456
01:12:23,350 --> 01:12:23,360
even if it was the size of the input to
 

4457
01:12:23,360 --> 01:12:24,550
even if it was the size of the input to
the 10th power

4458
01:12:24,550 --> 01:12:24,560
the 10th power
 

4459
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:26,870
the 10th power
or to the 50th power well that wouldn't

4460
01:12:26,870 --> 01:12:26,880
or to the 50th power well that wouldn't
 

4461
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:27,830
or to the 50th power well that wouldn't
be very uh

4462
01:12:27,830 --> 01:12:27,840
be very uh
 

4463
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:30,149
be very uh
good in practice but you know formally

4464
01:12:30,149 --> 01:12:30,159
good in practice but you know formally
 

4465
01:12:30,159 --> 01:12:31,590
good in practice but you know formally
we would still count that that would

4466
01:12:31,590 --> 01:12:31,600
we would still count that that would
 

4467
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:32,790
we would still count that that would
still be in p

4468
01:12:32,790 --> 01:12:32,800
still be in p
 

4469
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:35,110
still be in p
okay but if your algorithm takes

4470
01:12:35,110 --> 01:12:35,120
okay but if your algorithm takes
 

4471
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:36,709
okay but if your algorithm takes
exponential time

4472
01:12:36,709 --> 01:12:36,719
exponential time
 

4473
01:12:36,719 --> 01:12:39,830
exponential time
meaning like if every time i add one

4474
01:12:39,830 --> 01:12:39,840
meaning like if every time i add one
 

4475
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:40,390
meaning like if every time i add one
more

4476
01:12:40,390 --> 01:12:40,400
more
 

4477
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:44,310
more
uh data point to your input if the

4478
01:12:44,310 --> 01:12:44,320
uh data point to your input if the
 

4479
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:46,390
uh data point to your input if the
time that needed by the algorithm

4480
01:12:46,390 --> 01:12:46,400
time that needed by the algorithm
 

4481
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:48,390
time that needed by the algorithm
doubles if you need time like

4482
01:12:48,390 --> 01:12:48,400
doubles if you need time like
 

4483
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:51,030
doubles if you need time like
2 to the power of the amount of input

4484
01:12:51,030 --> 01:12:51,040
2 to the power of the amount of input
 

4485
01:12:51,040 --> 01:12:51,830
2 to the power of the amount of input
data

4486
01:12:51,830 --> 01:12:51,840
data
 

4487
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:53,990
data
then uh that is that we call an

4488
01:12:53,990 --> 01:12:54,000
then uh that is that we call an
 

4489
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:55,669
then uh that is that we call an
exponential time algorithm

4490
01:12:55,669 --> 01:12:55,679
exponential time algorithm
 

4491
01:12:55,679 --> 01:12:58,550
exponential time algorithm
okay and that is not polynomial okay so

4492
01:12:58,550 --> 01:12:58,560
okay and that is not polynomial okay so
 

4493
01:12:58,560 --> 01:12:59,189
okay and that is not polynomial okay so
p

4494
01:12:59,189 --> 01:12:59,199
p
 

4495
01:12:59,199 --> 01:13:02,070
p
is all of the problems that have some

4496
01:13:02,070 --> 01:13:02,080
is all of the problems that have some
 

4497
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:04,149
is all of the problems that have some
polynomial time algorithm

4498
01:13:04,149 --> 01:13:04,159
polynomial time algorithm
 

4499
01:13:04,159 --> 01:13:06,870
polynomial time algorithm
okay so that includes most of what we do

4500
01:13:06,870 --> 01:13:06,880
okay so that includes most of what we do
 

4501
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:09,110
okay so that includes most of what we do
with our computers on a day-to-day basis

4502
01:13:09,110 --> 01:13:09,120
with our computers on a day-to-day basis
 

4503
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:09,750
with our computers on a day-to-day basis
you know

4504
01:13:09,750 --> 01:13:09,760
you know
 

4505
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:11,910
you know
all the you know sorting basic

4506
01:13:11,910 --> 01:13:11,920
all the you know sorting basic
 

4507
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:12,950
all the you know sorting basic
arithmetic

4508
01:13:12,950 --> 01:13:12,960
arithmetic
 

4509
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:14,550

email reader or in angry birds
 

4513
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:20,390
email reader or in angry birds
okay it's all in p then the next uh

4514
01:13:20,390 --> 01:13:20,400
okay it's all in p then the next uh
 

4515
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:21,910
okay it's all in p then the next uh
super important class

4516
01:13:21,910 --> 01:13:21,920
super important class
 

4517
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:24,669
super important class
is called np uh that stands for

4518
01:13:24,669 --> 01:13:24,679
is called np uh that stands for
 

4519
01:13:24,679 --> 01:13:26,709
is called np uh that stands for
non-deterministic polynomial

4520
01:13:26,709 --> 01:13:26,719
non-deterministic polynomial
 

4521
01:13:26,719 --> 01:13:29,350
non-deterministic polynomial
okay does not stand for not polynomial

4522
01:13:29,350 --> 01:13:29,360
okay does not stand for not polynomial
 

4523
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:30,310
okay does not stand for not polynomial
which is a

4524
01:13:30,310 --> 01:13:30,320
which is a
 

4525
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:33,910
which is a
common confusion um but np was basically

4526
01:13:33,910 --> 01:13:33,920
common confusion um but np was basically
 

4527
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:35,510
common confusion um but np was basically
all of the problems

4528
01:13:35,510 --> 01:13:35,520
all of the problems
 

4529
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:38,630
all of the problems
where if there is a solution then it is

4530
01:13:38,630 --> 01:13:38,640
where if there is a solution then it is
 

4531
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:40,390
where if there is a solution then it is
easy to check the solution

4532
01:13:40,390 --> 01:13:40,400
easy to check the solution
 

4533
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:42,790
easy to check the solution
if someone shows it to you okay so

4534
01:13:42,790 --> 01:13:42,800
if someone shows it to you okay so
 

4535
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:43,830
if someone shows it to you okay so
actually a perfect

4536
01:13:43,830 --> 01:13:43,840
actually a perfect
 

4537
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:46,870
actually a perfect
example of a problem in np is uh

4538
01:13:46,870 --> 01:13:46,880
example of a problem in np is uh
 

4539
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:48,870
example of a problem in np is uh
factoring the one i told you about

4540
01:13:48,870 --> 01:13:48,880
factoring the one i told you about
 

4541
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:50,790
factoring the one i told you about
before like if i

01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:52,550
before like if i
gave you a number with thousands of

4544
01:13:52,550 --> 01:13:52,560
gave you a number with thousands of
 

4545
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:54,550
gave you a number with thousands of
digits and i told you

4546
01:13:54,550 --> 01:13:54,560
digits and i told you
 

4547
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:57,669
digits and i told you
that you know i i asked you does this

4548
01:13:57,669 --> 01:13:57,679
that you know i i asked you does this
 

4549
01:13:57,679 --> 01:14:01,030
that you know i i asked you does this
uh does this have at least um three

4550
01:14:01,030 --> 01:14:01,040
uh does this have at least um three
 

4551
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:02,870
uh does this have at least um three
non-trivial divisors

4552
01:14:02,870 --> 01:14:02,880
non-trivial divisors
 

4553
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:05,189
non-trivial divisors
right that might be a super hard problem

4554
01:14:05,189 --> 01:14:05,199
right that might be a super hard problem
 

4555
01:14:05,199 --> 01:14:06,950
right that might be a super hard problem
to solve right might take you millions

4556
01:14:06,950 --> 01:14:06,960
to solve right might take you millions
 

4557
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:07,830
to solve right might take you millions
of years

4558
01:14:07,830 --> 01:14:07,840
of years
 

4559
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:09,750
of years
using any algorithm that's known at

4560
01:14:09,750 --> 01:14:09,760
using any algorithm that's known at
 

4561
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:12,149
using any algorithm that's known at
least running on our existing computers

4562
01:14:12,149 --> 01:14:12,159
least running on our existing computers
 

4563
01:14:12,159 --> 01:14:14,550
least running on our existing computers
okay but if i simply showed you the

4564
01:14:14,550 --> 01:14:14,560
okay but if i simply showed you the
 

4565
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:15,590
okay but if i simply showed you the
divisors

4566
01:14:15,590 --> 01:14:15,600
divisors
 

4567
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:17,990
divisors
i said here are three divisors of this

4568
01:14:17,990 --> 01:14:18,000
i said here are three divisors of this
 

4569
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:18,630
i said here are three divisors of this
number

4570
01:14:18,630 --> 01:14:18,640
number
 

4571
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:21,030
number
then it would be very easy for you to

4572
01:14:21,030 --> 01:14:21,040
then it would be very easy for you to
 

4573
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:22,149
then it would be very easy for you to
ask your computer

4574
01:14:22,149 --> 01:14:22,159
ask your computer
 

4575
01:14:22,159 --> 01:14:24,070
ask your computer
to just check each one and see if it

4576
01:14:24,070 --> 01:14:24,080
to just check each one and see if it
 

4577
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:25,910
to just check each one and see if it
works just divide it in

4578
01:14:25,910 --> 01:14:25,920
works just divide it in
 

4579
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:27,990
works just divide it in
see if there's any remainder right and

4580
01:14:27,990 --> 01:14:28,000
see if there's any remainder right and
 

4581
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:28,950
see if there's any remainder right and
if they all go in

4582
01:14:28,950 --> 01:14:28,960
if they all go in
 

4583
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:30,630
if they all go in
then you've checked well i guess there

4584
01:14:30,630 --> 01:14:30,640
then you've checked well i guess there
 

4585
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:32,070
then you've checked well i guess there
were right

4586
01:14:32,070 --> 01:14:32,080
were right
 

4587
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:35,110
were right
so um so any problem

4588
01:14:35,110 --> 01:14:35,120
so um so any problem
 

4589
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:36,790
so um so any problem
where you know wherever there's a

4590
01:14:36,790 --> 01:14:36,800
where you know wherever there's a
 

4591
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:39,270
where you know wherever there's a
solution there is a short witness

4592
01:14:39,270 --> 01:14:39,280
solution there is a short witness
 

4593
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:41,830
solution there is a short witness
that can be easily like a polynomial

4594
01:14:41,830 --> 01:14:41,840
that can be easily like a polynomial
 

4595
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:42,390
that can be easily like a polynomial
size

4596
01:14:42,390 --> 01:14:42,400
size
 

4597
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:44,310
size
witness that can be checked in

4598
01:14:44,310 --> 01:14:44,320
witness that can be checked in
 

4599
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:45,830
witness that can be checked in
polynomial time

4600
01:14:45,830 --> 01:14:45,840
polynomial time
 

4601
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:48,470
polynomial time
that we call an np problem okay

4602
01:14:48,470 --> 01:14:48,480
that we call an np problem okay
 

4603
01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:49,030
that we call an np problem okay
beautiful

4604
01:14:49,030 --> 01:14:49,040
beautiful
 

4605
01:14:49,040 --> 01:14:51,750
beautiful
and uh yeah so so every problem that's

4606
01:14:51,750 --> 01:14:51,760
and uh yeah so so every problem that's
 

4607
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:52,310
and uh yeah so so every problem that's
in p

4608
01:14:52,310 --> 01:14:52,320
in p
 

4609
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:55,270
in p
is also in np right because you know you

4610
01:14:55,270 --> 01:14:55,280
is also in np right because you know you
 

4611
01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:56,229
is also in np right because you know you
could always just

4612
01:14:56,229 --> 01:14:56,239
could always just
 

4613
01:14:56,239 --> 01:14:57,990
could always just
ignore the witness and just you know if

4614
01:14:57,990 --> 01:14:58,000
ignore the witness and just you know if
 

4615
01:14:58,000 --> 01:14:59,590
ignore the witness and just you know if
a problem is in p you can just solve it

4616
01:14:59,590 --> 01:14:59,600
a problem is in p you can just solve it
 

4617
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:00,229
a problem is in p you can just solve it
yourself

4618
01:15:00,229 --> 01:15:00,239
yourself
 

4619
01:15:00,239 --> 01:15:02,630
yourself
right okay but now the influence is the

4620
01:15:02,630 --> 01:15:02,640
right okay but now the influence is the
 

4621
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:03,830
right okay but now the influence is the
central

4622

science
 

4627
01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:10,310
science
is is every np problem in p so

4628
01:15:10,310 --> 01:15:10,320
is is every np problem in p so
 

4629
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:13,510
is is every np problem in p so
if you can easily check the answer to a

4630
01:15:13,510 --> 01:15:13,520
if you can easily check the answer to a
 

4631
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:15,990
if you can easily check the answer to a
a computational problem does that mean

4632
01:15:15,990 --> 01:15:16,000
a computational problem does that mean
 

4633
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,149
a computational problem does that mean
that you can also easily find the answer

4634
01:15:18,149 --> 01:15:18,159
that you can also easily find the answer
 

4635
01:15:18,159 --> 01:15:19,990
that you can also easily find the answer
even though there's all these problems

4636
01:15:19,990 --> 01:15:20,000
even though there's all these problems
 

4637
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:21,350
even though there's all these problems
that appear to

4638
01:15:21,350 --> 01:15:21,360
that appear to
 

4639
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:23,669
that appear to
be very difficult to find the answer

4640
01:15:23,669 --> 01:15:23,679
be very difficult to find the answer
 

4641
01:15:23,679 --> 01:15:25,750
be very difficult to find the answer
it's still an open question whether

4642
01:15:25,750 --> 01:15:25,760
it's still an open question whether
 

4643
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:27,910
it's still an open question whether
a good answer exists so what's yours no

4644
01:15:27,910 --> 01:15:27,920
a good answer exists so what's yours no
 

4645
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:29,590
a good answer exists so what's yours no
one has proven that there's no way to do

like to say that if we were physicists

4670
01:15:49,910 --> 01:15:49,920
like to say that if we were physicists
 

4671
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:51,430
like to say that if we were physicists
we would have just declared that to be a

4672
01:15:51,430 --> 01:15:51,440
we would have just declared that to be a
 

4673
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:52,550
we would have just declared that to be a
law of nature

4674
01:15:52,550 --> 01:15:52,560
law of nature
 

4675
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:53,830
law of nature
you know just like just like

01:15:53,830 --> 01:15:53,840
you know just like just like
 

4677
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:55,669
you know just like just like

if later if later it turned out that we
 

4685
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:02,870
if later if later it turned out that we
were wrong we just give ourselves

4686
01:16:02,870 --> 01:16:02,880
were wrong we just give ourselves
 

4687
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:09,350
were wrong we just give ourselves
more more nobel prizes yeah

4688

01:16:26,709 --> 01:16:26,719
the difference in in language
 

4707
01:16:26,719 --> 01:16:29,030
the difference in in language
you know about the underlying truth so

4708
01:16:29,030 --> 01:16:29,040
you know about the underlying truth so
 

4709
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:30,790
you know about the underlying truth so
okay so you're a good investor and good

4710
01:16:30,790 --> 01:16:30,800
okay so you're a good investor and good
 

4711
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:32,310
okay so you're a good investor and good
spender money so then let me

4712
01:16:32,310 --> 01:16:32,320
spender money so then let me
 

4713
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:34,550
spender money so then let me
i don't know that let me ask another way

4714
01:16:34,550 --> 01:16:34,560
i don't know that let me ask another way
 

4715
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:36,070
i don't know that let me ask another way
is it possible at

4716
01:16:36,070 --> 01:16:36,080
is it possible at
 

4717
01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:39,990
is it possible at
all and what would that look like if p

4718
01:16:39,990 --> 01:16:40,000
all and what would that look like if p
 

4719
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,709
all and what would that look like if p
indeed equals np well i do think that

4720
01:16:42,709 --> 01:16:42,719
indeed equals np well i do think that
 

4721
01:16:42,719 --> 01:16:44,310
indeed equals np well i do think that
it's possible i mean in fact you know

4722
01:16:44,310 --> 01:16:44,320
it's possible i mean in fact you know
 

4723
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:46,390
it's possible i mean in fact you know
when people really pressed me on my blog

4724
01:16:46,390 --> 01:16:46,400
when people really pressed me on my blog
 

4725
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:47,990
when people really pressed me on my blog
for what odds would i put

4726
01:16:47,990 --> 01:16:48,000
for what odds would i put
 

4727
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:49,750
for what odds would i put
like well you know two or three percent

4728
01:16:49,750 --> 01:16:49,760
like well you know two or three percent
 

4729
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:51,750
like well you know two or three percent
odds wow that's pretty good that p

4730
01:16:51,750 --> 01:16:51,760
odds wow that's pretty good that p
 

4731
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:54,310
odds wow that's pretty good that p
equals np yeah just speak well um

4732
01:16:54,310 --> 01:16:54,320
equals np yeah just speak well um
 

4733
01:16:54,320 --> 01:16:55,669
equals np yeah just speak well um
because you know when p

4734
01:16:55,669 --> 01:16:55,679
because you know when p
 

4735
01:16:55,679 --> 01:16:56,950
because you know when p
i mean i mean you you really have to

4736
01:16:56,950 --> 01:16:56,960
i mean i mean you you really have to
 

4737
01:16:56,960 --> 01:16:59,270
i mean i mean you you really have to
think about like if there were

4738
01:16:59,270 --> 01:16:59,280
think about like if there were
 

4739
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:02,870
think about like if there were
50 you know mysteries like p versus np

4740
01:17:02,870 --> 01:17:02,880
50 you know mysteries like p versus np
 

4741
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:04,790
50 you know mysteries like p versus np
and if i made a guess about every single

4742
01:17:04,790 --> 01:17:04,800
and if i made a guess about every single
 

4743
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:05,510
and if i made a guess about every single
one of them

4744
01:17:05,510 --> 01:17:05,520
one of them
 

4745
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:07,910
one of them
would i expect to be right 50 times

4746
01:17:07,910 --> 01:17:07,920
would i expect to be right 50 times
 

4747
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:10,229
would i expect to be right 50 times
right and the truthful answer is no

4748
01:17:10,229 --> 01:17:10,239
right and the truthful answer is no
 

4749
01:17:10,239 --> 01:17:13,030
right and the truthful answer is no
okay yeah so you know and and and and

4750
01:17:13,030 --> 01:17:13,040
okay yeah so you know and and and and
 

4751
01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:14,310
okay yeah so you know and and and and
and that's what you really mean in

4752
01:17:14,310 --> 01:17:14,320
and that's what you really mean in
 

4753
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:15,750
and that's what you really mean in
saying that you know you have

4754
01:17:15,750 --> 01:17:15,760
saying that you know you have
 

4755
01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:18,550
saying that you know you have
you know better than 98 odds for

4756
01:17:18,550 --> 01:17:18,560
you know better than 98 odds for
 

4757
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:19,110
you know better than 98 odds for
something

4758
01:17:19,110 --> 01:17:19,120
something
 

4759
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:22,310
something
okay but um so so yeah you know i mean

4760
01:17:22,310 --> 01:17:22,320
okay but um so so yeah you know i mean
 

4761
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:24,310
okay but um so so yeah you know i mean
there could certainly be surprises and

4762
01:17:24,310 --> 01:17:24,320
there could certainly be surprises and
 

4763
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:25,510
there could certainly be surprises and
look if p

4764
01:17:25,510 --> 01:17:25,520
look if p
 

4765
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:27,510
look if p
equals np well then there would be the

4766
01:17:27,510 --> 01:17:27,520
equals np well then there would be the
 

4767
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:28,709
equals np well then there would be the
further question

4768
01:17:28,709 --> 01:17:28,719
further question
 

4769
01:17:28,719 --> 01:17:30,950
further question
of you know is the algorithm actually

4770
01:17:30,950 --> 01:17:30,960
of you know is the algorithm actually
 

4771
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:32,709
of you know is the algorithm actually
efficient in practice

4772
01:17:32,709 --> 01:17:32,719
efficient in practice
 

4773
01:17:32,719 --> 01:17:35,430
efficient in practice
right i mean don knuth who i know that

4774
01:17:35,430 --> 01:17:35,440
right i mean don knuth who i know that
 

4775
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:36,790
right i mean don knuth who i know that
you you've interviewed as well

4776
01:17:36,790 --> 01:17:36,800
you you've interviewed as well
 

4777
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:39,830
you you've interviewed as well
right he uh likes to conjecture that p

4778
01:17:39,830 --> 01:17:39,840
right he uh likes to conjecture that p
 

4779
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:42,550
right he uh likes to conjecture that p
equals np but that the algorithm is so

4780
01:17:42,550 --> 01:17:42,560
equals np but that the algorithm is so
 

4781
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:44,070
equals np but that the algorithm is so
inefficient that it doesn't matter

4782
01:17:44,070 --> 01:17:44,080
inefficient that it doesn't matter
 

4783
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:46,790
inefficient that it doesn't matter
anyway right now i i don't know i've

4784
01:17:46,790 --> 01:17:46,800
anyway right now i i don't know i've
 

4785
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:48,709
anyway right now i i don't know i've
listened to him say that i don't know

4786
01:17:48,709 --> 01:17:48,719
listened to him say that i don't know
 

4787
01:17:48,719 --> 01:17:50,870
listened to him say that i don't know
whether he says that just because he has

4788
01:17:50,870 --> 01:17:50,880
whether he says that just because he has
 

4789
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:52,790
whether he says that just because he has
an actual reason for thinking it's true

4790
01:17:52,790 --> 01:17:52,800
an actual reason for thinking it's true
 

4791
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:54,390
an actual reason for thinking it's true
or just because it sounds cool

4792
01:17:54,390 --> 01:17:54,400
or just because it sounds cool
 

4793
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:57,110
or just because it sounds cool
yeah okay but um but you know that

4794
01:17:57,110 --> 01:17:57,120
yeah okay but um but you know that
 

4795
01:17:57,120 --> 01:17:59,189
yeah okay but um but you know that
that's a logical possibility right that

4796
01:17:59,189 --> 01:17:59,199
that's a logical possibility right that
 

4797
01:17:59,199 --> 01:18:00,470
that's a logical possibility right that
the algorithm could be

4798
01:18:00,470 --> 01:18:00,480
the algorithm could be
 

4799
01:18:00,480 --> 01:18:03,350
the algorithm could be
n to the 10 000 time or it could even

4800
01:18:03,350 --> 01:18:03,360
n to the 10 000 time or it could even
 

4801
01:18:03,360 --> 01:18:03,990
n to the 10 000 time or it could even
just be n

4802
01:18:03,990 --> 01:18:04,000
just be n
 

4803
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,229
just be n
squared time but with a leading constant

4804
01:18:06,229 --> 01:18:06,239
squared time but with a leading constant
 

4805
01:18:06,239 --> 01:18:08,310
squared time but with a leading constant
of a it could be a google times n

4806
01:18:08,310 --> 01:18:08,320
of a it could be a google times n
 

4807
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:10,070
of a it could be a google times n
squared or something like that and in

4808
01:18:10,070 --> 01:18:10,080
squared or something like that and in
 

4809
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:12,790
squared or something like that and in
that case the fact that p equals np

4810
01:18:12,790 --> 01:18:12,800
that case the fact that p equals np
 

4811
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:15,430
that case the fact that p equals np
well it would it would uh you know

4812
01:18:15,430 --> 01:18:15,440
well it would it would uh you know
 

4813
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:16,950
well it would it would uh you know
ravage the whole theory

4814
01:18:16,950 --> 01:18:16,960
ravage the whole theory
 

4815
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:18,950
ravage the whole theory
of uh complexity we would have to you

4816
01:18:18,950 --> 01:18:18,960
of uh complexity we would have to you
 

4817
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:20,870
of uh complexity we would have to you
know rebuild from the ground up

4818
01:18:20,870 --> 01:18:20,880
know rebuild from the ground up
 

4819
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:22,870
know rebuild from the ground up
but in practical terms it might mean

4820
01:18:22,870 --> 01:18:22,880
but in practical terms it might mean
 

4821
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:24,870
but in practical terms it might mean
very little right

4822
01:18:24,870 --> 01:18:24,880
very little right
 

4823
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:26,790
very little right
if the algorithm was too inefficient to

4824
01:18:26,790 --> 01:18:26,800
if the algorithm was too inefficient to
 

4825
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:28,790
if the algorithm was too inefficient to
run if the algorithm

4826
01:18:28,790 --> 01:18:28,800
run if the algorithm
 

4827
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:31,270
run if the algorithm
could actually be run in practice like

4828
01:18:31,270 --> 01:18:31,280
could actually be run in practice like
 

4829
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:33,669
could actually be run in practice like
if if it had small enough constants

4830
01:18:33,669 --> 01:18:33,679
if if it had small enough constants
 

4831
01:18:33,679 --> 01:18:35,830
if if it had small enough constants
you know to or if you could improve it

4832
01:18:35,830 --> 01:18:35,840
you know to or if you could improve it
 

4833
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:36,790
you know to or if you could improve it
to where it had

4834
01:18:36,790 --> 01:18:36,800
to where it had
 

4835
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:39,030
to where it had
small enough constants that it was uh

4836
01:18:39,030 --> 01:18:39,040
small enough constants that it was uh
 

4837
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:40,390
small enough constants that it was uh
efficient in practice

4838
01:18:40,390 --> 01:18:40,400
efficient in practice
 

4839
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:42,470
efficient in practice
then that would change the world okay

4840
01:18:42,470 --> 01:18:42,480
then that would change the world okay
 

4841
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:43,830
then that would change the world okay
you think it would have like what kind

4842
01:18:43,830 --> 01:18:43,840
you think it would have like what kind
 

4843
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:44,390
you think it would have like what kind
of impact

4844
01:18:44,390 --> 01:18:44,400
of impact
 

4845
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:45,750
of impact
well okay i mean i mean here's an

4846
01:18:45,750 --> 01:18:45,760
well okay i mean i mean here's an
 

4847
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:48,229
well okay i mean i mean here's an
example i mean you could well okay

4848
01:18:48,229 --> 01:18:48,239
example i mean you could well okay
 

4849
01:18:48,239 --> 01:18:50,790
example i mean you could well okay
just for starters you could break

4850
01:18:50,790 --> 01:18:50,800
just for starters you could break
 

4851
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:52,470
just for starters you could break
basically all of the encryption that

4852
01:18:52,470 --> 01:18:52,480
basically all of the encryption that
 

4853
01:18:52,480 --> 01:18:54,310
basically all of the encryption that
people use to protect the internet first

4854
01:18:54,310 --> 01:18:54,320
people use to protect the internet first
 

4855
01:18:54,320 --> 01:18:55,990
people use to protect the internet first
you could you could break bitcoin and

4856
01:18:55,990 --> 01:18:56,000
you could you could break bitcoin and
 

4857
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,310
you could you could break bitcoin and
every other cryptocurrency or you know

4858
01:18:58,310 --> 01:18:58,320
every other cryptocurrency or you know
 

4859
01:18:58,320 --> 01:19:00,950
every other cryptocurrency or you know
uh mine as much bitcoin as you wanted

4860
01:19:00,950 --> 01:19:00,960
uh mine as much bitcoin as you wanted
 

4861
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:01,590
uh mine as much bitcoin as you wanted
right

4862
01:19:01,590 --> 01:19:01,600
right
 

4863
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:05,189
right
uh you know become a you know become a a

4864
01:19:05,189 --> 01:19:05,199
uh you know become a you know become a a
 

4865
01:19:05,199 --> 01:19:07,270
uh you know become a you know become a a
super duper billionaire right and then

4866
01:19:07,270 --> 01:19:07,280
super duper billionaire right and then
 

4867
01:19:07,280 --> 01:19:09,030
super duper billionaire right and then
and then plot your next move

4868
01:19:09,030 --> 01:19:09,040
and then plot your next move
 

4869
01:19:09,040 --> 01:19:10,470
and then plot your next move
right okay that's just for starters

4870
01:19:10,470 --> 01:19:10,480
right okay that's just for starters
 

4871
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:13,110
right okay that's just for starters
right right now your next move might be

4872
01:19:13,110 --> 01:19:13,120
right right now your next move might be
 

4873
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:14,149
right right now your next move might be
something like

4874
01:19:14,149 --> 01:19:14,159
something like
 

4875
01:19:14,159 --> 01:19:16,149
something like
you know you now have like a

4876
01:19:16,149 --> 01:19:16,159
you know you now have like a
 

4877
01:19:16,159 --> 01:19:17,910
you know you now have like a
theoretically optimal way

4878
01:19:17,910 --> 01:19:17,920
theoretically optimal way
 

4879
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:20,149
theoretically optimal way
to train any neural network to find

parameters for any neural network right
so you could now say like is there any

4884
01:19:24,709 --> 01:19:24,719
so you could now say like is there any
 

4885
01:19:24,719 --> 01:19:26,870
so you could now say like is there any

is the biggest of all of these questions
 

4933
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:13,830
is the biggest of all of these questions
is that if you had this fast algorithm

is that if you had this fast algorithm
 

4935
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:15,669
is that if you had this fast algorithm
then you could solve all seven of them

then you could solve all seven of them
okay you just ask your computer you know

4938
01:20:18,070 --> 01:20:18,080
okay you just ask your computer you know

hypothesis
 

4943
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:22,790
hypothesis
right you know that a machine could in a

4944
01:20:22,790 --> 01:20:22,800
right you know that a machine could in a
 

4945
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:25,189
right you know that a machine could in a
language where a machine could verify it

language where a machine could verify it
 

4947
01:20:25,199 --> 01:20:27,189
language where a machine could verify it
and provided that such a proof exists

4948
01:20:27,189 --> 01:20:27,199
and provided that such a proof exists
 

4949
01:20:27,199 --> 01:20:28,629
and provided that such a proof exists
then your computer finds it

4950
01:20:28,629 --> 01:20:28,639
then your computer finds it
 

4951
01:20:28,639 --> 01:20:30,709
then your computer finds it
in a short amount of time without having

4952
01:20:30,709 --> 01:20:30,719
in a short amount of time without having
 

4953
01:20:30,719 --> 01:20:32,229
in a short amount of time without having
to do a brute force search

4954
01:20:32,229 --> 01:20:32,239
to do a brute force search
 

4955
01:20:32,239 --> 01:20:33,669
to do a brute force search
okay so i mean i mean those are the

4956
01:20:33,669 --> 01:20:33,679
okay so i mean i mean those are the
 

4957
01:20:33,679 --> 01:20:35,430
okay so i mean i mean those are the
stakes of what we're talking about

4958
01:20:35,430 --> 01:20:35,440
stakes of what we're talking about
 

4959
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:38,070
stakes of what we're talking about
but i hope that also helps to give your

4960
01:20:38,070 --> 01:20:38,080
but i hope that also helps to give your
 

4961
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:39,830
but i hope that also helps to give your
listeners some intuition

4962
01:20:39,830 --> 01:20:39,840
listeners some intuition

is it possible i apologize this is a

4968
01:20:48,470 --> 01:20:48,480
is it possible i apologize this is a
 

4969
01:20:48,480 --> 01:20:50,310
is it possible i apologize this is a
really dumb question but is it possible

4970
01:20:50,310 --> 01:20:50,320
really dumb question but is it possible
 

4971
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:51,350
really dumb question but is it possible
to

4972
01:20:51,350 --> 01:20:51,360
to
 

4973
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:53,430
to
that proof will come out that p equals

4977
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:58,070

but an algorithm that makes p

4978
01:20:58,070 --> 01:20:58,080
but an algorithm that makes p
 

4979
01:20:58,080 --> 01:21:01,110
but an algorithm that makes p
equals np is impossible to find

equals np is impossible to find
 

4981
01:21:01,120 --> 01:21:03,830
equals np is impossible to find
um is that like crazy okay well well if

4982
01:21:03,830 --> 01:21:03,840
um is that like crazy okay well well if
 

4983
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:04,950
um is that like crazy okay well well if
p equals np

4984
01:21:04,950 --> 01:21:04,960
p equals np
 

4985
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:06,790
p equals np
it would mean that there is such an

4986
01:21:06,790 --> 01:21:06,800
it would mean that there is such an
 

4987
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:09,350
it would mean that there is such an
algorithm that it exists yeah

4988
01:21:09,350 --> 01:21:09,360
algorithm that it exists yeah
 

4989
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:12,950
algorithm that it exists yeah
but um um you know it would it would

4990
01:21:12,950 --> 01:21:12,960
but um um you know it would it would
 

4991
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:14,070
but um um you know it would it would
mean that it exists

4992
01:21:14,070 --> 01:21:14,080
mean that it exists
 

4993
01:21:14,080 --> 01:21:16,470
mean that it exists
now you know in practice normally the

4994
01:21:16,470 --> 01:21:16,480
now you know in practice normally the
 

4995
01:21:16,480 --> 01:21:17,270
now you know in practice normally the
way that we

4996

way that we
 

4997
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:19,110
way that we
would prove anything like that would be

4998
01:21:19,110 --> 01:21:19,120
would prove anything like that would be
 

4999
01:21:19,120 --> 01:21:20,790
would prove anything like that would be
by finding the algorithm by finding that

5000
01:21:20,790 --> 01:21:20,800
by finding the algorithm by finding that
 

5001
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:21,350
by finding the algorithm by finding that
one algorithm

5002
01:21:21,350 --> 01:21:21,360
one algorithm
 

5003
01:21:21,360 --> 01:21:23,149
one algorithm
but there is such a thing as a

5004
01:21:23,149 --> 01:21:23,159
but there is such a thing as a
 

5005
01:21:23,159 --> 01:21:24,709
but there is such a thing as a
non-constructive proof

5006
01:21:24,709 --> 01:21:24,719
non-constructive proof
 

5007
01:21:24,719 --> 01:21:26,790
non-constructive proof
that an algorithm exists you know this

5008
01:21:26,790 --> 01:21:26,800
that an algorithm exists you know this
 

5009
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:29,030
that an algorithm exists you know this
is really only reared its head i think a

5010
01:21:29,030 --> 01:21:29,040
is really only reared its head i think a
 

5011
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:29,830
is really only reared its head i think a
few times

5012
01:21:29,830 --> 01:21:29,840
few times
 

5013
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:32,709
few times
in the history of our field right but

5014
01:21:32,709 --> 01:21:32,719
in the history of our field right but
 

5015
01:21:32,719 --> 01:21:33,510
in the history of our field right but
you know it is

5016
01:21:33,510 --> 01:21:33,520
you know it is
 

5017
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:36,149
you know it is
it is theoretically possible that that

5018
01:21:36,149 --> 01:21:36,159
it is theoretically possible that that
 

5019
01:21:36,159 --> 01:21:36,790
it is theoretically possible that that
that

5020
01:21:36,790 --> 01:21:36,800
that
 

5021
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:38,629
that
that such a thing could happen but you

5022
01:21:38,629 --> 01:21:38,639
that such a thing could happen but you
 

5023
01:21:38,639 --> 01:21:40,149
that such a thing could happen but you
know there are so even here there are

5024
01:21:40,149 --> 01:21:40,159
know there are so even here there are
 

5025
01:21:40,159 --> 01:21:42,470
know there are so even here there are
some amusing observations that one could

5026
01:21:42,470 --> 01:21:42,480
some amusing observations that one could
 

5027
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:43,030
some amusing observations that one could
make

5028
01:21:43,030 --> 01:21:43,040
make
 

5029
01:21:43,040 --> 01:21:45,590
make
so there is this famous observation of

5030
01:21:45,590 --> 01:21:45,600
so there is this famous observation of
 

5031
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:46,870
so there is this famous observation of
leonid levin

5032
01:21:46,870 --> 01:21:46,880
leonid levin
 

5033
01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:48,550
leonid levin
who is you know one of the original

5034
01:21:48,550 --> 01:21:48,560
who is you know one of the original
 

5035
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:50,870
who is you know one of the original
discoverers of np completeness right and

5036
01:21:50,870 --> 01:21:50,880
discoverers of np completeness right and
 

5037
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:51,669
discoverers of np completeness right and
he said

5038
01:21:51,669 --> 01:21:51,679
he said
 

5039
01:21:51,679 --> 01:21:54,070
he said
well consider the following algorithm

5040
01:21:54,070 --> 01:21:54,080
well consider the following algorithm
 

5041
01:21:54,080 --> 01:21:56,070
well consider the following algorithm
that like i i guarantee

5042
01:21:56,070 --> 01:21:56,080
that like i i guarantee
 

5043
01:21:56,080 --> 01:21:59,030
that like i i guarantee
we'll solve the np problems efficiently

5044
01:21:59,030 --> 01:21:59,040
we'll solve the np problems efficiently
 

5045
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:00,550
we'll solve the np problems efficiently
just as provided that p

5046
01:22:00,550 --> 01:22:00,560
just as provided that p
 

5047
01:22:00,560 --> 01:22:03,669
just as provided that p
equals np okay here is what it does it

5048
01:22:03,669 --> 01:22:03,679
equals np okay here is what it does it
 

5049
01:22:03,679 --> 01:22:04,229
equals np okay here is what it does it
just

5050
01:22:04,229 --> 01:22:04,239
just
 

5051
01:22:04,239 --> 01:22:06,629
just
runs you know it enumerates every

01:22:06,629 --> 01:22:06,639
runs you know it enumerates every
 

5053
01:22:06,639 --> 01:22:07,990
runs you know it enumerates every
possible algorithm

5054
01:22:07,990 --> 01:22:08,000
possible algorithm
 

5055
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,709
possible algorithm
in a gigantic infinite list yeah right

5056
01:22:10,709 --> 01:22:10,719
in a gigantic infinite list yeah right
 

5057
01:22:10,719 --> 01:22:12,709
in a gigantic infinite list yeah right
from like in like alphabetical order

5058
01:22:12,709 --> 01:22:12,719
from like in like alphabetical order
 

5059
01:22:12,719 --> 01:22:13,270
from like in like alphabetical order
right

5060
01:22:13,270 --> 01:22:13,280
right
 

5061
01:22:13,280 --> 01:22:15,030
right
you know and many of them maybe won't

5062
01:22:15,030 --> 01:22:15,040
you know and many of them maybe won't
 

5063
01:22:15,040 --> 01:22:17,030
you know and many of them maybe won't
even compile so we just ignore those

5064
01:22:17,030 --> 01:22:17,040
even compile so we just ignore those
 

5065
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:18,070
even compile so we just ignore those
okay but now

5066
01:22:18,070 --> 01:22:18,080
okay but now
 

5067
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:20,709
okay but now
we just you know run the first algorithm

5068
01:22:20,709 --> 01:22:20,719
we just you know run the first algorithm
 

5069
01:22:20,719 --> 01:22:22,790
we just you know run the first algorithm
then we run the second algorithm we run

5070
01:22:22,790 --> 01:22:22,800
then we run the second algorithm we run
 

5071
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:23,990
then we run the second algorithm we run
the first one a little bit

5072
01:22:23,990 --> 01:22:24,000
the first one a little bit
 

5073
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:25,910
the first one a little bit
more then we run the first three

5074
01:22:25,910 --> 01:22:25,920
more then we run the first three
 

5075
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:27,830
more then we run the first three
algorithms for a while we won the first

5076
01:22:27,830 --> 01:22:27,840
algorithms for a while we won the first
 

5077
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:28,790
algorithms for a while we won the first
four for a while

5078
01:22:28,790 --> 01:22:28,800
four for a while
 

5079
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:30,629
four for a while
this is called dovetailing by the way

5080
01:22:30,629 --> 01:22:30,639
this is called dovetailing by the way
 

5081
01:22:30,639 --> 01:22:32,229
this is called dovetailing by the way
this is a known trick

5082
01:22:32,229 --> 01:22:32,239
this is a known trick
 

5083
01:22:32,239 --> 01:22:35,350
this is a known trick
in um uh um theoretical computer science

5084
01:22:35,350 --> 01:22:35,360
in um uh um theoretical computer science
 

5085
01:22:35,360 --> 01:22:36,149
in um uh um theoretical computer science
okay but

5086
01:22:36,149 --> 01:22:36,159
okay but
 

5087
01:22:36,159 --> 01:22:38,149
okay but
we do it in such a way that you know

5088
01:22:38,149 --> 01:22:38,159
we do it in such a way that you know
 

5089
01:22:38,159 --> 01:22:40,070
we do it in such a way that you know
whatever is the algorithm

5090
01:22:40,070 --> 01:22:40,080
whatever is the algorithm
 

5091
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:43,750
whatever is the algorithm
out there in in in our list that solves

5092
01:22:43,750 --> 01:22:43,760
out there in in in our list that solves
 

5093
01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:45,750
out there in in in our list that solves
np-complete you know the np problems

5094
01:22:45,750 --> 01:22:45,760
np-complete you know the np problems
 

5095
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:48,629
np-complete you know the np problems
efficiently will eventually hit that one

5096
01:22:48,629 --> 01:22:48,639
efficiently will eventually hit that one
 

5097
01:22:48,639 --> 01:22:50,390
efficiently will eventually hit that one
right and now the key is that whenever

5098
01:22:50,390 --> 01:22:50,400
right and now the key is that whenever
 

5099
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:51,669
right and now the key is that whenever
we hit that one

5100
01:22:51,669 --> 01:22:51,679
we hit that one
 

5101
01:22:51,679 --> 01:22:54,310
we hit that one
you know it you know by assumption it

5102
01:22:54,310 --> 01:22:54,320
you know it you know by assumption it
 

5103
01:22:54,320 --> 01:22:56,229
you know it you know by assumption it
has to solve the problem that's to find

5104
01:22:56,229 --> 01:22:56,239
has to solve the problem that's to find
 

5105
01:22:56,239 --> 01:22:57,030
has to solve the problem that's to find
the solution

5106
01:22:57,030 --> 01:22:57,040
the solution
 

5107
01:22:57,040 --> 01:22:59,430
the solution
and once it claims to find a solution

5108
01:22:59,430 --> 01:22:59,440
and once it claims to find a solution
 

5109
01:22:59,440 --> 01:23:01,110
and once it claims to find a solution
then we can check that ourself

5110
01:23:01,110 --> 01:23:01,120
then we can check that ourself
 

5111
01:23:01,120 --> 01:23:02,950
then we can check that ourself
right because these are increasing

5112
01:23:02,950 --> 01:23:02,960
right because these are increasing
 

5113
01:23:02,960 --> 01:23:04,790
right because these are increasing
problems then we can check it

5114
01:23:04,790 --> 01:23:04,800
problems then we can check it
 

5115
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:07,110
problems then we can check it
now this is utterly impractical all

5116
01:23:07,110 --> 01:23:07,120
now this is utterly impractical all
 

5117
01:23:07,120 --> 01:23:09,030
now this is utterly impractical all
right you know you'd have to do this

5118
01:23:09,030 --> 01:23:09,040
right you know you'd have to do this
 

5119
01:23:09,040 --> 01:23:11,910
right you know you'd have to do this
enormous exhaustive search among all the

5120
01:23:11,910 --> 01:23:11,920
enormous exhaustive search among all the
 

5121
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:12,870
enormous exhaustive search among all the
algorithms

5122
01:23:12,870 --> 01:23:12,880
algorithms
 

5123
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:14,390
algorithms
but from a certain theoretical

5124
01:23:14,390 --> 01:23:14,400
but from a certain theoretical
 

5125
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:16,950
but from a certain theoretical
standpoint that is merely a constant

5126
01:23:16,950 --> 01:23:16,960
standpoint that is merely a constant
 

5127
01:23:16,960 --> 01:23:18,950
standpoint that is merely a constant
prefactor

5128
01:23:18,950 --> 01:23:18,960
prefactor
 

5129
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:20,470
prefactor
that's merely a multiplier of your

5130
01:23:20,470 --> 01:23:20,480
that's merely a multiplier of your
 

5131
01:23:20,480 --> 01:23:22,470
that's merely a multiplier of your
running time so there are tricks like

5132
01:23:22,470 --> 01:23:22,480
running time so there are tricks like
 

5133
01:23:22,480 --> 01:23:24,070
running time so there are tricks like
that one can do to say that

5134
01:23:24,070 --> 01:23:24,080
that one can do to say that
 

5135
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:25,910
that one can do to say that
in some sense the algorithm would have

5136
01:23:25,910 --> 01:23:25,920
in some sense the algorithm would have
 

5137
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:27,750
in some sense the algorithm would have
to be uh constructive

5138
01:23:27,750 --> 01:23:27,760
to be uh constructive
 

5139
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:30,550
to be uh constructive
but you know in in in the human sense

5140
01:23:30,550 --> 01:23:30,560
but you know in in in the human sense
 

5141
01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:32,790
but you know in in in the human sense
you know it is possible that

5142
01:23:32,790 --> 01:23:32,800
you know it is possible that
 

5143
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:34,470
you know it is possible that
you know it's conceivable that one could

5144
01:23:34,470 --> 01:23:34,480
you know it's conceivable that one could
 

5145
01:23:34,480 --> 01:23:36,550
you know it's conceivable that one could
prove such a thing uh via a

5146
01:23:36,550 --> 01:23:36,560
prove such a thing uh via a
 

5147
01:23:36,560 --> 01:23:38,310
prove such a thing uh via a
non-constructive method is is that

5148
01:23:38,310 --> 01:23:38,320
non-constructive method is is that
 

5149
01:23:38,320 --> 01:23:40,310
non-constructive method is is that
likely i don't think so first no no

5150
01:23:40,310 --> 01:23:40,320
likely i don't think so first no no
 

5151
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:43,510
likely i don't think so first no no
no not personally so that's p and and p

5152
01:23:43,510 --> 01:23:43,520
no not personally so that's p and and p
 

5153
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:45,910
no not personally so that's p and and p
but the complexities it was full of

5154
01:23:45,910 --> 01:23:45,920
but the complexities it was full of
 

5155
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:47,590
but the complexities it was full of
wonderful creatures well it's got about

5156
01:23:47,590 --> 01:23:47,600
wonderful creatures well it's got about
 

5157
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:49,590
wonderful creatures well it's got about
500 of them 500.

5158
01:23:49,590 --> 01:23:49,600
500 of them 500.
 

5159
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:52,790
500 of them 500.
so how do you get uh yeah

5160
01:23:52,790 --> 01:23:52,800
so how do you get uh yeah
 

5161
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:54,229
so how do you get uh yeah
yeah how do you get more how do you yeah

5162
01:23:54,229 --> 01:23:54,239
yeah how do you get more how do you yeah
 

5163
01:23:54,239 --> 01:23:56,229
yeah how do you get more how do you yeah
well yeah well okay i mean i mean

5164
01:23:56,229 --> 01:23:56,239
well yeah well okay i mean i mean
 

5165
01:23:56,239 --> 01:23:58,550
well yeah well okay i mean i mean
i mean just for starters there is

5166
01:23:58,550 --> 01:23:58,560
i mean just for starters there is
 

5167
01:23:58,560 --> 01:24:00,310
i mean just for starters there is
everything that we could do

5168
01:24:00,310 --> 01:24:00,320
everything that we could do
 

5169
01:24:00,320 --> 01:24:03,189
everything that we could do
with a conventional computer with a

5170
01:24:03,189 --> 01:24:03,199
with a conventional computer with a
 

5171
01:24:03,199 --> 01:24:05,189
with a conventional computer with a
polynomial amount of memory

5172
01:24:05,189 --> 01:24:05,199
polynomial amount of memory
 

5173
01:24:05,199 --> 01:24:07,350
polynomial amount of memory
okay but possibly an exponential amount

5174
01:24:07,350 --> 01:24:07,360
okay but possibly an exponential amount
 

5175
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:09,830
okay but possibly an exponential amount
of time because we get to reuse the same

5176
01:24:09,830 --> 01:24:09,840
of time because we get to reuse the same
 

5177
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:11,669
of time because we get to reuse the same
memory over and over again

5178
01:24:11,669 --> 01:24:11,679
memory over and over again
 

5179
01:24:11,679 --> 01:24:14,709
memory over and over again
okay that is called p space okay and

5180
01:24:14,709 --> 01:24:14,719
okay that is called p space okay and
 

5181
01:24:14,719 --> 01:24:16,149
okay that is called p space okay and
that's actually a

5182
01:24:16,149 --> 01:24:16,159
that's actually a
 

5183
01:24:16,159 --> 01:24:19,430
that's actually a
uh we think an even larger class than np

5184
01:24:19,430 --> 01:24:19,440
uh we think an even larger class than np
 

5185
01:24:19,440 --> 01:24:22,390
uh we think an even larger class than np
okay well p is contained in np which is

5186
01:24:22,390 --> 01:24:22,400

that's called bpp bounded our

5354
01:27:03,430 --> 01:27:03,440
that's called bpp bounded our
 

5355
01:27:03,440 --> 01:27:05,669
that's called bpp bounded our
probabilistic polynomial time

5356
01:27:05,669 --> 01:27:05,679
probabilistic polynomial time
 

5357
01:27:05,679 --> 01:27:07,030
probabilistic polynomial time
and then of course there's one that's

5358
01:27:07,030 --> 01:27:07,040
and then of course there's one that's
 

5359
01:27:07,040 --> 01:27:08,790
and then of course there's one that's
very close to my own heart

5360
01:27:08,790 --> 01:27:08,800
very close to my own heart
 

5361
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:11,110
very close to my own heart
what you can efficiently do during

5362
01:27:11,110 --> 01:27:11,120
what you can efficiently do during
 

5363
01:27:11,120 --> 01:27:12,310
what you can efficiently do during
polynomial time

5364
01:27:12,310 --> 01:27:12,320
polynomial time
 

5365
01:27:12,320 --> 01:27:14,470
polynomial time
using a quantum computer okay and that's

5366
01:27:14,470 --> 01:27:14,480
using a quantum computer okay and that's
 

5367
01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:16,070
using a quantum computer okay and that's
called bqp

5368
01:27:16,070 --> 01:27:16,080
called bqp
 

5369
01:27:16,080 --> 01:27:19,110
called bqp
right and so you know what's understood

5370
01:27:19,110 --> 01:27:19,120
right and so you know what's understood
 

5371
01:27:19,120 --> 01:27:20,149
right and so you know what's understood
about that class

5372
01:27:20,149 --> 01:27:20,159
about that class
 

5373
01:27:20,159 --> 01:27:23,430
about that class
okay so p is contained in bpp

5374
01:27:23,430 --> 01:27:23,440
okay so p is contained in bpp
 

5375
01:27:23,440 --> 01:27:25,830
okay so p is contained in bpp
which is contained in bqp which is

5376
01:27:25,830 --> 01:27:25,840
which is contained in bqp which is
 

5377
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:26,709
which is contained in bqp which is
contained in p

5378
01:27:26,709 --> 01:27:26,719
contained in p
 

5379
01:27:26,719 --> 01:27:29,910
contained in p
space okay so anything you can in fact

5380
01:27:29,910 --> 01:27:29,920
space okay so anything you can in fact
 

5381
01:27:29,920 --> 01:27:30,790
space okay so anything you can in fact
in in like

5382
01:27:30,790 --> 01:27:30,800
in in like
 

5383
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:34,070
in in like
in something very similar to sharp p bqp

5384
01:27:34,070 --> 01:27:34,080
in something very similar to sharp p bqp
 

5385
01:27:34,080 --> 01:27:35,110
in something very similar to sharp p bqp
is basically

5386
01:27:35,110 --> 01:27:35,120
is basically
 

5387
01:27:35,120 --> 01:27:37,350
is basically
you know well it's contained in like p

5388
01:27:37,350 --> 01:27:37,360
you know well it's contained in like p
 

5389
01:27:37,360 --> 01:27:39,830
you know well it's contained in like p
with the magic power to solve sharp p

5390
01:27:39,830 --> 01:27:39,840
with the magic power to solve sharp p
 

5391
01:27:39,840 --> 01:27:42,870
with the magic power to solve sharp p
problems okay why why is bqp

5392
01:27:42,870 --> 01:27:42,880
problems okay why why is bqp
 

5393
01:27:42,880 --> 01:27:45,910
problems okay why why is bqp
contained in uh p space oh that's an

5394
01:27:45,910 --> 01:27:45,920
contained in uh p space oh that's an
 

5395
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:46,950
contained in uh p space oh that's an
excellent question

5396
01:27:46,950 --> 01:27:46,960
excellent question
 

5397
01:27:46,960 --> 01:27:49,990
excellent question
uh so uh there there is um

5398
01:27:49,990 --> 01:27:50,000
uh so uh there there is um
 

5399
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:51,910
uh so uh there there is um
well i mean one one has to prove that

5400
01:27:51,910 --> 01:27:51,920
well i mean one one has to prove that
 

5401
01:27:51,920 --> 01:27:53,030
well i mean one one has to prove that
okay but uh

5402
01:27:53,030 --> 01:27:53,040
okay but uh
 

5403
01:27:53,040 --> 01:27:55,669
okay but uh
the proof um uh you could you could

5404
01:27:55,669 --> 01:27:55,679
the proof um uh you could you could
 

5405
01:27:55,679 --> 01:27:56,390
the proof um uh you could you could
think of it

5406
01:27:56,390 --> 01:27:56,400
think of it
 

5407
01:27:56,400 --> 01:27:59,510
think of it
as uh using uh richard feynman's picture

5408
01:27:59,510 --> 01:27:59,520
as uh using uh richard feynman's picture
 

5409
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:00,950
as uh using uh richard feynman's picture
of quantum mechanics

5410
01:28:00,950 --> 01:28:00,960
of quantum mechanics
 

5411
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:02,629
of quantum mechanics
which is that you can always you know we

5412
01:28:02,629 --> 01:28:02,639
which is that you can always you know we
 

5413
01:28:02,639 --> 01:28:05,110
which is that you can always you know we
haven't really talked about uh

5414
01:28:05,110 --> 01:28:05,120
haven't really talked about uh
 

5415
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:06,629
haven't really talked about uh
quantum mechanics in this in this

5416
01:28:06,629 --> 01:28:06,639
quantum mechanics in this in this
 

5417
01:28:06,639 --> 01:28:08,550
quantum mechanics in this in this
conversation we we did in our previous

5418
01:28:08,550 --> 01:28:08,560
conversation we we did in our previous
 

5419
01:28:08,560 --> 01:28:08,870
conversation we we did in our previous
yeah

5420
01:28:08,870 --> 01:28:08,880
yeah
 

5421
01:28:08,880 --> 01:28:10,390
yeah
yeah we did last time but yeah we did

5422
01:28:10,390 --> 01:28:10,400
yeah we did last time but yeah we did
 

5423
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:11,990
yeah we did last time but yeah we did
last time okay but uh

5424
01:28:11,990 --> 01:28:12,000
last time okay but uh
 

5425
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:13,990
last time okay but uh
uh but basically you could always think

5426
01:28:13,990 --> 01:28:14,000
uh but basically you could always think
 

5427
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,149
uh but basically you could always think
of a quantum computation

5428
01:28:16,149 --> 01:28:16,159
of a quantum computation
 

5429
01:28:16,159 --> 01:28:18,870
of a quantum computation
as uh like a branching tree of

5430
01:28:18,870 --> 01:28:18,880
as uh like a branching tree of
 

5431
01:28:18,880 --> 01:28:20,070
as uh like a branching tree of
possibilities

5432
01:28:20,070 --> 01:28:20,080
possibilities
 

5433
01:28:20,080 --> 01:28:22,950
possibilities
where each pos each possible path that

5434
01:28:22,950 --> 01:28:22,960
where each pos each possible path that
 

5435
01:28:22,960 --> 01:28:23,990
where each pos each possible path that
you could take

5436
01:28:23,990 --> 01:28:24,000
you could take
 

5437
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,629
you could take
through you know your the space has a

5438
01:28:26,629 --> 01:28:26,639
through you know your the space has a
 

5439
01:28:26,639 --> 01:28:27,990
through you know your the space has a
complex number attached

5440
01:28:27,990 --> 01:28:28,000
complex number attached
 

5441
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:31,030
complex number attached
to it called an amplitude okay and now

5442
01:28:31,030 --> 01:28:31,040
to it called an amplitude okay and now
 

5443
01:28:31,040 --> 01:28:32,790
to it called an amplitude okay and now
the rule is you know when you make a

5444
01:28:32,790 --> 01:28:32,800
the rule is you know when you make a
 

5445
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:34,229
the rule is you know when you make a
measurement at the end

5446
01:28:34,229 --> 01:28:34,239
measurement at the end
 

5447
01:28:34,239 --> 01:28:37,030
measurement at the end
well you see a random answer okay but

5448
01:28:37,030 --> 01:28:37,040
well you see a random answer okay but
 

5449
01:28:37,040 --> 01:28:38,709
well you see a random answer okay but
quantum mechanics is all about

5450
01:28:38,709 --> 01:28:38,719
quantum mechanics is all about
 

5451
01:28:38,719 --> 01:28:40,790
quantum mechanics is all about
calculating the probability that you're

5452
01:28:40,790 --> 01:28:40,800
calculating the probability that you're
 

5453
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:43,270
calculating the probability that you're
going to see one potential answer versus

5454
01:28:43,270 --> 01:28:43,280
going to see one potential answer versus
 

5455
01:28:43,280 --> 01:28:44,070
going to see one potential answer versus
another one

5456
01:28:44,070 --> 01:28:44,080
another one
 

5457
01:28:44,080 --> 01:28:47,189
another one
right and the rule for calculating the

5458
01:28:47,189 --> 01:28:47,199
right and the rule for calculating the
 

5459
01:28:47,199 --> 01:28:49,750
right and the rule for calculating the
probability that you'll see some answer

5460
01:28:49,750 --> 01:28:49,760
probability that you'll see some answer
 

5461
01:28:49,760 --> 01:28:51,510
probability that you'll see some answer
is that you have to add up the

5462
01:28:51,510 --> 01:28:51,520
is that you have to add up the
 

5463
01:28:51,520 --> 01:28:53,910
is that you have to add up the
amplitudes for all of the paths that

5464
01:28:53,910 --> 01:28:53,920
amplitudes for all of the paths that
 

5465
01:28:53,920 --> 01:28:56,070
amplitudes for all of the paths that
could have led to that answer

5466
01:28:56,070 --> 01:28:56,080
could have led to that answer
 

5467
01:28:56,080 --> 01:28:57,990
could have led to that answer
and then you know that's a complex

5468
01:28:57,990 --> 01:28:58,000
and then you know that's a complex
 

5469
01:28:58,000 --> 01:28:59,750
and then you know that's a complex
number so that you know

5470
01:28:59,750 --> 01:28:59,760
number so that you know
 

5471
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:01,590
number so that you know
how could that be a probability then you

5472
01:29:01,590 --> 01:29:01,600
how could that be a probability then you
 

5473
01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:03,750
how could that be a probability then you
take the squared absolute value of the

5474
01:29:03,750 --> 01:29:03,760
take the squared absolute value of the
 

5475
01:29:03,760 --> 01:29:04,390
take the squared absolute value of the
result

5476
01:29:04,390 --> 01:29:04,400
result
 

5477
01:29:04,400 --> 01:29:06,229
result
that gives you a number between zero and

5478
01:29:06,229 --> 01:29:06,239
that gives you a number between zero and
 

5479
01:29:06,239 --> 01:29:07,590
that gives you a number between zero and
one okay

5480
01:29:07,590 --> 01:29:07,600
one okay
 

5481
01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:09,990
one okay
so um yeah i just i just summarized

5482
01:29:09,990 --> 01:29:10,000
so um yeah i just i just summarized
 

5483
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:11,990
so um yeah i just i just summarized
quantum mechanics in like 30 seconds

5484
01:29:11,990 --> 01:29:12,000
quantum mechanics in like 30 seconds
 

5485
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:15,030
quantum mechanics in like 30 seconds
okay but uh but now you know what what

5486
01:29:15,030 --> 01:29:15,040
okay but uh but now you know what what
 

5487
01:29:15,040 --> 01:29:15,350
okay but uh but now you know what what
this

5488
01:29:15,350 --> 01:29:15,360
this
 

5489
01:29:15,360 --> 01:29:17,750
this
already tells us is that anything i can

5490
01:29:17,750 --> 01:29:17,760
already tells us is that anything i can
 

5491
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:19,430
already tells us is that anything i can
do with a quantum computer

5492
01:29:19,430 --> 01:29:19,440
do with a quantum computer
 

5493
01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:21,270
do with a quantum computer
i could simulate with a classical

5494
01:29:21,270 --> 01:29:21,280
i could simulate with a classical
 

5495
01:29:21,280 --> 01:29:22,550
i could simulate with a classical
computer if i

5496
01:29:22,550 --> 01:29:22,560
computer if i
 

5497
01:29:22,560 --> 01:29:25,189
computer if i
only have exponentially more time okay

5498
01:29:25,189 --> 01:29:25,199
only have exponentially more time okay
 

5499
01:29:25,199 --> 01:29:25,590
only have exponentially more time okay
and why

5500
01:29:25,590 --> 01:29:25,600
and why
 

5501
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:28,149
and why
is that because if i have exponential

5502
01:29:28,149 --> 01:29:28,159
is that because if i have exponential
 

5503
01:29:28,159 --> 01:29:28,870
is that because if i have exponential
time

5504
01:29:28,870 --> 01:29:28,880
time
 

5505
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:31,030
time
i could just write down this entire

5506
01:29:31,030 --> 01:29:31,040
i could just write down this entire
 

5507
01:29:31,040 --> 01:29:32,470
i could just write down this entire
branching tree

5508
01:29:32,470 --> 01:29:32,480
branching tree
 

5509
01:29:32,480 --> 01:29:34,790
branching tree
and just explicitly calculate each of

5510
01:29:34,790 --> 01:29:34,800
and just explicitly calculate each of
 

5511
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:35,990
and just explicitly calculate each of
these amplitudes

5512
01:29:35,990 --> 01:29:36,000
these amplitudes
 

5513
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:37,669
these amplitudes
right you know that will be very

5514
01:29:37,669 --> 01:29:37,679
right you know that will be very
 

5515
01:29:37,679 --> 01:29:39,510
right you know that will be very
inefficient but it will work

5516
01:29:39,510 --> 01:29:39,520
inefficient but it will work
 

5517
01:29:39,520 --> 01:29:41,830
inefficient but it will work
right it's enough to show that quantum

5518
01:29:41,830 --> 01:29:41,840
right it's enough to show that quantum
 

5519
01:29:41,840 --> 01:29:43,110
right it's enough to show that quantum
computers could not

5520
01:29:43,110 --> 01:29:43,120
computers could not
 

5521
01:29:43,120 --> 01:29:45,270
computers could not
solve the halting problem or you know

5522
01:29:45,270 --> 01:29:45,280
solve the halting problem or you know
 

5523
01:29:45,280 --> 01:29:47,030
solve the halting problem or you know
they could never do anything that is

01:29:47,030 --> 01:29:47,040
they could never do anything that is
 

5525
01:29:47,040 --> 01:29:47,669
they could never do anything that is

uncomputable in touring sense okay but

5528
01:29:50,550 --> 01:29:50,560
uncomputable in touring sense okay but
 

5529
01:29:50,560 --> 01:29:51,510
uncomputable in touring sense okay but
now

5530
01:29:51,510 --> 01:29:51,520
now
 

5531
01:29:51,520 --> 01:29:53,270
now
as i said there is even a stronger

01:29:53,270 --> 01:29:53,280
as i said there is even a stronger
 

5533

is contained in p space the way that we

5536
01:29:58,229 --> 01:29:58,239
is contained in p space the way that we
 

5537
01:29:58,239 --> 01:29:59,350
is contained in p space the way that we
prove that

5538
01:29:59,350 --> 01:29:59,360
prove that
 

5539
01:29:59,360 --> 01:30:02,470
prove that
is that we say if if all i want is to

5540
01:30:02,470 --> 01:30:02,480
is that we say if if all i want is to
 

5541
01:30:02,480 --> 01:30:03,270
is that we say if if all i want is to
calculate

5542
01:30:03,270 --> 01:30:03,280
calculate
 

5543
01:30:03,280 --> 01:30:05,510
calculate
the probability of some particular

5544
01:30:05,510 --> 01:30:05,520
the probability of some particular
 

5545
01:30:05,520 --> 01:30:06,870
the probability of some particular
output happening

5546
01:30:06,870 --> 01:30:06,880

we know which is all i need to simulate

5548
01:30:08,709 --> 01:30:08,719
we know which is all i need to simulate
 

5549
01:30:08,719 --> 01:30:10,310
we know which is all i need to simulate
a quantum computer really

5550
01:30:10,310 --> 01:30:10,320
a quantum computer really
 

5551
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:12,149
a quantum computer really
then i don't need to write down the

5552
01:30:12,149 --> 01:30:12,159
then i don't need to write down the
 

5553
01:30:12,159 --> 01:30:13,590
then i don't need to write down the
entire quantum state

5554
01:30:13,590 --> 01:30:13,600
entire quantum state
 

5555
01:30:13,600 --> 01:30:16,390
entire quantum state
which is an exponentially large object

5556
01:30:16,390 --> 01:30:16,400
which is an exponentially large object
 

5557
01:30:16,400 --> 01:30:17,830
which is an exponentially large object
all i need to do

5558
01:30:17,830 --> 01:30:17,840
all i need to do
 

5559
01:30:17,840 --> 01:30:20,310
all i need to do
is just calculate what is the amplitude

5560
01:30:20,310 --> 01:30:20,320
is just calculate what is the amplitude
 

5561
01:30:20,320 --> 01:30:21,830
is just calculate what is the amplitude
for that final state

5562
01:30:21,830 --> 01:30:21,840
for that final state
 

5563
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:25,110
for that final state
and to do that i just have to sum up

5564
01:30:25,110 --> 01:30:25,120
and to do that i just have to sum up
 

5565
01:30:25,120 --> 01:30:27,110
and to do that i just have to sum up
all the amplitudes that lead to that

5566
01:30:27,110 --> 01:30:27,120
all the amplitudes that lead to that
 

5567
01:30:27,120 --> 01:30:29,510
all the amplitudes that lead to that
state okay so that's an exponentially

5568
01:30:29,510 --> 01:30:29,520
state okay so that's an exponentially
 

5569
01:30:29,520 --> 01:30:30,629
state okay so that's an exponentially
large sum

5570
01:30:30,629 --> 01:30:30,639
large sum
 

5571
01:30:30,639 --> 01:30:33,030
large sum
but i can calculate it just reusing the

5572
01:30:33,030 --> 01:30:33,040
but i can calculate it just reusing the
 

5573
01:30:33,040 --> 01:30:34,950
but i can calculate it just reusing the
same memory over and over

5574
01:30:34,950 --> 01:30:34,960
same memory over and over
 

5575
01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:37,350
same memory over and over
for each term in the song hence the p in

5576
01:30:37,350 --> 01:30:37,360
for each term in the song hence the p in
 

5577
01:30:37,360 --> 01:30:38,629
for each term in the song hence the p in
the pieces

5578
01:30:38,629 --> 01:30:38,639
the pieces
 

5579
01:30:38,639 --> 01:30:41,669
the pieces
yeah yeah so what uh

01:30:41,669 --> 01:30:41,679
yeah yeah so what uh
 

5581
01:30:41,679 --> 01:30:43,990
yeah yeah so what uh
out of that whole complexity zoo and it

01:30:43,990 --> 01:30:44,000
out of that whole complexity zoo and it
 

5583
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:45,750
out of that whole complexity zoo and it
could be bqp what do you find is the

5584
01:30:45,750 --> 01:30:45,760
could be bqp what do you find is the
 

5585
01:30:45,760 --> 01:30:47,270
could be bqp what do you find is the
most uh

5586
01:30:47,270 --> 01:30:47,280

01:31:46,320 --> 01:31:47,669
states were formed in the big bang or
something and they've just been sitting

there are no limits on how powerful it
could be

5652
01:31:56,229 --> 01:31:56,239
could be
 

5653
01:31:56,239 --> 01:31:58,149
could be
except that this state doesn't know in

5654
01:31:58,149 --> 01:31:58,159
except that this state doesn't know in

except that this state doesn't know in
advance which

5656
01:31:59,350 --> 01:31:59,360
advance which
 

5657
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:01,669
advance which
input you've got right it only knows the

5658
01:32:01,669 --> 01:32:01,679
input you've got right it only knows the
 

5659
01:32:01,679 --> 01:32:03,030
input you've got right it only knows the
size of your input

5660
01:32:03,030 --> 01:32:03,040
size of your input
 

5661
01:32:03,040 --> 01:32:05,270
size of your input
you know and then that that's bqp slash

5662
01:32:05,270 --> 01:32:05,280
you know and then that that's bqp slash
 

5663
01:32:05,280 --> 01:32:06,149
you know and then that that's bqp slash
q probably

5664
01:32:06,149 --> 01:32:06,159
q probably
 

5665
01:32:06,159 --> 01:32:07,669
q probably
so that's that's one that i just

5666
01:32:07,669 --> 01:32:07,679
so that's that's one that i just
 

5667
01:32:07,679 --> 01:32:09,189
so that's that's one that i just
personally happen to love

5668
01:32:09,189 --> 01:32:09,199
personally happen to love
 

5669
01:32:09,199 --> 01:32:12,310
personally happen to love
okay but um you know if you're asking

5670
01:32:12,310 --> 01:32:12,320
okay but um you know if you're asking
 

5671
01:32:12,320 --> 01:32:13,189
okay but um you know if you're asking
like what's the

5672
01:32:13,189 --> 01:32:13,199
like what's the
 

5673
01:32:13,199 --> 01:32:14,950
like what's the
you know there's there's there's a class

5674
01:32:14,950 --> 01:32:14,960
you know there's there's there's a class
 

5675
01:32:14,960 --> 01:32:16,390
you know there's there's there's a class

01:34:18,639 --> 01:34:21,350
right well like imagine that i had two
graphs and i wanted to convince you that

these two graphs are not
 

5797
01:34:22,880 --> 01:34:25,270
these two graphs are not
isomorphic meaning you know i cannot

you know you might have to do a very

5808
01:34:33,830 --> 01:34:33,840
you know you might have to do a very
 

5809
01:34:33,840 --> 01:34:35,990
you know you might have to do a very
exhaustive enumeration of you know all

5810
01:34:35,990 --> 01:34:36,000
exhaustive enumeration of you know all
 

5811

the different

5812
01:34:36,709 --> 01:34:36,719
the different
 

5813
01:34:36,719 --> 01:34:38,550
the different
permutations before you were convinced

5814
01:34:38,550 --> 01:34:38,560
permutations before you were convinced
 

5815
01:34:38,560 --> 01:34:40,629
permutations before you were convinced
that it was true but what if there were

5816
01:34:40,629 --> 01:34:40,639
that it was true but what if there were
 

5817
01:34:40,639 --> 01:34:41,350
that it was true but what if there were
some

5818
01:34:41,350 --> 01:34:41,360
some
 

5819
01:34:41,360 --> 01:34:43,830
some
all-knowing wizard that said to you look

5820
01:34:43,830 --> 01:34:43,840

5821
01:34:43,840 --> 01:34:44,950

i'll tell you what

5822
01:34:44,950 --> 01:34:44,960
i'll tell you what
 

5823
01:34:44,960 --> 01:34:47,270
i'll tell you what
just pick one of the graphs randomly

5824
01:34:47,270 --> 01:34:47,280
just pick one of the graphs randomly
 

5825
01:34:47,280 --> 01:34:49,189
just pick one of the graphs randomly
then randomly permute it

5826
01:34:49,189 --> 01:34:49,199
then randomly permute it
 

5827
01:34:49,199 --> 01:34:51,590
then randomly permute it
then send it to me and i will tell you

5828
01:34:51,590 --> 01:34:51,600
then send it to me and i will tell you
 

5829
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:54,149
then send it to me and i will tell you
which graph you started with

5830
01:34:54,149 --> 01:34:54,159
which graph you started with
 

5831
01:34:54,159 --> 01:34:56,149
which graph you started with
okay and i will do that every single

5832
01:34:56,149 --> 01:34:56,159
okay and i will do that every single
 

5833
01:34:56,159 --> 01:34:57,430
okay and i will do that every single
time

5834
01:34:57,430 --> 01:34:57,440
time
 

5835
01:34:57,440 --> 01:35:01,270
time
right and load that in

5837
01:35:01,280 --> 01:35:03,030

and let's say that that wizard did that

5838
01:35:03,030 --> 01:35:03,040
and let's say that that wizard did that
 

5839
01:35:03,040 --> 01:35:04,950
and let's say that that wizard did that
a hundred times and it was right every

5840
01:35:04,950 --> 01:35:04,960
a hundred times and it was right every
 

5841
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:06,070
a hundred times and it was right every
time yeah right

5842
01:35:06,070 --> 01:35:06,080
time yeah right
 

5843
01:35:06,080 --> 01:35:08,550
time yeah right
now if the graphs were isomorphic then

5844
01:35:08,550 --> 01:35:08,560
now if the graphs were isomorphic then
 

5845
01:35:08,560 --> 01:35:09,750
now if the graphs were isomorphic then
you know it would have been flipping a

5846
01:35:09,750 --> 01:35:09,760
you know it would have been flipping a
 

5847
01:35:09,760 --> 01:35:10,950
you know it would have been flipping a
coin each time

5848
01:35:10,950 --> 01:35:10,960
coin each time
 

5849
01:35:10,960 --> 01:35:12,950
coin each time
right it would have had only a one in

5850
01:35:12,950 --> 01:35:12,960
right it would have had only a one in
 

5851
01:35:12,960 --> 01:35:13,990
right it would have had only a one in
two to the 100

5852
01:35:13,990 --> 01:35:14,000
two to the 100
 

5853
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,149
two to the 100
power chance of you know of guessing

5854
01:35:16,149 --> 01:35:16,159
power chance of you know of guessing
 

5855
01:35:16,159 --> 01:35:17,350
power chance of you know of guessing
right each time

5856
01:35:17,350 --> 01:35:17,360
right each time
 

5857
01:35:17,360 --> 01:35:19,430
right each time
but you know so so if it's right every

5858
01:35:19,430 --> 01:35:19,440
but you know so so if it's right every
 

5859
01:35:19,440 --> 01:35:21,430
but you know so so if it's right every
time then now you're statistically

5860
01:35:21,430 --> 01:35:21,440
time then now you're statistically
 

5861
01:35:21,440 --> 01:35:23,109
time then now you're statistically
convinced that these graphs are not

5862
01:35:23,109 --> 01:35:23,119
convinced that these graphs are not
 

5863
01:35:23,119 --> 01:35:24,310
convinced that these graphs are not
isomorphic

5864
01:35:24,310 --> 01:35:24,320
isomorphic
 

5865
01:35:24,320 --> 01:35:25,990
isomorphic
even though you've learned nothing new

5866
01:35:25,990 --> 01:35:26,000
even though you've learned nothing new
 

5867
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,390
even though you've learned nothing new
about why they aren't so fascinating so

5868
01:35:28,390 --> 01:35:28,400
about why they aren't so fascinating so
 

5869
01:35:28,400 --> 01:35:29,109
about why they aren't so fascinating so
yeah so so

5870
01:35:29,109 --> 01:35:29,119
yeah so so
 

5871
01:35:29,119 --> 01:35:31,510
yeah so so
sdk is all of the problems that have

5872
01:35:31,510 --> 01:35:31,520
sdk is all of the problems that have
 

5873
01:35:31,520 --> 01:35:33,510
sdk is all of the problems that have
protocols like that one

5874
01:35:33,510 --> 01:35:33,520
protocols like that one
 

5875
01:35:33,520 --> 01:35:35,109
protocols like that one
but it has this beautiful other

5876
01:35:35,109 --> 01:35:35,119
but it has this beautiful other
 

5877
01:35:35,119 --> 01:35:37,590
but it has this beautiful other
characterization it's shown up again and

5878
01:35:37,590 --> 01:35:37,600
characterization it's shown up again and
 

5879
01:35:37,600 --> 01:35:37,990
characterization it's shown up again and
again

5880
01:35:37,990 --> 01:35:38,000
again
 

5881
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,149
again
in my in my own work in you know a lot

5882
01:35:40,149 --> 01:35:40,159
in my in my own work in you know a lot
 

5883
01:35:40,159 --> 01:35:41,189
in my in my own work in you know a lot
of people's work

5884
01:35:41,189 --> 01:35:41,199
of people's work
 

5885
01:35:41,199 --> 01:35:43,030
of people's work
and i think that it really is one of the

5886
01:35:43,030 --> 01:35:43,040
and i think that it really is one of the
 

5887
01:35:43,040 --> 01:35:44,790
and i think that it really is one of the
most fundamental classes

5888
01:35:44,790 --> 01:35:44,800
most fundamental classes
 

5889
01:35:44,800 --> 01:35:46,149
most fundamental classes
it's just that people didn't realize

5890
01:35:46,149 --> 01:35:46,159
it's just that people didn't realize
 

5891
01:35:46,159 --> 01:35:48,629
it's just that people didn't realize
that when it was first discovered

5892
01:35:48,629 --> 01:35:48,639
that when it was first discovered
 

5893
01:35:48,639 --> 01:35:50,070
that when it was first discovered
so we're living in the middle of a

5894
01:35:50,070 --> 01:35:50,080
so we're living in the middle of a
 

5895
01:35:50,080 --> 01:35:53,510
so we're living in the middle of a
pandemic currently yeah how has

5896
01:35:53,510 --> 01:35:53,520
pandemic currently yeah how has
 

5897
01:35:53,520 --> 01:35:55,750
pandemic currently yeah how has
your life been changed or no better to

5898
01:35:55,750 --> 01:35:55,760
your life been changed or no better to
 

5899
01:35:55,760 --> 01:35:57,669
your life been changed or no better to
ask like how is your perspective of the

5900
01:35:57,669 --> 01:35:57,679
ask like how is your perspective of the
 

5901
01:35:57,679 --> 01:35:59,030
ask like how is your perspective of the
world change

5902
01:35:59,030 --> 01:35:59,040
world change
 

5903
01:35:59,040 --> 01:36:01,910
world change
with this uh world-changing event of a

5904
01:36:01,910 --> 01:36:01,920
with this uh world-changing event of a
 

5905
01:36:01,920 --> 01:36:04,310
with this uh world-changing event of a
pandemic overtaking the entire world

5906
01:36:04,310 --> 01:36:04,320
pandemic overtaking the entire world
 

5907
01:36:04,320 --> 01:36:06,229
pandemic overtaking the entire world
yeah well i mean i mean all of our lives

5908
01:36:06,229 --> 01:36:06,239
yeah well i mean i mean all of our lives
 

5909
01:36:06,239 --> 01:36:07,750
yeah well i mean i mean all of our lives
have changed you know like

5910
01:36:07,750 --> 01:36:07,760
have changed you know like
 

5911
01:36:07,760 --> 01:36:10,629
have changed you know like
i guess as with no other event since i

5912
01:36:10,629 --> 01:36:10,639
i guess as with no other event since i
 

5913
01:36:10,639 --> 01:36:12,229
i guess as with no other event since i
was born you know you would have to go

5914
01:36:12,229 --> 01:36:12,239
was born you know you would have to go
 

5915
01:36:12,239 --> 01:36:13,270
was born you know you would have to go
back to world war

5916
01:36:13,270 --> 01:36:13,280
back to world war
 

5917
01:36:13,280 --> 01:36:15,109
back to world war
ii for something i think of this

5918
01:36:15,109 --> 01:36:15,119
ii for something i think of this
 

5919
01:36:15,119 --> 01:36:16,870
ii for something i think of this
magnitude you know uh

5920
01:36:16,870 --> 01:36:16,880
magnitude you know uh
 

5921
01:36:16,880 --> 01:36:18,310
magnitude you know uh
on you know the way that we live our

5922
01:36:18,310 --> 01:36:18,320
on you know the way that we live our
 

5923
01:36:18,320 --> 01:36:21,510
on you know the way that we live our
lives as for how it has changed my world

5924
01:36:21,510 --> 01:36:21,520
lives as for how it has changed my world
 

5925
01:36:21,520 --> 01:36:24,870
lives as for how it has changed my world
view i think that the the failure of

5926
01:36:24,870 --> 01:36:24,880
view i think that the the failure of
 

5927
01:36:24,880 --> 01:36:26,310
view i think that the the failure of
institutions

5928
01:36:26,310 --> 01:36:26,320
institutions
 

5929
01:36:26,320 --> 01:36:29,669
institutions
you know like uh like like the cdc

5930
01:36:29,669 --> 01:36:29,679
you know like uh like like the cdc
 

5931
01:36:29,679 --> 01:36:31,830
you know like uh like like the cdc
like you know other institutions that we

5932
01:36:31,830 --> 01:36:31,840
like you know other institutions that we
 

5933
01:36:31,840 --> 01:36:33,430
like you know other institutions that we
sort of thought were were

5934
01:36:33,430 --> 01:36:33,440
sort of thought were were
 

5935
01:36:33,440 --> 01:36:36,229
sort of thought were were
trustworthy like a lot of the media uh

5936
01:36:36,229 --> 01:36:36,239
trustworthy like a lot of the media uh
 

5937
01:36:36,239 --> 01:36:36,629
trustworthy like a lot of the media uh
was

5938
01:36:36,629 --> 01:36:36,639
was
 

5939
01:36:36,639 --> 01:36:39,510
was
uh staggering was was absolutely

5940
01:36:39,510 --> 01:36:39,520
uh staggering was was absolutely
 

5941
01:36:39,520 --> 01:36:40,550
uh staggering was was absolutely
breathtaking

5942
01:36:40,550 --> 01:36:40,560
breathtaking
 

5943
01:36:40,560 --> 01:36:42,229
breathtaking
uh it is something that i would not have

5944
01:36:42,229 --> 01:36:42,239
uh it is something that i would not have
 

5945
01:36:42,239 --> 01:36:44,149
uh it is something that i would not have
predicted right i think i

5946
01:36:44,149 --> 01:36:44,159
predicted right i think i
 

5947
01:36:44,159 --> 01:36:46,950
predicted right i think i
i uh wrote on my blog uh uh that you

5948
01:36:46,950 --> 01:36:46,960
i uh wrote on my blog uh uh that you
 

5949
01:36:46,960 --> 01:36:47,590
i uh wrote on my blog uh uh that you
know

01:48:13,590 --> 01:48:13,600
for what i'll call the the the open
 

6643
01:48:13,600 --> 01:48:15,910

discourse side the you know reasonable

6644
01:48:15,910 --> 01:48:15,920
discourse side the you know reasonable
 

6645
01:48:15,920 --> 01:48:17,430
discourse side the you know reasonable
enlightenment side

6646
01:48:17,430 --> 01:48:17,440
enlightenment side
 

6647
01:48:17,440 --> 01:48:19,510
enlightenment side
and i think that that that support has

6648
01:48:19,510 --> 01:48:19,520
and i think that that that support has
 

6649
01:48:19,520 --> 01:48:21,189
and i think that that that support has
to become less silent

6650
01:48:21,189 --> 01:48:21,199
to become less silent
 

6651
01:48:21,199 --> 01:48:23,910
to become less silent
right i think that a lot of people uh

6652
01:48:23,910 --> 01:48:23,920
right i think that a lot of people uh

but is it uh is there something from a
 

6795
01:50:48,080 --> 01:50:49,669
but is it uh is there something from a
computer science perspective to be said

6796
01:50:49,669 --> 01:50:49,679
computer science perspective to be said
 

6797
