back and when was it I think I started

80
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:36,600
back and when was it I think I started
 

81
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,950
back and when was it I think I started
as a kid and my parents got a basic

82

as a kid and my parents got a basic
 

83
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,560
as a kid and my parents got a basic
programming book and so when I started

84
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:42,570
programming book and so when I started
 

85
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:44,690
programming book and so when I started
it was typing out programs from a book

86
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:44,700
it was typing out programs from a book
 

87
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,210
it was typing out programs from a book
and seeing how they worked and then

88
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:47,220
and seeing how they worked and then
 

89
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,730
and seeing how they worked and then
typing them in wrong and trying to

90
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:49,740
typing them in wrong and trying to
 

91
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:50,990
typing them in wrong and trying to
figure out why they were not working

92
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:51,000
figure out why they were not working
 

93
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,870
figure out why they were not working
right that kind of stuff so basic what

94
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:53,880
right that kind of stuff so basic what
 

95
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,819
right that kind of stuff so basic what
was the first language that you remember

96
00:01:55,819 --> 00:01:55,829
was the first language that you remember

really connecting with I don't know I

100
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:00,450
really connecting with I don't know I
 

101
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:01,399
really connecting with I don't know I
mean I feel like I've learned a lot

102
00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:01,409
mean I feel like I've learned a lot
 

103
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:03,920
mean I feel like I've learned a lot
along the way and each of them have a

104
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:03,930
along the way and each of them have a
 

105
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:06,830
along the way and each of them have a
different special thing about them so I

106
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:06,840
different special thing about them so I
 

107
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,779
different special thing about them so I
started in basic and then went like

108
00:02:08,779 --> 00:02:08,789
started in basic and then went like
 

109
00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:10,669
started in basic and then went like
gw-basic which was the thing back in the

110
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:10,679
gw-basic which was the thing back in the
 

111
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:12,240
gw-basic which was the thing back in the
DOS days and then

112
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:12,250
DOS days and then
 

113
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:14,670
DOS days and then
upgrade to QBasic and eventually quick

114
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:14,680
upgrade to QBasic and eventually quick
 

115
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,340
upgrade to QBasic and eventually quick
basic which are all slightly more fancy

116
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:17,350
basic which are all slightly more fancy
 

117
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:19,740

eventually going to C C++ and then kind

128
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:31,420
eventually going to C C++ and then kind
 

129
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:33,660
eventually going to C C++ and then kind
of did lots of other weird things I feel

130
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:33,670
of did lots of other weird things I feel
 

131
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:35,780
of did lots of other weird things I feel
like you took the dark path which is the

132
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:35,790
like you took the dark path which is the
 

133
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:39,660
like you took the dark path which is the
you could you could have gone Lisp yeah

00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:39,670
you could you could have gone Lisp yeah
 

135
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:41,760
you could you could have gone Lisp yeah
you've got a higher-level sort of

136
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:41,770
you've got a higher-level sort of
 

137
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:44,010
you've got a higher-level sort of

instead you went into like the dark arts

140
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:46,930
instead you went into like the dark arts
 

141
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:49,440

straight to toys so started with basic

144
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:52,630
straight to toys so started with basic
 

145
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,270
straight to toys so started with basic
task element assembly and then wrote a

146
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:54,280
task element assembly and then wrote a
 

147
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:57,480
task element assembly and then wrote a
lot of assembly and why eventually I

148
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:57,490
lot of assembly and why eventually I
 

149
00:02:57,490 --> 00:02:59,280
lot of assembly and why eventually I
eventually did small talk and other

150
00:02:59,280 --> 00:02:59,290
eventually did small talk and other
 

151
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:00,780
eventually did small talk and other
things like that but that was not the

152
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:00,790
things like that but that was not the
 

153
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:03,180
things like that but that was not the
starting point but so what

154
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:03,190
starting point but so what
 

155
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:05,699
starting point but so what
what is this journey to see is that in

156
00:03:05,699 --> 00:03:05,709
what is this journey to see is that in
 

157
00:03:05,709 --> 00:03:07,710
what is this journey to see is that in
high school is that in college that was

158
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:07,720
high school is that in college that was
 

159
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:11,420
high school is that in college that was
in high school yeah so and then that was

160
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:11,430
in high school yeah so and then that was
 

161
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:14,130
in high school yeah so and then that was
it was really about trying to be able to

162
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:14,140
it was really about trying to be able to
 

163
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:16,050
it was really about trying to be able to
do more powerful things than what Pascal

164
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:16,060
do more powerful things than what Pascal
 

165
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:17,790
do more powerful things than what Pascal
could do and also to learn a different

166
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:17,800
could do and also to learn a different
 

167
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,040
could do and also to learn a different
world so he was really confusing me with

168
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:20,050
world so he was really confusing me with
 

169
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:21,840
world so he was really confusing me with
pointers and the syntax and everything

170
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:21,850
pointers and the syntax and everything
 

171
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:25,590
pointers and the syntax and everything
and it took a while but Pascal is much

172
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:25,600
and it took a while but Pascal is much
 

173
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:29,040
and it took a while but Pascal is much
more principled in various ways sees

174
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:29,050
more principled in various ways sees
 

175
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:33,180
more principled in various ways sees
more I mean it has its historical roots

176
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:33,190
more I mean it has its historical roots
 

177
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:35,670
more I mean it has its historical roots
but it's it's not as easy to learn with

178
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:35,680
but it's it's not as easy to learn with
 

179
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,780
but it's it's not as easy to learn with
pointers there's this memory management

180
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:38,790
pointers there's this memory management
 

181
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:41,100
pointers there's this memory management
thing that you have to become conscious

182
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:41,110
thing that you have to become conscious
 

183
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:43,289
thing that you have to become conscious
of is that the first time you start to

184
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:43,299
of is that the first time you start to
 

185
00:03:43,299 --> 00:03:45,060
of is that the first time you start to
understand that there's resources that

186
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:45,070
understand that there's resources that
 

187
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:46,770
understand that there's resources that
you're supposed to manage well so you

188
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:46,780
you're supposed to manage well so you
 

189
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:48,840
you're supposed to manage well so you
have that in Pascal as well but in

190
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:48,850
have that in Pascal as well but in
 

191
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:51,060
have that in Pascal as well but in
Pascal these like the carrot instead of

192
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:51,070
Pascal these like the carrot instead of
 

193
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:52,560
Pascal these like the carrot instead of
the star and there's some small

194
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:52,570
the star and there's some small
 

195
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:53,990
the star and there's some small
differences like that but it's not about

196
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:54,000
differences like that but it's not about
 

197
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,820
differences like that but it's not about
pointer arithmetic and and and see it

198
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:56,830
pointer arithmetic and and and see it
 

199
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:58,710
pointer arithmetic and and and see it
you end up thinking about how things get

200
00:03:58,710 --> 00:03:58,720
you end up thinking about how things get
 

201
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,440
you end up thinking about how things get
laid out in memory a lot more and so in

202
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:01,450
laid out in memory a lot more and so in
 

203
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:03,509
laid out in memory a lot more and so in
Pascal you have allocating and

204
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:03,519
Pascal you have allocating and
 

205
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,310
Pascal you have allocating and
deallocating and owning the the memory

206
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:05,320
deallocating and owning the the memory
 

207
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,530
deallocating and owning the the memory
but just the programs are simpler and

208
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:07,540
but just the programs are simpler and
 

209
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:10,530
but just the programs are simpler and
you don't have to well for example

210
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:10,540
you don't have to well for example
 

211
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:13,020
you don't have to well for example
Pascal has a string type and so you can

212
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:13,030
Pascal has a string type and so you can
 

213
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:14,880
Pascal has a string type and so you can
think about a string instead of an array

214
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:14,890
think about a string instead of an array
 

215
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:16,800
think about a string instead of an array
of characters which are consecutive in

216
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:16,810
of characters which are consecutive in
 

217
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:18,960
of characters which are consecutive in
memory so it's a little bit of a higher

218
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:18,970
memory so it's a little bit of a higher
 

219
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:22,710
memory so it's a little bit of a higher
level abstraction so let's get into it

220
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:22,720
level abstraction so let's get into it
 

221
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,900
level abstraction so let's get into it
let's talk about LLVM si Lang and

222
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:24,910
let's talk about LLVM si Lang and
 

223
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:25,530
let's talk about LLVM si Lang and
compilers

224
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:25,540
compilers
 

225
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:28,890
compilers
sure so can you tell me first what I

226
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:28,900
sure so can you tell me first what I
 

227
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:32,610
sure so can you tell me first what I
love the a messy laying our and how is

228
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:32,620
love the a messy laying our and how is
 

229
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,410
love the a messy laying our and how is
it that you find yourself the creator

230
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:34,420
it that you find yourself the creator
 

231
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:36,060
it that you find yourself the creator
and lead developer one of the most

232
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:36,070
and lead developer one of the most
 

233
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:39,240
and lead developer one of the most
powerful compiler optimization systems

234
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:39,250
powerful compiler optimization systems
 

235
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:42,600
powerful compiler optimization systems
than used today sure so I guess they're

236
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:42,610
than used today sure so I guess they're
 

237
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:45,630
than used today sure so I guess they're
different things so let's start with

238
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:45,640
different things so let's start with
 

239
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,560
different things so let's start with
what is a compiler

240
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:46,570
what is a compiler
 

241
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:48,750
what is a compiler
it's a is that a good place to start

242
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:48,760
it's a is that a good place to start
 

243
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,340
it's a is that a good place to start
what are the phases of a compiler where

244
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:50,350
what are the phases of a compiler where
 

245
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:52,110
what are the phases of a compiler where
the parts yeah what is it so what does

246
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:52,120
the parts yeah what is it so what does
 

247
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,480
the parts yeah what is it so what does
even a compiler are used for so the way

248
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:54,490
even a compiler are used for so the way
 

249
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:56,760
even a compiler are used for so the way
the way I look at this is you have a two

250
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:56,770
the way I look at this is you have a two
 

251
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:58,980
the way I look at this is you have a two
sided problem of you have humans that

252
00:04:58,980 --> 00:04:58,990
sided problem of you have humans that
 

253
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:00,810
sided problem of you have humans that
need to write code and then you have

254
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:00,820
need to write code and then you have
 

255
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:02,070
need to write code and then you have
machines that need to run the program

256
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:02,080
machines that need to run the program
 

257
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,440
machines that need to run the program
that the human wrote and for lots of

258
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:04,450
that the human wrote and for lots of
 

259
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:05,670
that the human wrote and for lots of
reasons the humans don't want to be

260
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:05,680
reasons the humans don't want to be
 

261
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,650
reasons the humans don't want to be
writing in binary and want to think

262
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:07,660
writing in binary and want to think
 

263
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,450
writing in binary and want to think
about every piece of hardware and so at

264
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:09,460
about every piece of hardware and so at
 

265
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:11,670
about every piece of hardware and so at
the same time that you have lots of

266
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:11,680
the same time that you have lots of
 

267
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,200
the same time that you have lots of
humans you also have lots of kinds of

268
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:13,210
humans you also have lots of kinds of
 

269
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:16,920
humans you also have lots of kinds of
hardware and so compilers are the art of

270
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:16,930
hardware and so compilers are the art of
 

271
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:18,570
hardware and so compilers are the art of
allowing humans to think of the level of

272
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:18,580
allowing humans to think of the level of
 

273
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:19,920
allowing humans to think of the level of
abstraction that they want to think

274
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:19,930
abstraction that they want to think
 

275
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:22,620
abstraction that they want to think
about and then get that program get the

276
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:22,630
about and then get that program get the
 

277
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:24,510
about and then get that program get the
thing that they wrote to run on a

278
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:24,520
thing that they wrote to run on a
 

279
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:27,480
thing that they wrote to run on a
specific piece of hardware and the

280
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:27,490
specific piece of hardware and the
 

281
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:29,220
specific piece of hardware and the
interesting and exciting part of all

282
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:29,230
interesting and exciting part of all
 

283
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:30,570
interesting and exciting part of all
this is that there's now lots of

284
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:30,580
this is that there's now lots of
 

285
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,460
this is that there's now lots of
different kinds of hardware chips like

286
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:32,470
different kinds of hardware chips like
 

287
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:35,280
different kinds of hardware chips like
x86 and PowerPC and arm and things like

288
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:35,290
x86 and PowerPC and arm and things like
 

289
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:36,690
x86 and PowerPC and arm and things like
that but also high-performance

290
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:36,700
that but also high-performance
 

291
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,100
that but also high-performance
accelerators for machine learning and

292
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:38,110
accelerators for machine learning and
 

293
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:39,270
accelerators for machine learning and
other things like that or also just

294
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:39,280
other things like that or also just
 

295
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,550
other things like that or also just
different kinds of hardware GPUs these

296
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:41,560
different kinds of hardware GPUs these
 

297
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,200
different kinds of hardware GPUs these
are new kinds of hardware and at the

298
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:43,210
are new kinds of hardware and at the
 

299
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:45,540
are new kinds of hardware and at the
same time on the programming side of it

300
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:45,550
same time on the programming side of it
 

301
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:47,970
same time on the programming side of it
you have your basic UFC you have

302
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:47,980
you have your basic UFC you have
 

303
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:50,640
you have your basic UFC you have
JavaScript you have Python you so if you

304
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:50,650
JavaScript you have Python you so if you
 

305
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:52,920
JavaScript you have Python you so if you
have like lots of other languages that

306
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:52,930
have like lots of other languages that
 

307
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:54,570
have like lots of other languages that
are all trying to talk to the human in a

308
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:54,580
are all trying to talk to the human in a
 

309
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:55,850
are all trying to talk to the human in a
different way to make them more

310
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:55,860
different way to make them more
 

311
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:58,320
different way to make them more
expressive and capable and powerful and

312
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:58,330
expressive and capable and powerful and
 

313
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:01,680
expressive and capable and powerful and
so compilers are the thing that goes

314
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:01,690
so compilers are the thing that goes
 

315
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:04,230
so compilers are the thing that goes
from one to the other no and then from

316
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:04,240
from one to the other no and then from
 

317
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,090
from one to the other no and then from
the very beginning end to end and so you

318
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:06,100
the very beginning end to end and so you
 

319
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,570
the very beginning end to end and so you
go from what the human wrote and

320
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:08,580
go from what the human wrote and
 

321
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,970
go from what the human wrote and
programming languages end up being about

322
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:10,980
programming languages end up being about
 

323
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:13,620
programming languages end up being about
expressing intent not just for the

324
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:13,630
expressing intent not just for the
 

325
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:16,650
expressing intent not just for the
compiler and the hardware but the

326
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:16,660
compiler and the hardware but the
 

327
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:18,330
compiler and the hardware but the
programming languages job is really to

328
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:18,340
programming languages job is really to
 

329
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:21,780
programming languages job is really to
to capture an expression of what the

330
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:21,790
to capture an expression of what the
 

331
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:23,250
to capture an expression of what the
programmer wanted that then can be

332
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:23,260
programmer wanted that then can be
 

333
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:25,680
programmer wanted that then can be
maintained and adapted and evolved by

334
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:25,690
maintained and adapted and evolved by
 

335
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:27,750
maintained and adapted and evolved by
other humans as well as by the

336
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:27,760
other humans as well as by the
 

337
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:30,720
other humans as well as by the
interpreter by the compiler so so when

338
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:30,730
interpreter by the compiler so so when
 

339
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:32,250
interpreter by the compiler so so when
you look at this problem you have on one

340
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:32,260
you look at this problem you have on one
 

341
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:34,230
you look at this problem you have on one
hand humans which are complicated and

342
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:34,240
hand humans which are complicated and
 

343
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,240
hand humans which are complicated and
you have hardware which is complicated

344
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:36,250
you have hardware which is complicated
 

345
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:38,280
you have hardware which is complicated
until compilers typically work in

346
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:38,290
until compilers typically work in
 

347
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:41,940
until compilers typically work in
multiple phases and so the software

348
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:41,950
multiple phases and so the software
 

349
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:43,290
multiple phases and so the software
engineering challenge that you have here

350
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:43,300
engineering challenge that you have here
 

351
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,390
engineering challenge that you have here
is try to get maximum reuse out of the

352
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:45,400
is try to get maximum reuse out of the
 

353
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,950
is try to get maximum reuse out of the
the amount of code that you write

354
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:46,960
the amount of code that you write
 

355
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,480
the amount of code that you write
because this these compilers are very

356
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:48,490
because this these compilers are very
 

357
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:50,700
because this these compilers are very
complicated and so the way it typically

358
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:50,710
complicated and so the way it typically
 

359
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:52,650
complicated and so the way it typically
works out is that you have something

360
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:52,660
works out is that you have something
 

361
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:54,750
works out is that you have something
called a front-end or a parser that is

362
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:54,760
called a front-end or a parser that is
 

363
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:57,600
called a front-end or a parser that is
language specific and so you'll have a C

364
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:57,610
language specific and so you'll have a C
 

365
00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:00,990
language specific and so you'll have a C
parser and that's what clang is or C++

366
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:01,000
parser and that's what clang is or C++
 

367
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,090
parser and that's what clang is or C++
or JavaScript or Python or whatever

368
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:03,100
or JavaScript or Python or whatever
 

369
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,670
or JavaScript or Python or whatever
that's the front-end then you'll have a

370
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:05,680
that's the front-end then you'll have a
 

371
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,640
that's the front-end then you'll have a
middle part which is often the optimizer

372
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:08,650
middle part which is often the optimizer
 

373
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:11,250
middle part which is often the optimizer
and then you'll have a late part which

374
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:11,260
and then you'll have a late part which
 

375
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:14,190
and then you'll have a late part which
is hardware specific and so compilers

376
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:14,200
is hardware specific and so compilers
 

377
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,110
is hardware specific and so compilers
end up there's many different layers

378
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:16,120
end up there's many different layers
 

379
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,720
end up there's many different layers
often but these three big groups are

380
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:18,730
often but these three big groups are
 

381
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:21,510
often but these three big groups are
very common in compilers and what LLVM

382
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:21,520
very common in compilers and what LLVM
 

383
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,070
very common in compilers and what LLVM
is trying to do is trying to standardize

384
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:23,080
is trying to do is trying to standardize
 

385
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:26,700
is trying to do is trying to standardize
that middle and last part and so one of

386
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:26,710
that middle and last part and so one of
 

387
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:28,260
that middle and last part and so one of
the cool things about LLVM is that there

388
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:28,270
the cool things about LLVM is that there
 

389
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:29,820
the cool things about LLVM is that there
are a lot of different languages that

390
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:29,830
are a lot of different languages that
 

391
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:32,330
are a lot of different languages that
compile through to it and so things like

392
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:32,340
compile through to it and so things like
 

393
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:37,170
compile through to it and so things like
swift but also julia rust clang for C

394
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:37,180
swift but also julia rust clang for C
 

395
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:39,900
swift but also julia rust clang for C
C++ objective-c like these are all very

396
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:39,910
C++ objective-c like these are all very
 

397
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:41,640
C++ objective-c like these are all very
different languages and they can all use

398
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:41,650
different languages and they can all use
 

399
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:43,680
different languages and they can all use
the same optimization infrastructure

400
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:43,690
the same optimization infrastructure
 

401
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:45,780
the same optimization infrastructure
which gets better performance and the

402
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:45,790
which gets better performance and the
 

403
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:47,430
which gets better performance and the
same code generation for structure for

404
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:47,440
same code generation for structure for
 

405
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,610
same code generation for structure for
hardware support and so LVM is really

406
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:50,620
hardware support and so LVM is really
 

407
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:52,560
hardware support and so LVM is really
that that layer that is common that all

408
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:52,570
that that layer that is common that all
 

409
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:54,659
that that layer that is common that all
these different specific compilers can

410
00:07:54,659 --> 00:07:54,669
these different specific compilers can
 

411
00:07:54,669 --> 00:07:58,380
these different specific compilers can
use and is that is it a standard like a

412
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:58,390
use and is that is it a standard like a
 

413
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:00,150
use and is that is it a standard like a
specification or is it literally an

414
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:00,160
specification or is it literally an
 

415
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,560
specification or is it literally an
implementation it's an implementation

416
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:01,570
implementation it's an implementation
 

417
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:05,490
implementation it's an implementation
and so it's I think there's a couple

418
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:05,500
and so it's I think there's a couple
 

419
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,630
and so it's I think there's a couple
different ways of looking at write

420
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:06,640
different ways of looking at write
 

421
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,100
different ways of looking at write
because it depends on what which angle

422
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:08,110
because it depends on what which angle
 

423
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:09,080
because it depends on what which angle
you're looking at it from

424
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:09,090
you're looking at it from
 

425
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:12,570
you're looking at it from
LVM ends up being a bunch of code okay

426
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:12,580
LVM ends up being a bunch of code okay
 

427
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:13,710
LVM ends up being a bunch of code okay
so it's a bunch of code that people

428
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:13,720
so it's a bunch of code that people
 

429
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,590
so it's a bunch of code that people
reuse and they build compilers with we

430
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:16,600
reuse and they build compilers with we
 

431
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,940
reuse and they build compilers with we
call it a compiler infrastructure

432
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:17,950
call it a compiler infrastructure
 

433
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:19,590
call it a compiler infrastructure
because it's kind of the underlying

434
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:19,600
because it's kind of the underlying
 

435
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,730
because it's kind of the underlying
platform that you build a concrete

436
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:20,740
platform that you build a concrete
 

437
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,980
platform that you build a concrete
compiler on top of but it's also a

438
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:22,990
compiler on top of but it's also a
 

439
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:25,100
compiler on top of but it's also a
community and the LVM community is

440
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:25,110
community and the LVM community is
 

441
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:27,690
community and the LVM community is
hundreds of people that all collaborate

442
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:27,700
hundreds of people that all collaborate
 

443
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,340
hundreds of people that all collaborate
and one of the most fascinating things

444
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:29,350
and one of the most fascinating things
 

445
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:32,550
and one of the most fascinating things
about LVM over the course of time is

446
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:32,560
about LVM over the course of time is
 

447
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,230
about LVM over the course of time is
that we've managed somehow to

448
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:34,240
that we've managed somehow to
 

449
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,140
that we've managed somehow to
successfully get harsh competitors in

450
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:37,150
successfully get harsh competitors in
 

451
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:39,050
successfully get harsh competitors in
the commercial space to collaborate on

452
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:39,060
the commercial space to collaborate on
 

453
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,750
the commercial space to collaborate on
shared infrastructure and so you have

454
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:41,760
shared infrastructure and so you have
 

455
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,750
shared infrastructure and so you have
Google and Apple you have AMD and Intel

456
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:45,760
Google and Apple you have AMD and Intel
 

457
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,410
Google and Apple you have AMD and Intel
you've Nvidia and

458
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:47,420
you've Nvidia and
 

459
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:50,350
you've Nvidia and
d on the graphics side you have prey and

460
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:50,360
d on the graphics side you have prey and
 

461
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,750
d on the graphics side you have prey and
everybody else doing these things and

462
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:52,760
everybody else doing these things and
 

463
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,370
everybody else doing these things and
like all these companies are

464
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:54,380
like all these companies are
 

465
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:56,019
like all these companies are
collaborating together to make that

466
00:08:56,019 --> 00:08:56,029
collaborating together to make that
 

467
00:08:56,029 --> 00:08:57,970
collaborating together to make that
shared infrastructure really really

468
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:57,980
shared infrastructure really really
 

469
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:00,490
shared infrastructure really really
great and they do this not other

470
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:00,500
great and they do this not other
 

471
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,930
great and they do this not other
businesses or heart but they do it

472
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:01,940
businesses or heart but they do it
 

473
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,040
businesses or heart but they do it
because it's in their commercial

474
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:03,050
because it's in their commercial
 

475
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:04,449
because it's in their commercial
interests of having really great

476
00:09:04,449 --> 00:09:04,459
interests of having really great
 

477
00:09:04,459 --> 00:09:05,800
interests of having really great
infrastructure that they can build on

478
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:05,810
infrastructure that they can build on
 

479
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:08,319
infrastructure that they can build on
top of and facing the reality that it's

480
00:09:08,319 --> 00:09:08,329
top of and facing the reality that it's
 

481
00:09:08,329 --> 00:09:10,420
top of and facing the reality that it's
so expensive that no one company even

482
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:10,430
so expensive that no one company even
 

483
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:12,639
so expensive that no one company even
the big companies no one company really

484
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:12,649
the big companies no one company really
 

485
00:09:12,649 --> 00:09:14,160
the big companies no one company really
wants to implement it all themselves

486
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:14,170
wants to implement it all themselves
 

487
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:17,110
wants to implement it all themselves
expensive or difficult both that's a

488
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:17,120
expensive or difficult both that's a
 

489
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,300
expensive or difficult both that's a
great point because it's also about the

490
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:19,310
great point because it's also about the
 

491
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:23,860
great point because it's also about the
skill sets right and these the skill

492
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:23,870
skill sets right and these the skill
 

493
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:26,379
skill sets right and these the skill
sets are very hard hard to find how big

494
00:09:26,379 --> 00:09:26,389
sets are very hard hard to find how big
 

495
00:09:26,389 --> 00:09:29,139
sets are very hard hard to find how big
is the LLVM it always seems like with

496
00:09:29,139 --> 00:09:29,149
is the LLVM it always seems like with
 

497
00:09:29,149 --> 00:09:31,900
is the LLVM it always seems like with
open-source projects the kind you know

498
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:31,910
open-source projects the kind you know
 

499
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:34,210
open-source projects the kind you know
LLVM open source yes it's open source

500
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:34,220
LLVM open source yes it's open source
 

501
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:36,699
LLVM open source yes it's open source
it's about it's 19 years old now so it's

502
00:09:36,699 --> 00:09:36,709
it's about it's 19 years old now so it's
 

503
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:40,509
it's about it's 19 years old now so it's
fairly old it seems like the magic often

504
00:09:40,509 --> 00:09:40,519
fairly old it seems like the magic often
 

505
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:42,370
fairly old it seems like the magic often
happens within a very small circle of

506
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:42,380
happens within a very small circle of
 

507
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:44,470
happens within a very small circle of
people yes I'd like at least the early

508
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:44,480
people yes I'd like at least the early
 

509
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,980
people yes I'd like at least the early
birth and whatever yes so the LVM came

510
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:47,990
birth and whatever yes so the LVM came
 

511
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:50,050
birth and whatever yes so the LVM came
from a university project and so I was

512
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:50,060
from a university project and so I was
 

513
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:52,060
from a university project and so I was
at the University of Illinois and there

514
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:52,070
at the University of Illinois and there
 

515
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:54,850
at the University of Illinois and there
it was myself my advisor and then a team

516
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:54,860
it was myself my advisor and then a team
 

517
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:57,730
it was myself my advisor and then a team
of two or three research students in the

518
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:57,740
of two or three research students in the
 

519
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:59,889
of two or three research students in the
research group and we built many of the

520
00:09:59,889 --> 00:09:59,899
research group and we built many of the
 

521
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:02,860
research group and we built many of the
core pieces initially I then graduated

522
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:02,870
core pieces initially I then graduated
 

523
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:05,410
core pieces initially I then graduated
went to Apple and Apple brought it to

524
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:05,420
went to Apple and Apple brought it to
 

525
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:07,600
went to Apple and Apple brought it to
the products first in the OpenGL

526
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:07,610
the products first in the OpenGL
 

527
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:10,780
the products first in the OpenGL
graphics stack but eventually to the C

528
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:10,790
graphics stack but eventually to the C
 

529
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:12,280
graphics stack but eventually to the C
compiler realm and eventually built

530
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:12,290
compiler realm and eventually built
 

531
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:13,689
compiler realm and eventually built
clang and eventually built Swift in

532
00:10:13,689 --> 00:10:13,699
clang and eventually built Swift in
 

533
00:10:13,699 --> 00:10:15,519
clang and eventually built Swift in
these things along the way building a

534
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:15,529
these things along the way building a
 

535
00:10:15,529 --> 00:10:17,439
these things along the way building a
team of people that are really amazing

536
00:10:17,439 --> 00:10:17,449
team of people that are really amazing
 

537
00:10:17,449 --> 00:10:19,240
team of people that are really amazing
compiler engineers that helped build a

538
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:19,250
compiler engineers that helped build a
 

539
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:21,340
compiler engineers that helped build a
lot of that and so as it was gaining

540
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:21,350
lot of that and so as it was gaining
 

541
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:23,650
lot of that and so as it was gaining
momentum and as Apple was using it being

542
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:23,660
momentum and as Apple was using it being
 

543
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:25,600
momentum and as Apple was using it being
open source in public and encouraging

544
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:25,610
open source in public and encouraging
 

545
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:27,639
open source in public and encouraging
contribution many others for example at

546
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:27,649
contribution many others for example at
 

547
00:10:27,649 --> 00:10:29,769
contribution many others for example at
Google came in and started contributing

548
00:10:29,769 --> 00:10:29,779
Google came in and started contributing
 

549
00:10:29,779 --> 00:10:32,680
Google came in and started contributing
and some cases Google effectively owns

550
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:32,690
and some cases Google effectively owns
 

551
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:34,689
and some cases Google effectively owns
clang now because it cares so much about

552
00:10:34,689 --> 00:10:34,699
clang now because it cares so much about
 

553
00:10:34,699 --> 00:10:36,670
clang now because it cares so much about
C++ and the evolution of that that

554
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:36,680
C++ and the evolution of that that
 

555
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:39,030
C++ and the evolution of that that
ecosystem and so it's a vesting a lot in

556
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:39,040
ecosystem and so it's a vesting a lot in
 

557
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,430
ecosystem and so it's a vesting a lot in
the C++ world and the tooling and things

558
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:42,440
the C++ world and the tooling and things
 

559
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:42,970
the C++ world and the tooling and things
like that

560
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:42,980
like that
 

561
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:47,050
like that
and so likewise Nvidia cares a lot about

562
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:47,060
and so likewise Nvidia cares a lot about
 

563
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:50,530
and so likewise Nvidia cares a lot about
CUDA and so CUDA uses clang and uses LVM

564
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:50,540
CUDA and so CUDA uses clang and uses LVM
 

565
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:56,050
CUDA and so CUDA uses clang and uses LVM
for for graphics and GPGPU and so when

566
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:56,060
for for graphics and GPGPU and so when
 

567
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:58,630
for for graphics and GPGPU and so when
you first started as a master's project

568
00:10:58,630 --> 00:10:58,640
you first started as a master's project
 

569
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,430
you first started as a master's project
I guess

570
00:10:59,430 --> 00:10:59,440
I guess
 

571
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,769
I guess
did you think is gonna go as far as it

572
00:11:01,769 --> 00:11:01,779
did you think is gonna go as far as it
 

573
00:11:01,779 --> 00:11:02,639
did you think is gonna go as far as it
went

574
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:02,649
went
 

575
00:11:02,649 --> 00:11:06,420
went
were you uh crazy ambitious about it no

576
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:06,430
were you uh crazy ambitious about it no
 

577
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:07,800
were you uh crazy ambitious about it no
seems like a really difficult

578
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:07,810
seems like a really difficult
 

579
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:10,769
seems like a really difficult
undertaking a brave one yeah no it was

580
00:11:10,769 --> 00:11:10,779
undertaking a brave one yeah no it was
 

581
00:11:10,779 --> 00:11:12,569
undertaking a brave one yeah no it was
nothing like that so I mean my goal when

582
00:11:12,569 --> 00:11:12,579
nothing like that so I mean my goal when
 

583
00:11:12,579 --> 00:11:13,949
nothing like that so I mean my goal when
I went to University of Illinois was to

584
00:11:13,949 --> 00:11:13,959
I went to University of Illinois was to
 

585
00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:15,509
I went to University of Illinois was to
get in and out with the non thesis

586
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:15,519
get in and out with the non thesis
 

587
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:18,059
get in and out with the non thesis
masters in a year and get back to work

588
00:11:18,059 --> 00:11:18,069
masters in a year and get back to work
 

589
00:11:18,069 --> 00:11:21,300
masters in a year and get back to work
so I was not I was not planning to stay

590
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:21,310
so I was not I was not planning to stay
 

591
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:23,309
so I was not I was not planning to stay
for five years and and build this

592
00:11:23,309 --> 00:11:23,319
for five years and and build this
 

593
00:11:23,319 --> 00:11:26,280
for five years and and build this
massive infrastructure I got nerd sniped

594
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:26,290
massive infrastructure I got nerd sniped
 

595
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:28,439
massive infrastructure I got nerd sniped
into staying and a lot of it was because

596
00:11:28,439 --> 00:11:28,449
into staying and a lot of it was because
 

597
00:11:28,449 --> 00:11:30,689
into staying and a lot of it was because
Elvin was fun I was building cool stuff

598
00:11:30,689 --> 00:11:30,699
Elvin was fun I was building cool stuff
 

599
00:11:30,699 --> 00:11:33,119
Elvin was fun I was building cool stuff
than learning really interesting things

600
00:11:33,119 --> 00:11:33,129
than learning really interesting things
 

601
00:11:33,129 --> 00:11:36,480

challenges but also learning how to work

604
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:37,689
challenges but also learning how to work
 

605
00:11:37,689 --> 00:11:40,350
challenges but also learning how to work
in a team and things like that I had

606
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:40,360
in a team and things like that I had
 

607
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,119
in a team and things like that I had
worked at many companies as interns

608
00:11:42,119 --> 00:11:42,129
worked at many companies as interns
 

609
00:11:42,129 --> 00:11:44,759
worked at many companies as interns
before that but it was really a

610
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:44,769
before that but it was really a
 

611
00:11:44,769 --> 00:11:46,050
before that but it was really a
different a different thing to have a

612
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:46,060
different a different thing to have a
 

613
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:47,460
different a different thing to have a
team of people that were working

614
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:47,470
team of people that were working
 

615
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:49,710
team of people that were working
together and try and collaborate in

616
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:49,720
together and try and collaborate in
 

617
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,360
together and try and collaborate in
version control and it was it was just a

618
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:51,370
version control and it was it was just a
 

619
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:53,009
version control and it was it was just a
little bit different like I said I just

620
00:11:53,009 --> 00:11:53,019
little bit different like I said I just
 

621
00:11:53,019 --> 00:11:54,600
little bit different like I said I just
talked to Don Knuth and he believes that

622
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:54,610
talked to Don Knuth and he believes that
 

623
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:56,910
talked to Don Knuth and he believes that
2% of the world population have

624
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:56,920
2% of the world population have
 

625
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,650
2% of the world population have
something weird with their brain that

626
00:11:58,650 --> 00:11:58,660
something weird with their brain that
 

627
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:00,809
something weird with their brain that
they're geeks they understand computers

628
00:12:00,809 --> 00:12:00,819
they're geeks they understand computers
 

629
00:12:00,819 --> 00:12:02,910
they're geeks they understand computers
to connect with computer he put it

630
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:02,920
to connect with computer he put it
 

631
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:06,179
to connect with computer he put it
exactly 2 percent okay so this specific

632
00:12:06,179 --> 00:12:06,189
exactly 2 percent okay so this specific
 

633
00:12:06,189 --> 00:12:09,780
exactly 2 percent okay so this specific
guy is very specific he says I can't

634
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:09,790
guy is very specific he says I can't
 

635
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:11,160
guy is very specific he says I can't
prove it but it's very empirical II

636
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:11,170
prove it but it's very empirical II
 

637
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:14,309
prove it but it's very empirical II
there is there something that attracts

638
00:12:14,309 --> 00:12:14,319
there is there something that attracts
 

639
00:12:14,319 --> 00:12:16,740
there is there something that attracts
you to the idea of optimizing code and

640
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:16,750
you to the idea of optimizing code and
 

641
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,559
you to the idea of optimizing code and
he seems like that's one of the biggest

642
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:18,569
he seems like that's one of the biggest
 

643
00:12:18,569 --> 00:12:21,360
he seems like that's one of the biggest
coolest things about oh yeah that's one

644
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:21,370
coolest things about oh yeah that's one
 

645
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:23,819
coolest things about oh yeah that's one
of the major things it does so I got

646
00:12:23,819 --> 00:12:23,829
of the major things it does so I got
 

647
00:12:23,829 --> 00:12:26,129
of the major things it does so I got
into that because of a person actually

648
00:12:26,129 --> 00:12:26,139
into that because of a person actually
 

649
00:12:26,139 --> 00:12:28,319
into that because of a person actually
so when I was in my undergraduate I had

650
00:12:28,319 --> 00:12:28,329
so when I was in my undergraduate I had
 

651
00:12:28,329 --> 00:12:31,410
so when I was in my undergraduate I had
an advisor or a professor named Steve

652
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:31,420
an advisor or a professor named Steve
 

653
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:34,079
an advisor or a professor named Steve
Bechtel and he I went to this little

654
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:34,089
Bechtel and he I went to this little
 

655
00:12:34,089 --> 00:12:36,689
Bechtel and he I went to this little
tiny private school we there were like

656
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:36,699
tiny private school we there were like
 

657
00:12:36,699 --> 00:12:38,699
tiny private school we there were like
seven or nine people in my computer

658
00:12:38,699 --> 00:12:38,709
seven or nine people in my computer
 

659
00:12:38,709 --> 00:12:42,210
seven or nine people in my computer
science department students in my in my

660
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:42,220
science department students in my in my
 

661
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:46,230
science department students in my in my
class so it was a very tiny very very

662
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:46,240
class so it was a very tiny very very
 

663
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,870
class so it was a very tiny very very
small school it was a kind of a wart on

664
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:48,880
small school it was a kind of a wart on
 

665
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,189
small school it was a kind of a wart on
the side of the math department kind of

666
00:12:50,189 --> 00:12:50,199
the side of the math department kind of
 

667
00:12:50,199 --> 00:12:52,049
the side of the math department kind of
a thing at the time I think it's evolved

668
00:12:52,049 --> 00:12:52,059
a thing at the time I think it's evolved
 

669
00:12:52,059 --> 00:12:54,110
a thing at the time I think it's evolved
a lot in the many years since then but

670
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:54,120
a lot in the many years since then but
 

671
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:57,780
a lot in the many years since then but
but Steve egg Dahl was a compiler guy

672
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:57,790
but Steve egg Dahl was a compiler guy
 

673
00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:01,530
but Steve egg Dahl was a compiler guy
and he was super passionate and he his

674
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:01,540
and he was super passionate and he his
 

675
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:03,179
and he was super passionate and he his
passion rubbed off on me and one of the

676
00:13:03,179 --> 00:13:03,189
passion rubbed off on me and one of the
 

677
00:13:03,189 --> 00:13:05,189
passion rubbed off on me and one of the
things I like about compilers is that

678
00:13:05,189 --> 00:13:05,199
things I like about compilers is that
 

679
00:13:05,199 --> 00:13:07,670
things I like about compilers is that
they're large complicated software

680
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:07,680
they're large complicated software
 

681
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:12,240
they're large complicated software
pieces and so one of the culminating

682
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:12,250
pieces and so one of the culminating
 

683
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:12,750
pieces and so one of the culminating
classes

684
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:12,760
classes
 

685
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,010
classes
is that many computer science

686
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:14,020
is that many computer science
 

687
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:15,840
is that many computer science
departments at least at the time did was

688
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:15,850
departments at least at the time did was
 

689
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:17,850
departments at least at the time did was
to say that you take algorithms and data

690
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:17,860
to say that you take algorithms and data
 

691
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:19,590
to say that you take algorithms and data
structures in all these core classes but

692
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:19,600
structures in all these core classes but
 

693
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,180
structures in all these core classes but
then the compilers class was one of the

694
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:21,190
then the compilers class was one of the
 

695
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:23,370
then the compilers class was one of the
last classes you take because it pulls

696
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:23,380
last classes you take because it pulls
 

697
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:25,710
last classes you take because it pulls
everything together and then you work on

698
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:25,720
everything together and then you work on
 

699
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,600
everything together and then you work on
one piece of code over the entire

700
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:27,610
one piece of code over the entire
 

701
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:31,050
one piece of code over the entire
semester and and so you keep building on

702
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:31,060
semester and and so you keep building on
 

703
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,610
semester and and so you keep building on
your own work which is really

704
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:32,620
your own work which is really
 

705
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,130
your own work which is really
interesting it's also very challenging

706
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:34,140
interesting it's also very challenging
 

707
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:36,780
interesting it's also very challenging
because in many classes if you don't get

708
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:36,790
because in many classes if you don't get
 

709
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:38,370
because in many classes if you don't get
a project done you just forget about it

710
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:38,380
a project done you just forget about it
 

711
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:39,690
a project done you just forget about it
and move on to the next one and get your

712
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:39,700
and move on to the next one and get your
 

713
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,460
and move on to the next one and get your
you know your B or whatever it is but

714
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:41,470
you know your B or whatever it is but
 

715
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:43,380
you know your B or whatever it is but
here you have to live with the decisions

716
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:43,390
here you have to live with the decisions
 

717
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:45,180
here you have to live with the decisions
you make and continue to reinvest in it

718
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:45,190
you make and continue to reinvest in it
 

719
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:49,440
you make and continue to reinvest in it
and I really like that and and so I did

720
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:49,450
and I really like that and and so I did
 

721
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:51,030
and I really like that and and so I did
a extra study project within the

722
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:51,040
a extra study project within the
 

723
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,280
a extra study project within the
following semester and he was just

724
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:53,290
following semester and he was just
 

725
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:55,620
following semester and he was just
really great and he was also a great

726
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:55,630
really great and he was also a great
 

727
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:58,320
really great and he was also a great
mentor in a lot of ways and so from from

728
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:58,330
mentor in a lot of ways and so from from
 

729
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:00,030
mentor in a lot of ways and so from from
him and from his advice he encouraged me

730
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:00,040
him and from his advice he encouraged me
 

731
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,980
him and from his advice he encouraged me
to go to graduate school I wasn't super

732
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:01,990
to go to graduate school I wasn't super
 

733
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:03,840
to go to graduate school I wasn't super
excited about going grad school I wanted

734
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:03,850
excited about going grad school I wanted
 

735
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:06,330
excited about going grad school I wanted
the master's degree but I didn't want to

736
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:06,340
the master's degree but I didn't want to
 

737
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:09,750
the master's degree but I didn't want to
be in academic and but like I said I

738
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:09,760
be in academic and but like I said I
 

739
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,340
be in academic and but like I said I
kind of got tricked into saying and was

740
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:11,350
kind of got tricked into saying and was
 

741
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,320
kind of got tricked into saying and was
having a lot of fun and I definitely do

742
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:13,330
having a lot of fun and I definitely do
 

743
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:15,780
having a lot of fun and I definitely do
not regret it what aspects of compilers

744
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:15,790
not regret it what aspects of compilers
 

745
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:18,800
not regret it what aspects of compilers
were the things you connected with so

746
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:18,810
were the things you connected with so
 

747
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:22,440
were the things you connected with so
LVM there's also the other part this is

748
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:22,450
LVM there's also the other part this is
 

749
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:24,090
LVM there's also the other part this is
really interesting if you're interested

750
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:24,100
really interesting if you're interested
 

751
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:26,580
really interesting if you're interested
in languages is parsing and you know

752
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:26,590
in languages is parsing and you know
 

753
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:29,220
in languages is parsing and you know
just analyzing like yeah analyzing

754
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:29,230
just analyzing like yeah analyzing
 

755
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:30,870
just analyzing like yeah analyzing
language breaking it out parsing so on

756
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:30,880
language breaking it out parsing so on
 

757
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,580
language breaking it out parsing so on
was that interesting to you were you

758
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:32,590
was that interesting to you were you
 

759
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:34,650
was that interesting to you were you
more engine optimization for me it was

760
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:34,660
more engine optimization for me it was
 

761
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:37,110
more engine optimization for me it was
more so I'm I'm not really a math person

762
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:37,120
more so I'm I'm not really a math person
 

763
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,420
more so I'm I'm not really a math person
I can do math I understand some bits of

764
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:39,430
I can do math I understand some bits of
 

765
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:42,420
I can do math I understand some bits of
it when I get into it but math is never

766
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:42,430
it when I get into it but math is never
 

767
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:44,280
it when I get into it but math is never
the thing that that attracted me and so

768
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:44,290
the thing that that attracted me and so
 

769
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:46,140
the thing that that attracted me and so
a lot of the parser part of the compiler

770
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:46,150
a lot of the parser part of the compiler
 

771
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:48,030
a lot of the parser part of the compiler
has a lot of good formal theories that

772
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:48,040
has a lot of good formal theories that
 

773
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,670
has a lot of good formal theories that
dawn for example knows quite well still

774
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:50,680
dawn for example knows quite well still
 

775
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:54,060
dawn for example knows quite well still
waiting for his book on that but but the

776
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:54,070
waiting for his book on that but but the
 

777
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:56,550
waiting for his book on that but but the
but I just like building a thing and and

778
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:56,560
but I just like building a thing and and
 

779
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,980
but I just like building a thing and and
seeing what it could do and exploring

780
00:14:58,980 --> 00:14:58,990
seeing what it could do and exploring
 

781
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:00,870
seeing what it could do and exploring
and getting it to do more things and

782
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:00,880
and getting it to do more things and
 

783
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,340
and getting it to do more things and
then setting new goals and reaching for

784
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:02,350
then setting new goals and reaching for
 

785
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:05,220
then setting new goals and reaching for
them and and with in the case of

786
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:05,230
them and and with in the case of
 

787
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:07,740
them and and with in the case of
component in the case of LVM when I

788
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:07,750
component in the case of LVM when I
 

789
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:10,800
component in the case of LVM when I
start work on that my research advisor

790
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:10,810
start work on that my research advisor
 

791
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:12,960
start work on that my research advisor
that I was working for was a compiler

792
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:12,970
that I was working for was a compiler
 

793
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:15,210
that I was working for was a compiler
guy and so he and I specifically found

794
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:15,220
guy and so he and I specifically found
 

795
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:16,440
guy and so he and I specifically found
each other because we're both interested

796
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:16,450
each other because we're both interested
 

797
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:17,730
each other because we're both interested
in compilers and so I started working

798
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:17,740
in compilers and so I started working
 

799
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:19,860
in compilers and so I started working
with them and taking his class and a lot

800
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:19,870
with them and taking his class and a lot
 

801
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:21,780
with them and taking his class and a lot
of LLVM initially was it's fun

802
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:21,790
of LLVM initially was it's fun
 

803
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:23,400
of LLVM initially was it's fun
implementing all the standard algorithms

804
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:23,410
implementing all the standard algorithms
 

805
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:25,490
implementing all the standard algorithms
and all the all the things that pea

806
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:25,500
and all the all the things that pea
 

807
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,630
and all the all the things that pea
have been talking about and were

808
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:26,640
have been talking about and were
 

809
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,250
have been talking about and were
well-known and they were in the the

810
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:28,260
well-known and they were in the the
 

811
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,770
well-known and they were in the the
curricula for Advanced Studies and

812
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:30,780
curricula for Advanced Studies and
 

813
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:32,840
curricula for Advanced Studies and
compilers and so just being able to

814
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:32,850
compilers and so just being able to
 

815
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:35,360
compilers and so just being able to
build that was really fun and I was

816
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:35,370
build that was really fun and I was
 

817
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:37,460
build that was really fun and I was
learning a lot by instead of reading

818
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:37,470
learning a lot by instead of reading
 

819
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:39,470
learning a lot by instead of reading
about it just building and so I enjoyed

820
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:39,480
about it just building and so I enjoyed
 

821
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:39,860
about it just building and so I enjoyed
that

822
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:39,870
that
 

823
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:42,110
that
so he said compositor these complicated

824
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:42,120
so he said compositor these complicated
 

825
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:45,590
so he said compositor these complicated
systems can you even just with language

826
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:45,600
systems can you even just with language
 

827
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,980
systems can you even just with language
tried to describe you know how you turn

828
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:48,990
tried to describe you know how you turn
 

829
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:52,610
tried to describe you know how you turn
a C++ program yes into code like what

830
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:52,620
a C++ program yes into code like what
 

831
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:54,800
a C++ program yes into code like what
are the hard parts why is this hard so

832
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:54,810
are the hard parts why is this hard so
 

833
00:15:54,810 --> 00:15:56,360
are the hard parts why is this hard so
I'll give you examples of the hard parts

834
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:56,370
I'll give you examples of the hard parts
 

835
00:15:56,370 --> 00:16:00,080
I'll give you examples of the hard parts
Illinois so C++ is a very complicated

836
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:00,090
Illinois so C++ is a very complicated
 

837
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:01,430
Illinois so C++ is a very complicated
programming way which is something like

838
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:01,440
programming way which is something like
 

839
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,280
programming way which is something like
1400 pages in the spec so people as

840
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:04,290
1400 pages in the spec so people as
 

841
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:07,370
1400 pages in the spec so people as
possible as crazy complicated paas what

842
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:07,380
possible as crazy complicated paas what
 

843
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:09,260
possible as crazy complicated paas what
makes a language complicated in terms of

844
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:09,270
makes a language complicated in terms of
 

845
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:13,430
makes a language complicated in terms of
what's syntactically like us so it's

846
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:13,440
what's syntactically like us so it's
 

847
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,320
what's syntactically like us so it's
what they call syntax so the actual how

848
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:15,330
what they call syntax so the actual how
 

849
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:17,150
what they call syntax so the actual how
the character is arranged yes it's also

850
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:17,160
the character is arranged yes it's also
 

851
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:20,720
the character is arranged yes it's also
semantics how it behaves it's also in

852
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:20,730
semantics how it behaves it's also in
 

853
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:22,460
semantics how it behaves it's also in
the case of C++ there's a huge amount of

854
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:22,470
the case of C++ there's a huge amount of
 

855
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:24,410
the case of C++ there's a huge amount of
history C was supposed to build on top

856
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:24,420
history C was supposed to build on top
 

857
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:27,050
history C was supposed to build on top
of C you play that forward and then a

858
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:27,060
of C you play that forward and then a
 

859
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:29,240
of C you play that forward and then a
bunch of suboptimal in some cases

860
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:29,250
bunch of suboptimal in some cases
 

861
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:30,980
bunch of suboptimal in some cases
decisions were made and they compound

862
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:30,990
decisions were made and they compound
 

863
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,290
decisions were made and they compound
and then more and more and more things

864
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:33,300
and then more and more and more things
 

865
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,480
and then more and more and more things
keep getting added to C++ and it will

866
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:35,490
keep getting added to C++ and it will
 

867
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:37,910
keep getting added to C++ and it will
probably never stop but the language is

868
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:37,920
probably never stop but the language is
 

869
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,380
probably never stop but the language is
very complicated from that perspective

870
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:39,390
very complicated from that perspective
 

871
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:40,370
very complicated from that perspective
and so the interactions between

872
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:40,380
and so the interactions between
 

873
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:42,560
and so the interactions between
subsystems is very complicated there's

874
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:42,570
subsystems is very complicated there's
 

875
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:45,050
subsystems is very complicated there's
just a lot there and when you talk about

876
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:45,060
just a lot there and when you talk about
 

877
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,040
just a lot there and when you talk about
the front end one of the major

878
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:46,050
the front end one of the major
 

879
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:48,710
the front end one of the major
challenges which clang as a project the

880
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:48,720
challenges which clang as a project the
 

881
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,380
challenges which clang as a project the
the C C++ compiler that I built I and

882
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:51,390
the C C++ compiler that I built I and
 

883
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:53,900
the C C++ compiler that I built I and
many people built one of the challenges

884
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:53,910
many people built one of the challenges
 

885
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:58,190
many people built one of the challenges
we took on was we looked at GCC ok GCC

886
00:16:58,190 --> 00:16:58,200
we took on was we looked at GCC ok GCC
 

887
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,770
we took on was we looked at GCC ok GCC
at the time was like a really good

888
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:00,780
at the time was like a really good
 

889
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:03,590
at the time was like a really good
industry standardized compiler that had

890
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:03,600
industry standardized compiler that had
 

891
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,780
industry standardized compiler that had
really consolidated a lot of the other

892
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:05,790
really consolidated a lot of the other
 

893
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:07,340
really consolidated a lot of the other
compilers in the world and was was a

894
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:07,350
compilers in the world and was was a
 

895
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:09,199
compilers in the world and was was a
standard but it wasn't really great for

896
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:09,209
standard but it wasn't really great for
 

897
00:17:09,209 --> 00:17:11,480
standard but it wasn't really great for
research the design was very difficult

898
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:11,490
research the design was very difficult
 

899
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:14,840
research the design was very difficult
to work with and it was full of global

900
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:14,850
to work with and it was full of global
 

901
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:16,699
to work with and it was full of global
variables and other other things that

902
00:17:16,699 --> 00:17:16,709
variables and other other things that
 

903
00:17:16,709 --> 00:17:18,350
variables and other other things that
made it very difficult to reuse in ways

904
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:18,360
made it very difficult to reuse in ways
 

905
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:19,790
made it very difficult to reuse in ways
that it wasn't originally designed for

906
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:19,800
that it wasn't originally designed for
 

907
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,679
that it wasn't originally designed for
and so with claying one of the things

908
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:21,689
and so with claying one of the things
 

909
00:17:21,689 --> 00:17:24,110
and so with claying one of the things
what we wanted to do is push forward on

910
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:24,120
what we wanted to do is push forward on
 

911
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,970
what we wanted to do is push forward on
better user interface so make error

912
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:25,980
better user interface so make error
 

913
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,829
better user interface so make error
messages that are just better than GCC's

914
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:27,839
messages that are just better than GCC's
 

915
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,390
messages that are just better than GCC's
and that that's actually hard because

916
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:29,400
and that that's actually hard because
 

917
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,860
and that that's actually hard because
you have to do a lot of bookkeeping in

918
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:30,870
you have to do a lot of bookkeeping in
 

919
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:32,270
you have to do a lot of bookkeeping in
an efficient way

920
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:32,280
an efficient way
 

921
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,980
an efficient way
today I'll do that we want to make

922
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:33,990
today I'll do that we want to make
 

923
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:35,690
today I'll do that we want to make
compile-time better and so compile-time

924
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:35,700
compile-time better and so compile-time
 

925
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,730
compile-time better and so compile-time
is about making it efficient which is

926
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:37,740
is about making it efficient which is
 

927
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:38,870
is about making it efficient which is
also really hard when you're keeping

928
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:38,880
also really hard when you're keeping
 

929
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,060
also really hard when you're keeping
track of extra information we wanted to

930
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:41,070
track of extra information we wanted to
 

931
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:44,240
track of extra information we wanted to
make new tools available so refactoring

932
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:44,250
make new tools available so refactoring
 

933
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:46,520
make new tools available so refactoring
tools and other analysis tools the the

934
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:46,530
tools and other analysis tools the the
 

935
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:49,550

GCC never supported also leveraging the

936
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:49,560
GCC never supported also leveraging the
 

937
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:52,880
GCC never supported also leveraging the
extra information we kept but enabling

938
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:52,890
extra information we kept but enabling
 

939
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:54,290
extra information we kept but enabling
those new classes the tools that then

940
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:54,300
those new classes the tools that then
 

941
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,480
those new classes the tools that then
get built into IDs and so that's been

942
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:56,490
get built into IDs and so that's been
 

943
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:58,820
get built into IDs and so that's been
one of the one of the areas that clang

944
00:17:58,820 --> 00:17:58,830
one of the one of the areas that clang
 

945
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:01,130
one of the one of the areas that clang
has really helped push the world forward

946
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:01,140
has really helped push the world forward
 

947
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:03,770
has really helped push the world forward
in the tooling for C and C++ and things

948
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:03,780
in the tooling for C and C++ and things
 

949
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:06,740
in the tooling for C and C++ and things
like that but C++ and the front-end

950
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:06,750
like that but C++ and the front-end
 

951
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,030
like that but C++ and the front-end
piece is complicated and you have to

952
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:08,040
piece is complicated and you have to
 

953
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,980
piece is complicated and you have to
build syntax trees and you have to check

954
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:09,990
build syntax trees and you have to check
 

955
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:11,780
build syntax trees and you have to check
every rule in the spec and you have to

00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:11,790
every rule in the spec and you have to
 

957
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:14,060
every rule in the spec and you have to
turn that back into an error message to

958
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:14,070
turn that back into an error message to
 

959
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:15,560
turn that back into an error message to
the humor humor that the human can

960
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:15,570
the humor humor that the human can
 

961
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:16,900
the humor humor that the human can
understand when they do something wrong

962
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:16,910
understand when they do something wrong
 

963
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:19,970
understand when they do something wrong
but then you start doing the what's

964
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:19,980
but then you start doing the what's
 

965
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:22,190
but then you start doing the what's
called lowering so going from C++ in the

966
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:22,200
called lowering so going from C++ in the
 

967
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,780
called lowering so going from C++ in the
way that it represents code down to the

968
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:23,790
way that it represents code down to the
 

969
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:25,880
way that it represents code down to the
machine and when you do that there's

970
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:25,890
machine and when you do that there's
 

971
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:28,930
machine and when you do that there's
many different phases you go through

972
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:28,940
many different phases you go through
 

973
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:31,970
many different phases you go through
often there are I think LLVM something

974
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:31,980
often there are I think LLVM something
 

975
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:34,400
often there are I think LLVM something
like 150 different what are called

976
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:34,410
like 150 different what are called
 

977
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:36,620
like 150 different what are called
passes in the compiler that the code

978
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:36,630
passes in the compiler that the code
 

979
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:39,580
passes in the compiler that the code
passed passes through and these get

980
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:39,590
passed passes through and these get
 

981
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:41,960
passed passes through and these get
organized in very complicated ways which

982
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:41,970
organized in very complicated ways which
 

983
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:44,210
organized in very complicated ways which
affect the generated code in performance

984
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:44,220
affect the generated code in performance
 

985
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:45,980
affect the generated code in performance
and compile time and many of the things

986
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:45,990
and compile time and many of the things
 

987
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:47,900
and compile time and many of the things
what are they passing through so after

988
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:47,910
what are they passing through so after
 

989
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:52,400
what are they passing through so after
you do the clang parsing what's what's

990
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:52,410
you do the clang parsing what's what's
 

991
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:54,890
you do the clang parsing what's what's
the graph what does it look like what's

992
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:54,900
the graph what does it look like what's
 

993
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,020
the graph what does it look like what's
the data structure here yeah so in in

994
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:57,030
the data structure here yeah so in in
 

995
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:59,210
the data structure here yeah so in in
the parser it's usually a tree and it's

996
00:18:59,210 --> 00:18:59,220
the parser it's usually a tree and it's
 

997
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:01,370
the parser it's usually a tree and it's
called an abstract syntax tree and so

998
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:01,380
called an abstract syntax tree and so
 

999
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:04,040
called an abstract syntax tree and so
the idea is you you have a node for the

1000
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:04,050
the idea is you you have a node for the
 

1001
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:06,110
the idea is you you have a node for the
plus that the human wrote in their code

1002
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:06,120
plus that the human wrote in their code
 

1003
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,210
plus that the human wrote in their code
or the function call you'll have a node

1004
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:08,220
or the function call you'll have a node
 

1005
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:10,400
or the function call you'll have a node
for call with the function that they

1006
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:10,410
for call with the function that they
 

1007
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:11,990
for call with the function that they
call and the arguments they pass things

1008
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:12,000
call and the arguments they pass things
 

1009
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,250
call and the arguments they pass things
like that this then gets lowered into

1010
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:16,260
like that this then gets lowered into
 

1011
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:17,180
like that this then gets lowered into
what's called an intermediate

1012
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:17,190
what's called an intermediate
 

1013
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:19,130
what's called an intermediate
representation and intermediate

1014
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:19,140
representation and intermediate
 

1015
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:21,680
representation and intermediate
representations are like LVM has one and

1016
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:21,690
representations are like LVM has one and
 

1017
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:25,910
representations are like LVM has one and
there it's a it's what's called a

1018
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:25,920
there it's a it's what's called a
 

1019
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,540
there it's a it's what's called a
control flow graph and so you represent

1020
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:28,550
control flow graph and so you represent
 

1021
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:31,670
control flow graph and so you represent
each operation in the program as a very

1022
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:31,680
each operation in the program as a very
 

1023
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,980
each operation in the program as a very
simple like this is gonna add two

1024
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:33,990
simple like this is gonna add two
 

1025
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:35,390
simple like this is gonna add two
numbers this is gonna multiply two

1026
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:35,400
numbers this is gonna multiply two
 

1027
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,760
numbers this is gonna multiply two
things maybe we'll do a call but then

1028
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:37,770
things maybe we'll do a call but then
 

1029
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:39,380
things maybe we'll do a call but then
they get put in what are called blocks

1030
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:39,390
they get put in what are called blocks
 

1031
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:42,380
they get put in what are called blocks
and so you get blocks of these straight

1032
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:42,390
and so you get blocks of these straight
 

1033
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:44,210
and so you get blocks of these straight
line operations or instead of being

1034
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:44,220
line operations or instead of being
 

1035
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:46,160
line operations or instead of being
nested like in a tree it's straight line

1036
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:46,170
nested like in a tree it's straight line
 

1037
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:46,740
nested like in a tree it's straight line
operation

1038
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:46,750
operation
 

1039
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,330
operation
and so there's a sequence and ordering

1040
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:48,340
and so there's a sequence and ordering
 

1041
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:50,400
and so there's a sequence and ordering
to these operations and then in the

1042
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:50,410
to these operations and then in the
 

1043
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:52,050
to these operations and then in the
block we're outside the block that's

1044
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:52,060
block we're outside the block that's
 

1045
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:53,880
block we're outside the block that's
within the block and so it's a straight

1046
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:53,890
within the block and so it's a straight
 

1047
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:55,290
within the block and so it's a straight
line sequence of operations within the

1048
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:55,300
line sequence of operations within the
 

1049
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,600
line sequence of operations within the
block and then you have branches like

1050
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:57,610
block and then you have branches like
 

1051
00:19:57,610 --> 00:19:59,880
block and then you have branches like
conditional branches between blocks and

1052
00:19:59,880 --> 00:19:59,890
conditional branches between blocks and
 

1053
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:03,300
conditional branches between blocks and
so when you write a loop for example in

1054
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:03,310
so when you write a loop for example in
 

1055
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:06,600
so when you write a loop for example in
a syntax tree you would have a four node

1056
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:06,610
a syntax tree you would have a four node
 

1057
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:08,700
a syntax tree you would have a four node
like for a for statement and I see like

1058
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:08,710
like for a for statement and I see like
 

1059
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:10,920
like for a for statement and I see like
language you'd out a four node and you

1060
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:10,930
language you'd out a four node and you
 

1061
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:12,420
language you'd out a four node and you
have a pointer to the expression for the

1062
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:12,430
have a pointer to the expression for the
 

1063
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:14,040
have a pointer to the expression for the
initializer a pointer to the expression

1064
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:14,050
initializer a pointer to the expression
 

1065
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:15,270
initializer a pointer to the expression
for the increment a pointer to the

1066
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:15,280
for the increment a pointer to the
 

1067
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,610
for the increment a pointer to the
expression for the comparison a pointer

1068
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:17,620
expression for the comparison a pointer
 

1069
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:19,320
expression for the comparison a pointer
to the body okay and these are all

1070
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:19,330
to the body okay and these are all
 

1071
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:21,630
to the body okay and these are all
nested underneath it in a control flow

1072
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:21,640
nested underneath it in a control flow
 

1073
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:24,660
nested underneath it in a control flow
graph you get a block for the code that

1074
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:24,670
graph you get a block for the code that
 

1075
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:26,700
graph you get a block for the code that
runs before the loop so the initializer

1076
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:26,710
runs before the loop so the initializer
 

1077
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:29,550
runs before the loop so the initializer
code then you have a block for the body

1078
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:29,560
code then you have a block for the body
 

1079
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:32,070
code then you have a block for the body
of the loop and so the the body of the

1080
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:32,080
of the loop and so the the body of the
 

1081
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,230
of the loop and so the the body of the
loop code goes in there but also they

1082
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:34,240
loop code goes in there but also they
 

1083
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,520
loop code goes in there but also they
increment and other things like that and

1084
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:35,530
increment and other things like that and
 

1085
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:36,930
increment and other things like that and
then you have a branch that goes back to

1086
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:36,940
then you have a branch that goes back to
 

1087
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:39,180
then you have a branch that goes back to
the top and a comparison and branch that

1088
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:39,190
the top and a comparison and branch that
 

1089
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:41,850
the top and a comparison and branch that
goes out and so it's more of a assembly

1090
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:41,860
goes out and so it's more of a assembly
 

1091
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:44,220
goes out and so it's more of a assembly
level kind of representation but the

1092
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:44,230
level kind of representation but the
 

1093
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:45,270
level kind of representation but the
nice thing about this level of

1094
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:45,280
nice thing about this level of
 

1095
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,890
nice thing about this level of
representation is it's much more

1096
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:46,900
representation is it's much more
 

1097
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:49,800
representation is it's much more
language independent and so there's lots

1098
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:49,810
language independent and so there's lots
 

1099
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:52,020
language independent and so there's lots
of different kinds of languages with

1100
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:52,030
of different kinds of languages with
 

1101
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:55,020
of different kinds of languages with
different kinds of you know JavaScript

1102
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:55,030
different kinds of you know JavaScript
 

1103
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:56,910
different kinds of you know JavaScript
has a lot of different ideas of what is

1104
00:20:56,910 --> 00:20:56,920
has a lot of different ideas of what is
 

1105
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:59,580
has a lot of different ideas of what is
false for example and all that can stay

1106
00:20:59,580 --> 00:20:59,590
false for example and all that can stay
 

1107
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:01,950
false for example and all that can stay
in the front end but then that middle

1108
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:01,960
in the front end but then that middle
 

1109
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,260
in the front end but then that middle
part can be shared across all those how

1110
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:04,270
part can be shared across all those how
 

1111
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:06,690
part can be shared across all those how
close is that intermediate

1112
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:06,700
close is that intermediate
 

1113
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:09,330
close is that intermediate
representation to ten yuan that works

1114
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:09,340
representation to ten yuan that works
 

1115
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:12,690
representation to ten yuan that works
for example is they are they because

1116
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:12,700
for example is they are they because
 

1117
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:15,240
for example is they are they because
everything described as a kind of neural

1118
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:15,250
everything described as a kind of neural
 

1119
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:16,800
everything described as a kind of neural
network graph right yeah that's all we

1120
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:16,810
network graph right yeah that's all we
 

1121
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:18,840
network graph right yeah that's all we
need a neighbor's or what they're

1122
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:18,850
need a neighbor's or what they're
 

1123
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:21,030
need a neighbor's or what they're
they're quite different in details but

1124
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:21,040
they're quite different in details but
 

1125
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,920
they're quite different in details but
they're very similar and idea so one of

1126
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:22,930
they're very similar and idea so one of
 

1127
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:24,090
they're very similar and idea so one of
the things that normal networks do is

1128
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:24,100
the things that normal networks do is
 

1129
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:26,910
the things that normal networks do is
they learn representations for data at

1130
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:26,920
they learn representations for data at
 

1131
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:29,070
they learn representations for data at
different levels of abstraction right

1132
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:29,080
different levels of abstraction right
 

1133
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:31,470
different levels of abstraction right
and then they transform those through

1134
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:31,480
and then they transform those through
 

1135
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:34,890
and then they transform those through
layers right so the compiler does very

1136
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:34,900
layers right so the compiler does very
 

1137
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,540
layers right so the compiler does very
similar things but one of the things the

1138
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:36,550
similar things but one of the things the
 

1139
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:38,520
similar things but one of the things the
compiler does is it has relatively few

1140
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:38,530
compiler does is it has relatively few
 

1141
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:41,040
compiler does is it has relatively few
different representations or a neural

1142
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:41,050
different representations or a neural
 

1143
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:42,630
different representations or a neural
network often as you get deeper for

1144
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:42,640
network often as you get deeper for
 

1145
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,730
network often as you get deeper for
example you get many different

1146
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:43,740
example you get many different
 

1147
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:46,620
example you get many different
representations in each you know layer

1148
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:46,630
representations in each you know layer
 

1149
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:48,450
representations in each you know layer
or set of ops is transforming between

1150
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:48,460
or set of ops is transforming between
 

1151
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:50,040
or set of ops is transforming between
these different representations and

1152
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:50,050
these different representations and
 

1153
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:52,320
these different representations and
compiler often you get one

1154
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:52,330
compiler often you get one
 

1155
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:53,730
compiler often you get one
representation and they do many

1156
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:53,740
representation and they do many
 

1157
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:55,440
representation and they do many
transformations to it and these

1158
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:55,450
transformations to it and these
 

1159
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:57,110
transformations to it and these
transformations are often applied

1160
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:57,120
transformations are often applied
 

1161
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,220
transformations are often applied
iteratively

1162
00:21:59,220 --> 00:21:59,230
iteratively
 

1163
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:02,250
iteratively
and for programmers there's familiar

1164
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:02,260
and for programmers there's familiar
 

1165
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:03,690
and for programmers there's familiar
types of things for example trying to

1166
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:03,700
types of things for example trying to
 

1167
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:06,240
types of things for example trying to
find expressions inside of a loop and

1168
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:06,250
find expressions inside of a loop and
 

1169
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:07,620
find expressions inside of a loop and
pulling them out of a loop so if they

1170
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:07,630
pulling them out of a loop so if they
 

1171
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:09,150
pulling them out of a loop so if they
execute four times or a fine

1172
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:09,160
execute four times or a fine
 

1173
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:13,560
execute four times or a fine
redundant computation or find constant

1174
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:13,570
redundant computation or find constant
 

1175
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:15,690
redundant computation or find constant
folding or other simplifications turning

1176
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:15,700
folding or other simplifications turning
 

1177
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:18,630
folding or other simplifications turning
you know 2 times X into X shift left by

1178
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:18,640
you know 2 times X into X shift left by
 

1179
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,730
you know 2 times X into X shift left by
one and and things like this or all all

1180
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:20,740
one and and things like this or all all
 

1181
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:22,500
one and and things like this or all all
all the examples of the things that

1182
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:22,510
all the examples of the things that
 

1183
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:24,480
all the examples of the things that
happen but compilers end up getting a

1184
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:24,490
happen but compilers end up getting a
 

1185
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:27,060
happen but compilers end up getting a
lot of theorem proving and other kinds

1186
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:27,070
lot of theorem proving and other kinds
 

1187
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:28,230
lot of theorem proving and other kinds
of algorithms that try to find

1188
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:28,240
of algorithms that try to find
 

1189
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,820
of algorithms that try to find
higher-level properties of the program

1190
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:29,830
higher-level properties of the program
 

1191
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:31,680
higher-level properties of the program
that then can be used by the optimizer

1192
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:31,690
that then can be used by the optimizer
 

1193
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:35,070
that then can be used by the optimizer
cool so what's like the biggest bang for

1194
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:35,080
cool so what's like the biggest bang for
 

1195
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:38,400
cool so what's like the biggest bang for
the buck with optimization what's there

1196
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:38,410
the buck with optimization what's there
 

1197
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:39,120
the buck with optimization what's there
yeah

1198
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:39,130
yeah
 

1199
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:41,250
yeah
well no not even today at the very

1200
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:41,260
well no not even today at the very
 

1201
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:43,110
well no not even today at the very
beginning the 80s I don't know but yeah

1202
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:43,120
beginning the 80s I don't know but yeah
 

1203
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,880
beginning the 80s I don't know but yeah
so for the 80s a lot of it was things

1204
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:44,890
so for the 80s a lot of it was things
 

1205
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:47,280
so for the 80s a lot of it was things
like register allocation so the idea of

1206
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:47,290
like register allocation so the idea of
 

1207
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:50,610
like register allocation so the idea of
in in a modern like a microprocessor

1208
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:50,620
in in a modern like a microprocessor
 

1209
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:51,870
in in a modern like a microprocessor
what you'll end up having is you're

1210
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:51,880
what you'll end up having is you're
 

1211
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:54,030
what you'll end up having is you're
having memory which is relatively slow

1212
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:54,040
having memory which is relatively slow
 

1213
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,220
having memory which is relatively slow
and then you have registers relatively

1214
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:56,230
and then you have registers relatively
 

1215
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:58,860
and then you have registers relatively
fast but registers you don't have very

1216
00:22:58,860 --> 00:22:58,870
fast but registers you don't have very
 

1217
00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:01,020
fast but registers you don't have very
many of them ok and so when you're

1218
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:01,030
many of them ok and so when you're
 

1219
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:02,850
many of them ok and so when you're
writing a bunch of code you're just

1220
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:02,860
writing a bunch of code you're just
 

1221
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:04,440
writing a bunch of code you're just
saying like compute this put it in

1222
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:04,450
saying like compute this put it in
 

1223
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:05,760
saying like compute this put it in
temporary variable compute those compute

1224
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:05,770
temporary variable compute those compute
 

1225
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:07,740
temporary variable compute those compute
this compute this put in temporary well

1226
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:07,750
this compute this put in temporary well
 

1227
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:08,760
this compute this put in temporary well
I have a loop I have some other stuff

1228
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:08,770
I have a loop I have some other stuff
 

1229
00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:09,240
I have a loop I have some other stuff
going on

1230
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:09,250
going on
 

1231
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:11,789
going on
well now you're running on an x86 like a

1232
00:23:11,789 --> 00:23:11,799
well now you're running on an x86 like a
 

1233
00:23:11,799 --> 00:23:14,580
well now you're running on an x86 like a
desktop PC or something well it only has

1234
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:14,590
desktop PC or something well it only has
 

1235
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:17,600
desktop PC or something well it only has
in some cases some modes eight registers

1236
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:17,610
in some cases some modes eight registers
 

1237
00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:20,220
in some cases some modes eight registers
right and so now the compiler has to

1238
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:20,230
right and so now the compiler has to
 

1239
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:22,110
right and so now the compiler has to
choose what values get put in what

1240
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:22,120
choose what values get put in what
 

1241
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,820
choose what values get put in what
registers at what points in the program

1242
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:23,830
registers at what points in the program
 

1243
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:26,070
registers at what points in the program
and this is actually a really big deal

1244
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:26,080
and this is actually a really big deal
 

1245
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,320
and this is actually a really big deal
so if you think about you have a loop

1246
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:28,330
so if you think about you have a loop
 

1247
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:29,970
so if you think about you have a loop
and then an inner loop to execute

1248
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:29,980
and then an inner loop to execute
 

1249
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:32,010
and then an inner loop to execute
millions of times maybe if you're doing

1250
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:32,020
millions of times maybe if you're doing
 

1251
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:33,690
millions of times maybe if you're doing
loads and stores inside that loop then

1252
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:33,700
loads and stores inside that loop then
 

1253
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,340
loads and stores inside that loop then
it's gonna be really slow but if you can

1254
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:35,350
it's gonna be really slow but if you can
 

1255
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:37,470
it's gonna be really slow but if you can
somehow fit all the values inside that

1256
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:37,480
somehow fit all the values inside that
 

1257
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,419
somehow fit all the values inside that
loop and registers now it's really fast

1258
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:39,429
loop and registers now it's really fast
 

1259
00:23:39,429 --> 00:23:42,840
loop and registers now it's really fast
and so getting that right requires a lot

1260
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:42,850
and so getting that right requires a lot
 

1261
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:44,070
and so getting that right requires a lot
of work because there's many different

1262
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:44,080
of work because there's many different
 

1263
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,140
of work because there's many different
ways to do that and often what the

1264
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:46,150
ways to do that and often what the
 

1265
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:47,460
ways to do that and often what the
compiler ends up doing is it ends up

1266
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:47,470
compiler ends up doing is it ends up
 

1267
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:49,350
compiler ends up doing is it ends up
thinking about things in a different

1268
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:49,360
thinking about things in a different
 

1269
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,060
thinking about things in a different

compiler thinks about that as four

1274
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:55,150
compiler thinks about that as four
 

1275
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:57,270
compiler thinks about that as four
different values each which have

1276
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:57,280
different values each which have
 

1277
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,159
different values each which have
different lifetimes across the function

1278
00:23:59,159 --> 00:23:59,169
different lifetimes across the function
 

1279
00:23:59,169 --> 00:24:01,350
different lifetimes across the function
that it's in and each of those could be

1280
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:01,360
that it's in and each of those could be
 

1281
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,659
that it's in and each of those could be
put in a register or memory or different

1282
00:24:03,659 --> 00:24:03,669
put in a register or memory or different
 

1283
00:24:03,669 --> 00:24:05,909
put in a register or memory or different
memory or maybe in some parts of the

1284
00:24:05,909 --> 00:24:05,919
memory or maybe in some parts of the
 

1285
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:08,039
memory or maybe in some parts of the
code recomputed instead of stored and

1286
00:24:08,039 --> 00:24:08,049
code recomputed instead of stored and
 

1287
00:24:08,049 --> 00:24:09,299
code recomputed instead of stored and
reloaded and there are many of these

1288
00:24:09,299 --> 00:24:09,309
reloaded and there are many of these
 

1289
00:24:09,309 --> 00:24:10,799
reloaded and there are many of these
different kinds of techniques that can

1290
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:10,809
different kinds of techniques that can
 

1291
00:24:10,809 --> 00:24:13,070
different kinds of techniques that can
be used so it's adding almost like a

1292
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:13,080
be used so it's adding almost like a
 

1293
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:16,980
be used so it's adding almost like a
time-dimension - it's trying to trying

1294
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:16,990
time-dimension - it's trying to trying
 

1295
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:18,960
time-dimension - it's trying to trying
to optimize across time so considering

1296
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:18,970
to optimize across time so considering
 

1297
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:20,669
to optimize across time so considering
when when you're programming you're not

1298
00:24:20,669 --> 00:24:20,679
when when you're programming you're not
 

1299
00:24:20,679 --> 00:24:22,740
when when you're programming you're not
thinking and yeah absolutely

1300
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:22,750
thinking and yeah absolutely
 

1301
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:26,340
thinking and yeah absolutely
and so the the RISC era made thing this

1302
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:26,350
and so the the RISC era made thing this
 

1303
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:30,779
and so the the RISC era made thing this
so so RISC chips Ras see the the risks

1304
00:24:30,779 --> 00:24:30,789
so so RISC chips Ras see the the risks
 

1305
00:24:30,789 --> 00:24:33,779
so so RISC chips Ras see the the risks
risk chips as opposed to sisk chips the

1306
00:24:33,779 --> 00:24:33,789
risk chips as opposed to sisk chips the
 

1307
00:24:33,789 --> 00:24:35,580
risk chips as opposed to sisk chips the
risk chips made things more complicated

1308
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:35,590
risk chips made things more complicated
 

1309
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:39,299
risk chips made things more complicated
for the compiler because what they ended

1310
00:24:39,299 --> 00:24:39,309
for the compiler because what they ended
 

1311
00:24:39,309 --> 00:24:41,370
for the compiler because what they ended
up doing is ending up adding pipelines

1312
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:41,380
up doing is ending up adding pipelines
 

1313
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:43,049
up doing is ending up adding pipelines
to the processor where the processor can

1314
00:24:43,049 --> 00:24:43,059
to the processor where the processor can
 

1315
00:24:43,059 --> 00:24:45,060
to the processor where the processor can
do more than one thing at a time but

1316
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:45,070
do more than one thing at a time but
 

1317
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:46,590
do more than one thing at a time but
this means that the order of operations

1318
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:46,600
this means that the order of operations
 

1319
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,240
this means that the order of operations
matters a lot and so one of the

1320
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:48,250
matters a lot and so one of the
 

1321
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:49,919
matters a lot and so one of the
classical compiler techniques that you

1322
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:49,929
classical compiler techniques that you
 

1323
00:24:49,929 --> 00:24:53,010
classical compiler techniques that you
use is called scheduling and so moving

1324
00:24:53,010 --> 00:24:53,020
use is called scheduling and so moving
 

1325
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:54,930
use is called scheduling and so moving
the instructions around so that the

1326
00:24:54,930 --> 00:24:54,940
the instructions around so that the
 

1327
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:56,549
the instructions around so that the
processor can act like keep its

1328
00:24:56,549 --> 00:24:56,559
processor can act like keep its
 

1329
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:58,529
processor can act like keep its
pipelines full instead of stalling and

1330
00:24:58,529 --> 00:24:58,539
pipelines full instead of stalling and
 

1331
00:24:58,539 --> 00:25:00,240
pipelines full instead of stalling and
getting blocked and so there's a lot of

1332
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:00,250
getting blocked and so there's a lot of
 

1333
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:02,310
getting blocked and so there's a lot of
things like that that are kind of bread

1334
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:02,320
things like that that are kind of bread
 

1335
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,720
things like that that are kind of bread
and butter a compiler techniques have

1336
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:03,730
and butter a compiler techniques have
 

1337
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:05,279
and butter a compiler techniques have
been studied a lot over the course of

1338
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:05,289
been studied a lot over the course of
 

1339
00:25:05,289 --> 00:25:07,649
been studied a lot over the course of
decades now but the engineering side of

1340
00:25:07,649 --> 00:25:07,659
decades now but the engineering side of
 

1341
00:25:07,659 --> 00:25:09,840
decades now but the engineering side of
making them real is also still quite

1342
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:09,850
making them real is also still quite
 

1343
00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:12,149
making them real is also still quite
hard and you talk about machine learning

1344
00:25:12,149 --> 00:25:12,159
hard and you talk about machine learning
 

1345
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:13,740
hard and you talk about machine learning
this is this is a huge opportunity for

1346
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:13,750
this is this is a huge opportunity for
 

1347
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:15,299
this is this is a huge opportunity for
machine learning because many of these

1348
00:25:15,299 --> 00:25:15,309
machine learning because many of these
 

1349
00:25:15,309 --> 00:25:17,909
machine learning because many of these
algorithms are full of these like hokey

1350
00:25:17,909 --> 00:25:17,919
algorithms are full of these like hokey
 

1351
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:19,620
algorithms are full of these like hokey
hand-rolled heuristics which work well

1357
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:26,460

you know I hear there's some techniques

1358
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:26,470
you know I hear there's some techniques
 

1359
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:28,380
you know I hear there's some techniques
that are good at handling that so what

1360
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:28,390
that are good at handling that so what
 

1361
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:30,600
that are good at handling that so what
would be the if you were to apply

1362
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:30,610
would be the if you were to apply
 

1363
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:33,539
would be the if you were to apply
machine learning to this what's the

1364
00:25:33,539 --> 00:25:33,549
machine learning to this what's the
 

1365
00:25:33,549 --> 00:25:34,890
machine learning to this what's the
thing you try to optimize is it

1366
00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:34,900
thing you try to optimize is it
 

1367
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:39,450
thing you try to optimize is it
ultimately the running time you can pick

1368
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:39,460
ultimately the running time you can pick
 

1369
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:40,799
ultimately the running time you can pick
your metric and there's there's running

1370
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:40,809
your metric and there's there's running
 

1371
00:25:40,809 --> 00:25:43,289
your metric and there's there's running

00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:46,080
lots of different things that you can
optimize for code code size is another

one that some people care about in the

1378
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:47,440
one that some people care about in the
 

1379
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,789
one that some people care about in the
embedded space is this like the thinking

1380
00:25:50,789 --> 00:25:50,799
embedded space is this like the thinking
 

1381
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,830
embedded space is this like the thinking
into the future or somebody actually

00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:52,840
into the future or somebody actually
 

1383
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:56,250

learning based parameter tuning for
 

1387
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:01,620
learning based parameter tuning for
optimization of compilers so this is

1388
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:01,630
optimization of compilers so this is
 

1389
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:03,630
optimization of compilers so this is
something that is I would say research

1390
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:03,640
something that is I would say research
 

1391
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:06,299
something that is I would say research
right now there are a lot of research

1392
00:26:06,299 --> 00:26:06,309
right now there are a lot of research
 

1393
00:26:06,309 --> 00:26:07,950
right now there are a lot of research
systems that have been applying search

00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:07,960
systems that have been applying search
 

1395
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:10,020
systems that have been applying search
in various forums and using

00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:11,590
reinforcement learning is one form but
 

1399
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:13,080
reinforcement learning is one form but
also brute force search has been tried

1400
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:13,090
also brute force search has been tried
 

1401
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:15,450
also brute force search has been tried
for a quite a while and usually these

1402
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:15,460
for a quite a while and usually these
 

1403
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:18,299
for a quite a while and usually these
are in small small problem spaces so

1404
00:26:18,299 --> 00:26:18,309
are in small small problem spaces so
 

1405
00:26:18,309 --> 00:26:21,539
are in small small problem spaces so

you execute multiple things in parallel

1416
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:31,930
you execute multiple things in parallel
 

1417
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:34,710
you execute multiple things in parallel
and there's many different confounding

1418
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:34,720
and there's many different confounding
 

1419
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,750
and there's many different confounding
factors here because graphics cards have

bandwidth and many different constraints
to interact in nonlinear ways and so

1428
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:44,770
to interact in nonlinear ways and so
 

1429
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:48,000
to interact in nonlinear ways and so
search is very powerful for that and it

1430
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:48,010
search is very powerful for that and it
 

1431
00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:50,010
search is very powerful for that and it
gets used in in certain ways but it's

1432
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:50,020
gets used in in certain ways but it's
 

1433
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:51,780
gets used in in certain ways but it's
not very structured this is something

1434
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:51,790
not very structured this is something
 

1435
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:53,580
not very structured this is something
that we need we as an industry need to

1436
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:53,590
that we need we as an industry need to
 

1437
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:58,140
that we need we as an industry need to
fix these set ATS but like so have there

1438
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:58,150
fix these set ATS but like so have there
 

1439
00:26:58,150 --> 00:26:59,970
fix these set ATS but like so have there
been like big jumps and improvement and

1440
00:26:59,970 --> 00:26:59,980
been like big jumps and improvement and
 

1441
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:03,060
been like big jumps and improvement and
optimization yeah yeah yes since then

1442
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:03,070
optimization yeah yeah yes since then
 

1443
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:06,060
optimization yeah yeah yes since then
what's yeah so so it's largely been

1444
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:06,070
what's yeah so so it's largely been
 

1445
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:09,180
what's yeah so so it's largely been
driven by hardware so hartwell hardware

1446
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:09,190
driven by hardware so hartwell hardware
 

1447
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:12,050
driven by hardware so hartwell hardware
and software so in the mid-90s Java

1448
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:12,060
and software so in the mid-90s Java
 

1449
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:14,520
and software so in the mid-90s Java
totally changed the world right and and

1450
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:14,530
totally changed the world right and and
 

1451
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:17,100
totally changed the world right and and
I'm still amazed by how much change was

1452
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:17,110
I'm still amazed by how much change was
 

1453
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:19,230
I'm still amazed by how much change was
introduced by the way or in a good way

1454
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:19,240
introduced by the way or in a good way
 

1455
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,240
introduced by the way or in a good way
so like reflecting back Java introduced

1456
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:21,250
so like reflecting back Java introduced
 

1457
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:23,490
so like reflecting back Java introduced
things like it all at once introduced

1458
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:23,500
things like it all at once introduced
 

1459
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:24,980
things like it all at once introduced
things like JIT compilation

1460
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:24,990
things like JIT compilation
 

1461
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:27,300
things like JIT compilation
none of these were novel but it pulled

1462
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:27,310
none of these were novel but it pulled
 

1463
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:28,710
none of these were novel but it pulled
it together and made it mainstream and

1464
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:28,720
it together and made it mainstream and
 

1465
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,750
it together and made it mainstream and
and made people invest in it JIT

1466
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:30,760
and made people invest in it JIT
 

1467
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:33,090
and made people invest in it JIT
compilation garbage collection portable

1468
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:33,100
compilation garbage collection portable
 

1469
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:36,800
compilation garbage collection portable
code safe code say like memory safe code

1470
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:36,810
code safe code say like memory safe code
 

1471
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:41,040
code safe code say like memory safe code
like a very dynamic dispatch execution

1472
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:41,050
like a very dynamic dispatch execution
 

1473
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:42,750
like a very dynamic dispatch execution
model like many of these things which

1474
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:42,760
model like many of these things which
 

1475
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,220
model like many of these things which
had been done in research systems and

1476
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:44,230
had been done in research systems and
 

1477
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:45,990
had been done in research systems and
had been done in small ways and various

1478
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:46,000
had been done in small ways and various
 

1479
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,760
had been done in small ways and various
places really came to the forefront

1480
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:47,770
places really came to the forefront
 

1481
00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:49,820
places really came to the forefront
really changed how things worked and

1482
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:49,830
really changed how things worked and
 

1483
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:51,930
really changed how things worked and
therefore changed the way people thought

1484
00:27:51,930 --> 00:27:51,940
therefore changed the way people thought
 

1485
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:53,880
therefore changed the way people thought
about the problem javascript was another

1486
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:53,890
about the problem javascript was another
 

1487
00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:57,210
about the problem javascript was another
major world change based on the way it

1488
00:27:57,210 --> 00:27:57,220
major world change based on the way it
 

1489
00:27:57,220 --> 00:28:00,420
major world change based on the way it
works but also on the hardware side of

1490
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:00,430
works but also on the hardware side of
 

1491
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:03,810
works but also on the hardware side of
things multi-core and vector

1492
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:03,820
things multi-core and vector
 

1493
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:07,110
things multi-core and vector
instructions really change the problem

1494
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:07,120
instructions really change the problem
 

1495
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:10,290
instructions really change the problem
space and are very they don't remove any

1496
00:28:10,290 --> 00:28:10,300
space and are very they don't remove any
 

1497
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:11,880
space and are very they don't remove any
of the problems that composers faced in

1498
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:11,890
of the problems that composers faced in
 

1499
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:13,890
of the problems that composers faced in
the past but they they add new kinds of

1500
00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:13,900
the past but they they add new kinds of
 

1501
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:16,260
the past but they they add new kinds of
problems of how do you find enough work

1502
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:16,270
problems of how do you find enough work
 

1503
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:20,100
problems of how do you find enough work
to keep a four-wide vector busy right or

1504
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:20,110
to keep a four-wide vector busy right or
 

1505
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:21,860
to keep a four-wide vector busy right or
if you're doing a matrix multiplication

1506
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:21,870
if you're doing a matrix multiplication
 

1507
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:24,300
if you're doing a matrix multiplication
how do you do different columns out of

1508
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:24,310
how do you do different columns out of
 

1509
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:26,820
how do you do different columns out of
that matrix in at the same time and how

1510
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:26,830
that matrix in at the same time and how
 

1511
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,860
that matrix in at the same time and how
do you maximally utilize the the

1512
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:28,870
do you maximally utilize the the
 

1513
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:31,230
do you maximally utilize the the
arithmetic compute that one core has and

1514
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:31,240
arithmetic compute that one core has and
 

1515
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,550
arithmetic compute that one core has and
then how do you take it to multiple

1516
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:32,560
then how do you take it to multiple
 

1517
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:34,470
then how do you take it to multiple
cores and how did the whole virtual

1518
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:34,480
cores and how did the whole virtual
 

1519
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,180
cores and how did the whole virtual
machine thing change the compilation

1520
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:36,190
machine thing change the compilation
 

1521
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:39,540
machine thing change the compilation
pipeline yeah so so what what the java

1522
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:39,550
pipeline yeah so so what what the java
 

1523
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:40,290
pipeline yeah so so what what the java
virtual machine does

1524
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:40,300
virtual machine does
 

1525
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:43,740
virtual machine does
is it splits just like I've talked about

1526
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:43,750
is it splits just like I've talked about
 

1527
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:45,120
is it splits just like I've talked about
before where you have a front-end that

1528
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:45,130
before where you have a front-end that
 

1529
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:46,950
before where you have a front-end that
parses the code and then you have an

1530
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:46,960
parses the code and then you have an
 

1531
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,210
parses the code and then you have an
intermediate representation that gets

1532
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:48,220
intermediate representation that gets
 

1533
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:50,490
intermediate representation that gets
transformed what Java did was they said

1534
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:50,500
transformed what Java did was they said
 

1535
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,650
transformed what Java did was they said
we will parse the code and then compile

1536
00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:52,660
we will parse the code and then compile
 

1537
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:54,740
we will parse the code and then compile
to what's known as Java bytecode and

1538
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:54,750
to what's known as Java bytecode and
 

1539
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:57,600
to what's known as Java bytecode and
that bytecode is now a portable code

1540
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:57,610
that bytecode is now a portable code
 

1541
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:59,640
that bytecode is now a portable code
representation that is industry-standard

1542
00:28:59,640 --> 00:28:59,650
representation that is industry-standard
 

1543
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:01,860
representation that is industry-standard
and locked down and can't change and

1544
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:01,870
and locked down and can't change and
 

1545
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:04,800
and locked down and can't change and
then the the back part of the compiler

1546
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:04,810
then the the back part of the compiler
 

1547
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:06,390
then the the back part of the compiler
the the does optimization and code

1548
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:06,400
the the does optimization and code
 

1549
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,310
the the does optimization and code
generation can now be built by different

1550
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:08,320
generation can now be built by different
 

1551
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:11,430
generation can now be built by different
vendors okay and Java bytecode can be

1552
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:11,440
vendors okay and Java bytecode can be
 

1553
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,110
vendors okay and Java bytecode can be
shipped around across the wire its

1554
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:13,120
shipped around across the wire its
 

1555
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:16,590
shipped around across the wire its
memory safe and relatively trusted and

1556
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:16,600
memory safe and relatively trusted and
 

1557
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,060
memory safe and relatively trusted and
because of that it can run in the

1558
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:18,070
because of that it can run in the
 

1559
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:19,560
because of that it can run in the
browser and that's why it runs in the

1560
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:19,570
browser and that's why it runs in the
 

1561
00:29:19,570 --> 00:29:21,180
browser and that's why it runs in the
browser yeah right and so that way you

1562
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:21,190
browser yeah right and so that way you
 

1563
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:23,730
browser yeah right and so that way you
can be in you know again back in the day

1564
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:23,740
can be in you know again back in the day
 

1565
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:25,200
can be in you know again back in the day
you would write a Java applet and you

1566
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:25,210
you would write a Java applet and you
 

1567
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:27,870
you would write a Java applet and you
use as a little as a web developer you'd

1568
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:27,880
use as a little as a web developer you'd
 

1569
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:30,000
use as a little as a web developer you'd
build this mini app that run a web page

1570
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:30,010
build this mini app that run a web page
 

1571
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:33,240
build this mini app that run a web page
well a user of that is running a web

1572
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:33,250
well a user of that is running a web
 

1573
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:34,770
well a user of that is running a web
browser on their computer you download

1574
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:34,780
browser on their computer you download
 

1575
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:36,540
browser on their computer you download
that that Java bytecode which can be

1576
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:36,550
that that Java bytecode which can be
 

1577
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:39,840
that that Java bytecode which can be
trusted and then you do all the compiler

1578
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:39,850
trusted and then you do all the compiler
 

1579
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:41,550
trusted and then you do all the compiler
stuff on your machine so that you know

1580
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:41,560
stuff on your machine so that you know
 

1581
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,960
stuff on your machine so that you know
that you trust that that was that a good

1582
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:42,970
that you trust that that was that a good
 

1583
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:44,820
that you trust that that was that a good
idea a bad idea it's great idea I mean

1584
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:44,830
idea a bad idea it's great idea I mean
 

1585
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:46,350
idea a bad idea it's great idea I mean
it's great idea for certain problems and

1586
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:46,360
it's great idea for certain problems and
 

1587
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,300
it's great idea for certain problems and
I'm very much believe for the

1588
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:48,310
I'm very much believe for the
 

1589
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:50,160
I'm very much believe for the
technologies itself neither good nor bad

1590
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:50,170
technologies itself neither good nor bad
 

1591
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:53,340
technologies itself neither good nor bad
it's how you apply it you know this

1592
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:53,350
it's how you apply it you know this
 

1593
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:55,020
it's how you apply it you know this
would be a very very bad thing for very

1594
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:55,030
would be a very very bad thing for very
 

1595
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:57,630
would be a very very bad thing for very
low levels of the software stack but but

1596
00:29:57,630 --> 00:29:57,640
low levels of the software stack but but
 

1597
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,220
low levels of the software stack but but
in terms of solving some of these

1598
00:29:59,220 --> 00:29:59,230
in terms of solving some of these
 

1599
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:00,810
in terms of solving some of these
software portability and transparency

1600
00:30:00,810 --> 00:30:00,820
software portability and transparency
 

1601
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:03,120
software portability and transparency
your portability problems I think it's

1602
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:03,130
your portability problems I think it's
 

1603
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:05,010
your portability problems I think it's
been really good now Java ultimately

1604
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:05,020
been really good now Java ultimately
 

1605
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:07,530
been really good now Java ultimately
didn't win out on the desktop and like

1606
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:07,540
didn't win out on the desktop and like
 

1607
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:10,440
didn't win out on the desktop and like
there are good reasons for that but it's

1608
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:10,450
there are good reasons for that but it's
 

1609
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:12,450
there are good reasons for that but it's
been very successful on servers and in

1610
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:12,460
been very successful on servers and in
 

1611
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:13,830
been very successful on servers and in
many places it's been a very successful

1612
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:13,840
many places it's been a very successful
 

1613
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:19,220
many places it's been a very successful
thing over over decades so what has been

1614
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:19,230
thing over over decades so what has been
 

1615
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:24,570
thing over over decades so what has been
ll VMs and ceilings improvements in

00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:24,580
ll VMs and ceilings improvements in
 

1617
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:28,290
ll VMs and ceilings improvements in
optimization that throughout its history

1618
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:28,300
optimization that throughout its history
 

1619
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:30,900
optimization that throughout its history
what are some moments we get set back

1620
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:30,910
what are some moments we get set back
 

1621
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:32,550
what are some moments we get set back
I'm really proud of what's been

1622
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:32,560
I'm really proud of what's been
 

1623
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,350
I'm really proud of what's been
accomplished yeah I think that the

1624
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:34,360
accomplished yeah I think that the
 

1625
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:36,900
accomplished yeah I think that the
interesting thing about LLVM is not the

1626
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:36,910
interesting thing about LLVM is not the
 

1627
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:40,530
interesting thing about LLVM is not the
innovations in compiler research it has

1628
00:30:40,530 --> 00:30:40,540
innovations in compiler research it has
 

1629
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:42,420
innovations in compiler research it has
very good implementations of various

1630
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:42,430
very good implementations of various
 

1631
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:47,010
very good implementations of various
important algorithms no doubt and and a

1632
00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:47,020
important algorithms no doubt and and a
 

1633
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:48,030
important algorithms no doubt and and a
lot of really smart people have worked

1634
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:48,040
lot of really smart people have worked
 

1635
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,140
lot of really smart people have worked
on it but I think that the thing was

1636
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:49,150
on it but I think that the thing was
 

1637
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:51,510
on it but I think that the thing was
most profound about LLVM is that through

1638
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:51,520
most profound about LLVM is that through
 

1639
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,550
most profound about LLVM is that through
standardization it made things possible

1640
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:53,560
standardization it made things possible
 

1641
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,030
standardization it made things possible
too

1642
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:54,040
too
 

1643
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,950
too
otherwise wouldn't have happened okay

1644
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:55,960
otherwise wouldn't have happened okay
 

1645
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:58,290
otherwise wouldn't have happened okay
and so interesting things that have

1646
00:30:58,290 --> 00:30:58,300
and so interesting things that have
 

1647
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:00,270
and so interesting things that have
happened with LVM for example sony has

1648
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:00,280
happened with LVM for example sony has
 

1649
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:02,910
happened with LVM for example sony has
picked up lv m and used it to do all the

1650
00:31:02,910 --> 00:31:02,920
picked up lv m and used it to do all the
 

1651
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,320
picked up lv m and used it to do all the
graphics compilation in their movie

1652
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:04,330
graphics compilation in their movie
 

1653
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:06,600
graphics compilation in their movie
production pipeline and so now they're

1654
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:06,610
production pipeline and so now they're
 

1655
00:31:06,610 --> 00:31:07,860
production pipeline and so now they're
able to have better special effects

1656
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:07,870
able to have better special effects
 

1657
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:10,920
able to have better special effects
because of LVN that's kind of cool

1658
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:10,930
because of LVN that's kind of cool
 

1659
00:31:10,930 --> 00:31:12,180
because of LVN that's kind of cool
that's not what it was designed for

1660
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:12,190
that's not what it was designed for
 

1661
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:14,700
that's not what it was designed for
right but that's that's the sign of good

1662
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:14,710
right but that's that's the sign of good
 

1663
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:17,550
right but that's that's the sign of good
infrastructure when it can be used in

1664
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:17,560
infrastructure when it can be used in
 

1665
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,020
infrastructure when it can be used in
ways it was never designed for because

1666
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:19,030
ways it was never designed for because
 

1667
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:20,430
ways it was never designed for because
it has good layering and software

1668
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:20,440
it has good layering and software
 

1669
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,050
it has good layering and software
engineering and it's composable and

1670
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:22,060
engineering and it's composable and
 

1671
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:24,420
engineering and it's composable and
things like that just where as you said

1672
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:24,430
things like that just where as you said
 

1673
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:27,360
things like that just where as you said
it differs from GCC yes GCC is also

1674
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:27,370
it differs from GCC yes GCC is also
 

1675
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:28,830
it differs from GCC yes GCC is also
great in various ways but it's not as

1676
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:28,840
great in various ways but it's not as
 

1677
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:31,920
great in various ways but it's not as
good as a infrastructure technology it's

1678
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:31,930
good as a infrastructure technology it's
 

1679
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:34,050
good as a infrastructure technology it's
it's you know it's really a C compiler

1680
00:31:34,050 --> 00:31:34,060
it's you know it's really a C compiler
 

1681
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:36,120
it's you know it's really a C compiler
or it's or it's a fortunate compiler

1682
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:36,130
or it's or it's a fortunate compiler
 

1683
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:38,160
or it's or it's a fortunate compiler
it's not it's not infrastructure in the

1684
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:38,170
it's not it's not infrastructure in the
 

1685
00:31:38,170 --> 00:31:40,470
it's not it's not infrastructure in the
same way is it now you can tell I don't

1686
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:40,480
same way is it now you can tell I don't
 

1687
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,880
same way is it now you can tell I don't
know what I'm talking about because I'm

1688
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:41,890
know what I'm talking about because I'm
 

1689
00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:44,910
know what I'm talking about because I'm
sick eep saying si Lang you can you

1690
00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:44,920
sick eep saying si Lang you can you
 

1691
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:47,970
sick eep saying si Lang you can you
could always tell when a person is close

1692
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:47,980
could always tell when a person is close
 

1693
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:49,470
could always tell when a person is close
by the way pronounce something I'm I

1694
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:49,480
by the way pronounce something I'm I
 

1695
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,950
by the way pronounce something I'm I
don't think have I ever used Clank

1696
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:51,960
don't think have I ever used Clank
 

1697
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:54,420
don't think have I ever used Clank
entirely possible have you well so

1698
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:54,430
entirely possible have you well so
 

1699
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:57,450
entirely possible have you well so
you've used code it's generated probably

1700
00:31:57,450 --> 00:31:57,460
you've used code it's generated probably
 

1701
00:31:57,460 --> 00:32:01,140
you've used code it's generated probably
so clang is an Alabama used to compile

1702
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:01,150
so clang is an Alabama used to compile
 

1703
00:32:01,150 --> 00:32:03,600
so clang is an Alabama used to compile
all the apps on the iPhone effectively

1704
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:03,610
all the apps on the iPhone effectively
 

1705
00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:06,540
all the apps on the iPhone effectively
and the OS is it compiles Google's

1706
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:06,550
and the OS is it compiles Google's
 

1707
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:10,920
and the OS is it compiles Google's
production server applications let's use

1708
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:10,930
production server applications let's use
 

1709
00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:13,770
production server applications let's use
to build my GameCube games and

1710
00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:13,780
to build my GameCube games and
 

1711
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:16,890
to build my GameCube games and
PlayStation 4 and things like that I was

1712
00:32:16,890 --> 00:32:16,900
PlayStation 4 and things like that I was
 

1713
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:19,410
PlayStation 4 and things like that I was
a user I have but just everything I've

1714
00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:19,420
a user I have but just everything I've
 

1715
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:21,480
a user I have but just everything I've
done that I experienced for Linux has

1716
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:21,490
done that I experienced for Linux has
 

1717
00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:23,820
done that I experienced for Linux has
been I believe always GCC yeah I think

1718
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:23,830
been I believe always GCC yeah I think
 

1719
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:26,970
been I believe always GCC yeah I think
Linux still defaults to GCC and is there

1720
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:26,980
Linux still defaults to GCC and is there
 

1721
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:29,610
Linux still defaults to GCC and is there
a reason for that there's a big it's a

1722
00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:29,620
a reason for that there's a big it's a
 

1723
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:30,810
a reason for that there's a big it's a
combination of technical and social

1724
00:32:30,810 --> 00:32:30,820
combination of technical and social
 

1725
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:34,170
combination of technical and social
reasons many GC likes developers do you

1726
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:34,180
reasons many GC likes developers do you
 

1727
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:38,430
reasons many GC likes developers do you
do use clang but the distributions for

1728
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:38,440
do use clang but the distributions for
 

1729
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,710
do use clang but the distributions for
lots of reasons

1730
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:39,720
lots of reasons
 

1731
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:42,780
lots of reasons
use GCC historically and they've not

1732
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:42,790
use GCC historically and they've not
 

1733
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:45,390
use GCC historically and they've not
switched yeah that and it's just

1734
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:45,400
switched yeah that and it's just
 

1735
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:48,240
switched yeah that and it's just
anecdotally online it seems that LLVM

1736
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:48,250
anecdotally online it seems that LLVM
 

1737
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:50,550
anecdotally online it seems that LLVM
has either reached the level GCC or

1738
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:50,560
has either reached the level GCC or
 

1739
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:52,530
has either reached the level GCC or
superseded on different features or

1740
00:32:52,530 --> 00:32:52,540
superseded on different features or
 

1741
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:54,300
superseded on different features or
whatever the way I would say it is that

1742
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:54,310
whatever the way I would say it is that
 

1743
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:55,500
whatever the way I would say it is that
there was there so close it doesn't

1744
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:55,510
there was there so close it doesn't
 

1745
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:57,120
there was there so close it doesn't
matter yeah exactly like there's a

1746
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:57,130
matter yeah exactly like there's a
 

1747
00:32:57,130 --> 00:32:58,410
matter yeah exactly like there's a
slightly better in some way slightly

1748
00:32:58,410 --> 00:32:58,420
slightly better in some way slightly
 

1749
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:00,450
slightly better in some way slightly
worse than otherwise but it doesn't

1750
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:00,460
worse than otherwise but it doesn't
 

1751
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:01,760
worse than otherwise but it doesn't
actually really matter anymore

1752
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:01,770
actually really matter anymore
 

1753
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:04,780
actually really matter anymore
that level so in terms of optimization

1754
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:04,790
that level so in terms of optimization
 

1755
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:08,060
that level so in terms of optimization
breakthroughs it's just been solid

1756
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:08,070
breakthroughs it's just been solid
 

1757
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:09,950
breakthroughs it's just been solid
incremental work yeah yeah

1758
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:09,960
incremental work yeah yeah
 

1759
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,570
incremental work yeah yeah
which which is which describes a lot of

1760
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:11,580
which which is which describes a lot of
 

1761
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:12,950
which which is which describes a lot of
compilers there are the hard thing about

1762
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:12,960
compilers there are the hard thing about
 

1763
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,110
compilers there are the hard thing about
compilers in my experience is the

1764
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:15,120
compilers in my experience is the
 

1765
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,270
compilers in my experience is the
engineering the software engineering

1766
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:17,280
engineering the software engineering
 

1767
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:19,669

making it so that you can have hundreds

1768
00:33:19,669 --> 00:33:19,679
making it so that you can have hundreds

00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:21,470
making it so that you can have hundreds
of people collaborating on really

1770
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:21,480
of people collaborating on really
 

1771
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:24,890
of people collaborating on really
detailed low-level work and scaling that

1772
00:33:24,890 --> 00:33:24,900
detailed low-level work and scaling that
 

1773
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:28,070
detailed low-level work and scaling that
and that's that's really hard and that's

1774
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:28,080
and that's that's really hard and that's
 

1775
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,630
and that's that's really hard and that's
one of the things I think Alabama's done

1776
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:29,640
one of the things I think Alabama's done
 

1777
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:33,230
one of the things I think Alabama's done
well and that kind of goes back to the

1778
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:33,240
well and that kind of goes back to the
 

1779
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,669
well and that kind of goes back to the
original design goals with it to be

1780
00:33:34,669 --> 00:33:34,679
original design goals with it to be
 

1781
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:36,880
original design goals with it to be
modular and things like that and

1782
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:36,890
modular and things like that and
 

1783
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:38,450
modular and things like that and
incidentally I don't want to take all

1784
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:38,460
incidentally I don't want to take all
 

1785
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:39,770
incidentally I don't want to take all
the credit for this right I mean some of

1786
00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:39,780
the credit for this right I mean some of
 

1787
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:42,020
the credit for this right I mean some of
the the best parts about LLVM is that it

1788
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:42,030
the the best parts about LLVM is that it
 

1789
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:44,000
the the best parts about LLVM is that it
was designed to be modular and when I

1790
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:44,010
was designed to be modular and when I
 

1791
00:33:44,010 --> 00:33:45,620
was designed to be modular and when I
started I would write for example a

1792
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:45,630
started I would write for example a
 

1793
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:47,600
started I would write for example a
register allocator and then some a much

1794
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:47,610
register allocator and then some a much
 

1795
00:33:47,610 --> 00:33:49,760
register allocator and then some a much
smarter than me would come in and pull

1796
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:49,770
smarter than me would come in and pull
 

1797
00:33:49,770 --> 00:33:50,960
smarter than me would come in and pull
it out and replace it with something

1798
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:50,970
it out and replace it with something
 

1799
00:33:50,970 --> 00:33:52,340
it out and replace it with something
else that they would come up with and

1800
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:52,350
else that they would come up with and
 

1801
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:54,320
else that they would come up with and
because it's modular they were able to

1802
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:54,330
because it's modular they were able to
 

1803
00:33:54,330 --> 00:33:56,210
because it's modular they were able to
do that and that's one of the challenges

1804
00:33:56,210 --> 00:33:56,220
do that and that's one of the challenges
 

1805
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:59,360
do that and that's one of the challenges
with what GCC for example is replacing

1806
00:33:59,360 --> 00:33:59,370
with what GCC for example is replacing
 

1807
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:01,340
with what GCC for example is replacing
subsystems is incredibly difficult it

1808
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:01,350
subsystems is incredibly difficult it
 

1809
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:03,860
subsystems is incredibly difficult it
can be done but it wasn't designed for

1810
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:03,870
can be done but it wasn't designed for
 

1811
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:05,480
can be done but it wasn't designed for
that and that's one of the reasons the

1812
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:05,490
that and that's one of the reasons the
 

1813
00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:06,799
that and that's one of the reasons the

compiler folks is there that did it at

1826
00:34:26,899 --> 00:34:26,909
compiler folks is there that did it at
 

1827
00:34:26,909 --> 00:34:29,830
compiler folks is there that did it at
for a time at least following you to

1828
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:29,840
for a time at least following you to
 

1829
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:32,899
for a time at least following you to
approve things oh yeah so I mean I still

1830
00:34:32,899 --> 00:34:32,909
approve things oh yeah so I mean I still
 

1831
00:34:32,909 --> 00:34:35,060
approve things oh yeah so I mean I still
have something like an order of

1832
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:35,070
have something like an order of
 

1833
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:38,090
have something like an order of
magnitude more patches in LVM than

1834
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:38,100
magnitude more patches in LVM than
 

1835
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:41,930
magnitude more patches in LVM than
anybody else and many of those I wrote

1836
00:34:41,930 --> 00:34:41,940
anybody else and many of those I wrote
 

1837
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:44,149
anybody else and many of those I wrote
myself but he's still right I mean you

1838
00:34:44,149 --> 00:34:44,159
myself but he's still right I mean you
 

1839
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:48,200
myself but he's still right I mean you
still he's still close to the two though

1840
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:48,210
still he's still close to the two though
 

1841
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:49,550
still he's still close to the two though
I don't know what the expression is to

I don't know what the expression is to

I don't know what the expression is to
the metal you still write code yes

1844
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:51,210
the metal you still write code yes
 

1845
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:53,240
the metal you still write code yes
alright good not as much as I was able

1846
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:53,250
alright good not as much as I was able
 

1847
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:55,580
alright good not as much as I was able
to in grad school but that's important

1848
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:55,590
to in grad school but that's important
 

1849
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:57,950
to in grad school but that's important
part of my identity but the way the LLVM

1850
00:34:57,950 --> 00:34:57,960
part of my identity but the way the LLVM
 

1851
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,930
part of my identity but the way the LLVM
has worked over time is that when I was

1852
00:34:59,930 --> 00:34:59,940
has worked over time is that when I was
 

1853
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:01,040
has worked over time is that when I was
a grad student I could do all the work

1854
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:01,050
a grad student I could do all the work
 

1855
00:35:01,050 --> 00:35:03,650
a grad student I could do all the work
and steer everything and review every

1856
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:03,660
and steer everything and review every
 

1857
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:05,540
and steer everything and review every
patch and make sure everything was done

1858
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:05,550
patch and make sure everything was done
 

1859
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:08,810
patch and make sure everything was done
exactly the way my opinionated sense

1860
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:08,820
exactly the way my opinionated sense
 

1861
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:11,359
exactly the way my opinionated sense
felt like it should be done and that was

1862
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:11,369
felt like it should be done and that was
 

1863
00:35:11,369 --> 00:35:13,760
felt like it should be done and that was
fine but I think scale you can't do that

1864
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:13,770
fine but I think scale you can't do that
 

1865
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:15,380
fine but I think scale you can't do that
right and so what ends

1866
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:15,390
right and so what ends
 

1867
00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:17,900
right and so what ends
happening as LVM has a hierarchical

1868
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:17,910
happening as LVM has a hierarchical
 

1869
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:19,790
happening as LVM has a hierarchical

1879
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:29,180

1881
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:30,290
patches do get reviewed and make sure
that the right things happening

00:35:30,290 --> 00:35:30,300
that the right things happening

1885
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:36,230
architectural e in their area and so
what you'll see is you'll see that for

what you'll see is you'll see that for

work naturally become the de facto owner
 

1899
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:52,760
work naturally become the de facto owner
of something and then usually somebody

1900
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:52,770
of something and then usually somebody
 

1901
00:35:52,770 --> 00:35:54,560
of something and then usually somebody
else's like how about we make them the

1902
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:54,570
else's like how about we make them the
 

1903
00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:57,170
else's like how about we make them the
official code owner and then and then

1904
00:35:57,170 --> 00:35:57,180
official code owner and then and then
 

1905
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:58,700
official code owner and then and then
we'll have somebody to make sure the

1906
00:35:58,700 --> 00:35:58,710
we'll have somebody to make sure the
 

1907
00:35:58,710 --> 00:35:59,750
we'll have somebody to make sure the
whole patch does get reviewed in a

1908

whole patch does get reviewed in a
 

1909
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,070
whole patch does get reviewed in a
timely manner and then everybody's like

1910
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:01,080
timely manner and then everybody's like
 

1911
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,870
timely manner and then everybody's like
yes that's obvious and then it happens

1912
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:02,880
yes that's obvious and then it happens
 

1913
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,430
yes that's obvious and then it happens
right and usually this is a very organic

1914

but I don't spend a lot of time
 

1921
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:13,660
but I don't spend a lot of time
reviewing patches what I do is I help

1922
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:13,670
reviewing patches what I do is I help
 

1923
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:16,400
reviewing patches what I do is I help
negotiate a lot of the the technical

we'll find a path forward so then in a
 

1995
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:34,480
we'll find a path forward so then in a
slightly different flavor of effort you

the challenges first of all leading such
 

2013
00:38:00,559 --> 00:38:03,700
the challenges first of all leading such
a huge group of developers what was the

2014
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:03,710
a huge group of developers what was the
 

2015
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:06,670
a huge group of developers what was the
big motivator dream mission behind

2016

2027
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:21,819
other stuff I'll stay I'll stay on the
technical side then we could talk about

2028
00:38:21,819 --> 00:38:21,829
technical side then we could talk about
 

2029
00:38:21,829 --> 00:38:23,859
technical side then we could talk about
the big team pieces yeah that's okay

2030
00:38:23,859 --> 00:38:23,869
the big team pieces yeah that's okay
 

2031
00:38:23,869 --> 00:38:26,380
the big team pieces yeah that's okay

joined Apple became a thing we became

2036
00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:32,660
joined Apple became a thing we became
 

2037
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:34,809
joined Apple became a thing we became
successful and became deployed but then

2038
00:38:34,809 --> 00:38:34,819
successful and became deployed but then
 

2039
00:38:34,819 --> 00:38:37,180
successful and became deployed but then
there was a question about how how do we

2040
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:37,190
there was a question about how how do we
 

2041
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:39,460
there was a question about how how do we
actually purse the source code so LVM is

2042
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:39,470
actually purse the source code so LVM is
 

2043

2046
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:43,520
code generator and Alvin was really good
 

2047
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,039
code generator and Alvin was really good
for Apple as it went through a couple of

2048
00:38:45,039 --> 00:38:45,049
for Apple as it went through a couple of
 

2049
00:38:45,049 --> 00:38:46,630
for Apple as it went through a couple of
hundred transitions I joined right at

2050
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:46,640
hundred transitions I joined right at
 

2051
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,099
hundred transitions I joined right at
the time of the Intel transition for

2052
00:38:48,099 --> 00:38:48,109
the time of the Intel transition for
 

2053
00:38:48,109 --> 00:38:52,089
the time of the Intel transition for
example and 64-bit transitions and then

2054
00:38:52,089 --> 00:38:52,099
example and 64-bit transitions and then
 

2055
00:38:52,099 --> 00:38:53,589
example and 64-bit transitions and then
the transition to almost the iPhone and

2056
00:38:53,589 --> 00:38:53,599
the transition to almost the iPhone and
 

2057
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:55,150
the transition to almost the iPhone and
so LVM was very useful for some of these

2058
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:55,160
so LVM was very useful for some of these
 

2059
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:57,579
so LVM was very useful for some of these
kinds of things but at the same time

2060
00:38:57,579 --> 00:38:57,589
kinds of things but at the same time
 

2061
00:38:57,589 --> 00:38:58,599
kinds of things but at the same time
there's a lot of questions around

2062
00:38:58,599 --> 00:38:58,609
there's a lot of questions around
 

2063
00:38:58,609 --> 00:39:00,640
there's a lot of questions around
developer experience and so if you're a

2064
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:00,650
developer experience and so if you're a
 

2065
00:39:00,650 --> 00:39:02,410
developer experience and so if you're a
programmer pounding out at the time of

2066
00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:02,420
programmer pounding out at the time of
 

2067
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:05,079
programmer pounding out at the time of
objective-c code the error message you

2068
00:39:05,079 --> 00:39:05,089
objective-c code the error message you
 

2069
00:39:05,089 --> 00:39:06,910
objective-c code the error message you
get the compile time the turnaround

2070
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:06,920
get the compile time the turnaround
 

2071
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:09,789
get the compile time the turnaround
cycle the the tooling and the IDE were

2072
00:39:09,789 --> 00:39:09,799
cycle the the tooling and the IDE were
 

2073
00:39:09,799 --> 00:39:12,190
cycle the the tooling and the IDE were
not great we're not as good as it could

2074
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:12,200
not great we're not as good as it could
 

2075
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:17,380
not great we're not as good as it could
be and so you know as as I occasionally

2076
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:17,390
be and so you know as as I occasionally
 

2077
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:19,030
be and so you know as as I occasionally
do I'm like well okay how hard is it to

2078
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:19,040
do I'm like well okay how hard is it to
 

2079
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,700
do I'm like well okay how hard is it to
write a C compiler and so I I'm not

2080
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:21,710
write a C compiler and so I I'm not
 

2081
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:22,839
write a C compiler and so I I'm not
gonna commit to anybody I'm not gonna

2082
00:39:22,839 --> 00:39:22,849
gonna commit to anybody I'm not gonna
 

2083
00:39:22,849 --> 00:39:24,490
gonna commit to anybody I'm not gonna
tell anybody I'm just gonna just do it

2084
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:24,500
tell anybody I'm just gonna just do it
 

2085
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:26,440
tell anybody I'm just gonna just do it
on nice and weekends and start working

2086
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:26,450
on nice and weekends and start working
 

2087
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:29,650
on nice and weekends and start working
on it and then you know I built up in C

2088
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:29,660
on it and then you know I built up in C
 

2089
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:30,670
on it and then you know I built up in C
there's a thing called the preprocessor

2090
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:30,680
there's a thing called the preprocessor
 

2091
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:33,280
there's a thing called the preprocessor
which people don't like but it's

2092
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:33,290
which people don't like but it's
 

2093
00:39:33,290 --> 00:39:35,470
which people don't like but it's
actually really hard and complicated and

2094
00:39:35,470 --> 00:39:35,480
actually really hard and complicated and
 

2095
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:37,599
actually really hard and complicated and
includes a bunch of really weird things

2096
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:37,609
includes a bunch of really weird things
 

2097
00:39:37,609 --> 00:39:38,950
includes a bunch of really weird things
like try graphs and other stuff like

2098
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:38,960
like try graphs and other stuff like
 

2099
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,780
like try graphs and other stuff like
that that are they're really nasty and

2100
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:40,790
that that are they're really nasty and
 

2101
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:43,150
that that are they're really nasty and
it's the crux of a bunch of the perform

2102
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:43,160
it's the crux of a bunch of the perform
 

2103
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:45,820
it's the crux of a bunch of the perform
issues in the compiler and I'm started

2104
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:45,830
issues in the compiler and I'm started
 

2105
00:39:45,830 --> 00:39:47,140
issues in the compiler and I'm started
working on the parser and kind of got to

2106
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:47,150
working on the parser and kind of got to
 

2107
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:48,250
working on the parser and kind of got to
the point where I'm like ah you know

2108
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:48,260
the point where I'm like ah you know
 

2109
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:49,660
the point where I'm like ah you know
what we could actually do this this

2110
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:49,670
what we could actually do this this
 

2111
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:50,950
what we could actually do this this
everybody saying that this is impossible

2112
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:50,960
everybody saying that this is impossible
 

2113
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,660
everybody saying that this is impossible
to do but it's actually just hard it's

2114
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:52,670
to do but it's actually just hard it's
 

2115
00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:56,770
to do but it's actually just hard it's
not impossible and eventually told my

2116
00:39:56,770 --> 00:39:56,780
not impossible and eventually told my
 

2117
00:39:56,780 --> 00:39:58,360
not impossible and eventually told my
manager about it and he's like oh wow

2118
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:58,370
manager about it and he's like oh wow
 

2119
00:39:58,370 --> 00:39:59,920
manager about it and he's like oh wow
this is great we do need to solve this

2120
00:39:59,920 --> 00:39:59,930
this is great we do need to solve this
 

2121
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:01,720
this is great we do need to solve this
problem oh this is great we can like get

2122
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:01,730
problem oh this is great we can like get
 

2123
00:40:01,730 --> 00:40:03,100
problem oh this is great we can like get
you one other person to work with you on

2124
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:03,110
you one other person to work with you on
 

2125
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:05,860
you one other person to work with you on
this you know and slowly a team is

2126
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:05,870
this you know and slowly a team is
 

2127
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:09,310
this you know and slowly a team is
formed and it starts taking off and c++

2128
00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:09,320
formed and it starts taking off and c++
 

2129
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:11,770
formed and it starts taking off and c++
for example huge complicated language

2130
00:40:11,770 --> 00:40:11,780
for example huge complicated language
 

2131
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:13,240
for example huge complicated language
people always assume that it's

2132
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:13,250
people always assume that it's
 

2133
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:15,250
people always assume that it's
impossible to implement and it's very

2134
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:15,260
impossible to implement and it's very
 

2135
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:17,770
impossible to implement and it's very
nearly impossible but it's just really

2136
00:40:17,770 --> 00:40:17,780
nearly impossible but it's just really
 

2137
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:20,290
nearly impossible but it's just really
really hard and the way to get there is

2138
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:20,300
really hard and the way to get there is
 

2139
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:21,610
really hard and the way to get there is
to build it one piece at a time

2140
00:40:21,610 --> 00:40:21,620
to build it one piece at a time
 

2141
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:24,070
to build it one piece at a time
incrementally and and there that was

2142
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:24,080
incrementally and and there that was
 

2143
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:26,500
incrementally and and there that was
only possible because we were lucky to

2144
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:26,510
only possible because we were lucky to
 

2145
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:27,940
only possible because we were lucky to
hire some really exceptional engineers

2146
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:27,950
hire some really exceptional engineers
 

2147
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:29,920
hire some really exceptional engineers
that that knew various parts of it very

2148
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:29,930
that that knew various parts of it very
 

2149
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:31,950
that that knew various parts of it very
well and and could do great things

2150
00:40:31,950 --> 00:40:31,960
well and and could do great things
 

2151
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:34,570
well and and could do great things
Swift was kind of a similar thing so

2152
00:40:34,570 --> 00:40:34,580
Swift was kind of a similar thing so
 

2153
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:38,500
Swift was kind of a similar thing so
Swift came from we were just finishing

2154
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:38,510
Swift came from we were just finishing
 

2155
00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:41,350
Swift came from we were just finishing
off the first version of C++ support in

2156
00:40:41,350 --> 00:40:41,360
off the first version of C++ support in
 

2157
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:46,240
off the first version of C++ support in
M clang and C++ is a very formidable and

2158
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:46,250
M clang and C++ is a very formidable and
 

2159
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:47,680
M clang and C++ is a very formidable and
very important language but it's also

2160
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:47,690
very important language but it's also
 

2161
00:40:47,690 --> 00:40:50,230
very important language but it's also
ugly in lots of ways and you can't

2162
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:50,240
ugly in lots of ways and you can't
 

2163
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,630
ugly in lots of ways and you can't
influence C++ without thinking there has

2164
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:52,640
influence C++ without thinking there has
 

2165
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,670
influence C++ without thinking there has
to be a better thing right and so I

2166
00:40:54,670 --> 00:40:54,680
to be a better thing right and so I
 

2167
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:56,500
to be a better thing right and so I
started working on Swift again with no

2168
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:56,510
started working on Swift again with no
 

2169
00:40:56,510 --> 00:40:58,270
started working on Swift again with no
hope or ambition that would go anywhere

2170
00:40:58,270 --> 00:40:58,280
hope or ambition that would go anywhere
 

2171
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:00,430
hope or ambition that would go anywhere
just uh let's see what could be done

2172
00:41:00,430 --> 00:41:00,440
just uh let's see what could be done
 

2173
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:02,920
just uh let's see what could be done
let's play around with this thing it was

2174
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:02,930
let's play around with this thing it was
 

2175
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:05,830
let's play around with this thing it was
you know me in my spare time not telling

2176
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:05,840
you know me in my spare time not telling
 

2177
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:08,410
you know me in my spare time not telling
anybody about it kind of a thing and it

2178
00:41:08,410 --> 00:41:08,420
anybody about it kind of a thing and it
 

2179
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:09,610
anybody about it kind of a thing and it
made some good progress I'm like

2180
00:41:09,610 --> 00:41:09,620
made some good progress I'm like
 

2181
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:11,020
made some good progress I'm like
actually it would make sense to do this

2182
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:11,030
actually it would make sense to do this
 

2183
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:12,520
actually it would make sense to do this
at the same time I started talking with

2184
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:12,530
at the same time I started talking with
 

2185
00:41:12,530 --> 00:41:15,850
at the same time I started talking with
the senior VP of software at the time a

2186
00:41:15,850 --> 00:41:15,860
the senior VP of software at the time a
 

2187
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:18,130
the senior VP of software at the time a
guy named Burt Ron stole a and Burt Ron

2188
00:41:18,130 --> 00:41:18,140
guy named Burt Ron stole a and Burt Ron
 

2189
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:19,930
guy named Burt Ron stole a and Burt Ron
was very encouraging he was like well

2190
00:41:19,930 --> 00:41:19,940
was very encouraging he was like well
 

2191
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:21,610
was very encouraging he was like well
you know let's let's have fun let's talk

2192
00:41:21,610 --> 00:41:21,620
you know let's let's have fun let's talk
 

2193
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:22,780
you know let's let's have fun let's talk
about this and he was a little bit of a

2194
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:22,790
about this and he was a little bit of a
 

2195
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:24,970
about this and he was a little bit of a
language guy and so he helped guide some

2196
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:24,980
language guy and so he helped guide some
 

2197
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:27,490
language guy and so he helped guide some
of the the early work and encouraged me

2198
00:41:27,490 --> 00:41:27,500
of the the early work and encouraged me
 

2199
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:30,100
of the the early work and encouraged me
and like got things off the ground and

2200
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:30,110
and like got things off the ground and
 

2201
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:32,710
and like got things off the ground and
eventually I've told other to like my

2202
00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:32,720
eventually I've told other to like my
 

2203
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:36,550
eventually I've told other to like my
manager and told other people and and it

2204
00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:36,560
manager and told other people and and it
 

2205
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:39,580
manager and told other people and and it
started making progress the the

2206
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:39,590
started making progress the the
 

2207
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:41,700
started making progress the the
complicating thing was Swift was that

2208
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:41,710
complicating thing was Swift was that
 

2209
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:44,110
complicating thing was Swift was that
the idea of doing a new language is not

2210
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:44,120
the idea of doing a new language is not
 

2211
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:47,230
the idea of doing a new language is not
obvious to anybody including myself

2212
00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:47,240
obvious to anybody including myself
 

2213
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:49,840
obvious to anybody including myself
and the tone at the time was that the

2214
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:49,850
and the tone at the time was that the
 

2215
00:41:49,850 --> 00:41:51,160
and the tone at the time was that the
iPhone was successful because of

2216
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:51,170
iPhone was successful because of
 

2217
00:41:51,170 --> 00:41:54,580
iPhone was successful because of
objective-c right Oh interesting in a

00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:54,590
objective-c right Oh interesting in a

00:41:56,620 --> 00:41:56,630
practice site of or just great because
 

2221
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:58,720
practice site of or just great because
it and and you have to understand that

2222
00:41:58,720 --> 00:41:58,730
it and and you have to understand that
 

2223
00:41:58,730 --> 00:42:00,609
it and and you have to understand that
at the time

2224
00:42:00,609 --> 00:42:00,619
at the time
 

2225
00:42:00,619 --> 00:42:03,010
at the time
Apple was hiring software people that

2226
00:42:03,010 --> 00:42:03,020
Apple was hiring software people that
 

2227
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:05,890
Apple was hiring software people that
loved Objective C right and it wasn't

2228
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:05,900
loved Objective C right and it wasn't
 

2229
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:08,080
loved Objective C right and it wasn't
that they came despite Objective C they

2230
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:08,090
that they came despite Objective C they
 

2231
00:42:08,090 --> 00:42:09,220
that they came despite Objective C they
loved Objective C and that's why they

2232
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:09,230
loved Objective C and that's why they
 

2233
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:11,230
loved Objective C and that's why they
got hired and so you had a software team

2234
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:11,240
got hired and so you had a software team
 

2235
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:13,570
got hired and so you had a software team
that the leadership and in many cases

2236
00:42:13,570 --> 00:42:13,580
that the leadership and in many cases
 

2237
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:15,310
that the leadership and in many cases
went all the way back to next where

2238
00:42:15,310 --> 00:42:15,320
went all the way back to next where
 

2239
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:20,080
went all the way back to next where
Objective C really became real and so

2240
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:20,090
Objective C really became real and so
 

2241
00:42:20,090 --> 00:42:22,330
Objective C really became real and so
they quote-unquote grew up writing

2242
00:42:22,330 --> 00:42:22,340
they quote-unquote grew up writing
 

2243
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:24,550
they quote-unquote grew up writing
Objective C and many of the individual

2244
00:42:24,550 --> 00:42:24,560
Objective C and many of the individual
 

2245
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,710
Objective C and many of the individual
engineers all were hired because they

2246
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:26,720
engineers all were hired because they
 

2247
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:29,350
engineers all were hired because they
loved Objective C and so this notion of

2248
00:42:29,350 --> 00:42:29,360
loved Objective C and so this notion of
 

2249
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:31,030
loved Objective C and so this notion of
okay let's do new language was kind of

2250
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:31,040
okay let's do new language was kind of
 

2251
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:34,390
okay let's do new language was kind of
heretical in many ways right meanwhile

2252
00:42:34,390 --> 00:42:34,400
heretical in many ways right meanwhile
 

2253
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,310
heretical in many ways right meanwhile
my sense was that the outside community

2254
00:42:36,310 --> 00:42:36,320
my sense was that the outside community
 

2255
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,690
my sense was that the outside community
wasn't really in love with Objective C

2256
00:42:37,690 --> 00:42:37,700
wasn't really in love with Objective C
 

2257
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:39,100
wasn't really in love with Objective C
some people were and some of the most

2258
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:39,110
some people were and some of the most
 

2259
00:42:39,110 --> 00:42:40,630
some people were and some of the most
outspoken people were but other people

2260
00:42:40,630 --> 00:42:40,640
outspoken people were but other people
 

2261
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:43,240
outspoken people were but other people
were hitting challenges because it has

2262
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:43,250
were hitting challenges because it has
 

2263
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:45,340
were hitting challenges because it has
very sharp corners and it's difficult to

2264
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:45,350
very sharp corners and it's difficult to
 

2265
00:42:45,350 --> 00:42:49,000
very sharp corners and it's difficult to
learn and so one of the challenges of

2266
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:49,010
learn and so one of the challenges of
 

2267
00:42:49,010 --> 00:42:50,620
learn and so one of the challenges of
making Swift happen that was totally

2268
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:50,630
making Swift happen that was totally
 

2269
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:54,820
making Swift happen that was totally
non-technical is the the social part of

2270
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:54,830
non-technical is the the social part of
 

2271
00:42:54,830 --> 00:42:58,330
non-technical is the the social part of
what do we do like if we do a new

2272
00:42:58,330 --> 00:42:58,340
what do we do like if we do a new
 

2273
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:00,250
what do we do like if we do a new
language which at Apple many things

2274
00:43:00,250 --> 00:43:00,260
language which at Apple many things
 

2275
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:02,859
language which at Apple many things
happen that don't ship right so if we if

2276
00:43:02,859 --> 00:43:02,869
happen that don't ship right so if we if
 

2277
00:43:02,869 --> 00:43:05,109
happen that don't ship right so if we if
we ship it what what what is the metrics

2278
00:43:05,109 --> 00:43:05,119
we ship it what what what is the metrics
 

2279
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:06,460
we ship it what what what is the metrics
of success why would we do this why

2280
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:06,470
of success why would we do this why
 

2281
00:43:06,470 --> 00:43:07,990
of success why would we do this why
wouldn't we make Objective C better if

2282
00:43:07,990 --> 00:43:08,000
wouldn't we make Objective C better if
 

2283
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,120
wouldn't we make Objective C better if
object C has problems let's file off

2284
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:10,130
object C has problems let's file off
 

2285
00:43:10,130 --> 00:43:12,640
object C has problems let's file off
those rough corners and edges and one of

2286
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:12,650
those rough corners and edges and one of
 

2287
00:43:12,650 --> 00:43:14,859
those rough corners and edges and one of
the major things that became the reason

2288
00:43:14,859 --> 00:43:14,869
the major things that became the reason
 

2289
00:43:14,869 --> 00:43:17,290
the major things that became the reason
to do this was this notion of safety

2290
00:43:17,290 --> 00:43:17,300
to do this was this notion of safety
 

2291
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:20,230
to do this was this notion of safety
memory safety and the way Objective C

2292
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:20,240
memory safety and the way Objective C
 

2293
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:23,050
memory safety and the way Objective C
works is that a lot of the object system

2294
00:43:23,050 --> 00:43:23,060
works is that a lot of the object system
 

2295
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:25,720
works is that a lot of the object system
and everything else is built on top of

2296
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:25,730
and everything else is built on top of
 

2297
00:43:25,730 --> 00:43:28,180
and everything else is built on top of
pointers and C Objective C is an

2298
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:28,190
pointers and C Objective C is an
 

2299
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:31,359
pointers and C Objective C is an
extension on top of C and so pointers

2300
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:31,369
extension on top of C and so pointers
 

2301
00:43:31,369 --> 00:43:34,090
extension on top of C and so pointers
are unsafe and if you get rid of the

2302
00:43:34,090 --> 00:43:34,100
are unsafe and if you get rid of the
 

2303
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:35,770
are unsafe and if you get rid of the
pointers it's not Objective C anymore

2304
00:43:35,770 --> 00:43:35,780
pointers it's not Objective C anymore
 

2305
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:38,770
pointers it's not Objective C anymore
and so fundamentally that was an issue

2306
00:43:38,770 --> 00:43:38,780
and so fundamentally that was an issue
 

2307
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:41,200
and so fundamentally that was an issue
that you could not fix safety or memory

2308
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:41,210
that you could not fix safety or memory
 

2309
00:43:41,210 --> 00:43:44,770
that you could not fix safety or memory
safety without fundamentally changing

2310
00:43:44,770 --> 00:43:44,780
safety without fundamentally changing
 

2311
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:46,720
safety without fundamentally changing
the language and so once we got through

2312
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:46,730
the language and so once we got through
 

2313
00:43:46,730 --> 00:43:50,050
the language and so once we got through
that part of the mental process and the

2314
00:43:50,050 --> 00:43:50,060
that part of the mental process and the
 

2315
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:52,630
that part of the mental process and the
thought process it became a design

2316
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:52,640
thought process it became a design
 

2317
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:54,160
thought process it became a design
process of saying okay well if we're

2318
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:54,170
process of saying okay well if we're
 

2319
00:43:54,170 --> 00:43:55,990
process of saying okay well if we're
gonna do something new what what is good

2320
00:43:55,990 --> 00:43:56,000
gonna do something new what what is good
 

2321
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,730
gonna do something new what what is good
like how do we think about this and what

2322
00:43:57,730 --> 00:43:57,740
like how do we think about this and what
 

2323
00:43:57,740 --> 00:43:59,320
like how do we think about this and what
do we like and what are we looking for

2324
00:43:59,320 --> 00:43:59,330
do we like and what are we looking for
 

2325
00:43:59,330 --> 00:44:01,750
do we like and what are we looking for
and that that was a very different phase

2326
00:44:01,750 --> 00:44:01,760
and that that was a very different phase
 

2327
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,880
and that that was a very different phase
of it so well what are some design

2328
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:03,890
of it so well what are some design
 

2329
00:44:03,890 --> 00:44:06,460
of it so well what are some design
choices early on and Swift like we're

2330
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:06,470
choices early on and Swift like we're
 

2331
00:44:06,470 --> 00:44:10,450
choices early on and Swift like we're
talking about braces are you making a

2332
00:44:10,450 --> 00:44:10,460
talking about braces are you making a
 

2333
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:12,670
talking about braces are you making a
type language or not all those kinds of

2334
00:44:12,670 --> 00:44:12,680
type language or not all those kinds of
 

2335
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:14,320
type language or not all those kinds of
things yeah so some of those were

2336
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:14,330
things yeah so some of those were
 

2337
00:44:14,330 --> 00:44:16,750
things yeah so some of those were
obvious given the context so a types

2338
00:44:16,750 --> 00:44:16,760
obvious given the context so a types
 

2339
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:18,310
obvious given the context so a types
language for example objective sees a

2340
00:44:18,310 --> 00:44:18,320
language for example objective sees a
 

2341
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:20,050
language for example objective sees a
typed language and going with an untyped

2342
00:44:20,050 --> 00:44:20,060
typed language and going with an untyped
 

2343
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:23,530
typed language and going with an untyped
language wasn't really seriously

2344
00:44:23,530 --> 00:44:23,540
language wasn't really seriously
 

2345
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:25,270
language wasn't really seriously
considered we wanted we want the

2346
00:44:25,270 --> 00:44:25,280
considered we wanted we want the
 

2347
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:26,830
considered we wanted we want the
performance and we wanted refactoring

2348
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:26,840
performance and we wanted refactoring
 

2349
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:28,120
performance and we wanted refactoring
tools and other things like that to go

2350
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:28,130
tools and other things like that to go
 

2351
00:44:28,130 --> 00:44:30,520
tools and other things like that to go
with type languages quick dumb question

2352
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:30,530
with type languages quick dumb question
 

2353
00:44:30,530 --> 00:44:32,500
with type languages quick dumb question
yeah was it obvious

2354
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:32,510
yeah was it obvious
 

2355
00:44:32,510 --> 00:44:34,600
yeah was it obvious
I think it would be a dumb question but

2356
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:34,610
I think it would be a dumb question but
 

2357
00:44:34,610 --> 00:44:36,490
I think it would be a dumb question but
was it obvious that the language has to

2358
00:44:36,490 --> 00:44:36,500
was it obvious that the language has to
 

2359
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:40,300
was it obvious that the language has to
be a compiled language not and yes

2360
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:40,310
be a compiled language not and yes
 

2361
00:44:40,310 --> 00:44:42,700
be a compiled language not and yes
that's not a dumb question earlier I

2362
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:42,710
that's not a dumb question earlier I
 

2363
00:44:42,710 --> 00:44:44,410
that's not a dumb question earlier I

the iPhone it was when the iPhone was
 

2373
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:56,170
the iPhone it was when the iPhone was
definitely on an upward trajectory and

00:44:56,170 --> 00:44:56,180
definitely on an upward trajectory and
 

2375
00:44:56,180 --> 00:44:59,020
definitely on an upward trajectory and
the iPhone was still extremely and is

00:44:59,020 --> 00:44:59,030
the iPhone was still extremely and is
 

2377
00:44:59,030 --> 00:45:01,870
the iPhone was still extremely and is
still a bit memory constrained right and

still a bit memory constrained right and
 

2379
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:04,510
still a bit memory constrained right and
so being able to compile the code and

00:45:04,510 --> 00:45:04,520
so being able to compile the code and
 

2381
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:06,690
so being able to compile the code and
then ship it and then have having

then ship it and then have having
 

2383
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:09,190
then ship it and then have having

2385
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:11,800
standalone code that is not JIT compiled
was is a very big deal and it's very

00:45:25,250 --> 00:45:26,950
how they're applied right but in the

yes so the the funny thing after working

2418
00:45:51,910 --> 00:45:51,920
yes so the the funny thing after working
 

2419
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,530
yes so the the funny thing after working
on compilers for a really long time is

2420
00:45:53,530 --> 00:45:53,540
on compilers for a really long time is
 

2421
00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:56,800
on compilers for a really long time is
that and one of this is one of the

00:45:56,810 --> 00:45:59,350
that and one of this is one of the
things that LVM has helped with is that

00:46:01,630 --> 00:46:01,640
I don't look as comp compilations being

00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:04,600
I don't look as comp compilations being
static or dynamic or interpreted or not

this is a spectrum okay and one of the

2430
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:08,150
this is a spectrum okay and one of the
 

2431
00:46:08,150 --> 00:46:09,970
this is a spectrum okay and one of the
cool things about Swift is that Swift is

2432
00:46:09,970 --> 00:46:09,980
cool things about Swift is that Swift is
 

2433
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:11,740
cool things about Swift is that Swift is
not just statically compiled

2434
00:46:11,740 --> 00:46:11,750
not just statically compiled
 

2435
00:46:11,750 --> 00:46:13,480
not just statically compiled
it's actually dynamically compiled as

2436
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:13,490
it's actually dynamically compiled as
 

2437
00:46:13,490 --> 00:46:15,370
it's actually dynamically compiled as
well and it can also be interpreted that

2438
00:46:15,370 --> 00:46:15,380
well and it can also be interpreted that
 

2439
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:18,490
well and it can also be interpreted that
nobody's actually done that and so what

2440
00:46:18,490 --> 00:46:18,500
nobody's actually done that and so what
 

2441
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:20,650
nobody's actually done that and so what
what ends up happening when you use

2442
00:46:20,650 --> 00:46:20,660
what ends up happening when you use
 

2443
00:46:20,660 --> 00:46:22,810
what ends up happening when you use
Swift in a workbook for example in

Calabria and Jupiter is it's actually

2446
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:24,590
Calabria and Jupiter is it's actually
 

2447
00:46:24,590 --> 00:46:26,410
Calabria and Jupiter is it's actually
dynamically compiling the statements as

2448
00:46:26,410 --> 00:46:26,420
dynamically compiling the statements as
 

2449
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:28,960
dynamically compiling the statements as
you execute them and so let's gets back

2450
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:28,970
you execute them and so let's gets back
 

2451
00:46:28,970 --> 00:46:32,020
you execute them and so let's gets back
to the software engineering problems

2452
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:32,030
to the software engineering problems
 

2453
00:46:32,030 --> 00:46:34,270
to the software engineering problems
right where if you layer the stack

2454
00:46:34,270 --> 00:46:34,280
right where if you layer the stack
 

2455
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:36,910
right where if you layer the stack
properly you can actually completely

2456
00:46:36,910 --> 00:46:36,920
properly you can actually completely
 

2457
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:38,740
properly you can actually completely
change how and when things get compiled

2458
00:46:38,740 --> 00:46:38,750
change how and when things get compiled
 

2459
00:46:38,750 --> 00:46:40,210
change how and when things get compiled
because you have the right abstractions

2460
00:46:40,210 --> 00:46:40,220
because you have the right abstractions
 

2461
00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:42,640
because you have the right abstractions
there and so the way that a collab

2462
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:42,650
there and so the way that a collab

00:46:42,650 --> 00:46:43,240

workbook

2464
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:43,250
workbook
 

2465
00:46:43,250 --> 00:46:47,349
workbook
works with Swift is that we start typing

2466
00:46:47,349 --> 00:46:47,359
works with Swift is that we start typing
 

2467
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:49,150
works with Swift is that we start typing
into it it creates a process a UNIX

2468
00:46:49,150 --> 00:46:49,160
into it it creates a process a UNIX
 

2469
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:51,310
into it it creates a process a UNIX
process and then each line of code you

2470
00:46:51,310 --> 00:46:51,320
process and then each line of code you
 

2471
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:53,890
process and then each line of code you
type in it compiles it through the Swift

2472
00:46:53,890 --> 00:46:53,900
type in it compiles it through the Swift
 

2473
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:55,810
type in it compiles it through the Swift
compiler there's the front end part and

2474
00:46:55,810 --> 00:46:55,820
compiler there's the front end part and
 

2475
00:46:55,820 --> 00:46:58,630
compiler there's the front end part and
then sends it through the optimizer JIT

2476
00:46:58,630 --> 00:46:58,640
then sends it through the optimizer JIT
 

2477
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:01,540
then sends it through the optimizer JIT
compiles machine code and then injects

2478
00:47:01,540 --> 00:47:01,550
compiles machine code and then injects
 

2479
00:47:01,550 --> 00:47:04,450
compiles machine code and then injects
it into that process and so as you're

2480
00:47:04,450 --> 00:47:04,460
it into that process and so as you're
 

2481
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:06,760
it into that process and so as you're
typing new stuff it's putting it's like

2482
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:06,770
typing new stuff it's putting it's like
 

2483
00:47:06,770 --> 00:47:08,740
typing new stuff it's putting it's like
squirting a new code and overriding and

2484
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:08,750
squirting a new code and overriding and
 

2485
00:47:08,750 --> 00:47:10,900
squirting a new code and overriding and
replacing an updating code in place and

2486
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:10,910
replacing an updating code in place and
 

2487
00:47:10,910 --> 00:47:13,000
replacing an updating code in place and
the fact that it can do this is not an

2488
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:13,010
the fact that it can do this is not an
 

2489
00:47:13,010 --> 00:47:14,470
the fact that it can do this is not an
accident like Swift was designed for

2490
00:47:14,470 --> 00:47:14,480
accident like Swift was designed for
 

2491
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:17,140
accident like Swift was designed for
this but it's an important part of how

2492
00:47:17,140 --> 00:47:17,150
this but it's an important part of how
 

2493
00:47:17,150 --> 00:47:18,490
this but it's an important part of how
the language was set up and how it's

2494
00:47:18,490 --> 00:47:18,500
the language was set up and how it's
 

2495
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:20,530
the language was set up and how it's
layered and and this is a non-obvious

2496
00:47:20,530 --> 00:47:20,540
layered and and this is a non-obvious
 

2497
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:22,839
layered and and this is a non-obvious
piece and one of the things with Swift

2498
00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:22,849
piece and one of the things with Swift
 

2499
00:47:22,849 --> 00:47:25,540
piece and one of the things with Swift
that was for me a very strong design

2500
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:25,550
that was for me a very strong design
 

2501
00:47:25,550 --> 00:47:27,220
that was for me a very strong design
point is to make it so that you can

2502
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:27,230
point is to make it so that you can
 

2503
00:47:27,230 --> 00:47:30,970
point is to make it so that you can
learn it very quickly and so from a

2504
00:47:30,970 --> 00:47:30,980
learn it very quickly and so from a
 

2505
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:32,320
learn it very quickly and so from a
language design perspective the thing

2506
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:32,330
language design perspective the thing
 

2507
00:47:32,330 --> 00:47:33,760
language design perspective the thing
that I always come back to is this UI

00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:40,270
principle of progressive disclosure of
complexity and so in Swift you can start

2512
00:47:40,270 --> 00:47:40,280
complexity and so in Swift you can start
 

2513
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:42,790
complexity and so in Swift you can start
by saying print quote hello world quote

2514
00:47:42,790 --> 00:47:42,800
by saying print quote hello world quote
 

2515
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:46,390
by saying print quote hello world quote
right and there's no /n just like Python

2516
00:47:46,390 --> 00:47:46,400
right and there's no /n just like Python
 

2517
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,700
right and there's no /n just like Python
one line of code no main no no header

2518
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:48,710
one line of code no main no no header
 

2519
00:47:48,710 --> 00:47:50,710
one line of code no main no no header
files no header files no public static

2520
00:47:50,710 --> 00:47:50,720
files no header files no public static
 

2521
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:53,140
files no header files no public static
class void blah blah blah string like

2522
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:53,150
class void blah blah blah string like
 

2523
00:47:53,150 --> 00:47:55,240
class void blah blah blah string like
Java has right so one line of code right

2524
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:55,250
Java has right so one line of code right
 

2525
00:47:55,250 --> 00:47:57,250
Java has right so one line of code right
and you can teach that and it works

2526
00:47:57,250 --> 00:47:57,260
and you can teach that and it works
 

2527
00:47:57,260 --> 00:47:59,650
and you can teach that and it works
great they can say well let's introduce

2528
00:47:59,650 --> 00:47:59,660
great they can say well let's introduce
 

2529
00:47:59,660 --> 00:48:01,329
great they can say well let's introduce
variables and so you can declare a

2530
00:48:01,329 --> 00:48:01,339
variables and so you can declare a
 

2531
00:48:01,339 --> 00:48:03,490
variables and so you can declare a
variable with far so VAR x equals four

2532
00:48:03,490 --> 00:48:03,500
variable with far so VAR x equals four
 

2533
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:05,829
variable with far so VAR x equals four
what is a variable you can use xx plus

2534
00:48:05,829 --> 00:48:05,839
what is a variable you can use xx plus
 

2535
00:48:05,839 --> 00:48:08,079
what is a variable you can use xx plus
one this is what it means then you can

2536
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:08,089
one this is what it means then you can
 

2537
00:48:08,089 --> 00:48:09,760
one this is what it means then you can
say we'll have a control flow well this

2538
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:09,770
say we'll have a control flow well this
 

2539
00:48:09,770 --> 00:48:11,170
say we'll have a control flow well this
is what an if statement is this is what

2540
00:48:11,170 --> 00:48:11,180
is what an if statement is this is what
 

2541
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:12,910
is what an if statement is this is what
a for statement is this is what a while

2542
00:48:12,910 --> 00:48:12,920
a for statement is this is what a while
 

2543
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:16,000
a for statement is this is what a while
statement is then you can say let's

2544
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:16,010
statement is then you can say let's
 

2545
00:48:16,010 --> 00:48:18,280
statement is then you can say let's
introduce functions right and and many

2546
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:18,290
introduce functions right and and many
 

2547
00:48:18,290 --> 00:48:20,800
introduce functions right and and many
languages like Python have had this this

2548
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:20,810
languages like Python have had this this
 

2549
00:48:20,810 --> 00:48:22,450
languages like Python have had this this
kind of notion of let's introduce small

2550
00:48:22,450 --> 00:48:22,460
kind of notion of let's introduce small
 

2551
00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:23,710
kind of notion of let's introduce small
things and they can add complex

2552
00:48:23,710 --> 00:48:23,720
things and they can add complex
 

2553
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:25,930
things and they can add complex
then you can introduce classes and then

2554
00:48:25,930 --> 00:48:25,940
then you can introduce classes and then
 

2555
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:27,730
then you can introduce classes and then
you can add generics I'm against the

2556
00:48:27,730 --> 00:48:27,740
you can add generics I'm against the
 

2557
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:29,620
you can add generics I'm against the
Swift and then you can in modules and

2558
00:48:29,620 --> 00:48:29,630
Swift and then you can in modules and
 

2559
00:48:29,630 --> 00:48:31,599
Swift and then you can in modules and
build out in terms of the things that

2560
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:31,609
build out in terms of the things that
 

2561
00:48:31,609 --> 00:48:33,579
build out in terms of the things that
you're expressing but this is not very

2562
00:48:33,579 --> 00:48:33,589
you're expressing but this is not very
 

2563
00:48:33,589 --> 00:48:36,099
you're expressing but this is not very
typical for compiled languages and so

2564
00:48:36,099 --> 00:48:36,109
typical for compiled languages and so
 

2565
00:48:36,109 --> 00:48:38,079
typical for compiled languages and so
this was a very strong design point and

2566
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:38,089
this was a very strong design point and
 

2567
00:48:38,089 --> 00:48:40,900
this was a very strong design point and
one of the reasons that Swift in general

2568
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:40,910
one of the reasons that Swift in general
 

2569
00:48:40,910 --> 00:48:42,370
one of the reasons that Swift in general
is designed with this factoring of

2570
00:48:42,370 --> 00:48:42,380
is designed with this factoring of
 

2571
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:44,829
is designed with this factoring of
complexity in mind so that the language

2572
00:48:44,829 --> 00:48:44,839
complexity in mind so that the language
 

2573
00:48:44,839 --> 00:48:46,630
complexity in mind so that the language
can express powerful things you can

2574
00:48:46,630 --> 00:48:46,640
can express powerful things you can
 

2575
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:48,450
can express powerful things you can
write firmware in Swift if you want to

2576
00:48:48,450 --> 00:48:48,460
write firmware in Swift if you want to
 

2577
00:48:48,460 --> 00:48:51,970
write firmware in Swift if you want to
but it has a very high-level feel which

2578
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:51,980
but it has a very high-level feel which
 

2579
00:48:51,980 --> 00:48:54,059
but it has a very high-level feel which
is really this perfect blend because

2580
00:48:54,059 --> 00:48:54,069
is really this perfect blend because
 

2581
00:48:54,069 --> 00:48:56,950
is really this perfect blend because
often you have very advanced library

2582
00:48:56,950 --> 00:48:56,960
often you have very advanced library
 

2583
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:58,569
often you have very advanced library
writers that want to be able to use the

2584
00:48:58,569 --> 00:48:58,579
writers that want to be able to use the
 

2585
00:48:58,579 --> 00:49:01,569
writers that want to be able to use the
the nitty-gritty details but then other

2586
00:49:01,569 --> 00:49:01,579
the nitty-gritty details but then other
 

2587
00:49:01,579 --> 00:49:02,890
the nitty-gritty details but then other
people just want to use the libraries

2588
00:49:02,890 --> 00:49:02,900
people just want to use the libraries
 

2589
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:04,390
people just want to use the libraries
and work at a higher abstraction level

2590
00:49:04,390 --> 00:49:04,400
and work at a higher abstraction level
 

2591
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,339
and work at a higher abstraction level
it's kind of cool that I saw that you

2592
00:49:06,339 --> 00:49:06,349
it's kind of cool that I saw that you
 

2593
00:49:06,349 --> 00:49:09,520
it's kind of cool that I saw that you
can just enter a probability I don't

2594
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:09,530
can just enter a probability I don't
 

2595
00:49:09,530 --> 00:49:11,530
can just enter a probability I don't
think I pronounced that word enough but

2596
00:49:11,530 --> 00:49:11,540
think I pronounced that word enough but
 

2597
00:49:11,540 --> 00:49:15,550
think I pronounced that word enough but
you can just drag in Python it's just a

2598
00:49:15,550 --> 00:49:15,560
you can just drag in Python it's just a
 

2599
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:18,250
you can just drag in Python it's just a
string you can import like I saw this in

2600
00:49:18,250 --> 00:49:18,260
string you can import like I saw this in
 

2601
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:19,540
string you can import like I saw this in
the demo yeah I'm pointing out but like

2602
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:19,550
the demo yeah I'm pointing out but like
 

2603
00:49:19,550 --> 00:49:20,650
the demo yeah I'm pointing out but like
how do you make that happen

2604
00:49:20,650 --> 00:49:20,660
how do you make that happen
 

2605
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:23,710
how do you make that happen
yeah what's what's up yeah say is that

2606
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:23,720
yeah what's what's up yeah say is that
 

2607
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:24,880
yeah what's what's up yeah say is that
as easy as it looks

2608
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:24,890
as easy as it looks
 

2609
00:49:24,890 --> 00:49:27,339
as easy as it looks
or is it yes that's not that's not a

2610
00:49:27,339 --> 00:49:27,349
or is it yes that's not that's not a
 

2611
00:49:27,349 --> 00:49:29,230
or is it yes that's not that's not a
stage magic hack or anything like that

2612
00:49:29,230 --> 00:49:29,240
stage magic hack or anything like that
 

2613
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:30,760
stage magic hack or anything like that
then I I don't mean from the user

2614
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:30,770
then I I don't mean from the user
 

2615
00:49:30,770 --> 00:49:32,020
then I I don't mean from the user
perspective I mean from the

2616
00:49:32,020 --> 00:49:32,030
perspective I mean from the
 

2617
00:49:32,030 --> 00:49:33,579
perspective I mean from the
implementation perspective to make it

2618
00:49:33,579 --> 00:49:33,589
implementation perspective to make it
 

2619
00:49:33,589 --> 00:49:34,089
implementation perspective to make it
happen

2620
00:49:34,089 --> 00:49:34,099
happen
 

2621
00:49:34,099 --> 00:49:36,040
happen
so it's it's easy once all the pieces

2622
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:36,050
so it's it's easy once all the pieces
 

2623
00:49:36,050 --> 00:49:38,170
so it's it's easy once all the pieces
are in place the way it works so if you

2624
00:49:38,170 --> 00:49:38,180
are in place the way it works so if you
 

2625
00:49:38,180 --> 00:49:39,520
are in place the way it works so if you
think about a dynamically typed language

2626
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:39,530
think about a dynamically typed language
 

2627
00:49:39,530 --> 00:49:41,200
think about a dynamically typed language
like Python right you can think about it

2628
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:41,210
like Python right you can think about it
 

2629
00:49:41,210 --> 00:49:43,329
like Python right you can think about it
as in two different ways you can say it

2630
00:49:43,329 --> 00:49:43,339
as in two different ways you can say it
 

2631
00:49:43,339 --> 00:49:46,120
as in two different ways you can say it
has no types right which is what most

2632
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:46,130
has no types right which is what most
 

2633
00:49:46,130 --> 00:49:48,280
has no types right which is what most
people would say or you can say it has

2634
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:48,290
people would say or you can say it has
 

2635
00:49:48,290 --> 00:49:51,190
people would say or you can say it has
one type right and you could say has one

2636
00:49:51,190 --> 00:49:51,200
one type right and you could say has one
 

2637
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:52,839
one type right and you could say has one
type and it's like the Python object

2638
00:49:52,839 --> 00:49:52,849
type and it's like the Python object
 

2639
00:49:52,849 --> 00:49:54,640
type and it's like the Python object
mm-hmm and the Python object gets passed

2640
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:54,650
mm-hmm and the Python object gets passed
 

2641
00:49:54,650 --> 00:49:55,960
mm-hmm and the Python object gets passed
around and because there's only one type

2642
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:55,970
around and because there's only one type
 

2643
00:49:55,970 --> 00:49:59,170
around and because there's only one type
its implicit okay and so what happens

2644
00:49:59,170 --> 00:49:59,180
its implicit okay and so what happens
 

2645
00:49:59,180 --> 00:50:01,059
its implicit okay and so what happens
with Swift and Python talking to each

2646
00:50:01,059 --> 00:50:01,069
with Swift and Python talking to each
 

2647
00:50:01,069 --> 00:50:02,859
with Swift and Python talking to each
other Swift has lots of types right has

2648
00:50:02,859 --> 00:50:02,869
other Swift has lots of types right has
 

2649
00:50:02,869 --> 00:50:05,319
other Swift has lots of types right has
a raise and it has strings and all like

2650
00:50:05,319 --> 00:50:05,329
a raise and it has strings and all like
 

2651
00:50:05,329 --> 00:50:07,510
a raise and it has strings and all like
classes and that kind of stuff but it

2652
00:50:07,510 --> 00:50:07,520
classes and that kind of stuff but it
 

2653
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:11,230
classes and that kind of stuff but it
now has a Python object type right so

2654
00:50:11,230 --> 00:50:11,240
now has a Python object type right so
 

2655
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:12,970
now has a Python object type right so
there is one Python object type and so

2656
00:50:12,970 --> 00:50:12,980
there is one Python object type and so
 

2657
00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:16,240
there is one Python object type and so
when you say import numpy what you get

2658
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:16,250
when you say import numpy what you get
 

2659
00:50:16,250 --> 00:50:18,670
when you say import numpy what you get
is a Python object which is the numpy

2660
00:50:18,670 --> 00:50:18,680
is a Python object which is the numpy
 

2661
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:22,720
is a Python object which is the numpy
module then you say NPRA it says okay

2662
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:22,730
module then you say NPRA it says okay
 

2663
00:50:22,730 --> 00:50:24,550
module then you say NPRA it says okay
hey hey Python object I have no idea

2664
00:50:24,550 --> 00:50:24,560
hey hey Python object I have no idea
 

2665
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:26,190
hey hey Python object I have no idea
what you are give me your array member

2666
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:26,200
what you are give me your array member
 

2667
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:29,440
what you are give me your array member
right okay cool it just it just uses

2668
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:29,450
right okay cool it just it just uses
 

2669
00:50:29,450 --> 00:50:30,609
right okay cool it just it just uses
dynamic stuff talks to the Python

2670
00:50:30,609 --> 00:50:30,619
dynamic stuff talks to the Python
 

2671
00:50:30,619 --> 00:50:32,650
dynamic stuff talks to the Python
interpreter and says hey Python what's

2672
00:50:32,650 --> 00:50:32,660
interpreter and says hey Python what's
 

2673
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:34,560
interpreter and says hey Python what's
the daughter a member in the

2674
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:34,570
the daughter a member in the
 

2675
00:50:34,570 --> 00:50:36,120
the daughter a member in the
that Python object it gives you back

2676
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:36,130
that Python object it gives you back
 

2677
00:50:36,130 --> 00:50:37,920
that Python object it gives you back
another Python object and now you say

2678
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:37,930
another Python object and now you say
 

2679
00:50:37,930 --> 00:50:39,660
another Python object and now you say
parentheses for the call and the

2680
00:50:39,660 --> 00:50:39,670
parentheses for the call and the
 

2681
00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:41,070
parentheses for the call and the
arguments are gonna pass and so then it

2682
00:50:41,070 --> 00:50:41,080
arguments are gonna pass and so then it
 

2683
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:43,920
arguments are gonna pass and so then it
says hey a Python object that is the

2684
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:43,930
says hey a Python object that is the
 

2685
00:50:43,930 --> 00:50:46,830
says hey a Python object that is the
result of NPR a call with these

2686
00:50:46,830 --> 00:50:46,840
result of NPR a call with these
 

2687
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:48,780
result of NPR a call with these
arguments right again calling into the

2688
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:48,790
arguments right again calling into the
 

2689
00:50:48,790 --> 00:50:50,340
arguments right again calling into the
Python interpreter to do that work and

2690
00:50:50,340 --> 00:50:50,350
Python interpreter to do that work and
 

2691
00:50:50,350 --> 00:50:53,370
Python interpreter to do that work and
so right now this is all really simple

2692
00:50:53,370 --> 00:50:53,380
so right now this is all really simple
 

2693
00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:55,380
so right now this is all really simple
and if you if you dive into the code

2694
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:55,390
and if you if you dive into the code
 

2695
00:50:55,390 --> 00:50:57,480
and if you if you dive into the code
what you'll see is that the the Python

2696
00:50:57,480 --> 00:50:57,490
what you'll see is that the the Python
 

2697
00:50:57,490 --> 00:50:58,980
what you'll see is that the the Python
module and Swift is something like

2698
00:50:58,980 --> 00:50:58,990
module and Swift is something like
 

2699
00:50:58,990 --> 00:51:00,930
module and Swift is something like
twelve hundred lines of code or

2700
00:51:00,930 --> 00:51:00,940
twelve hundred lines of code or
 

2701
00:51:00,940 --> 00:51:02,460
twelve hundred lines of code or
something is written in pure Swift it's

2702
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:02,470
something is written in pure Swift it's
 

2703
00:51:02,470 --> 00:51:05,010
something is written in pure Swift it's
super simple and it's and it's built on

2704
00:51:05,010 --> 00:51:05,020
super simple and it's and it's built on
 

2705
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:06,750
super simple and it's and it's built on
top of the c interoperability because

2706
00:51:06,750 --> 00:51:06,760
top of the c interoperability because
 

2707
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:09,690
top of the c interoperability because
just talks to the Python interpreter but

2708
00:51:09,690 --> 00:51:09,700
just talks to the Python interpreter but
 

2709
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:11,310
just talks to the Python interpreter but
making that possible required us to add

2710
00:51:11,310 --> 00:51:11,320
making that possible required us to add
 

2711
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:13,560
making that possible required us to add
two major language features to Swift to

2712
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:13,570
two major language features to Swift to
 

2713
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:15,090
two major language features to Swift to
be able to express these dynamic calls

2714
00:51:15,090 --> 00:51:15,100
be able to express these dynamic calls
 

2715
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:17,550
be able to express these dynamic calls
and the dynamic member lookups and so

2716
00:51:17,550 --> 00:51:17,560
and the dynamic member lookups and so
 

2717
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:19,560
and the dynamic member lookups and so
what we've done over the last year is

2718
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:19,570
what we've done over the last year is
 

2719
00:51:19,570 --> 00:51:22,770
what we've done over the last year is
we've proposed implement standardized

2720
00:51:22,770 --> 00:51:22,780
we've proposed implement standardized
 

2721
00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:24,930
we've proposed implement standardized
and contributed new language features to

2722
00:51:24,930 --> 00:51:24,940
and contributed new language features to
 

2723
00:51:24,940 --> 00:51:26,790
and contributed new language features to
the Swift language in order to make it

2724
00:51:26,790 --> 00:51:26,800
the Swift language in order to make it
 

2725
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:29,730
the Swift language in order to make it
so it is really trivial right and this

2726
00:51:29,730 --> 00:51:29,740
so it is really trivial right and this
 

2727
00:51:29,740 --> 00:51:32,450
so it is really trivial right and this
is one of the things about Swift that is

2728
00:51:32,450 --> 00:51:32,460
is one of the things about Swift that is
 

2729
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:34,680
is one of the things about Swift that is
critical to this but for tens flow work

2730
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:34,690
critical to this but for tens flow work
 

2731
00:51:34,690 --> 00:51:36,150
critical to this but for tens flow work
which is that we can actually add new

2732
00:51:36,150 --> 00:51:36,160
which is that we can actually add new
 

2733
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:38,520
which is that we can actually add new
language features and the bar for adding

2734
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:38,530
language features and the bar for adding
 

2735
00:51:38,530 --> 00:51:40,560
language features and the bar for adding
those is high but it's it's what makes

2736
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:40,570
those is high but it's it's what makes
 

2737
00:51:40,570 --> 00:51:43,650
those is high but it's it's what makes
it possible so you know Google doing

2738
00:51:43,650 --> 00:51:43,660
it possible so you know Google doing
 

2739
00:51:43,660 --> 00:51:45,780
it possible so you know Google doing
incredible work on several things

2740
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:45,790
incredible work on several things
 

2741
00:51:45,790 --> 00:51:46,980
incredible work on several things
including tensorflow

2742
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:46,990
including tensorflow
 

2743
00:51:46,990 --> 00:51:50,610
including tensorflow
the test flow 2.0 or whatever leading up

2744
00:51:50,610 --> 00:51:50,620
the test flow 2.0 or whatever leading up
 

2745
00:51:50,620 --> 00:51:55,440
the test flow 2.0 or whatever leading up
to 2.0 has by default in 2.0 has eager

2749
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:01,760

optimized for GPU or TP or some of these

2750
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:01,770
optimized for GPU or TP or some of these
 

2751
00:52:01,770 --> 00:52:04,470
optimized for GPU or TP or some of these
systems computation needs to be

2752
00:52:04,470 --> 00:52:04,480
systems computation needs to be
 

2753
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:06,360
systems computation needs to be
converted to a graph so what's that

2754
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:06,370
converted to a graph so what's that
 

2755
00:52:06,370 --> 00:52:07,950
converted to a graph so what's that
process like what are the challenges

2756
00:52:07,950 --> 00:52:07,960
process like what are the challenges
 

2757
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:10,740
process like what are the challenges
there yeah so I I'm tangentially

2758
00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:10,750
there yeah so I I'm tangentially
 

2759
00:52:10,750 --> 00:52:13,650
there yeah so I I'm tangentially
involved in this but the the way that it

2760
00:52:13,650 --> 00:52:13,660
involved in this but the the way that it
 

2761
00:52:13,660 --> 00:52:17,130
involved in this but the the way that it
works with autograph is that

2762
00:52:17,130 --> 00:52:17,140
works with autograph is that
 

2763
00:52:17,140 --> 00:52:20,220
works with autograph is that
you mark your your function with the

2764
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:20,230
you mark your your function with the
 

2765
00:52:20,230 --> 00:52:22,560
you mark your your function with the
decorator and when Python calls that

2766
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:22,570
decorator and when Python calls that
 

2767
00:52:22,570 --> 00:52:25,380
decorator and when Python calls that
that decorator is invoked and then it

2768
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:25,390
that decorator is invoked and then it
 

2769
00:52:25,390 --> 00:52:28,440
that decorator is invoked and then it
says before I call this function you can

2770
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:28,450
says before I call this function you can
 

2771
00:52:28,450 --> 00:52:30,510
says before I call this function you can
transform it and so the way autograph

2772
00:52:30,510 --> 00:52:30,520
transform it and so the way autograph
 

2773
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:32,610
transform it and so the way autograph
works is as far as I understand as it

2774
00:52:32,610 --> 00:52:32,620
works is as far as I understand as it
 

2775
00:52:32,620 --> 00:52:34,680
works is as far as I understand as it
actually uses the Python parser to go

2776
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:34,690
actually uses the Python parser to go
 

2777
00:52:34,690 --> 00:52:37,110
actually uses the Python parser to go
parse that turn into a syntax tree and

2778
00:52:37,110 --> 00:52:37,120
parse that turn into a syntax tree and
 

2779
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:39,300
parse that turn into a syntax tree and
now apply compiler techniques to again

2780
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:39,310
now apply compiler techniques to again
 

2781
00:52:39,310 --> 00:52:41,220
now apply compiler techniques to again
transform this down into tensor

2782
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:41,230
transform this down into tensor
 

2783
00:52:41,230 --> 00:52:44,250
transform this down into tensor
photographs and so it you can think of

2784
00:52:44,250 --> 00:52:44,260
photographs and so it you can think of
 

2785
00:52:44,260 --> 00:52:45,570
photographs and so it you can think of
it as saying hey I have an if statement

2786
00:52:45,570 --> 00:52:45,580
it as saying hey I have an if statement
 

2787
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:47,880
it as saying hey I have an if statement
I'm going to create an if node in the

2788
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:47,890
I'm going to create an if node in the
 

2789
00:52:47,890 --> 00:52:48,120
I'm going to create an if node in the
graph

2790
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:48,130
graph
 

2791
00:52:48,130 --> 00:52:51,680
graph
like you say TF conned you have a

2792
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:51,690
like you say TF conned you have a
 

2793
00:52:51,690 --> 00:52:53,670
like you say TF conned you have a
multiply well I'll turn that into

2794
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:53,680
multiply well I'll turn that into
 

2795
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:55,380
multiply well I'll turn that into
multiply node in the graph and that

2796
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:55,390
multiply node in the graph and that
 

2797
00:52:55,390 --> 00:52:57,840
multiply node in the graph and that
becomes the street transformation so

2798
00:52:57,840 --> 00:52:57,850
becomes the street transformation so
 

2799
00:52:57,850 --> 00:53:00,750
becomes the street transformation so
word is the Swift for tensor for come in

2800
00:53:00,750 --> 00:53:00,760
word is the Swift for tensor for come in
 

2801
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:05,130
word is the Swift for tensor for come in
which is you know parallels you know for

2802
00:53:05,130 --> 00:53:05,140
which is you know parallels you know for
 

2803
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:07,650
which is you know parallels you know for
one swift is a interface like Python is

2804
00:53:07,650 --> 00:53:07,660
one swift is a interface like Python is
 

2805
00:53:07,660 --> 00:53:09,810
one swift is a interface like Python is
an interface test flow but it seems like

2806
00:53:09,810 --> 00:53:09,820
an interface test flow but it seems like
 

2807
00:53:09,820 --> 00:53:11,850
an interface test flow but it seems like
there's a lot more going on in just a

2808
00:53:11,850 --> 00:53:11,860
there's a lot more going on in just a
 

2809
00:53:11,860 --> 00:53:13,260
there's a lot more going on in just a
different language interface there's

2810
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:13,270
different language interface there's
 

2811
00:53:13,270 --> 00:53:16,710
different language interface there's
optimization methodology yeah so so the

2812
00:53:16,710 --> 00:53:16,720
optimization methodology yeah so so the
 

2813
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:17,970
optimization methodology yeah so so the
tensor float world has a couple of

2814
00:53:17,970 --> 00:53:17,980
tensor float world has a couple of
 

2815
00:53:17,980 --> 00:53:20,250
tensor float world has a couple of
different what I'd call front-end

2816
00:53:20,250 --> 00:53:20,260
different what I'd call front-end
 

2817
00:53:20,260 --> 00:53:23,520
different what I'd call front-end
technologies and so Swift and Python and

2818
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:23,530
technologies and so Swift and Python and
 

2819
00:53:23,530 --> 00:53:25,590
technologies and so Swift and Python and
go and rust and Julia and all these

2820
00:53:25,590 --> 00:53:25,600
go and rust and Julia and all these
 

2821
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:29,100
go and rust and Julia and all these
things share the tensor flow graphs and

2822
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:29,110
things share the tensor flow graphs and
 

2823
00:53:29,110 --> 00:53:31,290
things share the tensor flow graphs and
all the runtime and everything that's

2824
00:53:31,290 --> 00:53:31,300
all the runtime and everything that's
 

2825
00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:35,400
all the runtime and everything that's
later again and so vertex flow is merely

2826
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:35,410
later again and so vertex flow is merely
 

2827
00:53:35,410 --> 00:53:37,860
later again and so vertex flow is merely
another front end for tensor flow I'm

2828
00:53:37,860 --> 00:53:37,870
another front end for tensor flow I'm
 

2829
00:53:37,870 --> 00:53:39,830
another front end for tensor flow I'm
just like any of these other systems are

2830
00:53:39,830 --> 00:53:39,840
just like any of these other systems are
 

2831
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:42,360
just like any of these other systems are
there's a major difference between I

2832
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:42,370
there's a major difference between I
 

2833
00:53:42,370 --> 00:53:44,370
there's a major difference between I
would say three camps of technologies

2834
00:53:44,370 --> 00:53:44,380
would say three camps of technologies
 

2835
00:53:44,380 --> 00:53:46,290
would say three camps of technologies
here there's Python which is a special

2836
00:53:46,290 --> 00:53:46,300
here there's Python which is a special
 

2837
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:48,600
here there's Python which is a special
case because the vast majority of the

2838
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:48,610
case because the vast majority of the
 

2839
00:53:48,610 --> 00:53:49,920
case because the vast majority of the
community efforts go into the Python

2840
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:49,930
community efforts go into the Python
 

2841
00:53:49,930 --> 00:53:52,500
community efforts go into the Python
interface and python has its own

2842
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:52,510
interface and python has its own
 

2843
00:53:52,510 --> 00:53:53,820
interface and python has its own
approaches for automatic differentiation

2844
00:53:53,820 --> 00:53:53,830
approaches for automatic differentiation
 

2845
00:53:53,830 --> 00:53:56,640
approaches for automatic differentiation
it has its own api's and all this kind

2846
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:56,650
it has its own api's and all this kind
 

2847
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:57,870
it has its own api's and all this kind
of stuff

2848
00:53:57,870 --> 00:53:57,880
of stuff
 

2849
00:53:57,880 --> 00:53:59,490
of stuff
there's Swift which I'll talk about in a

2850
00:53:59,490 --> 00:53:59,500
there's Swift which I'll talk about in a
 

2851
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:00,900
there's Swift which I'll talk about in a
second and then there's kind of

2852
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:00,910
second and then there's kind of
 

2853
00:54:00,910 --> 00:54:02,610
second and then there's kind of
everything else and so the everything

2854
00:54:02,610 --> 00:54:02,620
everything else and so the everything
 

2855
00:54:02,620 --> 00:54:04,920
everything else and so the everything
else are effectively language bindings

2856
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:04,930
else are effectively language bindings
 

2857
00:54:04,930 --> 00:54:07,020
else are effectively language bindings
so they they call into the tense flow

2858
00:54:07,020 --> 00:54:07,030
so they they call into the tense flow
 

2859
00:54:07,030 --> 00:54:08,970
so they they call into the tense flow
runtime but they're not they usually

2860
00:54:08,970 --> 00:54:08,980
runtime but they're not they usually
 

2861
00:54:08,980 --> 00:54:10,980
runtime but they're not they usually
don't have automatic differentiation or

2862
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:10,990
don't have automatic differentiation or
 

2863
00:54:10,990 --> 00:54:13,110
don't have automatic differentiation or
they usually don't provide anything

2864
00:54:13,110 --> 00:54:13,120
they usually don't provide anything
 

2865
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:15,780
they usually don't provide anything
other than API is that call the C API is

2866
00:54:15,780 --> 00:54:15,790
other than API is that call the C API is
 

2867
00:54:15,790 --> 00:54:16,980
other than API is that call the C API is
intensive flow and so they're kind of

2868
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:16,990
intensive flow and so they're kind of
 

2869
00:54:16,990 --> 00:54:19,230
intensive flow and so they're kind of
wrappers for that Swift is really kind

2870
00:54:19,230 --> 00:54:19,240
wrappers for that Swift is really kind
 

2871
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:20,970
wrappers for that Swift is really kind
of special and it's a very different

2872
00:54:20,970 --> 00:54:20,980
of special and it's a very different
 

2873
00:54:20,980 --> 00:54:24,600
of special and it's a very different
approach Swift 4/10 below that is is a

2874
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:24,610
approach Swift 4/10 below that is is a
 

2875
00:54:24,610 --> 00:54:25,830
approach Swift 4/10 below that is is a
very different approach because there

2876
00:54:25,830 --> 00:54:25,840
very different approach because there
 

2877
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:27,480
very different approach because there
we're saying let's look at all the

2878
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:27,490
we're saying let's look at all the
 

2879
00:54:27,490 --> 00:54:29,160
we're saying let's look at all the
problems that need to be solved in the

2880
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:29,170
problems that need to be solved in the
 

2881
00:54:29,170 --> 00:54:29,730
problems that need to be solved in the
fullest

2882
00:54:29,730 --> 00:54:29,740
fullest
 

2883
00:54:29,740 --> 00:54:34,680
fullest
of the tensorflow compilation process if

2884
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:34,690
of the tensorflow compilation process if
 

2885
00:54:34,690 --> 00:54:35,760
of the tensorflow compilation process if
you think about it that way because

2886
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:35,770
you think about it that way because
 

2887
00:54:35,770 --> 00:54:37,680
you think about it that way because
tensorflow is fundamentally a compiler

2888
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:37,690
tensorflow is fundamentally a compiler
 

2889
00:54:37,690 --> 00:54:40,620
tensorflow is fundamentally a compiler
it takes models and then it makes them

2890
00:54:40,620 --> 00:54:40,630
it takes models and then it makes them
 

2891
00:54:40,630 --> 00:54:43,050
it takes models and then it makes them
go faster on hardware that's what a

2892
00:54:43,050 --> 00:54:43,060
go faster on hardware that's what a
 

2893
00:54:43,060 --> 00:54:46,200
go faster on hardware that's what a
compiler does and it has a front end it

2894
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:46,210
compiler does and it has a front end it
 

2895
00:54:46,210 --> 00:54:48,630
compiler does and it has a front end it
has an optimizer and it has many

2896
00:54:48,630 --> 00:54:48,640
has an optimizer and it has many
 

2897
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:50,579
has an optimizer and it has many
backends and so if you think about it

2898
00:54:50,579 --> 00:54:50,589
backends and so if you think about it
 

2899
00:54:50,589 --> 00:54:51,270
backends and so if you think about it
the right way

2900
00:54:51,270 --> 00:54:51,280
the right way
 

2901
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:53,940
the right way
or in in if you look at it in a

2902
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:53,950
or in in if you look at it in a
 

2903
00:54:53,950 --> 00:54:55,650
or in in if you look at it in a
particular way like it is a compiler

2904
00:54:55,650 --> 00:54:55,660
particular way like it is a compiler
 

2905
00:54:55,660 --> 00:55:01,050
particular way like it is a compiler
okay and and so Swift is merely another

2906
00:55:01,050 --> 00:55:01,060
okay and and so Swift is merely another
 

2907
00:55:01,060 --> 00:55:03,750
okay and and so Swift is merely another
front-end but it's saying in the the

2908
00:55:03,750 --> 00:55:03,760
front-end but it's saying in the the
 

2909
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:06,180
front-end but it's saying in the the
design principle is saying let's look at

2910
00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:06,190
design principle is saying let's look at
 

2911
00:55:06,190 --> 00:55:08,160
design principle is saying let's look at
all the problems that we face as machine

2912
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:08,170
all the problems that we face as machine
 

2913
00:55:08,170 --> 00:55:10,290
all the problems that we face as machine
learning practitioners and what is the

2914
00:55:10,290 --> 00:55:10,300
learning practitioners and what is the
 

2915
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:12,480
learning practitioners and what is the
best possible way we can do that given

2916
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:12,490
best possible way we can do that given
 

2917
00:55:12,490 --> 00:55:13,740
best possible way we can do that given
the fact that we can change literally

2918
00:55:13,740 --> 00:55:13,750
the fact that we can change literally
 

2919
00:55:13,750 --> 00:55:16,440
the fact that we can change literally
anything in this entire stack and python

2920
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:16,450
anything in this entire stack and python
 

2921
00:55:16,450 --> 00:55:18,510
anything in this entire stack and python
for example where the vast majority of

2922
00:55:18,510 --> 00:55:18,520
for example where the vast majority of
 

2923
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:21,030
for example where the vast majority of
the engineering and an effort has gone

2924
00:55:21,030 --> 00:55:21,040
the engineering and an effort has gone
 

2925
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:24,210
the engineering and an effort has gone
into its constrained by being the best

2926
00:55:24,210 --> 00:55:24,220
into its constrained by being the best
 

2927
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:25,530
into its constrained by being the best
possible thing you can do with the

2928
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:25,540
possible thing you can do with the
 

2929
00:55:25,540 --> 00:55:28,140
possible thing you can do with the
Python library like there are no Python

2930
00:55:28,140 --> 00:55:28,150
Python library like there are no Python
 

2931
00:55:28,150 --> 00:55:30,060
Python library like there are no Python
language features that are added because

2932
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:30,070
language features that are added because
 

2933
00:55:30,070 --> 00:55:31,670
language features that are added because
of machine learning that I'm aware of

2934
00:55:31,670 --> 00:55:31,680
of machine learning that I'm aware of
 

2935
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:34,020
of machine learning that I'm aware of
they added a matrix multiplication

2936
00:55:34,020 --> 00:55:34,030
they added a matrix multiplication
 

2937
00:55:34,030 --> 00:55:36,660
they added a matrix multiplication
operator with that but that's as close

2938
00:55:36,660 --> 00:55:36,670
operator with that but that's as close
 

2939
00:55:36,670 --> 00:55:40,440
operator with that but that's as close
as you get and so with Swift you can you

2940
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:40,450
as you get and so with Swift you can you
 

2941
00:55:40,450 --> 00:55:41,940
as you get and so with Swift you can you
it's hard but you can add language

2942
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:41,950
it's hard but you can add language
 

2943
00:55:41,950 --> 00:55:44,579
it's hard but you can add language
features to the language and there's a

2944
00:55:44,579 --> 00:55:44,589
features to the language and there's a
 

2945
00:55:44,589 --> 00:55:46,890
features to the language and there's a
community process for that and so we

2946
00:55:46,890 --> 00:55:46,900
community process for that and so we
 

2947
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:48,329
community process for that and so we
look at these things and say well what

2948
00:55:48,329 --> 00:55:48,339
look at these things and say well what
 

2949
00:55:48,339 --> 00:55:49,890
look at these things and say well what
is the right division of labor between

2950
00:55:49,890 --> 00:55:49,900
is the right division of labor between
 

2951
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:51,630
is the right division of labor between
the human programmer and the compiler

2952
00:55:51,630 --> 00:55:51,640
the human programmer and the compiler
 

2953
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:54,270
the human programmer and the compiler
and Swift has a number of things that

2954
00:55:54,270 --> 00:55:54,280
and Swift has a number of things that
 

2955
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:58,130
and Swift has a number of things that
shift that balance so because it's a

2956
00:55:58,130 --> 00:55:58,140
shift that balance so because it's a
 

2957
00:55:58,140 --> 00:56:00,089
shift that balance so because it's a
because it has a type system for example

2958
00:56:00,089 --> 00:56:00,099
because it has a type system for example
 

2959
00:56:00,099 --> 00:56:01,829
because it has a type system for example
it makes certain things possible for

2960
00:56:01,829 --> 00:56:01,839
it makes certain things possible for
 

2961
00:56:01,839 --> 00:56:04,620
it makes certain things possible for
analysis of the code and the compiler

2962
00:56:04,620 --> 00:56:04,630
analysis of the code and the compiler
 

2963
00:56:04,630 --> 00:56:06,420
analysis of the code and the compiler
can automatically build graphs for you

2964
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:06,430
can automatically build graphs for you
 

2965
00:56:06,430 --> 00:56:08,820
can automatically build graphs for you
without you thinking about them like

2966
00:56:08,820 --> 00:56:08,830
without you thinking about them like
 

2967
00:56:08,830 --> 00:56:10,079
without you thinking about them like
that's that's a big deal for a

2968
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:10,089
that's that's a big deal for a
 

2969
00:56:10,089 --> 00:56:11,609
that's that's a big deal for a
programmer you just get free performance

2970
00:56:11,609 --> 00:56:11,619
programmer you just get free performance
 

2971
00:56:11,619 --> 00:56:13,740
programmer you just get free performance
you get clustering infusion and

2972
00:56:13,740 --> 00:56:13,750
you get clustering infusion and
 

2973
00:56:13,750 --> 00:56:15,500
you get clustering infusion and
optimization and things like that

2974
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:15,510
optimization and things like that
 

2975
00:56:15,510 --> 00:56:17,550
optimization and things like that
without you as a programmer having to

small gradients you want to accumulate

3132
00:59:13,650 --> 00:59:13,660
small gradients you want to accumulate
 

3133
00:59:13,660 --> 00:59:17,339
small gradients you want to accumulate
and very very small numbers that are

3134
00:59:17,339 --> 00:59:17,349
and very very small numbers that are
 

3135
00:59:17,349 --> 00:59:19,890
and very very small numbers that are
important to to move things as you're

3136
00:59:19,890 --> 00:59:19,900
important to to move things as you're
 

3137
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:21,180
important to to move things as you're
learning but sometimes you have very

3138
00:59:21,180 --> 00:59:21,190
learning but sometimes you have very
 

3139
00:59:21,190 --> 00:59:25,140
learning but sometimes you have very
large magnitude numbers as well and be

3140
00:59:25,140 --> 00:59:25,150
large magnitude numbers as well and be
 

3141
00:59:25,150 --> 00:59:27,269
large magnitude numbers as well and be
float16 is not as precise the mantissa

3142
00:59:27,269 --> 00:59:27,279
float16 is not as precise the mantissa
 

3143
00:59:27,279 --> 00:59:29,279
float16 is not as precise the mantissa
is small but it turns out the machine

3144
00:59:29,279 --> 00:59:29,289
is small but it turns out the machine
 

3145
00:59:29,289 --> 00:59:30,599
is small but it turns out the machine
learning algorithms actually want to

3146
00:59:30,599 --> 00:59:30,609
learning algorithms actually want to
 

3147
00:59:30,609 --> 00:59:33,029
learning algorithms actually want to
generalize and so there's you know

3148
00:59:33,029 --> 00:59:33,039
generalize and so there's you know
 

3149
00:59:33,039 --> 00:59:34,680
generalize and so there's you know
theories that this actually increases

3150
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:34,690
theories that this actually increases
 

3151
00:59:34,690 --> 00:59:36,450
theories that this actually increases
generate the ability for the network to

00:59:36,450 --> 00:59:36,460
generate the ability for the network to
 

3153
00:59:36,460 --> 00:59:38,809
generate the ability for the network to
generalize across data sets and

3154
00:59:38,809 --> 00:59:38,819
generalize across data sets and
 

3155
00:59:38,819 --> 00:59:40,920
generalize across data sets and
regardless of whether it's good or bad

3156
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:40,930
regardless of whether it's good or bad
 

3157
00:59:40,930 --> 00:59:42,779

at the thing was designed to do but you
know 20 years later the world has

3288
01:02:15,059 --> 01:02:15,069
know 20 years later the world has
 

3289
01:02:15,069 --> 01:02:16,319
know 20 years later the world has
changed and people are trying to solve

3290
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:16,329
changed and people are trying to solve
 

3291
01:02:16,329 --> 01:02:18,209
changed and people are trying to solve
higher-level problems and we need we

3292
01:02:18,209 --> 01:02:18,219
higher-level problems and we need we
 

3293
01:02:18,219 --> 01:02:21,479
higher-level problems and we need we
need some new technology and what's the

3294
01:02:21,479 --> 01:02:21,489
need some new technology and what's the
 

3295
01:02:21,489 --> 01:02:24,120
need some new technology and what's the
future of open source in this context

3296
01:02:24,120 --> 01:02:24,130
future of open source in this context
 

3297
01:02:24,130 --> 01:02:27,359
future of open source in this context
very soon so it is not yet open source

3298
01:02:27,359 --> 01:02:27,369
very soon so it is not yet open source
 

3299
01:02:27,369 --> 01:02:28,890
very soon so it is not yet open source
but it will be hopefully you still

3300
01:02:28,890 --> 01:02:28,900
but it will be hopefully you still
 

3301
01:02:28,900 --> 01:02:31,140
but it will be hopefully you still
believe in the value of open source in

3302
01:02:31,140 --> 01:02:31,150
believe in the value of open source in
 

3303
01:02:31,150 --> 01:02:32,920
believe in the value of open source in
kazakh oh yeah absolutely and I

3304
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:32,930
kazakh oh yeah absolutely and I
 

3305
01:02:32,930 --> 01:02:35,340

that the tensorflow community at large

3306
01:02:35,340 --> 01:02:35,350
that the tensorflow community at large
 

3307
01:02:35,350 --> 01:02:37,990
that the tensorflow community at large
fully believes an open-source so I mean

3308
01:02:37,990 --> 01:02:38,000
fully believes an open-source so I mean
 

3309
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,490
fully believes an open-source so I mean
that's there is a difference between

3310
01:02:39,490 --> 01:02:39,500
that's there is a difference between
 

3311
01:02:39,500 --> 01:02:41,170
that's there is a difference between
Apple where you were previously in

3312
01:02:41,170 --> 01:02:41,180
Apple where you were previously in
 

3313
01:02:41,180 --> 01:02:43,630
Apple where you were previously in
Google now in spirit and culture and I

3314
01:02:43,630 --> 01:02:43,640
Google now in spirit and culture and I
 

3315
01:02:43,640 --> 01:02:45,220
Google now in spirit and culture and I
would say the open sourcing intensive

3316
01:02:45,220 --> 01:02:45,230
would say the open sourcing intensive
 

3317
01:02:45,230 --> 01:02:47,260
would say the open sourcing intensive
floor was a seminal moment in the

3318
01:02:47,260 --> 01:02:47,270
floor was a seminal moment in the
 

3319
01:02:47,270 --> 01:02:49,390
floor was a seminal moment in the
history of software because here's this

3320
01:02:49,390 --> 01:02:49,400
history of software because here's this
 

3321
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:52,420
history of software because here's this
large company releasing a very large

3322

code base as the open sourcing what are

3324
01:02:56,410 --> 01:02:56,420
code base as the open sourcing what are
 

3325
01:02:56,420 --> 01:02:57,490
code base as the open sourcing what are
your thoughts on that

3326
01:02:57,490 --> 01:02:57,500
your thoughts on that
 

3327
01:02:57,500 --> 01:03:00,580
your thoughts on that
I'll happy or not were you to see that

3328
01:03:00,580 --> 01:03:00,590
I'll happy or not were you to see that
 

3329
01:03:00,590 --> 01:03:03,040
I'll happy or not were you to see that
kind of degree of open sourcing so

3330
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:03,050
kind of degree of open sourcing so
 

3331
01:03:03,050 --> 01:03:04,630
kind of degree of open sourcing so
between the two I prefer the Google

3332
01:03:04,630 --> 01:03:04,640
between the two I prefer the Google
 

3333
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:06,990
between the two I prefer the Google
approach if that's what you're saying

3334
01:03:06,990 --> 01:03:07,000
approach if that's what you're saying
 

3335
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:11,350
approach if that's what you're saying
the Apple approach makes sense given the

3336
01:03:11,350 --> 01:03:11,360
the Apple approach makes sense given the
 

3337
01:03:11,360 --> 01:03:13,240
the Apple approach makes sense given the
historical context that Apple came from

3338
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:13,250
historical context that Apple came from
 

3339
01:03:13,250 --> 01:03:16,030
historical context that Apple came from
but that's been 35 years ago and I think

3340
01:03:16,030 --> 01:03:16,040
but that's been 35 years ago and I think
 

3341
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:19,300
but that's been 35 years ago and I think
the Apple is definitely adapting and the

3342
01:03:19,300 --> 01:03:19,310
the Apple is definitely adapting and the
 

3343
01:03:19,310 --> 01:03:20,200
the Apple is definitely adapting and the
way I look at it is that there's

3344
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:20,210
way I look at it is that there's
 

3345
01:03:20,210 --> 01:03:22,480
way I look at it is that there's
different kinds of concerns in the space

3346
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:22,490
different kinds of concerns in the space
 

3347
01:03:22,490 --> 01:03:24,760
different kinds of concerns in the space
right it is very rational for a business

3348
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:24,770
right it is very rational for a business
 

3349
01:03:24,770 --> 01:03:28,840
right it is very rational for a business
to to care about making money that

3350
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:28,850
to to care about making money that
 

3351
01:03:28,850 --> 01:03:30,370
to to care about making money that
fundamentally is what a business is

3352
01:03:30,370 --> 01:03:30,380
fundamentally is what a business is
 

3353
01:03:30,380 --> 01:03:32,680
fundamentally is what a business is
about right but I think it's also

3354
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:32,690
about right but I think it's also
 

3355
01:03:32,690 --> 01:03:35,140
about right but I think it's also
incredibly realistic to say it's not

3356
01:03:35,140 --> 01:03:35,150
incredibly realistic to say it's not
 

3357
01:03:35,150 --> 01:03:36,580
incredibly realistic to say it's not
your string library that's the thing

3358
01:03:36,580 --> 01:03:36,590
your string library that's the thing
 

3359
01:03:36,590 --> 01:03:38,140
your string library that's the thing
that's going to make you money it's

3360
01:03:38,140 --> 01:03:38,150
that's going to make you money it's
 

3361
01:03:38,150 --> 01:03:40,930
that's going to make you money it's
going to be the amazing UI product

3362
01:03:40,930 --> 01:03:40,940
going to be the amazing UI product
 

3363
01:03:40,940 --> 01:03:42,160
going to be the amazing UI product

01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:43,730
things like that that you built on top
 

3367
01:03:43,730 --> 01:03:47,290
things like that that you built on top
of your string library and so keeping

3368
01:03:47,290 --> 01:03:47,300
of your string library and so keeping
 

3369
01:03:47,300 --> 01:03:49,030
of your string library and so keeping
your string library proprietary and

3370

secret and things like that isn't maybe
 

3373
01:03:51,230 --> 01:03:53,740
secret and things like that isn't maybe
not the the important thing anymore

3374
01:03:53,740 --> 01:03:53,750
not the the important thing anymore

right or before platforms were different

3376
01:03:57,400 --> 01:03:57,410
right or before platforms were different
 

3377
01:03:57,410 --> 01:04:00,370
right or before platforms were different
right and even 15 years ago things were

3378
01:04:00,370 --> 01:04:00,380
right and even 15 years ago things were
 

3379
01:04:00,380 --> 01:04:01,990
right and even 15 years ago things were
a little bit different but the world is

3380
01:04:01,990 --> 01:04:02,000
a little bit different but the world is
 

3381
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,480
a little bit different but the world is
changing so Google strikes very good

3382
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:04,490
changing so Google strikes very good
 

3383
01:04:04,490 --> 01:04:07,000
changing so Google strikes very good
balance I think and I think the

3384
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:07,010
balance I think and I think the
 

3385
01:04:07,010 --> 01:04:08,920
balance I think and I think the
tensorflow being open source really

3386
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:08,930
tensorflow being open source really
 

3387
01:04:08,930 --> 01:04:10,740
tensorflow being open source really
changed the entire machine learning

3388
01:04:10,740 --> 01:04:10,750
changed the entire machine learning
 

3389
01:04:10,750 --> 01:04:13,480
changed the entire machine learning
field and it caused a revolution in its

3390
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:13,490
field and it caused a revolution in its
 

3391
01:04:13,490 --> 01:04:15,820
field and it caused a revolution in its
own right and so I think it's amazing

3392
01:04:15,820 --> 01:04:15,830
own right and so I think it's amazing
 

3393
01:04:15,830 --> 01:04:18,910
own right and so I think it's amazing
for amazingly forward-looking because I

3394
01:04:18,910 --> 01:04:18,920
for amazingly forward-looking because I
 

3395
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:20,890
for amazingly forward-looking because I
could have imagined and I was an at

3396
01:04:20,890 --> 01:04:20,900
could have imagined and I was an at
 

3397
01:04:20,900 --> 01:04:22,270
could have imagined and I was an at
Google time but I could imagine the

3398
01:04:22,270 --> 01:04:22,280
Google time but I could imagine the
 

3399
01:04:22,280 --> 01:04:23,650
Google time but I could imagine the
different contacts and different world

3400
01:04:23,650 --> 01:04:23,660
different contacts and different world
 

3401
01:04:23,660 --> 01:04:26,170
different contacts and different world
where a company says machine learning is

3402
01:04:26,170 --> 01:04:26,180
where a company says machine learning is
 

3403
01:04:26,180 --> 01:04:27,820
where a company says machine learning is
critical to what we're doing we're not

3404
01:04:27,820 --> 01:04:27,830
critical to what we're doing we're not
 

3405
01:04:27,830 --> 01:04:28,960
critical to what we're doing we're not
going to give it to other people

3406
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:28,970
going to give it to other people
 

3407
01:04:28,970 --> 01:04:31,840
going to give it to other people
right and so that decision is a profound

3408
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:31,850
right and so that decision is a profound
 

3409
01:04:31,850 --> 01:04:36,010
right and so that decision is a profound
a profoundly brilliant insight that I

3410
01:04:36,010 --> 01:04:36,020
a profoundly brilliant insight that I
 

3411
01:04:36,020 --> 01:04:37,360
a profoundly brilliant insight that I
think has really led to the world being

3412
01:04:37,360 --> 01:04:37,370
think has really led to the world being
 

3413
01:04:37,370 --> 01:04:39,790
think has really led to the world being
better and better for Google as well and

3414
01:04:39,790 --> 01:04:39,800
better and better for Google as well and
 

3415
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:42,520
better and better for Google as well and
has all kinds of ripple effects I think

3416
01:04:42,520 --> 01:04:42,530
has all kinds of ripple effects I think
 

3417
01:04:42,530 --> 01:04:45,790
has all kinds of ripple effects I think
it is really I mean you can't understate

3418
01:04:45,790 --> 01:04:45,800
it is really I mean you can't understate
 

3419
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:46,690
it is really I mean you can't understate
Google does

3420
01:04:46,690 --> 01:04:46,700
Google does
 

3421
01:04:46,700 --> 01:04:49,210
Google does
adding that how profound that is for

3422
01:04:49,210 --> 01:04:49,220
adding that how profound that is for
 

3423
01:04:49,220 --> 01:04:51,550
adding that how profound that is for
software is awesome well and it's been

3424
01:04:51,550 --> 01:04:51,560
software is awesome well and it's been
 

3425
01:04:51,560 --> 01:04:54,579
software is awesome well and it's been
in again I can understand the concern

3426
01:04:54,579 --> 01:04:54,589
in again I can understand the concern
 

3427
01:04:54,589 --> 01:04:56,710
in again I can understand the concern
about if we release our machine learning

3428
01:04:56,710 --> 01:04:56,720
about if we release our machine learning
 

3429
01:04:56,720 --> 01:04:59,530
about if we release our machine learning
software are our competitors could go

3430
01:04:59,530 --> 01:04:59,540
software are our competitors could go
 

3431
01:04:59,540 --> 01:05:01,450
software are our competitors could go
faster from the other hand I think that

3432
01:05:01,450 --> 01:05:01,460
faster from the other hand I think that
 

3433
01:05:01,460 --> 01:05:02,710
faster from the other hand I think that
open sourcing test flow has been

3434
01:05:02,710 --> 01:05:02,720
open sourcing test flow has been
 

3435
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:05,440
open sourcing test flow has been
fantastic for Google and I'm sure that

3436
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:05,450
fantastic for Google and I'm sure that
 

3437
01:05:05,450 --> 01:05:07,150
fantastic for Google and I'm sure that
obvious was that that that decision was

3438
01:05:07,150 --> 01:05:07,160
obvious was that that that decision was
 

3439
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:08,620
obvious was that that that decision was
very non obvious at the time

3440
01:05:08,620 --> 01:05:08,630
very non obvious at the time
 

3441
01:05:08,630 --> 01:05:10,710
very non obvious at the time
but I think it's worked out very well so

3442
01:05:10,710 --> 01:05:10,720
but I think it's worked out very well so
 

3443
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:13,480
but I think it's worked out very well so
let's try this real quick yeah you were

3444
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:13,490
let's try this real quick yeah you were
 

3445
01:05:13,490 --> 01:05:16,569
let's try this real quick yeah you were
at Tesla for five months as the VP of

3446
01:05:16,569 --> 01:05:16,579
at Tesla for five months as the VP of
 

3447
01:05:16,579 --> 01:05:18,250
at Tesla for five months as the VP of
auto pilot software you led the team

3448
01:05:18,250 --> 01:05:18,260
auto pilot software you led the team
 

3449
01:05:18,260 --> 01:05:20,470
auto pilot software you led the team
during the transition from each hardware

3450
01:05:20,470 --> 01:05:20,480
during the transition from each hardware
 

3451
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:22,839
during the transition from each hardware
one hardware to I have a couple

3452
01:05:22,839 --> 01:05:22,849
one hardware to I have a couple
 

3453
01:05:22,849 --> 01:05:25,900
one hardware to I have a couple
questions so one first of all to me

3454
01:05:25,900 --> 01:05:25,910
questions so one first of all to me
 

3455
01:05:25,910 --> 01:05:27,640
questions so one first of all to me
that's one of the bravest engineering

3456
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:27,650
that's one of the bravest engineering
 

3457
01:05:27,650 --> 01:05:29,500
that's one of the bravest engineering
decisions undertaking

3458
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:29,510
decisions undertaking
 

3459
01:05:29,510 --> 01:05:33,520
decisions undertaking
so like undertaking really ever in the

3460
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:33,530
so like undertaking really ever in the
 

3461
01:05:33,530 --> 01:05:35,470
so like undertaking really ever in the
automotive industry to me software wise

3462
01:05:35,470 --> 01:05:35,480
automotive industry to me software wise
 

3463
01:05:35,480 --> 01:05:38,109
automotive industry to me software wise
starting from scratch it's a really

3464
01:05:38,109 --> 01:05:38,119
starting from scratch it's a really
 

3465
01:05:38,119 --> 01:05:40,569
starting from scratch it's a really
brave a decision so my one question is

3466
01:05:40,569 --> 01:05:40,579
brave a decision so my one question is
 

3467
01:05:40,579 --> 01:05:43,030
brave a decision so my one question is
there's always that like what was the

3468
01:05:43,030 --> 01:05:43,040
there's always that like what was the
 

3469
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:44,770
there's always that like what was the
challenge of that do you mean the career

3470
01:05:44,770 --> 01:05:44,780
challenge of that do you mean the career
 

3471
01:05:44,780 --> 01:05:46,510
challenge of that do you mean the career
decision of jumping from a comfortable

3472
01:05:46,510 --> 01:05:46,520
decision of jumping from a comfortable
 

3473
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:49,120
decision of jumping from a comfortable
good job into the unknown or that

3474
01:05:49,120 --> 01:05:49,130
good job into the unknown or that
 

3475
01:05:49,130 --> 01:05:51,099
good job into the unknown or that
combined so the at the individual level

3476
01:05:51,099 --> 01:05:51,109
combined so the at the individual level
 

3477
01:05:51,109 --> 01:05:55,089
combined so the at the individual level
you making that decision and then when

3478
01:05:55,089 --> 01:05:55,099
you making that decision and then when
 

3479
01:05:55,099 --> 01:05:57,250
you making that decision and then when
you show up you know it's a really hard

3480
01:05:57,250 --> 01:05:57,260
you show up you know it's a really hard
 

3481
01:05:57,260 --> 01:06:00,370
you show up you know it's a really hard
engineering process so you could just

3482
01:06:00,370 --> 01:06:00,380
engineering process so you could just
 

3483
01:06:00,380 --> 01:06:04,930
engineering process so you could just
stay maybe slow down say hardware one or

3484
01:06:04,930 --> 01:06:04,940
stay maybe slow down say hardware one or
 

3485
01:06:04,940 --> 01:06:06,339
stay maybe slow down say hardware one or
that those kinds of decisions

3486
01:06:06,339 --> 01:06:06,349
that those kinds of decisions
 

3487
01:06:06,349 --> 01:06:09,430
that those kinds of decisions
just taking it full-on let's let's do

3488
01:06:09,430 --> 01:06:09,440
just taking it full-on let's let's do
 

3489
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:10,780
just taking it full-on let's let's do
this from scratch what was that like

3490
01:06:10,780 --> 01:06:10,790
this from scratch what was that like
 

3491
01:06:10,790 --> 01:06:12,819
this from scratch what was that like
well so I mean I don't think Tesla has a

3492
01:06:12,819 --> 01:06:12,829
well so I mean I don't think Tesla has a
 

3493
01:06:12,829 --> 01:06:14,650
well so I mean I don't think Tesla has a
culture of taking things slow insights

3494
01:06:14,650 --> 01:06:14,660
culture of taking things slow insights
 

3495
01:06:14,660 --> 01:06:15,569
culture of taking things slow insights
how it goes

3496
01:06:15,569 --> 01:06:15,579
how it goes
 

3497
01:06:15,579 --> 01:06:17,559
how it goes
and one of the things that attracted me

3498
01:06:17,559 --> 01:06:17,569
and one of the things that attracted me
 

3499
01:06:17,569 --> 01:06:19,030
and one of the things that attracted me
about Tesla is it's very much a gung-ho

3500
01:06:19,030 --> 01:06:19,040
about Tesla is it's very much a gung-ho
 

3501
01:06:19,040 --> 01:06:20,470
about Tesla is it's very much a gung-ho
let's change the world let's figure it

3502
01:06:20,470 --> 01:06:20,480
let's change the world let's figure it
 

3503
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:22,780
let's change the world let's figure it
out kind of a place and so I have a huge

3504
01:06:22,780 --> 01:06:22,790
out kind of a place and so I have a huge
 

3505
01:06:22,790 --> 01:06:25,080
out kind of a place and so I have a huge
amount of respect for that

3506
01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:25,090
amount of respect for that
 

3507
01:06:25,090 --> 01:06:28,110
amount of respect for that
Tesla has done very smart things with

3508
01:06:28,110 --> 01:06:28,120
Tesla has done very smart things with
 

3509
01:06:28,120 --> 01:06:30,480
Tesla has done very smart things with
hardware one in particular and the

3510
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:30,490
hardware one in particular and the
 

3511
01:06:30,490 --> 01:06:32,190
hardware one in particular and the
harder one design was originally

3512
01:06:32,190 --> 01:06:32,200
harder one design was originally
 

3513
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:36,090
harder one design was originally
designed to be very simple automation

3514
01:06:36,090 --> 01:06:36,100
designed to be very simple automation
 

3515
01:06:36,100 --> 01:06:38,250

features in the car for like traffic

3516
01:06:38,250 --> 01:06:38,260
features in the car for like traffic
 

3517
01:06:38,260 --> 01:06:39,480

aware cruise control and things like

3518
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:39,490
aware cruise control and things like
 

3519
01:06:39,490 --> 01:06:41,160
aware cruise control and things like
that and the fact that they were able to

3520
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:41,170
that and the fact that they were able to
 

3521
01:06:41,170 --> 01:06:43,680
that and the fact that they were able to
effectively feature creep it into lane

3522
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:43,690
effectively feature creep it into lane
 

3523

assistance features is pretty astounding

3526
01:06:48,990 --> 01:06:49,000
assistance features is pretty astounding
 

3527
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,820
assistance features is pretty astounding
particularly given the details of the

3528
01:06:50,820 --> 01:06:50,830
particularly given the details of the
 

3529
01:06:50,830 --> 01:06:54,210
particularly given the details of the
hardware hardware to built on that a lot

3530
01:06:54,210 --> 01:06:54,220
hardware hardware to built on that a lot
 

3531
01:06:54,220 --> 01:06:55,830
hardware hardware to built on that a lot
of ways and the challenge there was that

3532
01:06:55,830 --> 01:06:55,840
of ways and the challenge there was that
 

3533
01:06:55,840 --> 01:06:58,410
of ways and the challenge there was that
they were transitioning from a third

3534

party provided vision stack to an

3536
01:07:00,420 --> 01:07:00,430
party provided vision stack to an
 

3537
01:07:00,430 --> 01:07:03,120
party provided vision stack to an
in-house built vision stack and so for

3538
01:07:03,120 --> 01:07:03,130
in-house built vision stack and so for
 

3539
01:07:03,130 --> 01:07:05,370
in-house built vision stack and so for
the first step which I mostly helped

3540
01:07:05,370 --> 01:07:05,380
the first step which I mostly helped
 

3541
01:07:05,380 --> 01:07:07,920
the first step which I mostly helped
with was getting onto that new vision

3542
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:07,930
with was getting onto that new vision
 

3543
01:07:07,930 --> 01:07:11,000
with was getting onto that new vision
stack and that was very challenging and

3544
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:11,010
stack and that was very challenging and
 

3545
01:07:11,010 --> 01:07:13,230
stack and that was very challenging and
there were it was time critical for

3546
01:07:13,230 --> 01:07:13,240
there were it was time critical for
 

3547
01:07:13,240 --> 01:07:14,820
there were it was time critical for
various reasons and it was a big leap

3548
01:07:14,820 --> 01:07:14,830
various reasons and it was a big leap
 

3549
01:07:14,830 --> 01:07:17,010
various reasons and it was a big leap
but it was fortunate that built on a lot

3550
01:07:17,010 --> 01:07:17,020
but it was fortunate that built on a lot
 

3551
01:07:17,020 --> 01:07:18,420
but it was fortunate that built on a lot
of the knowledge and expertise and the

3552
01:07:18,420 --> 01:07:18,430
of the knowledge and expertise and the
 

3553
01:07:18,430 --> 01:07:21,150
of the knowledge and expertise and the

Leon yeah so I guess I would say that

3578
01:07:48,840 --> 01:07:48,850
Leon yeah so I guess I would say that
 

3579

Leon yeah so I guess I would say that
when I was at Tesla I experienced and

3580
01:07:51,570 --> 01:07:51,580
when I was at Tesla I experienced and
 

3581
01:07:51,580 --> 01:07:54,420
when I was at Tesla I experienced and
saw vert the highest degree of turnover

3582
01:07:54,420 --> 01:07:54,430
saw vert the highest degree of turnover
 

3583
01:07:54,430 --> 01:07:56,400
saw vert the highest degree of turnover
I'd ever seen in a company my which was

3584
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:56,410
I'd ever seen in a company my which was
 

3585
01:07:56,410 --> 01:07:59,040
I'd ever seen in a company my which was
a bit of a shock but one of the things I

3586
01:07:59,040 --> 01:07:59,050
a bit of a shock but one of the things I
 

3587
01:07:59,050 --> 01:08:00,770
a bit of a shock but one of the things I
learned and I came to respect is that

3588
01:08:00,770 --> 01:08:00,780
learned and I came to respect is that
 

3589
01:08:00,780 --> 01:08:03,390
learned and I came to respect is that
Elon is able to attract amazing talent

3590
01:08:03,390 --> 01:08:03,400
Elon is able to attract amazing talent
 

3591
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:05,220
Elon is able to attract amazing talent
because he has a very clear vision of

3592
01:08:05,220 --> 01:08:05,230
because he has a very clear vision of
 

3593
01:08:05,230 --> 01:08:06,810
because he has a very clear vision of
the future and he can get people to buy

happen right and the power of vision is
something that I have a tremendous

3600
01:08:12,420 --> 01:08:12,430
something that I have a tremendous
 

3601
01:08:12,430 --> 01:08:15,270
something that I have a tremendous
amount of respect for and I think that

3602
01:08:15,270 --> 01:08:15,280

01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:17,700
amount of respect for and I think that
Elon is fairly singular in the world in

01:08:17,700 --> 01:08:17,710
Elon is fairly singular in the world in
 

3605
01:08:17,710 --> 01:08:20,880
Elon is fairly singular in the world in
terms of the things he's able to get

3606
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:20,890
terms of the things he's able to get
 

3607
01:08:20,890 --> 01:08:23,250
terms of the things he's able to get
people to believe in and it's it's a

3608
01:08:23,250 --> 01:08:23,260
people to believe in and it's it's a
 

3609
01:08:23,260 --> 01:08:26,520
people to believe in and it's it's a
very it's very there many people who

3610
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:26,530
very it's very there many people who
 

3611
01:08:26,530 --> 01:08:27,840
very it's very there many people who
stay on the street corner and say ah

3612
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:27,850
stay on the street corner and say ah
 

3613
01:08:27,850 --> 01:08:29,640
stay on the street corner and say ah
we're gonna go to Mars right but then

3614
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:29,650
we're gonna go to Mars right but then
 

3615
01:08:29,650 --> 01:08:31,710
we're gonna go to Mars right but then
but then there are a few people that can

3616
01:08:31,710 --> 01:08:31,720
but then there are a few people that can
 

3617
01:08:31,720 --> 01:08:34,140
but then there are a few people that can
get other others to buy into it and

3618
01:08:34,140 --> 01:08:34,150
get other others to buy into it and
 

3619
01:08:34,150 --> 01:08:35,550
get other others to buy into it and
believe in build the path and make it

3620
01:08:35,550 --> 01:08:35,560
believe in build the path and make it
 

3621
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:38,870
believe in build the path and make it
happen and so I respect that

3622
01:08:38,870 --> 01:08:38,880
happen and so I respect that
 

3623
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:41,000
happen and so I respect that
I don't respect all of his methods but

3624
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:41,010
I don't respect all of his methods but
 

3625
01:08:41,010 --> 01:08:43,340
I don't respect all of his methods but
but I have a huge amount of respect for

3626
01:08:43,340 --> 01:08:43,350
but I have a huge amount of respect for
 

3627
01:08:43,350 --> 01:08:46,190
but I have a huge amount of respect for
that you've mentioned in a few places

3628
01:08:46,190 --> 01:08:46,200
that you've mentioned in a few places
 

3629
01:08:46,200 --> 01:08:49,599
that you've mentioned in a few places
including in this context working hard

3630
01:08:49,599 --> 01:08:49,609
including in this context working hard
 

3631
01:08:49,609 --> 01:08:52,250
including in this context working hard
what does it mean to work hard and when

3632
01:08:52,250 --> 01:08:52,260
what does it mean to work hard and when
 

3633
01:08:52,260 --> 01:08:54,289
what does it mean to work hard and when
you look back at your life what are what

3634
01:08:54,289 --> 01:08:54,299
you look back at your life what are what
 

3635
01:08:54,299 --> 01:08:58,000
you look back at your life what are what
were some of the most brutal periods of

3636
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:58,010
were some of the most brutal periods of
 

3637
01:08:58,010 --> 01:09:00,590
were some of the most brutal periods of
having to really sort of put everything

3638
01:09:00,590 --> 01:09:00,600
having to really sort of put everything
 

3639
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:03,800
having to really sort of put everything
you have into something yeah good

3640
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:03,810
you have into something yeah good
 

3641
01:09:03,810 --> 01:09:04,400
you have into something yeah good
question

3642
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:04,410
question
 

3643
01:09:04,410 --> 01:09:06,860
question
so working hard can be defined a lot of

3644
01:09:06,860 --> 01:09:06,870
so working hard can be defined a lot of
 

3645
01:09:06,870 --> 01:09:08,660
so working hard can be defined a lot of
different ways so a lot of hours and so

3646
01:09:08,660 --> 01:09:08,670
different ways so a lot of hours and so
 

3647
01:09:08,670 --> 01:09:13,010
different ways so a lot of hours and so
that's that is true the thing to me

3648
01:09:13,010 --> 01:09:13,020
that's that is true the thing to me
 

3649
01:09:13,020 --> 01:09:15,670
that's that is true the thing to me
that's the hardest is both being

3650
01:09:15,670 --> 01:09:15,680
that's the hardest is both being
 

3651
01:09:15,680 --> 01:09:18,170
that's the hardest is both being
short-term focused on delivering and

3652
01:09:18,170 --> 01:09:18,180
short-term focused on delivering and
 

3653
01:09:18,180 --> 01:09:19,849
short-term focused on delivering and
executing and making a thing happen

3654
01:09:19,849 --> 01:09:19,859
executing and making a thing happen
 

3655
01:09:19,859 --> 01:09:21,289
executing and making a thing happen
while also thinking about the

3656
01:09:21,289 --> 01:09:21,299
while also thinking about the
 

3657
01:09:21,299 --> 01:09:23,809
while also thinking about the
longer-term and trying to balance that

3658
01:09:23,809 --> 01:09:23,819
longer-term and trying to balance that
 

3659
01:09:23,819 --> 01:09:26,809
longer-term and trying to balance that
right because if you are myopically

3660
01:09:26,809 --> 01:09:26,819
right because if you are myopically
 

3661
01:09:26,819 --> 01:09:28,940
right because if you are myopically
focused on solving a task and getting

3662
01:09:28,940 --> 01:09:28,950
focused on solving a task and getting
 

3663
01:09:28,950 --> 01:09:31,550
focused on solving a task and getting
that done and only think about that

3664
01:09:31,550 --> 01:09:31,560
that done and only think about that
 

3665
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:33,260
that done and only think about that
incremental next step you will miss the

3666
01:09:33,260 --> 01:09:33,270
incremental next step you will miss the
 

3667
01:09:33,270 --> 01:09:35,450
incremental next step you will miss the
next big hill you should jump over -

3668
01:09:35,450 --> 01:09:35,460
next big hill you should jump over -
 

3669
01:09:35,460 --> 01:09:37,700
next big hill you should jump over -
right and so I've been really fortunate

3670
01:09:37,700 --> 01:09:37,710
right and so I've been really fortunate
 

3671
01:09:37,710 --> 01:09:40,670
right and so I've been really fortunate
that I've been able to kind of oscillate

3672
01:09:40,670 --> 01:09:40,680
that I've been able to kind of oscillate
 

3673
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:44,840
that I've been able to kind of oscillate
between the two and historically at

3674
01:09:44,840 --> 01:09:44,850
between the two and historically at
 

3675
01:09:44,850 --> 01:09:46,190
between the two and historically at
Apple for example that was made possible

3676
01:09:46,190 --> 01:09:46,200
Apple for example that was made possible
 

3677
01:09:46,200 --> 01:09:47,900
Apple for example that was made possible
because I was able to work some really

3678
01:09:47,900 --> 01:09:47,910
because I was able to work some really
 

3679
01:09:47,910 --> 01:09:49,670
because I was able to work some really
amazing people and build up teams and

3680
01:09:49,670 --> 01:09:49,680
amazing people and build up teams and
 

3681
01:09:49,680 --> 01:09:53,900
amazing people and build up teams and
leadership structures and and allow them

3682
01:09:53,900 --> 01:09:53,910
leadership structures and and allow them
 

3683
01:09:53,910 --> 01:09:55,780
leadership structures and and allow them
to grow in their careers and take on

3684
01:09:55,780 --> 01:09:55,790
to grow in their careers and take on
 

3685
01:09:55,790 --> 01:09:58,430
to grow in their careers and take on
responsibilities thereby freeing up me

3686
01:09:58,430 --> 01:09:58,440
responsibilities thereby freeing up me
 

3687
01:09:58,440 --> 01:10:00,440
responsibilities thereby freeing up me
to be a little bit crazy and thinking

3688
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:00,450
to be a little bit crazy and thinking
 

3689
01:10:00,450 --> 01:10:04,190
to be a little bit crazy and thinking
about the next thing and so it's it's a

3690
01:10:04,190 --> 01:10:04,200
about the next thing and so it's it's a
 

3691
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:06,170
about the next thing and so it's it's a
lot of that but it's also about you know

3692
01:10:06,170 --> 01:10:06,180
lot of that but it's also about you know
 

3693
01:10:06,180 --> 01:10:07,850
lot of that but it's also about you know
with the experience you make connections

3694
01:10:07,850 --> 01:10:07,860
with the experience you make connections
 

3695
01:10:07,860 --> 01:10:09,830
with the experience you make connections
that other people don't necessarily make

3696
01:10:09,830 --> 01:10:09,840
that other people don't necessarily make
 

3697
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:11,840
that other people don't necessarily make
and so I think that is that's a big part

3698
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:11,850
and so I think that is that's a big part
 

3699
01:10:11,850 --> 01:10:15,560
and so I think that is that's a big part
as well but the bedrock is just a lot of

3700
01:10:15,560 --> 01:10:15,570
as well but the bedrock is just a lot of
 

3701
01:10:15,570 --> 01:10:18,980
as well but the bedrock is just a lot of
hours and you know that's that's okay

3702
01:10:18,980 --> 01:10:18,990
hours and you know that's that's okay
 

3703
01:10:18,990 --> 01:10:19,550
hours and you know that's that's okay
with me

3704
01:10:19,550 --> 01:10:19,560
with me
 

3705
01:10:19,560 --> 01:10:20,960
with me
there's different theories on work-life

do not project on to the team but my

3710
01:10:25,460 --> 01:10:25,470
do not project on to the team but my
 

3711
01:10:25,470 --> 01:10:28,310
do not project on to the team but my
theory for myself is that you know I I

make it a better place and that's that's
what I'm really motivated to do so last

3722
01:10:40,580 --> 01:10:40,590
what I'm really motivated to do so last

question LLVM logo is a dragon

3724
01:10:43,610 --> 01:10:43,620
question LLVM logo is a dragon
 

3725
01:10:43,620 --> 01:10:45,920
question LLVM logo is a dragon
you know you explain that this is

3726
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:45,930
you know you explain that this is
 

3727
01:10:45,930 --> 01:10:47,960
you know you explain that this is
because dragons have connotations of

3728

01:11:04,010 --> 01:11:04,020
kind ways of explaining it that you
 

3743
01:11:04,020 --> 01:11:05,480
kind ways of explaining it that you
wanna know the real reason it's a dragon

3744
01:11:05,480 --> 01:11:05,490
wanna know the real reason it's a dragon
 

3745
01:11:05,490 --> 01:11:09,890
wanna know the real reason it's a dragon
well yeah so there is a seminal book on

3746
01:11:09,890 --> 01:11:09,900
well yeah so there is a seminal book on
 

3747
01:11:09,900 --> 01:11:11,900
well yeah so there is a seminal book on
compiler design called the dragon book

3748
01:11:11,900 --> 01:11:11,910
compiler design called the dragon book
 

3749
01:11:11,910 --> 01:11:15,650
compiler design called the dragon book
and so this is a really old now book on

3750
01:11:15,650 --> 01:11:15,660
and so this is a really old now book on
 

3751
01:11:15,660 --> 01:11:19,550
and so this is a really old now book on
compilers and so the the dragon logo for

3752
01:11:19,550 --> 01:11:19,560
