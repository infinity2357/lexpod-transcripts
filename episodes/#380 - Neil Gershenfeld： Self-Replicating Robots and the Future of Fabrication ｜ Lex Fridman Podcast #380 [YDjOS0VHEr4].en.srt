so the first quantum computations

348
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:56,759
so the first quantum computations
 

349
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:59,210
so the first quantum computations
synthetic life so in the space of

in high school I really wanted to go to

368
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:18,960
in high school I really wanted to go to
 

369
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,689
in high school I really wanted to go to
vocational school where you learned to

370
00:07:20,689 --> 00:07:20,699
vocational school where you learned to
 

371
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:23,870
vocational school where you learned to
weld and fix cars and build houses

372
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:23,880
weld and fix cars and build houses
 

373
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,850
weld and fix cars and build houses
and I was told no you're smart you have

374
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:25,860
and I was told no you're smart you have
 

375
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:27,890
and I was told no you're smart you have
to sit in a room and nobody could

376
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:27,900
to sit in a room and nobody could
 

377
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,870
to sit in a room and nobody could
explain to me why I couldn't

378
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:29,880
explain to me why I couldn't
 

379
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,909
explain to me why I couldn't
go to Vocational School

380
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:31,919
go to Vocational School
 

381
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:35,390
go to Vocational School
uh I then worked at Bell labs this

382
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:35,400
uh I then worked at Bell labs this
 

383
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,909
uh I then worked at Bell labs this
wonderful place uh before deregulation

384
00:07:37,909 --> 00:07:37,919
wonderful place uh before deregulation
 

385
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,790
wonderful place uh before deregulation
legendary place and I would get Union

386
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:40,800
legendary place and I would get Union
 

387
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,610
legendary place and I would get Union
grievances because I would go into the

388
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:43,620
grievances because I would go into the
 

389
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:45,050
grievances because I would go into the
workshop and try to make something and

390
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:45,060
workshop and try to make something and
 

391
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,309
workshop and try to make something and
they would say no you're smart you have

392
00:07:46,309 --> 00:07:46,319
they would say no you're smart you have
 

393
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,529
they would say no you're smart you have
to tell somebody what to do

394
00:07:48,529 --> 00:07:48,539
to tell somebody what to do
 

395
00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:51,110
to tell somebody what to do
and it wasn't until MIT and I'll explain

396
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:51,120
and it wasn't until MIT and I'll explain
 

397
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,290
and it wasn't until MIT and I'll explain
how CBA started but I could create CBA

398
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:54,300
how CBA started but I could create CBA
 

399
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,270
how CBA started but I could create CBA
that I came to understand this is a

400
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:56,280
that I came to understand this is a
 

401
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,529
that I came to understand this is a
mistake that dates back to the

402
00:07:57,529 --> 00:07:57,539
mistake that dates back to the
 

403
00:07:57,539 --> 00:08:00,830
mistake that dates back to the
Renaissance so in the Renaissance the

404
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:00,840
Renaissance so in the Renaissance the
 

405
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,409
Renaissance so in the Renaissance the
liberal arts emerged and liberal doesn't

406
00:08:03,409 --> 00:08:03,419
liberal arts emerged and liberal doesn't
 

407
00:08:03,419 --> 00:08:05,089
liberal arts emerged and liberal doesn't
mean politically liberal this was the

408
00:08:05,089 --> 00:08:05,099
mean politically liberal this was the
 

409
00:08:05,099 --> 00:08:07,850
mean politically liberal this was the
path to Liberation birth of humanism and

410
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:07,860
path to Liberation birth of humanism and
 

411
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,350
path to Liberation birth of humanism and
so the liberal arts with the Trivium

412
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:09,360
so the liberal arts with the Trivium
 

413
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,870
so the liberal arts with the Trivium
quadrivium roughly language Natural

414
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:11,880
quadrivium roughly language Natural
 

415
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,089
quadrivium roughly language Natural
Science and

416
00:08:14,089 --> 00:08:14,099
Science and
 

417
00:08:14,099 --> 00:08:17,930
Science and
at that moment what emerged was this

418
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:17,940
at that moment what emerged was this
 

419
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:20,330
at that moment what emerged was this
Dreadful concept of the ill liberal arts

420
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:20,340
Dreadful concept of the ill liberal arts
 

421
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:22,670
Dreadful concept of the ill liberal arts
so anything that wasn't the liberal arts

422
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:22,680
so anything that wasn't the liberal arts
 

423
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,950
so anything that wasn't the liberal arts
was for commercial gain and was just

424
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:24,960
was for commercial gain and was just
 

425
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,350
was for commercial gain and was just
making stuff and wasn't valid for

426
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:27,360
making stuff and wasn't valid for
 

427
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,570
making stuff and wasn't valid for
serious study and so that's why we're

428
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:29,580
serious study and so that's why we're
 

429
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:32,570
serious study and so that's why we're
left with learning to weld wasn't a

430
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:32,580
left with learning to weld wasn't a
 

431
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:35,149
left with learning to weld wasn't a
subject for serious study

432
00:08:35,149 --> 00:08:35,159

433
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,769

00:09:41,449 --> 00:09:41,459
and eventually he was kicked out and
 

493
00:09:41,459 --> 00:09:43,670
and eventually he was kicked out and
invented electronic music David Borden

494
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:43,680
invented electronic music David Borden
 

495
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,070
invented electronic music David Borden
was the first musician who created

496
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:46,080
was the first musician who created
 

497
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,050
was the first musician who created
electronic music so he's legendary for

498
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:48,060
electronic music so he's legendary for
 

499
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:49,930
electronic music so he's legendary for
people like Phil glass and Steve Reich

500
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:49,940
people like Phil glass and Steve Reich
 

501
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:53,150
people like Phil glass and Steve Reich
and so that got me thinking about I

502
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:53,160
and so that got me thinking about I
 

503
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,949
and so that got me thinking about I
would behave as a scientist in the music

504
00:09:54,949 --> 00:09:54,959
would behave as a scientist in the music
 

505
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,470
would behave as a scientist in the music

was really
um resolution and bandwidth it's

582
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:24,600
um resolution and bandwidth it's
 

583
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,449
um resolution and bandwidth it's
um how fast can you measure what he does

584

and
 

587
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:32,150
and
um uh the the the bandwidth and the

588
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:32,160
um uh the the the bandwidth and the
 

589
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,410

and Jerry explaining that and Nicholas
 

813
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,150
and Jerry explaining that and Nicholas
then confirming it is really why I

814
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:02,160
then confirming it is really why I
 

815
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,610
then confirming it is really why I
pivoted and went to MIT

816
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:04,620
pivoted and went to MIT
 

817
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:06,530
pivoted and went to MIT
um because my students who helped create

818
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:06,540
um because my students who helped create
 

819
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:09,110
um because my students who helped create
Quantum Computing or synthetic life get

this department of none of the above
 

825
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:18,470
this department of none of the above
so that led to coming to MIT yeah with

826
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:18,480
so that led to coming to MIT yeah with
 

827
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,650
so that led to coming to MIT yeah with
um uh Todd and Joe Paradiso and my

828
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:21,660
um uh Todd and Joe Paradiso and my
 

829
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:23,269
um uh Todd and Joe Paradiso and my
colleague we started a Consortium called

830
00:16:23,269 --> 00:16:23,279
colleague we started a Consortium called
 

831
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,069
colleague we started a Consortium called
things that think and this was around

832
00:16:25,069 --> 00:16:25,079
things that think and this was around
 

833
00:16:25,079 --> 00:16:28,550
things that think and this was around
the birth of Internet of things and

834
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:28,560
the birth of Internet of things and
 

835
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,430
the birth of Internet of things and
um RFID but then we started doing things

836
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:31,440
um RFID but then we started doing things
 

837
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,769
um RFID but then we started doing things
like work we can discuss that became the

838
00:16:33,769 --> 00:16:33,779
like work we can discuss that became the
 

839
00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:35,569
like work we can discuss that became the
beginnings of quantum Computing and

840
00:16:35,569 --> 00:16:35,579
beginnings of quantum Computing and
 

841
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:38,749
beginnings of quantum Computing and
cryptography and materials and logic and

842
00:16:38,749 --> 00:16:38,759
cryptography and materials and logic and
 

843
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:42,550
cryptography and materials and logic and
microfluidics and those needed

844
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:42,560
microfluidics and those needed
 

845
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,110
microfluidics and those needed
uh much more significant infrastructure

846
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:45,120
uh much more significant infrastructure
 

847
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,810
uh much more significant infrastructure
and were much longer research arcs so

848
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:47,820
and were much longer research arcs so
 

849
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:50,870
and were much longer research arcs so
with a bigger team of about 20 people we

850
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:50,880
with a bigger team of about 20 people we
 

851
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,269
with a bigger team of about 20 people we
wrote a proposal to the NSF to assemble

852
00:16:53,269 --> 00:16:53,279
wrote a proposal to the NSF to assemble
 

853
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,009
wrote a proposal to the NSF to assemble
one of every tool to make anything of

854
00:16:55,009 --> 00:16:55,019
one of every tool to make anything of
 

855
00:16:55,019 --> 00:16:58,850
one of every tool to make anything of
any size was roughly the proposal one of

856
00:16:58,850 --> 00:16:58,860
any size was roughly the proposal one of
 

857
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:01,249
any size was roughly the proposal one of
any tool to make anything of any size

858
00:17:01,249 --> 00:17:01,259
any tool to make anything of any size
 

859
00:17:01,259 --> 00:17:04,610
any tool to make anything of any size
yeah so they're usually nanometers

860
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:04,620
yeah so they're usually nanometers
 

861
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:06,829
yeah so they're usually nanometers
micrometers millimeters meters are

862

segregated input and output is
 

865
00:17:08,939 --> 00:17:12,470
segregated input and output is
segregated we wanted to look just very

866
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:12,480
segregated we wanted to look just very
 

867
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,270

literally how digital becomes physical

868
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:14,280
literally how digital becomes physical
 

869
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:17,510
literally how digital becomes physical
and physical becomes digital and

870
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:17,520
and physical becomes digital and
 

871
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:22,010
and physical becomes digital and
fortunately we got NSF on a good day and

872
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:22,020
fortunately we got NSF on a good day and
 

873
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:24,949
fortunately we got NSF on a good day and
they funded this facility of one of

874
00:17:24,949 --> 00:17:24,959
they funded this facility of one of
 

875
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:27,409
they funded this facility of one of
almost every tool to make anything and

876
00:17:27,409 --> 00:17:27,419
almost every tool to make anything and
 

877
00:17:27,419 --> 00:17:29,810
almost every tool to make anything and
so uh with

878
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:29,820
so uh with
 

879
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:32,750
so uh with
um a group of core colleagues

yeah so a well-equipped research lab has

908
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:08,160
yeah so a well-equipped research lab has
 

909
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,529
yeah so a well-equipped research lab has
the sort of tools we're talking about

910
00:18:09,529 --> 00:18:09,539
the sort of tools we're talking about
 

911
00:18:09,539 --> 00:18:11,450
the sort of tools we're talking about
but they're segregated in different

912
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:11,460
but they're segregated in different
 

913
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:15,230
but they're segregated in different
places they're typically also run by

914
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:15,240
places they're typically also run by
 

915
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,750
places they're typically also run by
technicians where you then have an

916
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:17,760
technicians where you then have an
 

917
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,850
technicians where you then have an
account and a project and you charge all

918
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:19,860
account and a project and you charge all
 

919
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,890
account and a project and you charge all
of these tools are essentially

920
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:21,900
of these tools are essentially
 

921
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,390
of these tools are essentially
when you don't know what you're doing

922
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:23,400
when you don't know what you're doing
 

923
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,770
when you don't know what you're doing
not when you do know what you're doing

00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:24,780
not when you do know what you're doing
 

925
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,870
not when you do know what you're doing
in that they're they're when you need to

926
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:26,880
in that they're they're when you need to
 

927
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,409
in that they're they're when you need to
work across length scales where we don't

928
00:18:29,409 --> 00:18:29,419
work across length scales where we don't
 

929

what we're talking about is a crazy
 

975
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:31,549
what we're talking about is a crazy
random seeming of almost unrelated

projects but if you rotate 90 degrees

978
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:34,140
projects but if you rotate 90 degrees
 

979
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:37,190
projects but if you rotate 90 degrees
it's really just a core thought over and

980
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:37,200
it's really just a core thought over and
 

981
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,669
it's really just a core thought over and
over again just very literally how bits

982
00:19:40,669 --> 00:19:40,679
over again just very literally how bits
 

983
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:42,590
over again just very literally how bits
and atoms relate how digital and just

984
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:42,600
and atoms relate how digital and just
 

985
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,169
and atoms relate how digital and just
going from digital to physical in many

986
00:19:45,169 --> 00:19:45,179
going from digital to physical in many
 

987
00:19:45,179 --> 00:19:46,549
going from digital to physical in many
different domains but it's really just

988
00:19:46,549 --> 00:19:46,559
different domains but it's really just
 

989
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,590
different domains but it's really just
the same idea over and over again

00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,549
the same idea over and over again
so to understand the biggest things

992
00:19:51,549 --> 00:19:51,559
so to understand the biggest things

the Casual obvious answer is digital in
 

1001
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:10,190
the Casual obvious answer is digital in

and he made an important mistake which

1022
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:37,080
and he made an important mistake which
 

1023
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,450
and he made an important mistake which
we can talk about

1031
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,850
great analog computer so it was a room
full of gears and pulleys and the longer

and Shannon worked on it as a student

1036
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:52,320
and Shannon worked on it as a student
 

1037
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,710
and Shannon worked on it as a student
and he got so annoyed in his master's

1038
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:54,720
and he got so annoyed in his master's
 

1039

and he got so annoyed in his master's
thesis he invented digital logic

1040
00:20:57,529 --> 00:20:57,539
thesis he invented digital logic
 

1041
00:20:57,539 --> 00:20:59,930
thesis he invented digital logic
um but he then went on to Bell labs and

1042
00:20:59,930 --> 00:20:59,940
um but he then went on to Bell labs and
 

1043
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:02,029
um but he then went on to Bell labs and
what he did there was

1044
00:21:02,029 --> 00:21:02,039
what he did there was
 

1045
00:21:02,039 --> 00:21:04,970
what he did there was
communication was beginning to expand

1046
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:04,980
communication was beginning to expand
 

1047
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:07,789
communication was beginning to expand
there is more demand for phone lines and

1048
00:21:07,789 --> 00:21:07,799
there is more demand for phone lines and
 

1049
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:11,029
there is more demand for phone lines and
so there's a question about how much how

1050
00:21:11,029 --> 00:21:11,039
so there's a question about how much how
 

1051
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,770
so there's a question about how much how
many phone lines you could phone

1052
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:12,780
many phone lines you could phone
 

1053
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:15,230
many phone lines you could phone
messages you could send down a wire

1054
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:15,240
messages you could send down a wire
 

1055
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,450
messages you could send down a wire
and you could try to just make it better

1056
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:17,460
and you could try to just make it better
 

1057
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:19,310
and you could try to just make it better
and better he asked a question nobody

1058
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:19,320
and better he asked a question nobody
 

1059
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,049
and better he asked a question nobody
had asked which is rather than make it

1060
00:21:21,049 --> 00:21:21,059
had asked which is rather than make it
 

1061
00:21:21,059 --> 00:21:22,610
had asked which is rather than make it
better and better what's the limit to

1062
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:22,620
better and better what's the limit to
 

1063
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:26,270
better and better what's the limit to
how good it can be and he proved a

1064
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:26,280
how good it can be and he proved a
 

1065
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,770
how good it can be and he proved a
couple things but one of the main things

1066
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:27,780
couple things but one of the main things
 

1067
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:31,430
couple things but one of the main things
he proved was a threshold theorem for

1068
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:31,440
he proved was a threshold theorem for
 

1069
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,310
he proved was a threshold theorem for
channel capacity and so what he showed

1070
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:34,320
channel capacity and so what he showed
 

1071
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,830
channel capacity and so what he showed
was my voice to you right now is coming

means unreliable things can work
 

1117
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:34,070
means unreliable things can work
reliably so Shannon did that for

1118
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:34,080
reliably so Shannon did that for
 

1119
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:37,490
reliably so Shannon did that for
communication then van Neumann was

1120
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:37,500
communication then van Neumann was
 

1121
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,590
communication then van Neumann was
inspired by that and applied it to

1122
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:39,600
inspired by that and applied it to
 

1123
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,990
inspired by that and applied it to
computation and he showed how an

1124
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:42,000
computation and he showed how an
 

1125
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,330

unreliable computer can operate reliably
 

1127
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:46,789
unreliable computer can operate reliably
by using the same threshold property of

by using the same threshold property of
 

1129
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:49,070
by using the same threshold property of

1288
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:04,260
these digital properties but not for
 

1289
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:08,029
these digital properties but not for
communication or computation in effect

1290
00:26:08,029 --> 00:26:08,039
communication or computation in effect
 

1291
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:09,890
communication or computation in effect
but for construction

1292
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:09,900
but for construction
 

1293
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:13,430
but for construction
so a number of projects in my lab have

1294
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:13,440
so a number of projects in my lab have
 

1295
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,110
so a number of projects in my lab have
been studying the idea of digital

1296
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:15,120
been studying the idea of digital
 

1297
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,510
been studying the idea of digital
materials and think of a digital

1298
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:17,520
materials and think of a digital
 

1299
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:21,230
materials and think of a digital
material just as Lego bricks the precise

1300
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:21,240
material just as Lego bricks the precise
 

1301
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:24,110
material just as Lego bricks the precise
meaning is a degree discrete set of

1302
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:24,120
meaning is a degree discrete set of
 

1303
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:26,810
meaning is a degree discrete set of
Parts reversibly joined

1304
00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:26,820

00:26:29,269 --> 00:26:29,279
um with global geometry determined from
 

1307
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:32,450
um with global geometry determined from
local constraints and so it's digitizing

1308
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:32,460
local constraints and so it's digitizing
 

1309
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:34,549
local constraints and so it's digitizing
the materials and so I'm coming back to

1310
00:26:34,549 --> 00:26:34,559
the materials and so I'm coming back to
 

1311
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,590
the materials and so I'm coming back to
what are the biggest things I've made my

1312
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:36,600
what are the biggest things I've made my
 

1313
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,269
what are the biggest things I've made my
lab was working with the Aerospace

they asked us for how to join Composites

1320
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:44,760
they asked us for how to join Composites
 

1321
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,610
they asked us for how to join Composites
when you make a composite airplane you

1322
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:46,620
when you make a composite airplane you
 

1323
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:48,590

make these giant wing and fuselage parts
 

1325
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,690
make these giant wing and fuselage parts
and they asked us for a better way to

1326
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:50,700
and they asked us for a better way to
 

1327
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:53,090
and they asked us for a better way to
stick them together because the joints

1328
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:53,100
stick them together because the joints
 

1329
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:55,549
stick them together because the joints
were a place of failure and what we

1330
00:26:55,549 --> 00:26:55,559
were a place of failure and what we
 

1331
00:26:55,559 --> 00:26:58,789
were a place of failure and what we
discovered was instead of making a few

00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:19,200
is fascinating yeah the answer is
 

1447
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,590
is fascinating yeah the answer is
different at different length scales so

1448
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:21,600
different at different length scales so
 

1449
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:25,250
different at different length scales so
so to explain that in biology primary

1450
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:25,260
so to explain that in biology primary
 

1451
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:28,190
so to explain that in biology primary
structure is the code in the messenger

1452
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:28,200
structure is the code in the messenger
 

1453
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,049
structure is the code in the messenger

build yeah

1456
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:31,320
build yeah
 

1457
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,470
build yeah

00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:33,480
um secondary structure or geometrical
 

1459
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,269
um secondary structure or geometrical
motifs they're things like helices or

1460
00:29:35,269 --> 00:29:35,279
motifs they're things like helices or
 

1461
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:37,549
motifs they're things like helices or
sheets tertiary structures are

1462
00:29:37,549 --> 00:29:37,559

moving my mouth or making the synapses
 

1471
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,090
moving my mouth or making the synapses
work in my brain so there's that

1472
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:50,100
work in my brain so there's that
 

1473
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:52,549
work in my brain so there's that

00:30:51,169 --> 00:30:51,179
without luggage and the at heart it's
 

1529
00:30:51,179 --> 00:30:53,570
without luggage and the at heart it's
sort of how to create life in non-living

sort of how to create life in non-living
 

1531
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:56,510
sort of how to create life in non-living
materials so if if you think about this

1532
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:56,520
materials so if if you think about this
 

1533
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,310

um in my lab we're doing that but on

1538
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:02,880
um in my lab we're doing that but on
 

1539
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:03,950
um in my lab we're doing that but on
different length scales for different

1540
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:03,960
different length scales for different
 

1541
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:06,230
different length scales for different
purposes so we're making micro robots

1542
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:06,240
purposes so we're making micro robots
 

1543
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:10,010
purposes so we're making micro robots
out of like Nano bricks and to make the

1544
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:10,020
out of like Nano bricks and to make the
 

1545
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:12,950
out of like Nano bricks and to make the
robots to build large-scale structures

1546
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:12,960
robots to build large-scale structures
 

1547
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,070
robots to build large-scale structures
in Space the elements of the robots now

1548
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:16,080
in Space the elements of the robots now
 

1549
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:19,250
in Space the elements of the robots now
are centimeters rather than micrometers

1550
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:19,260
are centimeters rather than micrometers
 

1551
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:21,769
are centimeters rather than micrometers
and so the assembly robots for the

1552
00:31:21,769 --> 00:31:21,779
and so the assembly robots for the
 

1553
00:31:21,779 --> 00:31:23,750
and so the assembly robots for the
bigger structures are

1554
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:23,760
bigger structures are
 

1555
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:27,230
bigger structures are
uh there are the cells that make up the

1556
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:27,240
uh there are the cells that make up the
 

1557
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:29,029
uh there are the cells that make up the
structure but then we have functional

1558
00:31:29,029 --> 00:31:29,039
structure but then we have functional
 

1559
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:31,730
structure but then we have functional
cells and so cells that can process and

1560
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:31,740
cells and so cells that can process and
 

1561
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:34,130
cells and so cells that can process and
actuate each cell can like move one

1562
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:34,140
actuate each cell can like move one
 

1563
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:37,130
actuate each cell can like move one

degree of Freedom or attach or disk
 

1565
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:41,870
degree of Freedom or attach or disk
detach or process now those elements I

1566
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:41,880
detach or process now those elements I
 

1567
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:44,330
detach or process now those elements I
just described we can make out of the

1568
00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:44,340
just described we can make out of the
 

1569
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:45,889
just described we can make out of the
still smaller parts So eventually

1570
00:31:45,889 --> 00:31:45,899
still smaller parts So eventually
 

1571
00:31:45,899 --> 00:31:47,450
still smaller parts So eventually
there's the hierarchy of the little

00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:49,080
Parts make little robots that make
 

1575
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:51,529
Parts make little robots that make
bigger parts of bigger robots that up

1576
00:31:51,529 --> 00:31:51,539
bigger parts of bigger robots that up
 

1577
00:31:51,539 --> 00:31:53,630
bigger parts of bigger robots that up
through that hierarchy in that way you

1578
00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:53,640
through that hierarchy in that way you
 

1579
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,190
through that hierarchy in that way you
can move up the line scale right early

1580
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:55,200
can move up the line scale right early
 

1581
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,590
can move up the line scale right early
on I tried to go in a straight line from

00:31:57,590 --> 00:31:57,600
on I tried to go in a straight line from
 

1583
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,269
on I tried to go in a straight line from
the bottom to the top and that ended up

1584
00:31:59,269 --> 00:31:59,279
the bottom to the top and that ended up
 

1585
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:01,310
the bottom to the top and that ended up
being a bad idea instead we're kind of

1586
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:01,320
being a bad idea instead we're kind of
 

1587
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,350
being a bad idea instead we're kind of
doing all of these in parallel and then

1588
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:03,360
doing all of these in parallel and then
 

1589
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,870
doing all of these in parallel and then
they're growing together and so to make

1590
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:05,880
they're growing together and so to make
 

1591
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:08,570
they're growing together and so to make
the larger scale structures we um like

1592
00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:08,580
the larger scale structures we um like
 

1593
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:10,430
the larger scale structures we um like
there's a lot of a hype right now about

1594
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:10,440
there's a lot of a hype right now about
 

1595
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,110
there's a lot of a hype right now about

00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:39,769
now there's a really hard problem which
is

1670
00:33:39,769 --> 00:33:39,779
is

00:33:39,779 --> 00:33:44,450
is
how if you have that in your mind how do

1672
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:44,460
how if you have that in your mind how do
 

1673
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:48,409
how if you have that in your mind how do
you transfer it and wake up a thing that

00:33:48,409 --> 00:33:48,419
you transfer it and wake up a thing that
 

1675
00:33:48,419 --> 00:33:50,330
you transfer it and wake up a thing that
then can contain it

1676
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:50,340
then can contain it
 

1677
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:51,710
then can contain it
um so how do you give birth to a thing

1678
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:51,720
um so how do you give birth to a thing
 

1679
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:54,710
um so how do you give birth to a thing
that knows how to make itself and so um

00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:54,720
that knows how to make itself and so um

00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,470
that knows how to make itself and so um

intellectually is so important because
 

1717
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,930
intellectually is so important because
this is the foundation of life this is

1718

this is the foundation of life this is
 

1719
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:40,550
this is the foundation of life this is
really just understanding the essence of

really just understanding the essence of
 

1721
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:43,129
really just understanding the essence of

the reason it's so important
 

1727
00:34:47,179 --> 00:34:49,550
the reason it's so important
technologically is because that's how

1728
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:49,560
technologically is because that's how
 

1729
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,409
technologically is because that's how
you scale capacity that's how you can

1730
00:34:51,409 --> 00:34:51,419
you scale capacity that's how you can
 

1731
00:34:51,419 --> 00:34:53,629
you scale capacity that's how you can
make an elephant from a ribosome because

00:35:32,359 --> 00:35:35,150
does 10 to the 17 Ops per second
your brain does 10 to the 17 Ops per

1764
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:35,160
your brain does 10 to the 17 Ops per
 

1765
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,130
your brain does 10 to the 17 Ops per
second it has about 10 to the 15

1766
00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:37,140
second it has about 10 to the 15
 

1767
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:40,010
second it has about 10 to the 15
synapses and they run at about 100 Hertz

1768
00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:40,020
synapses and they run at about 100 Hertz
 

1769
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:42,910
synapses and they run at about 100 Hertz
so as of a year or two ago

1770
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:42,920
so as of a year or two ago
 

1771
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:46,010
so as of a year or two ago
the compute the performance of a big

1772
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:46,020
the compute the performance of a big
 

1773
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:48,890
the compute the performance of a big
computer matched a brain so you could

1774
00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:48,900
computer matched a brain so you could
 

1775
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:51,109
computer matched a brain so you could
view AI as a breakthrough but the real

1776
00:35:51,109 --> 00:35:51,119
view AI as a breakthrough but the real
 

1777
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:53,270
view AI as a breakthrough but the real
story is

1778
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:53,280
story is
 

1779
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:56,030
story is
um within about a year or two ago and

1780
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:56,040
um within about a year or two ago and
 

1781
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:57,710
um within about a year or two ago and
let's see that that the super computer

1782
00:35:57,710 --> 00:35:57,720
let's see that that the super computer
 

1783
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:00,829
let's see that that the super computer
has about 10 to the 15 transistors in

1784
00:36:00,829 --> 00:36:00,839
has about 10 to the 15 transistors in
 

1785
00:36:00,839 --> 00:36:02,810
has about 10 to the 15 transistors in
the processors 10 to the 15 transistors

1786
00:36:02,810 --> 00:36:02,820
the processors 10 to the 15 transistors
 

1787
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:04,790
the processors 10 to the 15 transistors
in the memory which is the synapses in

1788
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:04,800
in the memory which is the synapses in
 

1789
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,470
in the memory which is the synapses in
your brain so the real breakthrough was

1790
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:06,480
your brain so the real breakthrough was
 

1791
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,870
your brain so the real breakthrough was
the computers match the computational

1792
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:08,880
the computers match the computational
 

1793
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:12,530
the computers match the computational
capacity of a brain and so we'd be sort

1794
00:36:12,530 --> 00:36:12,540
capacity of a brain and so we'd be sort
 

1795
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:14,329
capacity of a brain and so we'd be sort
of derelict if they couldn't do about

1796
00:36:14,329 --> 00:36:14,339
of derelict if they couldn't do about
 

1797
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:16,609
of derelict if they couldn't do about
the same thing but now the reason I'm

1798
00:36:16,609 --> 00:36:16,619
the same thing but now the reason I'm
 

1799
00:36:16,619 --> 00:36:18,670
the same thing but now the reason I'm
mentioning that is

1800
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:18,680
mentioning that is
 

1801
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,510
mentioning that is
the

1802
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:20,520
the
 

1803
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:23,690
the
chip Fab making the supercomputer is

1804
00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:23,700
chip Fab making the supercomputer is
 

1805
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:25,849
chip Fab making the supercomputer is
placing about 10 to the 10 transistors a

while you're digesting your lunch right
 

1811
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:31,670
while you're digesting your lunch right
now you're make you're placing about 10

1812
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:31,680
now you're make you're placing about 10
 

1813

um there's an eight order of magnitude

1816
00:36:37,310 --> 00:36:37,320
um there's an eight order of magnitude
 

1817
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,950
um there's an eight order of magnitude
difference not so in computational

1820
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:42,240
capacity it's done we've caught up
 

1821
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,270
capacity it's done we've caught up
but there's eight orders of magnitude

1822
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:44,280
but there's eight orders of magnitude
 

1823
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,670
but there's eight orders of magnitude
difference in the rate at which biology

1824
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:46,680

and that distinction is what we're

1830
00:36:52,490 --> 00:36:52,500
and that distinction is what we're
 

1831
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:55,730
and that distinction is what we're
talking about that distinction is not

1832
00:36:55,730 --> 00:36:55,740
talking about that distinction is not
 

1833
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:58,130
talking about that distinction is not
analog but this deep sense of digital

1834
00:36:58,130 --> 00:36:58,140
analog but this deep sense of digital
 

1835
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:00,530

construction so a description doesn't

1838
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:02,220
construction so a description doesn't
 

1839
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,829
construction so a description doesn't
describe a thing but the description

1840
00:37:03,829 --> 00:37:03,839
describe a thing but the description
 

1841
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:06,170
describe a thing but the description
becomes the thing so you're saying I

1842
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:06,180
becomes the thing so you're saying I
 

1843
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:07,670
becomes the thing so you're saying I
mean this is one of the cases you're

1844
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:07,680
mean this is one of the cases you're
 

1845
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,410
mean this is one of the cases you're
making and that this is this third

and you're anticipating we're going to

1854
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:20,040
and you're anticipating we're going to
 

1855
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:22,670
and you're anticipating we're going to
see that in digital fabrication can you

1856
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:22,680
see that in digital fabrication can you
 

1857
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,170
see that in digital fabrication can you
actually first of all describe what you

1858
00:37:24,170 --> 00:37:24,180
actually first of all describe what you
 

1859
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:27,050
actually first of all describe what you
mean by this term digital fabrication so

1860
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:27,060
mean by this term digital fabrication so
 

1861
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:28,970
mean by this term digital fabrication so
the Casual meaning is the computer

1862
00:37:28,970 --> 00:37:28,980
the Casual meaning is the computer
 

1863
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:31,730
the Casual meaning is the computer
controls the tool to make something and

1864
00:37:31,730 --> 00:37:31,740
controls the tool to make something and
 

1865
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:34,190
controls the tool to make something and
that was invented when MIT stole it in

1866
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:34,200
that was invented when MIT stole it in
 

1867
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:37,849
that was invented when MIT stole it in
1952. yeah um there's the deep meaning

1868
00:37:37,849 --> 00:37:37,859
1952. yeah um there's the deep meaning
 

1869
00:37:37,859 --> 00:37:40,130
1952. yeah um there's the deep meaning
of what the ribosome does of a

1870
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:40,140
of what the ribosome does of a

1874
00:37:45,829 --> 00:37:45,839
description doesn't describe a thing a
 

1875
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:47,569
description doesn't describe a thing a
digital description becomes the thing

1876
00:37:47,569 --> 00:37:47,579
digital description becomes the thing
 

1877
00:37:47,579 --> 00:37:50,450
digital description becomes the thing
yeah that's where the that's that's the

1878
00:37:50,450 --> 00:37:50,460
yeah that's where the that's that's the
 

1879
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:52,790
yeah that's where the that's that's the
path to the Star Trek replicator

1880
00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:52,800
path to the Star Trek replicator
 

1881
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,130
path to the Star Trek replicator
and that's the thing that doesn't exist

1882
00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:55,140
and that's the thing that doesn't exist
 

1883
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:56,089
and that's the thing that doesn't exist
yet

1884
00:37:56,089 --> 00:37:56,099
yet
 

1885
00:37:56,099 --> 00:37:58,130
yet
now I think the the best way to

1886
00:37:58,130 --> 00:37:58,140
now I think the the best way to
 

1887
00:37:58,140 --> 00:37:59,930
now I think the the best way to
understand what this roadmap looks like

1888
00:37:59,930 --> 00:37:59,940
understand what this roadmap looks like
 

1889
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:03,950
understand what this roadmap looks like
is to now bring in Fab labs and how they

1890
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:03,960
is to now bring in Fab labs and how they
 

1891
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,750
is to now bring in Fab labs and how they
relate to all of this what are Fab Labs

1892
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:05,760
relate to all of this what are Fab Labs
 

1893
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,870
relate to all of this what are Fab Labs
so here here's a sequence

1894
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:08,880
so here here's a sequence
 

1895
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,849
so here here's a sequence
um with colleagues I accidentally

1896
00:38:10,849 --> 00:38:10,859
um with colleagues I accidentally
 

1897
00:38:10,859 --> 00:38:14,450
um with colleagues I accidentally
started a network of what's now 2500

1898
00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:14,460
started a network of what's now 2500

00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,650
here's the sequence
uh we started Center for bits and atoms

1912
00:38:30,650 --> 00:38:30,660
uh we started Center for bits and atoms
 

1913
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:32,870
uh we started Center for bits and atoms
to do the kind of research we're talking

1914
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:32,880
to do the kind of research we're talking
 

1915
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,630
to do the kind of research we're talking
about we had all of these machines and

about we had all of these machines and
 

1917
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:37,609
about we had all of these machines and
then had a problem it would take a

1918
00:38:37,609 --> 00:38:37,619
then had a problem it would take a
 

1919
00:38:37,619 --> 00:38:40,250
then had a problem it would take a
lifetime of classes to learn to use all

1920
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:40,260
lifetime of classes to learn to use all
 

1921
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:41,390
lifetime of classes to learn to use all
the machines

1922
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:41,400
the machines
 

1923
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,250
the machines
so with

1924
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:43,260
so with
 

1925
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:45,589
so with
you know colleagues who helped start CBA

1926
00:38:45,589 --> 00:38:45,599
you know colleagues who helped start CBA
 

1927
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:47,690

we began a class modestly called how to

1928
00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:47,700
we began a class modestly called how to
 

1929
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,550
we began a class modestly called how to
make almost anything yeah and there's no

1930
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:49,560
make almost anything yeah and there's no
 

1931
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:52,130

big agenda it was just it was aimed at a
 

1933
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:53,390
big agenda it was just it was aimed at a
few research students to use the

1934
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:53,400
few research students to use the
 

1935
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,130
few research students to use the
machines and it were completely

1936
00:38:55,130 --> 00:38:55,140
machines and it were completely
 

1937
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:57,170
machines and it were completely
unprepared for the first time we taught

1938
00:38:57,170 --> 00:38:57,180
unprepared for the first time we taught
 

1939
00:38:57,180 --> 00:39:00,710
unprepared for the first time we taught
it we were swamped by every year since

1940
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:00,720
it we were swamped by every year since
 

1941
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,450

um students would say things like can

1948
00:39:08,270 --> 00:39:08,280
um students would say things like can
 

1949
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,069

you teach this at MIT it seems too
 

1951
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:12,050
you teach this at MIT it seems too
useful it's just how to work these

would teach them all the skills to use
 

1957
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:19,730
would teach them all the skills to use
all these tools and then they would do

1958
00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:19,740
all these tools and then they would do
 

1959
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:21,530
all these tools and then they would do
projects integrating them and they were

Computing became personal so I mentioned

2046
00:40:59,329 --> 00:40:59,339
Computing became personal so I mentioned
 

2047
00:40:59,339 --> 00:41:00,650
Computing became personal so I mentioned
all of that because

2048
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:00,660
all of that because
 

2049
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:02,569
all of that because
I was asking how to do digital

2050
00:41:02,569 --> 00:41:02,579
I was asking how to do digital
 

2051
00:41:02,579 --> 00:41:05,030
I was asking how to do digital
fabrication but not really why the

2052
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:05,040
fabrication but not really why the
 

2053
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:07,010
fabrication but not really why the
students in this how to make class were

2054
00:41:07,010 --> 00:41:07,020
students in this how to make class were
 

2055
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:09,950
students in this how to make class were
showing me that the killer app of

2056
00:41:09,950 --> 00:41:09,960
showing me that the killer app of
 

2057
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,510
showing me that the killer app of
digital fabrication is personal

2058
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:11,520
digital fabrication is personal
 

2059
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,670
digital fabrication is personal
fabrication yeah how do you jump to the

2060
00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:13,680
fabrication yeah how do you jump to the
 

2061
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,890
fabrication yeah how do you jump to the
personal fabrication so Kelly didn't

2062
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:15,900
personal fabrication so Kelly didn't
 

2063
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:17,569
personal fabrication so Kelly didn't
make the screen body because it was for

2064
00:41:17,569 --> 00:41:17,579
make the screen body because it was for
 

2065
00:41:17,579 --> 00:41:19,310
make the screen body because it was for
a thesis she wasn't writing a research

paper it wasn't a business model she
 

2069
00:41:23,339 --> 00:41:24,650
paper it wasn't a business model she
wanted it was because she wanted one

2070
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:24,660
wanted it was because she wanted one
 

2071
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:27,470
wanted it was because she wanted one
yeah it was personal expression going

2072
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:27,480
yeah it was personal expression going
 

2073
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,690
yeah it was personal expression going
back to me and vocational schools

2074
00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:29,700
back to me and vocational schools

was it was punitive but to piso in the
Fab Lab was actually doing all the work

2234
00:44:36,589 --> 00:44:36,599
Fab Lab was actually doing all the work
 

2235
00:44:36,599 --> 00:44:39,530
Fab Lab was actually doing all the work
of my MIT classes and so over and over

2236
00:44:39,530 --> 00:44:39,540
of my MIT classes and so over and over
 

2237
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:42,950
of my MIT classes and so over and over
we found precisely the same kind of

2238
00:44:42,950 --> 00:44:42,960
we found precisely the same kind of
 

2239
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:45,470
we found precisely the same kind of
bright invent of

2240
00:44:45,470 --> 00:44:45,480
bright invent of
 

2241
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:47,150
bright invent of
um creativity

2242
00:44:47,150 --> 00:44:47,160
um creativity
 

2243
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:51,589
um creativity
uh and historically the answer was

2244
00:44:51,589 --> 00:44:51,599
uh and historically the answer was
 

2245
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:53,690
uh and historically the answer was
go you're smart go away it's sort of

2246
00:44:53,690 --> 00:44:53,700
go you're smart go away it's sort of
 

2247
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:56,150
go you're smart go away it's sort of
like me and vocational school but in

00:44:56,150 --> 00:44:56,160
like me and vocational school but in
 

2249
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,250
like me and vocational school but in
this lab Network what we could then do

2250
00:44:58,250 --> 00:44:58,260
this lab Network what we could then do
 

2251
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:00,710
this lab Network what we could then do
is in effect bring the world to them now

2252
00:45:00,710 --> 00:45:00,720
is in effect bring the world to them now
 

2253
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:02,270
is in effect bring the world to them now
let's look at the scaling of all of this

2254
00:45:02,270 --> 00:45:02,280
let's look at the scaling of all of this
 

2255
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:07,970
let's look at the scaling of all of this
so there's one Earth a thousand cities a

2256
00:45:07,970 --> 00:45:07,980
so there's one Earth a thousand cities a
 

2257
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:10,010
so there's one Earth a thousand cities a
million towns a billion people a

2258
00:45:10,010 --> 00:45:10,020
million towns a billion people a
 

2259
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:11,750
million towns a billion people a
trillion things

00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:11,760
trillion things
 

2261
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:14,630
trillion things
there was one Whirlwind computer and my

2262
00:45:14,630 --> 00:45:14,640
there was one Whirlwind computer and my
 

2263
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:16,750
there was one Whirlwind computer and my
teammate uh the first real-time computer

2264
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:16,760
teammate uh the first real-time computer
 

2265
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:20,390
teammate uh the first real-time computer
there were thousands of pdps there were

2266
00:45:20,390 --> 00:45:20,400
there were thousands of pdps there were
 

2267
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,370
there were thousands of pdps there were
millions of hobbyist computers that came

2268
00:45:22,370 --> 00:45:22,380
millions of hobbyist computers that came
 

2269
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:25,069
millions of hobbyist computers that came
from that billions of personal computers

2270
00:45:25,069 --> 00:45:25,079
from that billions of personal computers
 

2271
00:45:25,079 --> 00:45:27,890
from that billions of personal computers
trillions of Internet of things so now

2272
00:45:27,890 --> 00:45:27,900
trillions of Internet of things so now
 

2273
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:31,190
trillions of Internet of things so now
if we look at this Fab Lab story 1952

2274
00:45:31,190 --> 00:45:31,200
if we look at this Fab Lab story 1952
 

2275
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:32,890
if we look at this Fab Lab story 1952
was the NC Mill

2276
00:45:32,890 --> 00:45:32,900
was the NC Mill
 

2277
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:35,930
was the NC Mill
there are now thousands of Fab labs and

2278
00:45:35,930 --> 00:45:35,940
there are now thousands of Fab labs and
 

2279
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:39,890
there are now thousands of Fab labs and
the Fab Lab costs exactly the same cost

2280
00:45:39,890 --> 00:45:39,900
the Fab Lab costs exactly the same cost
 

2281
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:42,829
the Fab Lab costs exactly the same cost
and complexity of the mini computer so

2282
00:45:42,829 --> 00:45:42,839
and complexity of the mini computer so
 

2283
00:45:42,839 --> 00:45:45,470
and complexity of the mini computer so
on the mini computer it it didn't fit in

2284
00:45:45,470 --> 00:45:45,480
on the mini computer it it didn't fit in
 

2285
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:48,410
on the mini computer it it didn't fit in

anything you do with the internet
 

2291
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:55,130
anything you do with the internet
anything you do with a computer today

00:45:55,130 --> 00:45:55,140
anything you do with a computer today
 

2293
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:57,770
anything you do with a computer today
happened at that era because it got on

2294
00:45:57,770 --> 00:45:57,780
happened at that era because it got on
 

2295
00:45:57,780 --> 00:45:59,809
happened at that era because it got on
the scale of a work group not a

in the same way Fab labs are like the

2300
00:46:04,430 --> 00:46:04,440
in the same way Fab labs are like the
 

2301
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:06,109
in the same way Fab labs are like the
mini computers inventing how does the

00:46:06,109 --> 00:46:06,119
mini computers inventing how does the
 

2303
00:46:06,119 --> 00:46:07,809
mini computers inventing how does the
world work if anybody can make anything

2304
00:46:07,809 --> 00:46:07,819
world work if anybody can make anything
 

2305
00:46:07,819 --> 00:46:11,210
world work if anybody can make anything
then if you look at that scaling

2306
00:46:11,210 --> 00:46:11,220
then if you look at that scaling
 

2307
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:14,390
then if you look at that scaling
Fab Labs today are transitioning from

2308
00:46:14,390 --> 00:46:14,400
Fab Labs today are transitioning from
 

2309
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:17,089
Fab Labs today are transitioning from
buying a machine to make machines making

2310
00:46:17,089 --> 00:46:17,099
buying a machine to make machines making
 

2311
00:46:17,099 --> 00:46:19,309
buying a machine to make machines making
machines so we're transitioning to you

2312
00:46:19,309 --> 00:46:19,319
machines so we're transitioning to you
 

2313
00:46:19,319 --> 00:46:21,290
machines so we're transitioning to you
can go to a Fab Lab not to make a

2314
00:46:21,290 --> 00:46:21,300
can go to a Fab Lab not to make a
 

2315
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:23,089
can go to a Fab Lab not to make a
project to make but to make a new

2316
00:46:23,089 --> 00:46:23,099
project to make but to make a new
 

2317
00:46:23,099 --> 00:46:24,230
project to make but to make a new
machine

2318
00:46:24,230 --> 00:46:24,240
machine
 

2319
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:26,569
machine
so we talked about the Deep sense of

2320
00:46:26,569 --> 00:46:26,579
so we talked about the Deep sense of
 

2321
00:46:26,579 --> 00:46:27,950
so we talked about the Deep sense of
self-replication there's a very

2322
00:46:27,950 --> 00:46:27,960
self-replication there's a very
 

2323
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:30,290
self-replication there's a very
practical sense of Fab Lab machines

2324
00:46:30,290 --> 00:46:30,300
practical sense of Fab Lab machines
 

2325
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:32,329
practical sense of Fab Lab machines
making Fab Lab machines

2326
00:46:32,329 --> 00:46:32,339
making Fab Lab machines
 

2327
00:46:32,339 --> 00:46:36,710
making Fab Lab machines
and so that's the equivalent of the uh

2328
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:36,720
and so that's the equivalent of the uh
 

2329
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:39,410
and so that's the equivalent of the uh
hobbyist computer era what it's called

2330
00:46:39,410 --> 00:46:39,420
hobbyist computer era what it's called
 

2331
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:42,530
hobbyist computer era what it's called
the Altair historically then the work we

2332
00:46:42,530 --> 00:46:42,540
the Altair historically then the work we
 

2333
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:43,790
the Altair historically then the work we
spent a while talking about about

2334
00:46:43,790 --> 00:46:43,800
spent a while talking about about
 

2335
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:45,950
spent a while talking about about
assemblers and self-assemblers that's

2336
00:46:45,950 --> 00:46:45,960
assemblers and self-assemblers that's
 

2337
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:48,770
assemblers and self-assemblers that's
the equivalent of smartphones and

2338
00:46:48,770 --> 00:46:48,780
the equivalent of smartphones and
 

2339
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:51,530
the equivalent of smartphones and
internet of things that's when so the

2340
00:46:51,530 --> 00:46:51,540
internet of things that's when so the
 

2341
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:53,750
internet of things that's when so the
the assemblers are like the smartphone

2342
00:46:53,750 --> 00:46:53,760
the assemblers are like the smartphone
 

2343
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:55,490
the assemblers are like the smartphone
where a smartphone today has the

2344
00:46:55,490 --> 00:46:55,500
where a smartphone today has the
 

2345
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:56,750
where a smartphone today has the
capacity of what used to be a

2346
00:46:56,750 --> 00:46:56,760
capacity of what used to be a
 

2347
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:59,470
capacity of what used to be a
supercomputer in your pocket and then

2348
00:46:59,470 --> 00:46:59,480
supercomputer in your pocket and then
 

2349
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:02,750
supercomputer in your pocket and then
the smart thermostat on your wall has

2350
00:47:02,750 --> 00:47:02,760
the smart thermostat on your wall has
 

2351
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:07,010
the smart thermostat on your wall has
the power of the original PDP computer

2352
00:47:07,010 --> 00:47:07,020
the power of the original PDP computer
 

2353
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:09,290
the power of the original PDP computer
not metaphorically but literally and now

2354
00:47:09,290 --> 00:47:09,300
not metaphorically but literally and now
 

2355
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:11,390
not metaphorically but literally and now
there's trillions of those in the same

2356
00:47:11,390 --> 00:47:11,400
there's trillions of those in the same
 

2357
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:13,569
there's trillions of those in the same
sense that when we finally merge

2358
00:47:13,569 --> 00:47:13,579
sense that when we finally merge
 

2359
00:47:13,579 --> 00:47:16,069
sense that when we finally merge
materials with the machines in the

2360
00:47:16,069 --> 00:47:16,079
materials with the machines in the
 

2361
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:17,809
materials with the machines in the
self-assembly that's like the Internet

2362
00:47:17,809 --> 00:47:17,819
self-assembly that's like the Internet
 

2363
00:47:17,819 --> 00:47:20,150
self-assembly that's like the Internet
of Things stage but here's the important

2364
00:47:20,150 --> 00:47:20,160
of Things stage but here's the important
 

2365
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:21,950
of Things stage but here's the important
lesson

2366
00:47:21,950 --> 00:47:21,960
lesson
 

2367
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:24,650
lesson
if you look at the Computing analogy

2368
00:47:24,650 --> 00:47:24,660
if you look at the Computing analogy
 

2369
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:29,210
if you look at the Computing analogy
Computing expanded exponentially but it

2370
00:47:29,210 --> 00:47:29,220
Computing expanded exponentially but it
 

2371
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:32,510
Computing expanded exponentially but it
really didn't fundamentally change the

2372
00:47:32,510 --> 00:47:32,520
really didn't fundamentally change the
 

2373
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:35,510
really didn't fundamentally change the
the core things happened in in that

2374
00:47:35,510 --> 00:47:35,520
the core things happened in in that
 

2375
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:37,370
the core things happened in in that
transition in the mini computer era so

2376
00:47:37,370 --> 00:47:37,380
transition in the mini computer era so
 

2377
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:40,069
transition in the mini computer era so
in the same sense the research now I'm

2378
00:47:40,069 --> 00:47:40,079
in the same sense the research now I'm
 

2379
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:41,630
in the same sense the research now I'm
we spent a while talking about is how we

2380
00:47:41,630 --> 00:47:41,640
we spent a while talking about is how we
 

2381
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:43,490
we spent a while talking about is how we
get to the replicator

2382
00:47:43,490 --> 00:47:43,500
get to the replicator
 

2383
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:46,010
get to the replicator
today you can do all of that if you

2384
00:47:46,010 --> 00:47:46,020
today you can do all of that if you
 

2385
00:47:46,020 --> 00:47:47,510
today you can do all of that if you
close your eyes and view the whole Fab

2386
00:47:47,510 --> 00:47:47,520
close your eyes and view the whole Fab
 

2387
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:50,089
close your eyes and view the whole Fab
Lab as a machine in that room you can

2388
00:47:50,089 --> 00:47:50,099
Lab as a machine in that room you can
 

2389
00:47:50,099 --> 00:47:51,829
Lab as a machine in that room you can
make almost anything but you need a lot

the skills to go into a Fab Lab and make

2438
00:48:50,329 --> 00:48:50,339
the skills to go into a Fab Lab and make
 

2439
00:48:50,339 --> 00:48:52,730
the skills to go into a Fab Lab and make
a machine and so we've started creating

2440
00:48:52,730 --> 00:48:52,740
a machine and so we've started creating
 

2441
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:55,010
a machine and so we've started creating
a network of superfap so the Fab Lab can

2442
00:48:55,010 --> 00:48:55,020
a network of superfap so the Fab Lab can
 

2443
00:48:55,020 --> 00:48:56,390
a network of superfap so the Fab Lab can
make a machine but it can't make a

2444
00:48:56,390 --> 00:48:56,400
make a machine but it can't make a
 

2445
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:57,950
make a machine but it can't make a
number of the Precision parts of the

2446
00:48:57,950 --> 00:48:57,960
number of the Precision parts of the
 

2447
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:00,650
number of the Precision parts of the
machine so in places like Bhutan or

2448
00:49:00,650 --> 00:49:00,660
machine so in places like Bhutan or
 

2449
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:02,630
machine so in places like Bhutan or
Carol in the south of India we started

2450
00:49:02,630 --> 00:49:02,640
Carol in the south of India we started
 

2451
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:04,670
Carol in the south of India we started
creating super Fab Labs that have more

2452
00:49:04,670 --> 00:49:04,680
creating super Fab Labs that have more
 

2453
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:07,309
creating super Fab Labs that have more
advanced tools to make the parts of the

2454
00:49:07,309 --> 00:49:07,319
advanced tools to make the parts of the
 

2455
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:09,230
advanced tools to make the parts of the
machines so that the machines themselves

2456
00:49:09,230 --> 00:49:09,240
machines so that the machines themselves
 

2457
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:11,150
machines so that the machines themselves
become even cheaper

2458
00:49:11,150 --> 00:49:11,160
become even cheaper
 

2459
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:12,250
become even cheaper
so

2460
00:49:12,250 --> 00:49:12,260
so
 

2461
00:49:12,260 --> 00:49:15,410
so
that that is self-reproducing machines

2462
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:15,420
that that is self-reproducing machines
 

2463
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:18,650
that that is self-reproducing machines
but you need to feed it things like

2615
00:52:12,839 --> 00:52:14,150
a it's a fun example of exactly the
thing we're talking about and I've had a

2616
00:52:14,150 --> 00:52:14,160
thing we're talking about and I've had a
 

2617

um and so
 

2623
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:21,589
um and so
um in what I'm describing there's this

2624

00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:01,970
machines I'm I'm asked for example
um you know what what's the killer

2706
00:54:01,970 --> 00:54:01,980
um you know what what's the killer
 

2707
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:04,190
um you know what what's the killer
opportunity you know who's going to make

2708
00:54:04,190 --> 00:54:04,200
opportunity you know who's going to make
 

2709
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:05,510
opportunity you know who's going to make
all the money

2710
00:54:05,510 --> 00:54:05,520
all the money
 

2711
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:07,910
all the money
um who to invest in but if the machine

2712
00:54:07,910 --> 00:54:07,920
um who to invest in but if the machine
 

2713
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:09,950
um who to invest in but if the machine
can make the machine it's not a great

2714
00:54:09,950 --> 00:54:09,960
can make the machine it's not a great
 

2715
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:13,250
can make the machine it's not a great
business to invest in the machine

2716
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:13,260
business to invest in the machine
 

2717
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:16,069
business to invest in the machine
um in the same way that if you can

2718
00:54:16,069 --> 00:54:16,079
um in the same way that if you can
 

2719
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:18,049
um in the same way that if you can
produce if you can think globally but

2720
00:54:18,049 --> 00:54:18,059
produce if you can think globally but
 

2721
00:54:18,059 --> 00:54:20,930
produce if you can think globally but
produce locally then the way the

2722
00:54:20,930 --> 00:54:20,940
produce locally then the way the
 

2723
00:54:20,940 --> 00:54:24,170
produce locally then the way the
technology goes out into society isn't a

2724
00:54:24,170 --> 00:54:24,180
technology goes out into society isn't a
 

2725
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:26,450
technology goes out into society isn't a
function of central control but is

2726
00:54:26,450 --> 00:54:26,460
function of central control but is
 

2727
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:28,730
function of central control but is
fundamentally distributed now that

2728
00:54:28,730 --> 00:54:28,740
fundamentally distributed now that
 

2729
00:54:28,740 --> 00:54:31,790
fundamentally distributed now that
raises an obvious kind of concern which

2730
00:54:31,790 --> 00:54:31,800
raises an obvious kind of concern which
 

2731
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:33,230
raises an obvious kind of concern which
is well doesn't this mean you could make

2732
00:54:33,230 --> 00:54:33,240
is well doesn't this mean you could make
 

2733
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:35,510
is well doesn't this mean you could make
bombs and guns and all of that

2734
00:54:35,510 --> 00:54:35,520
bombs and guns and all of that
 

2735
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:38,270
bombs and guns and all of that
the reason that's much less of a problem

2736
00:54:38,270 --> 00:54:38,280
the reason that's much less of a problem
 

2737
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:41,750
the reason that's much less of a problem
than you would think is making bombs and

2738
00:54:41,750 --> 00:54:41,760
than you would think is making bombs and
 

2739
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:43,910
than you would think is making bombs and
guns and all of that is a very well met

2740
00:54:43,910 --> 00:54:43,920
guns and all of that is a very well met
 

2741
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:47,690
guns and all of that is a very well met
Market need anywhere we go there's a

00:54:47,690 --> 00:54:47,700
Market need anywhere we go there's a
 

2743
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:49,790
Market need anywhere we go there's a
fine supply chain for weapons now

2744
00:54:49,790 --> 00:54:49,800
fine supply chain for weapons now
 

2745
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:51,589
fine supply chain for weapons now
hobbyists have been making guns for ages

2746
00:54:51,589 --> 00:54:51,599
hobbyists have been making guns for ages
 

2747
00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:53,450
hobbyists have been making guns for ages
and guns are available just about

2748
00:54:53,450 --> 00:54:53,460
and guns are available just about
 

2749
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:55,490
and guns are available just about
anywhere so you could go into the lab

2750
00:54:55,490 --> 00:54:55,500
anywhere so you could go into the lab
 

2751
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:57,290
anywhere so you could go into the lab
and make a gun today it's not a very

2752
00:54:57,290 --> 00:54:57,300
and make a gun today it's not a very
 

2753
00:54:57,300 --> 00:54:59,750
and make a gun today it's not a very
good gun and guns are easily available

2754
00:54:59,750 --> 00:54:59,760
good gun and guns are easily available
 

2755
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:02,329
good gun and guns are easily available
and so generally we run these lab in war

2756
00:55:02,329 --> 00:55:02,339
and so generally we run these lab in war
 

2757
00:55:02,339 --> 00:55:05,150
and so generally we run these lab in war
zones what we find is

people don't go to them to make weapons

2760
00:55:08,089 --> 00:55:08,099
people don't go to them to make weapons
 

2761
00:55:08,099 --> 00:55:09,950
people don't go to them to make weapons
which you can already do anyway it's an

00:55:09,950 --> 00:55:09,960
which you can already do anyway it's an
 

2763
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:11,870
which you can already do anyway it's an
alternative to making weapons it coming

00:55:16,309 --> 00:55:16,319
most important thing I've learned is
 

2769
00:55:16,319 --> 00:55:18,710
most important thing I've learned is
the greatest natural resource of the

the greatest natural resource of the
 

2771
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:21,890
the greatest natural resource of the
planet is this amazing density of

00:55:33,770 --> 00:55:33,780
the capacity for them and so it you know
 

2783
00:55:33,780 --> 00:55:35,990
the capacity for them and so it you know
in the end the way this is going to

and control it's how the world uses it
 

2789
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:43,609
and control it's how the world uses it
and it's been really gratifying for me

2790
00:55:43,609 --> 00:55:43,619
and it's been really gratifying for me
 

2791
00:55:43,619 --> 00:55:46,370
and it's been really gratifying for me
to see just how it does yeah but what

00:55:46,370 --> 00:55:46,380
to see just how it does yeah but what
 

2793
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:48,770
to see just how it does yeah but what
are the different ways uh the evolution

2794
00:55:48,770 --> 00:55:48,780
are the different ways uh the evolution
 

2795
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:51,470
are the different ways uh the evolution

well first let me start with a

2818
00:56:16,549 --> 00:56:16,559
well first let me start with a
 

2819
00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:19,210
well first let me start with a
benevolent story which is

2820
00:56:19,210 --> 00:56:19,220
benevolent story which is
 

2821
00:56:19,220 --> 00:56:24,589
benevolent story which is
uh trash is an analog concept there's no

2822
00:56:24,589 --> 00:56:24,599
uh trash is an analog concept there's no
 

2823
00:56:24,599 --> 00:56:26,690
uh trash is an analog concept there's no
trash in a forest all the parts get

00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:29,809
trash in a forest all the parts get
disassembled and reused trash means

2826
00:56:29,809 --> 00:56:29,819
disassembled and reused trash means
 

2827
00:56:29,819 --> 00:56:30,829
disassembled and reused trash means
something doesn't have enough

2828
00:56:30,829 --> 00:56:30,839
something doesn't have enough
 

2829

information to tell you how to reuse it
 

2831
00:56:33,180 --> 00:56:36,470
information to tell you how to reuse it
yeah it's as simple as there's no trash

2832
00:56:36,470 --> 00:56:36,480
yeah it's as simple as there's no trash

and there's a couple claims to the
 

2919
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:22,490

don't have to cut away the material you

2924
00:58:25,670 --> 00:58:25,680
don't have to cut away the material you
 

2925
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:27,049
don't have to cut away the material you
don't need you just put material where

2926
00:58:27,049 --> 00:58:27,059
don't need you just put material where
 

2927
00:58:27,059 --> 00:58:28,609
don't need you just put material where
you do need it and so that's the 3D

2928
00:58:28,609 --> 00:58:28,619
you do need it and so that's the 3D
 

2929
00:58:28,619 --> 00:58:31,069
you do need it and so that's the 3D
printing Revolution but

think of anything more important than
 

3007
00:59:59,700 --> 01:00:02,510

was
 

3011
01:00:04,619 --> 01:00:06,950
was
um because if we rely on like

um because if we rely on like
 

3013
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:09,109
um because if we rely on like
informational superiority in the

can make biotechnology somebody could

3128
01:02:26,210 --> 01:02:26,220
can make biotechnology somebody could

learn to make a virus that's scary that
 

3131
01:02:30,420 --> 01:02:32,690
learn to make a virus that's scary that
that's unlike some of the things I said

3132
01:02:32,690 --> 01:02:32,700
that's unlike some of the things I said
 

3133
01:02:32,700 --> 01:02:35,030
that's unlike some of the things I said
I don't worry about that's something I

3134
01:02:35,030 --> 01:02:35,040
I don't worry about that's something I
 

3135
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:37,970
I don't worry about that's something I
really worry about that is scary now how

3136
01:02:37,970 --> 01:02:37,980
really worry about that is scary now how
 

3137
01:02:37,980 --> 01:02:40,329
really worry about that is scary now how
do you deal with that uh

3138
01:02:40,329 --> 01:02:40,339
do you deal with that uh
 

3139
01:02:40,339 --> 01:02:43,510
do you deal with that uh
prior threats we dealt with

3140
01:02:43,510 --> 01:02:43,520
prior threats we dealt with
 

3141
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:45,650
prior threats we dealt with
command and control

3142

command and control
 

3143
01:02:45,660 --> 01:02:48,789
command and control
so like uh

3144
01:02:48,789 --> 01:02:48,799
so like uh
 

3145
01:02:48,799 --> 01:02:52,130
so like uh
early color copiers had unique codes and

3146
01:02:52,130 --> 01:02:52,140
early color copiers had unique codes and
 

3147
01:02:52,140 --> 01:02:53,569
early color copiers had unique codes and
you could tell which copier made them

3148
01:02:53,569 --> 01:02:53,579
you could tell which copier made them
 

3149
01:02:53,579 --> 01:02:55,130
you could tell which copier made them
eventually you couldn't keep up with

3150
01:02:55,130 --> 01:02:55,140
eventually you couldn't keep up with
 

3151
01:02:55,140 --> 01:02:58,370
eventually you couldn't keep up with
that uh there there was a famous meeting

3152
01:02:58,370 --> 01:02:58,380
that uh there there was a famous meeting
 

3153
01:02:58,380 --> 01:03:00,650
that uh there there was a famous meeting
at asilamar in the early days of

3154
01:03:00,650 --> 01:03:00,660
at asilamar in the early days of
 

3155
01:03:00,660 --> 01:03:04,870
at asilamar in the early days of
recombinant DNA where that Community

3156
01:03:04,870 --> 01:03:04,880
recombinant DNA where that Community
 

3157
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:07,130
recombinant DNA where that Community
recognized the dangers of what it was

3158
01:03:07,130 --> 01:03:07,140
recognized the dangers of what it was
 

3159
01:03:07,140 --> 01:03:10,190
recognized the dangers of what it was
doing and put in place a regime to help

3160
01:03:10,190 --> 01:03:10,200
doing and put in place a regime to help
 

3161
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:12,890
doing and put in place a regime to help
manage it and so that led to the kind of

3162
01:03:12,890 --> 01:03:12,900
manage it and so that led to the kind of
 

3163
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:15,710
manage it and so that led to the kind of
research management so you know MIT has

3164
01:03:15,710 --> 01:03:15,720
research management so you know MIT has
 

3165
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:18,230
research management so you know MIT has
an office that supervises research and

3166
01:03:18,230 --> 01:03:18,240
an office that supervises research and
 

3167
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:20,150
an office that supervises research and
it works with the national office that

3168
01:03:20,150 --> 01:03:20,160
it works with the national office that
 

3169
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:22,190
it works with the national office that
works if you can identify who's doing it

3170
01:03:22,190 --> 01:03:22,200
works if you can identify who's doing it
 

3171
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:24,710
works if you can identify who's doing it
and where it doesn't work in this world

3172
01:03:24,710 --> 01:03:24,720
and where it doesn't work in this world
 

3173
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:26,270
and where it doesn't work in this world
we're describing

3174
01:03:26,270 --> 01:03:26,280
we're describing
 

3175
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:29,510
we're describing
so anybody could do this anywhere and so

3176
01:03:29,510 --> 01:03:29,520
so anybody could do this anywhere and so
 

3177
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:33,589
so anybody could do this anywhere and so
what we found is you can't

3178
01:03:33,589 --> 01:03:33,599
what we found is you can't
 

3179
01:03:33,599 --> 01:03:36,410
what we found is you can't
contain this it's already L you can't

3180
01:03:36,410 --> 01:03:36,420
contain this it's already L you can't
 

3181
01:03:36,420 --> 01:03:38,329
contain this it's already L you can't
forbid because there isn't command and

3182
01:03:38,329 --> 01:03:38,339
forbid because there isn't command and
 

3183
01:03:38,339 --> 01:03:41,210
forbid because there isn't command and
control the most useful thing you can do

3184
01:03:41,210 --> 01:03:41,220
control the most useful thing you can do
 

3185
01:03:41,220 --> 01:03:43,910
control the most useful thing you can do
is provide incentives for transparency

3186
01:03:43,910 --> 01:03:43,920
is provide incentives for transparency
 

3187
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:47,270
is provide incentives for transparency
yes so but really the heart of what we

3188
01:03:47,270 --> 01:03:47,280
yes so but really the heart of what we
 

3189
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:50,990
yes so but really the heart of what we
do is you could do this by yourself in a

3190
01:03:50,990 --> 01:03:51,000
do is you could do this by yourself in a
 

3191
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:54,289
do is you could do this by yourself in a
basement for nefarious reasons or you

3192
01:03:54,289 --> 01:03:54,299
basement for nefarious reasons or you
 

3193
01:03:54,299 --> 01:03:55,970
basement for nefarious reasons or you
could come into a place in the light

3194
01:03:55,970 --> 01:03:55,980
could come into a place in the light
 

3195
01:03:55,980 --> 01:03:57,650
could come into a place in the light
where you get help and you get community

3196
01:03:57,650 --> 01:03:57,660
where you get help and you get community
 

3197
01:03:57,660 --> 01:04:00,230
where you get help and you get community
and you get resources and there's an

3198
01:04:00,230 --> 01:04:00,240
and you get resources and there's an
 

3199
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:02,930
and you get resources and there's an
incentive to do it in the open not in

3200
01:04:02,930 --> 01:04:02,940
incentive to do it in the open not in
 

3201
01:04:02,940 --> 01:04:06,789
incentive to do it in the open not in
the dark and that might sound naive but

3202
01:04:06,789 --> 01:04:06,799
the dark and that might sound naive but
 

3203
01:04:06,799 --> 01:04:10,370
the dark and that might sound naive but
in the sort of places we're working oh

3204
01:04:10,370 --> 01:04:10,380
in the sort of places we're working oh
 

3205
01:04:10,380 --> 01:04:12,289
in the sort of places we're working oh
you know

3206
01:04:12,289 --> 01:04:12,299
you know
 

3207
01:04:12,299 --> 01:04:15,230
you know
um again bad people do bad things in

3208
01:04:15,230 --> 01:04:15,240
um again bad people do bad things in
 

3209
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:18,410
um again bad people do bad things in
these places already but providing

3210
01:04:18,410 --> 01:04:18,420
these places already but providing
 

3211
01:04:18,420 --> 01:04:21,289
these places already but providing
openness and providing transparency is a

3212
01:04:21,289 --> 01:04:21,299
openness and providing transparency is a
 

3213
01:04:21,299 --> 01:04:23,690
openness and providing transparency is a
key part of managing these and so it it

3214
01:04:23,690 --> 01:04:23,700
key part of managing these and so it it
 

3215
01:04:23,700 --> 01:04:26,210
key part of managing these and so it it
transitions from regulating risks as

3216
01:04:26,210 --> 01:04:26,220
transitions from regulating risks as
 

3217
01:04:26,220 --> 01:04:29,270
transitions from regulating risks as
regulation to to soft power to manage

3218
01:04:29,270 --> 01:04:29,280
regulation to to soft power to manage
 

3219
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:31,849
regulation to to soft power to manage
them so there's so much potential for

3220
01:04:31,849 --> 01:04:31,859
them so there's so much potential for
 

3221
01:04:31,859 --> 01:04:34,910
them so there's so much potential for
good so much capacity for good that Fab

3222
01:04:34,910 --> 01:04:34,920
good so much capacity for good that Fab
 

3223
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:39,289
good so much capacity for good that Fab
labs and the uh the the ability

3224
01:04:39,289 --> 01:04:39,299
labs and the uh the the ability
 

3225
01:04:39,299 --> 01:04:41,450
labs and the uh the the ability
um and the tools of creation really

3226
01:04:41,450 --> 01:04:41,460
um and the tools of creation really
 

3227
01:04:41,460 --> 01:04:44,089
um and the tools of creation really
unlock that potential

3228
01:04:44,089 --> 01:04:44,099
unlock that potential
 

3229
01:04:44,099 --> 01:04:47,150
unlock that potential
yeah and I don't say that as sort of

3230
01:04:47,150 --> 01:04:47,160
yeah and I don't say that as sort of
 

3231
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:49,609
yeah and I don't say that as sort of
dewey-eyed naive I say that empirically

3232
01:04:49,609 --> 01:04:49,619
dewey-eyed naive I say that empirically
 

3233
01:04:49,619 --> 01:04:52,010
dewey-eyed naive I say that empirically
from just years of seeing how this plays

3234
01:04:52,010 --> 01:04:52,020
from just years of seeing how this plays
 

3235
01:04:52,020 --> 01:04:53,569
from just years of seeing how this plays
out in communities I wonder if it's the

3236
01:04:53,569 --> 01:04:53,579
out in communities I wonder if it's the
 

3237
01:04:53,579 --> 01:04:55,130
out in communities I wonder if it's the
early days of personal computers though

3238
01:04:55,130 --> 01:04:55,140
early days of personal computers though
 

3239
01:04:55,140 --> 01:04:59,630
early days of personal computers though
before we get spam right in the end most

3240
01:04:59,630 --> 01:04:59,640
before we get spam right in the end most
 

3241
01:04:59,640 --> 01:05:01,630
before we get spam right in the end most
fundamentally

01:05:01,630 --> 01:05:01,640
fundamentally
 

3243
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:05,270
fundamentally
literally the mother of all problems

3244
01:05:05,270 --> 01:05:05,280
literally the mother of all problems
 

3245
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:07,430
literally the mother of all problems
is

3246
01:05:07,430 --> 01:05:07,440
is

01:05:13,370 --> 01:05:13,380
who designed us so so assume

01:05:13,380 --> 01:05:15,049
who designed us so so assume
success and that we're going to

01:05:15,049 --> 01:05:15,059
success and that we're going to

01:05:16,250 --> 01:05:16,260
transition to the machines making
 

3253
01:05:16,260 --> 01:05:19,010
transition to the machines making
machines and all of these new sort of

01:05:19,010 --> 01:05:19,020
machines and all of these new sort of
 

3255
01:05:19,020 --> 01:05:20,690
machines and all of these new sort of
social systems we're describing will

3256
01:05:20,690 --> 01:05:20,700
social systems we're describing will
 

3257
01:05:20,700 --> 01:05:22,549
social systems we're describing will
help manage them and curate them and

3258
01:05:22,549 --> 01:05:22,559
help manage them and curate them and
 

3259
01:05:22,559 --> 01:05:24,490
help manage them and curate them and
democratize them

3260
01:05:24,490 --> 01:05:24,500
democratize them
 

3261
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:28,730
democratize them
if we close the gap I just let off with

3262
01:05:28,730 --> 01:05:28,740
if we close the gap I just let off with
 

3263
01:05:28,740 --> 01:05:31,849
if we close the gap I just let off with
of 10 to the 10 to 10 to the 18 between

3264
01:05:31,849 --> 01:05:31,859
of 10 to the 10 to 10 to the 18 between
 

3265
01:05:31,859 --> 01:05:34,549

01:05:34,549 --> 01:05:34,559
chip Fab and you
 

3267
01:05:34,559 --> 01:05:37,250
chip Fab and you
um we're ultimately in marrying

3268
01:05:37,250 --> 01:05:37,260
um we're ultimately in marrying
 

3269
01:05:37,260 --> 01:05:38,750
um we're ultimately in marrying
communication computation and

3270
01:05:38,750 --> 01:05:38,760
communication computation and
 

3271
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:40,309
communication computation and
Fabrication going to be able to create

3272
01:05:40,309 --> 01:05:40,319
Fabrication going to be able to create
 

3273
01:05:40,319 --> 01:05:44,030
Fabrication going to be able to create
unimaginable complexity

3274
01:05:44,030 --> 01:05:44,040

 

3275
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:48,109

um and how do you design that

3276
01:05:48,109 --> 01:05:48,119
um and how do you design that
 

3277
01:05:48,119 --> 01:05:50,569
um and how do you design that
and so I'd say

3278
01:05:50,569 --> 01:05:50,579
and so I'd say
 

3279
01:05:50,579 --> 01:05:54,410
and so I'd say
the deepest of all questions that I've

3280
01:05:54,410 --> 01:05:54,420
the deepest of all questions that I've
 

3281
01:05:54,420 --> 01:05:55,970
the deepest of all questions that I've
been working on

3282
01:05:55,970 --> 01:05:55,980
been working on
 

3283
01:05:55,980 --> 01:05:57,589
been working on
is

3284
01:05:57,589 --> 01:05:57,599
is
 

3285
01:05:57,599 --> 01:05:59,569
is
goes back to the oldest part of our

3286
01:05:59,569 --> 01:05:59,579
goes back to the oldest part of our
 

3287
01:05:59,579 --> 01:06:02,170
goes back to the oldest part of our
genome so

3288
01:06:02,170 --> 01:06:02,180
genome so
 

3289
01:06:02,180 --> 01:06:05,530
genome so
in our genome what are called Hox genes

3290
01:06:05,530 --> 01:06:05,540
in our genome what are called Hox genes
 

3291
01:06:05,540 --> 01:06:10,370
in our genome what are called Hox genes
and these are morphogenes

3292
01:06:10,370 --> 01:06:10,380
and these are morphogenes
 

3293
01:06:10,380 --> 01:06:12,650
and these are morphogenes
and

3294
01:06:12,650 --> 01:06:12,660
and
 

3295
01:06:12,660 --> 01:06:15,710
and
nowhere in your genome is the number

3296
01:06:15,710 --> 01:06:15,720
nowhere in your genome is the number
 

3297
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:17,750
nowhere in your genome is the number
five it doesn't store the fact that you

3298
01:06:17,750 --> 01:06:17,760
five it doesn't store the fact that you
 

3299
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:19,670
five it doesn't store the fact that you
have five fingers

3300
01:06:19,670 --> 01:06:19,680
have five fingers
 

3301
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:21,109
have five fingers
um what it stores is What's called the

3302
01:06:21,109 --> 01:06:21,119
um what it stores is What's called the
 

3303
01:06:21,119 --> 01:06:23,390
um what it stores is What's called the
developmental program it's a series of

3304
01:06:23,390 --> 01:06:23,400
developmental program it's a series of
 

3305
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:25,789
developmental program it's a series of
steps and the steps have the character

3306
01:06:25,789 --> 01:06:25,799
steps and the steps have the character
 

3307
01:06:25,799 --> 01:06:28,789
steps and the steps have the character
of like grow up a gradient or break

3308
01:06:28,789 --> 01:06:28,799
of like grow up a gradient or break
 

3309
01:06:28,799 --> 01:06:30,230
of like grow up a gradient or break
symmetry

3310
01:06:30,230 --> 01:06:30,240
symmetry
 

3311
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:32,210
symmetry
and at the end of that developmental

3312
01:06:32,210 --> 01:06:32,220
and at the end of that developmental
 

3313
01:06:32,220 --> 01:06:34,370
and at the end of that developmental
program you have five fingers

3314
01:06:34,370 --> 01:06:34,380
program you have five fingers
 

3315
01:06:34,380 --> 01:06:35,750
program you have five fingers
so

3316
01:06:35,750 --> 01:06:35,760
so
 

3317
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:41,150
so
you are stored not as a body plan

3318
01:06:41,150 --> 01:06:41,160
you are stored not as a body plan
 

3319
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:45,470
you are stored not as a body plan
but as a growth Plan and there's two

3320
01:06:45,470 --> 01:06:45,480
but as a growth Plan and there's two
 

3321
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:48,589
but as a growth Plan and there's two
reasons for that one reason is just

3322
01:06:48,589 --> 01:06:48,599
reasons for that one reason is just
 

3323
01:06:48,599 --> 01:06:51,950
reasons for that one reason is just
compression billions of genes can place

3324
01:06:51,950 --> 01:06:51,960
compression billions of genes can place
 

3325
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:54,950
compression billions of genes can place
trillions of cells but the much deeper

3326
01:06:54,950 --> 01:06:54,960
trillions of cells but the much deeper
 

3327
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:58,990
trillions of cells but the much deeper
one is evolution doesn't randomly

3328
01:06:58,990 --> 01:06:59,000
one is evolution doesn't randomly
 

3329
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:02,029
one is evolution doesn't randomly
perturb almost anything you did randomly

3330
01:07:02,029 --> 01:07:02,039
perturb almost anything you did randomly
 

3331
01:07:02,039 --> 01:07:04,490
perturb almost anything you did randomly
in the genome would be fatal or

3332
01:07:04,490 --> 01:07:04,500
in the genome would be fatal or
 

3333
01:07:04,500 --> 01:07:07,309
in the genome would be fatal or
inconsequential but not interesting but

3334
01:07:07,309 --> 01:07:07,319
inconsequential but not interesting but
 

3335
01:07:07,319 --> 01:07:09,470
inconsequential but not interesting but
when you modify things in these

3336
01:07:09,470 --> 01:07:09,480
when you modify things in these
 

3337
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:12,049
when you modify things in these
developmental programs you go from like

3338
01:07:12,049 --> 01:07:12,059

in part it was the scaling we talked

3348
01:07:29,150 --> 01:07:29,160
in part it was the scaling we talked
 

3349
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:30,470
in part it was the scaling we talked
about a while ago

3350
01:07:30,470 --> 01:07:30,480
about a while ago
 

3351
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:33,829
about a while ago
and in part it was the representations

3352
01:07:33,829 --> 01:07:33,839
and in part it was the representations
 

3353
01:07:33,839 --> 01:07:37,930
and in part it was the representations
for which search is effective

AI has found good representations it

3356
01:07:41,390 --> 01:07:41,400
AI has found good representations it
 

3357
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:43,309
AI has found good representations it
hasn't found new ways to search but it's

3358
01:07:43,309 --> 01:07:43,319
hasn't found new ways to search but it's
 

3359
01:07:43,319 --> 01:07:45,770
hasn't found new ways to search but it's
found good representations of search and

3360
01:07:45,770 --> 01:07:45,780
found good representations of search and
 

3361
01:07:45,780 --> 01:07:47,210
found good representations of search and
that's you're saying that's what biology

3362
01:07:47,210 --> 01:07:47,220
that's you're saying that's what biology
 

3363
01:07:47,220 --> 01:07:50,270
that's you're saying that's what biology
that's what evolution has done is

01:07:50,270 --> 01:07:50,280
that's what evolution has done is

molecular intelligence it's AI embodied
 

3379
01:08:10,260 --> 01:08:14,150
molecular intelligence it's AI embodied
in our genome it it it it's every bit as

01:08:14,150 --> 01:08:14,160
in our genome it it it it's every bit as
 

3381
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:16,370
in our genome it it it it's every bit as

3382
01:08:16,370 --> 01:08:16,380
profound as the cognition in our brain
 

3383
01:08:16,380 --> 01:08:18,829
profound as the cognition in our brain
but now this is sort of thinking in

3384
01:08:18,829 --> 01:08:18,839
but now this is sort of thinking in
 

3385
01:08:18,839 --> 01:08:22,309
but now this is sort of thinking in
molecular thinking in how you design

3386
01:08:22,309 --> 01:08:22,319
molecular thinking in how you design
 

3387
01:08:22,319 --> 01:08:24,050
molecular thinking in how you design
and so

3388
01:08:24,050 --> 01:08:24,060
and so
 

3389
01:08:24,060 --> 01:08:26,150
and so
um I'd say the most fundamental problem

3390
01:08:26,150 --> 01:08:26,160
um I'd say the most fundamental problem
 

3391
01:08:26,160 --> 01:08:28,789
um I'd say the most fundamental problem
we're working on is it's kind of

3392
01:08:28,789 --> 01:08:28,799
we're working on is it's kind of
 

3393
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:30,829
we're working on is it's kind of
tautological that when you design a

3394
01:08:30,829 --> 01:08:30,839
tautological that when you design a
 

3395
01:08:30,839 --> 01:08:31,910
tautological that when you design a
phone

3396
01:08:31,910 --> 01:08:31,920
phone
 

3397
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:34,249
phone
you design the phone you represent the

3398
01:08:34,249 --> 01:08:34,259
you design the phone you represent the
 

3399
01:08:34,259 --> 01:08:36,110
you design the phone you represent the
design of the phone but that actually

3400
01:08:36,110 --> 01:08:36,120
design of the phone but that actually
 

3401
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:38,150
design of the phone but that actually
fails when you get to the sort of

3402
01:08:38,150 --> 01:08:38,160
fails when you get to the sort of
 

3403
01:08:38,160 --> 01:08:40,729
fails when you get to the sort of
complexity that we're talking about and

3404
01:08:40,729 --> 01:08:40,739
complexity that we're talking about and
 

3405
01:08:40,739 --> 01:08:42,950
complexity that we're talking about and
so there's this profound transition to

3406
01:08:42,950 --> 01:08:42,960
so there's this profound transition to
 

3407
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:45,289
so there's this profound transition to
come once I can have self-readressing

3408
01:08:45,289 --> 01:08:45,299
come once I can have self-readressing

01:08:45,299 --> 01:08:49,370
come once I can have self-readressing

um you need to not sort of

3412
01:08:52,150 --> 01:08:52,160
um you need to not sort of
 

3413
01:08:52,160 --> 01:08:55,070
um you need to not sort of

3414
01:08:55,070 --> 01:08:55,080
metaphorically but create life

in that you need to learn how to evolve

3416
01:08:58,130 --> 01:08:58,140
in that you need to learn how to evolve
 

3417
01:08:58,140 --> 01:09:01,249
in that you need to learn how to evolve
but evolutionary design has a really

3418
01:09:01,249 --> 01:09:01,259
but evolutionary design has a really
 

3419
01:09:01,259 --> 01:09:05,269
but evolutionary design has a really

01:10:01,550 --> 01:10:01,560
does biology work and then I'm going to
 

3463
01:10:01,560 --> 01:10:04,910
does biology work and then I'm going to
copy it I start from how to solve

01:10:04,910 --> 01:10:04,920
copy it I start from how to solve
 

3465
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:08,450
copy it I start from how to solve

problems and then it it leads me to in a
 

3467
01:10:08,460 --> 01:10:10,310

sense ReDiscover biology so if we go

3468
01:10:10,310 --> 01:10:10,320
sense ReDiscover biology so if we go

3495
01:10:44,280 --> 01:10:47,570
have a machine shop
so it is it it's sort of how how you do

3496
01:10:47,570 --> 01:10:47,580
so it is it it's sort of how how you do
 

3497
01:10:47,580 --> 01:10:49,630
so it is it it's sort of how how you do
your own personal Industrial Revolution

3498
01:10:49,630 --> 01:10:49,640
your own personal Industrial Revolution
 

3499
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:53,510

3501
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:55,729
uh isru is what NASA calls in-situ
resource utilization and that's how do

3502
01:10:55,729 --> 01:10:55,739
resource utilization and that's how do
 

3503
01:10:55,739 --> 01:10:58,189
resource utilization and that's how do
you go to a planet and create a

01:11:12,300 --> 01:11:15,290
you the minimum building blocks for a
civilization is

3518
01:11:15,290 --> 01:11:15,300
civilization is
 

3519
01:11:15,300 --> 01:11:17,750
civilization is
roughly 20 parts so what's interesting

3520
01:11:17,750 --> 01:11:17,760
roughly 20 parts so what's interesting
 

3521
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:19,430
roughly 20 parts so what's interesting
about the amino acids is they're not

3522
01:11:19,430 --> 01:11:19,440
about the amino acids is they're not
 

3523
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:21,530
about the amino acids is they're not
interesting they're hydrophobic or

3524
01:11:21,530 --> 01:11:21,540
interesting they're hydrophobic or
 

3525
01:11:21,540 --> 01:11:24,350
interesting they're hydrophobic or
hydrophilic basic or acidic they have

3526
01:11:24,350 --> 01:11:24,360
hydrophilic basic or acidic they have
 

3527
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:26,689
hydrophilic basic or acidic they have
typical but not extremal properties but

3528
01:11:26,689 --> 01:11:26,699
typical but not extremal properties but
 

3529
01:11:26,699 --> 01:11:28,130
typical but not extremal properties but
they're good enough you can combine them

3530
01:11:28,130 --> 01:11:28,140
they're good enough you can combine them
 

3531
01:11:28,140 --> 01:11:29,630
they're good enough you can combine them
to make you

3532
01:11:29,630 --> 01:11:29,640
to make you
 

3533
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:32,270
to make you
so what this is leading towards is

3534
01:11:32,270 --> 01:11:32,280
so what this is leading towards is
 

3535
01:11:32,280 --> 01:11:35,630
so what this is leading towards is
technology doesn't need enormous Global

3536
01:11:35,630 --> 01:11:35,640
technology doesn't need enormous Global
 

3537
01:11:35,640 --> 01:11:38,330
technology doesn't need enormous Global
Supply chains it just needs about 20

Supply chains it just needs about 20
 

3539
01:11:38,340 --> 01:11:40,970
Supply chains it just needs about 20
properties you can compose to create all

3540
01:11:40,970 --> 01:11:40,980

technology as the minimum building
blocks for a technological civilization

3544
01:11:45,470 --> 01:11:45,480
blocks for a technological civilization
 

3545
01:11:45,480 --> 01:11:48,830
blocks for a technological civilization
so there's going to be 20 basic building

3546
01:11:48,830 --> 01:11:48,840
so there's going to be 20 basic building
 

3547
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:51,350
so there's going to be 20 basic building

01:11:52,970 --> 01:11:52,980
self-replicating assemblers can work
 

3551
01:11:52,980 --> 01:11:55,189
self-replicating assemblers can work
right and I say that not philosophically

3552
01:11:55,189 --> 01:11:55,199
right and I say that not philosophically
 

3553
01:11:55,199 --> 01:11:56,810
right and I say that not philosophically
just empirically sort of that's that

3554
01:11:56,810 --> 01:11:56,820
just empirically sort of that's that
 

3555
01:11:56,820 --> 01:11:59,810
just empirically sort of that's that
that's where it's heading and

3556
01:11:59,810 --> 01:11:59,820
that's where it's heading and
 

3557
01:11:59,820 --> 01:12:02,330
that's where it's heading and
yeah that I like thinking about how you

3558
01:12:02,330 --> 01:12:02,340
yeah that I like thinking about how you
 

3559
01:12:02,340 --> 01:12:04,610
yeah that I like thinking about how you
bootstrap a civilization on Mars that

a neat group of people we talk about it
 

3567
01:12:10,380 --> 01:12:12,050
a neat group of people we talk about it
because it has really profound

um with those
 

3595
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:48,830
um with those
those are enough for us to assemble

3596
01:12:48,830 --> 01:12:48,840
those are enough for us to assemble
 

3597

um with logic and actuation we can make

3604
01:12:57,169 --> 01:12:57,179
um with logic and actuation we can make
 

3605
01:12:57,179 --> 01:12:59,169
um with logic and actuation we can make
micro robots

micro robots
 

3607
01:12:59,179 --> 01:13:03,350
micro robots
the micro robots can build bigger robots

3608
01:13:03,350 --> 01:13:03,360
the micro robots can build bigger robots
 

3609
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:06,169
the micro robots can build bigger robots
um the bigger robots can then take the

3610
01:13:06,169 --> 01:13:06,179
um the bigger robots can then take the
 

3611
01:13:06,179 --> 01:13:08,570
um the bigger robots can then take the
building block materials and make the

3612
01:13:08,570 --> 01:13:08,580
building block materials and make the
 

3613
01:13:08,580 --> 01:13:11,270
building block materials and make the
structural elements that you then do to

01:13:11,270 --> 01:13:11,280
structural elements that you then do to
 

3615
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:13,370
structural elements that you then do to
make construction and then you boot up

3616
01:13:13,370 --> 01:13:13,380
make construction and then you boot up
 

3617
01:13:13,380 --> 01:13:14,930

Civilization by the way where in the

3620
01:13:18,530 --> 01:13:18,540
Civilization by the way where in the
 

3621
01:13:18,540 --> 01:13:21,110
Civilization by the way where in the

01:13:21,110 --> 01:13:21,120
span of logic and actuation to the
 

3623
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:23,510
span of logic and actuation to the
sensing come in oh I skipped over that

3624
01:13:23,510 --> 01:13:23,520
sensing come in oh I skipped over that
 

3625
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:28,010
sensing come in oh I skipped over that
but my favorite sensor is a step

3626
01:13:28,010 --> 01:13:28,020
but my favorite sensor is a step
 

3627
01:13:28,020 --> 01:13:31,550
but my favorite sensor is a step
response so if you just make a step and

3628
01:13:31,550 --> 01:13:31,560
response so if you just make a step and
 

3629
01:13:31,560 --> 01:13:32,870
response so if you just make a step and
measure the response to the electric

3630
01:13:32,870 --> 01:13:32,880
measure the response to the electric
 

3631
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:34,270
measure the response to the electric
field

3632
01:13:34,270 --> 01:13:34,280
field
 

3633
01:13:34,280 --> 01:13:37,550
field
that ranges from user interfaces to

3634
01:13:37,550 --> 01:13:37,560
that ranges from user interfaces to
 

3635
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:40,189
that ranges from user interfaces to
positioning to material properties and

3636
01:13:40,189 --> 01:13:40,199
positioning to material properties and
 

3637
01:13:40,199 --> 01:13:41,750
positioning to material properties and
if you do it at higher frequencies you

3638
01:13:41,750 --> 01:13:41,760
if you do it at higher frequencies you
 

3639
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:44,149
if you do it at higher frequencies you
get chemistry and you can get all of

3640
01:13:44,149 --> 01:13:44,159
get chemistry and you can get all of
 

3641
01:13:44,159 --> 01:13:45,890
get chemistry and you can get all of
that just from a step in an electric

3642
01:13:45,890 --> 01:13:45,900
that just from a step in an electric
 

3643
01:13:45,900 --> 01:13:49,070
that just from a step in an electric
field so for example once you have time

3644
01:13:49,070 --> 01:13:49,080
field so for example once you have time
 

3645
01:13:49,080 --> 01:13:52,850
field so for example once you have time

about all the work I do there's a story
about

3654
01:14:02,630 --> 01:14:02,640
about
 

3655
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:04,970
about
how it happens you know where do ideas

3656
01:14:04,970 --> 01:14:04,980
how it happens you know where do ideas
 

3657
01:14:04,980 --> 01:14:07,189
how it happens you know where do ideas
come from and that's an interesting

3658
01:14:07,189 --> 01:14:07,199
come from and that's an interesting
 

3659
01:14:07,199 --> 01:14:10,250
come from and that's an interesting
story where do I just come from so I had

3660
01:14:10,250 --> 01:14:10,260
story where do I just come from so I had
 

3661
01:14:10,260 --> 01:14:13,310
story where do I just come from so I had
mentioned veniver Bush and

3662
01:14:13,310 --> 01:14:13,320
mentioned veniver Bush and
 

3663
01:14:13,320 --> 01:14:16,970
mentioned veniver Bush and
uh he wrote a really influential thing

3664
01:14:16,970 --> 01:14:16,980
uh he wrote a really influential thing
 

3665
01:14:16,980 --> 01:14:19,669
uh he wrote a really influential thing
called the endless Frontier so uh

3666
01:14:19,669 --> 01:14:19,679
called the endless Frontier so uh
 

3667
01:14:19,679 --> 01:14:22,850
called the endless Frontier so uh
science won World War II the the the the

3668
01:14:22,850 --> 01:14:22,860
science won World War II the the the the
 

3669
01:14:22,860 --> 01:14:26,990
science won World War II the the the the
more known story is nuclear bombs the

3670
01:14:26,990 --> 01:14:27,000
more known story is nuclear bombs the
 

3671
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,270
more known story is nuclear bombs the
less well-known story is the rad lab so

3672
01:14:29,270 --> 01:14:29,280
less well-known story is the rad lab so
 

3673
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:31,430
less well-known story is the rad lab so
at MIT an amazing group of people

3674
01:14:31,430 --> 01:14:31,440
at MIT an amazing group of people
 

3675
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:33,649
at MIT an amazing group of people
invented radar which is really credited

3676
01:14:33,649 --> 01:14:33,659
invented radar which is really credited
 

3677
01:14:33,659 --> 01:14:37,669
invented radar which is really credited
as winning the war so after the war uh

3678
01:14:37,669 --> 01:14:37,679
as winning the war so after the war uh
 

3679
01:14:37,679 --> 01:14:40,850
as winning the war so after the war uh
grand old man from MIT and it's a

3680
01:14:40,850 --> 01:14:40,860
grand old man from MIT and it's a
 

3681
01:14:40,860 --> 01:14:44,450
grand old man from MIT and it's a
um uh was charged with science won the

3682
01:14:44,450 --> 01:14:44,460
um uh was charged with science won the
 

3683
01:14:44,460 --> 01:14:49,490
um uh was charged with science won the
war how do we maintain that edge and the

3684
01:14:49,490 --> 01:14:49,500
war how do we maintain that edge and the
 

3685
01:14:49,500 --> 01:14:52,010
war how do we maintain that edge and the
report he wrote led to the National

3686
01:14:52,010 --> 01:14:52,020
report he wrote led to the National
 

3687
01:14:52,020 --> 01:14:54,530
report he wrote led to the National
Science Foundation and the modern notion

3688
01:14:54,530 --> 01:14:54,540
Science Foundation and the modern notion
 

3689
01:14:54,540 --> 01:14:56,090
Science Foundation and the modern notion
we take for granted but didn't really

3690
01:14:56,090 --> 01:14:56,100
we take for granted but didn't really
 

3691
01:14:56,100 --> 01:14:59,990
we take for granted but didn't really
exist before then of Public Funding of

3692
01:14:59,990 --> 01:15:00,000
exist before then of Public Funding of
 

3693
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,990

research or research agencies

3694
01:15:01,990 --> 01:15:02,000
research or research agencies
 

3695
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:06,290
research or research agencies
in it he made again what I consider an

3696
01:15:06,290 --> 01:15:06,300
in it he made again what I consider an
 

3697
01:15:06,300 --> 01:15:09,410
in it he made again what I consider an
important mistake which is he described

3698
01:15:09,410 --> 01:15:09,420
important mistake which is he described
 

3699
01:15:09,420 --> 01:15:13,370
important mistake which is he described
basic research leads to applied research

3700
01:15:13,370 --> 01:15:13,380
basic research leads to applied research
 

3701
01:15:13,380 --> 01:15:15,649
basic research leads to applied research
search leads to Applications leads to

3702
01:15:15,649 --> 01:15:15,659
search leads to Applications leads to
 

3703
01:15:15,659 --> 01:15:19,310
search leads to Applications leads to
commercialization leads to impact and so

3704
01:15:19,310 --> 01:15:19,320
commercialization leads to impact and so
 

3705
01:15:19,320 --> 01:15:22,370
commercialization leads to impact and so
we need to invest in that pipeline

3706
01:15:22,370 --> 01:15:22,380
we need to invest in that pipeline
 

3707
01:15:22,380 --> 01:15:25,790
we need to invest in that pipeline
the reason I considered a mistake

3708
01:15:25,790 --> 01:15:25,800
the reason I considered a mistake
 

3709
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:29,510
the reason I considered a mistake
is almost all of the examples we've been

3710
01:15:29,510 --> 01:15:29,520
is almost all of the examples we've been
 

3711
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:30,770
is almost all of the examples we've been
talking about

3712
01:15:30,770 --> 01:15:30,780
talking about
 

3713
01:15:30,780 --> 01:15:34,130
talking about
in my lab went backwards that the basic

3714
01:15:34,130 --> 01:15:34,140
in my lab went backwards that the basic
 

3715
01:15:34,140 --> 01:15:37,370
in my lab went backwards that the basic
research came from applications

3716
01:15:37,370 --> 01:15:37,380
research came from applications
 

3717
01:15:37,380 --> 01:15:41,330
research came from applications
and further almost all of the examples

3718
01:15:41,330 --> 01:15:41,340
and further almost all of the examples
 

3719
01:15:41,340 --> 01:15:43,630
and further almost all of the examples
we've been talking about came

3720
01:15:43,630 --> 01:15:43,640
we've been talking about came
 

3721
01:15:43,640 --> 01:15:48,669
we've been talking about came
fundamentally from mistakes so yeah

3722
01:15:48,669 --> 01:15:48,679
fundamentally from mistakes so yeah
 

3723
01:15:48,679 --> 01:15:50,990
fundamentally from mistakes so yeah
essentially everything I've ever worked

3724
01:15:50,990 --> 01:15:51,000
essentially everything I've ever worked
 

3725
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,290
essentially everything I've ever worked
on has failed

3726
01:15:53,290 --> 01:15:53,300
on has failed
 

3727
01:15:53,300 --> 01:15:55,850
on has failed
but in failing something better happened

3728
01:15:55,850 --> 01:15:55,860
but in failing something better happened
 

3729
01:15:55,860 --> 01:15:58,850
but in failing something better happened
so the way I like to describe it is

3730
01:15:58,850 --> 01:15:58,860
so the way I like to describe it is
 

3731
01:15:58,860 --> 01:16:02,750
so the way I like to describe it is
ready aim fire is you do your homework

3732
01:16:02,750 --> 01:16:02,760
ready aim fire is you do your homework
 

3733
01:16:02,760 --> 01:16:05,750
ready aim fire is you do your homework
um you aim carefully at something a

3734
01:16:05,750 --> 01:16:05,760
um you aim carefully at something a
 

3735
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:07,189
um you aim carefully at something a
Target you want to accomplish and if

3736
01:16:07,189 --> 01:16:07,199
Target you want to accomplish and if
 

3737
01:16:07,199 --> 01:16:09,050
Target you want to accomplish and if
everything goes right you then hit the

3738
01:16:09,050 --> 01:16:09,060
everything goes right you then hit the
 

3739
01:16:09,060 --> 01:16:10,970
everything goes right you then hit the
target and succeed

3740
01:16:10,970 --> 01:16:10,980
target and succeed
 

3741
01:16:10,980 --> 01:16:14,149
target and succeed
um what I do you can think of is ready

3742
01:16:14,149 --> 01:16:14,159
um what I do you can think of is ready
 

3743
01:16:14,159 --> 01:16:16,790
um what I do you can think of is ready
fire Aim so you you do a lot of work to

3744
01:16:16,790 --> 01:16:16,800
fire Aim so you you do a lot of work to
 

3745
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:17,810
fire Aim so you you do a lot of work to
get ready

3746
01:16:17,810 --> 01:16:17,820
get ready
 

3747
01:16:17,820 --> 01:16:20,450
get ready
then you close your eyes and you don't

3748
01:16:20,450 --> 01:16:20,460
then you close your eyes and you don't
 

3749
01:16:20,460 --> 01:16:22,130
then you close your eyes and you don't
really think about where you're aiming

3750
01:16:22,130 --> 01:16:22,140
really think about where you're aiming
 

3751
01:16:22,140 --> 01:16:24,290
really think about where you're aiming
but you look very carefully at where you

3752
01:16:24,290 --> 01:16:24,300
but you look very carefully at where you
 

3753
01:16:24,300 --> 01:16:25,930
but you look very carefully at where you
didn't

3754
01:16:25,930 --> 01:16:25,940
didn't
 

3755
01:16:25,940 --> 01:16:28,450
didn't
you aim after you fire

3756
01:16:28,450 --> 01:16:28,460
you aim after you fire
 

3757
01:16:28,460 --> 01:16:31,189
you aim after you fire
and the the reason that's so important

3758
01:16:31,189 --> 01:16:31,199
and the the reason that's so important
 

3759
01:16:31,199 --> 01:16:35,830
and the the reason that's so important
is it if you do Ready Aim Fire there's

3760
01:16:35,830 --> 01:16:35,840
is it if you do Ready Aim Fire there's
 

3761
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:38,149
is it if you do Ready Aim Fire there's
the best you can hope is hit what you

3762
01:16:38,149 --> 01:16:38,159
the best you can hope is hit what you
 

3763
01:16:38,159 --> 01:16:40,729
the best you can hope is hit what you
aim at so let me give you some examples

3764
01:16:40,729 --> 01:16:40,739
aim at so let me give you some examples
 

3765
01:16:40,739 --> 01:16:43,610
aim at so let me give you some examples
uh because this is a source of great

3766
01:16:43,610 --> 01:16:43,620
uh because this is a source of great
 

3767
01:16:43,620 --> 01:16:45,250
uh because this is a source of great
full of good lines today

3768
01:16:45,250 --> 01:16:45,260
full of good lines today
 

3769
01:16:45,260 --> 01:16:48,470
full of good lines today
source of great frustration so I

3770
01:16:48,470 --> 01:16:48,480
source of great frustration so I
 

3771
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:51,410
source of great frustration so I
mentioned the early Quantum Computing so

3772
01:16:51,410 --> 01:16:51,420
mentioned the early Quantum Computing so
 

3773
01:16:51,420 --> 01:16:53,870
mentioned the early Quantum Computing so
Quantum Computing is this power of using

3774
01:16:53,870 --> 01:16:53,880
Quantum Computing is this power of using
 

3775
01:16:53,880 --> 01:16:55,790
Quantum Computing is this power of using
quantum mechanics to make computers that

3776
01:16:55,790 --> 01:16:55,800
quantum mechanics to make computers that
 

3777
01:16:55,800 --> 01:16:58,430
quantum mechanics to make computers that
for some problems are dramatically more

3778
01:16:58,430 --> 01:16:58,440
for some problems are dramatically more
 

3779
01:16:58,440 --> 01:17:00,890
for some problems are dramatically more
powerful than classical computers

3780
01:17:00,890 --> 01:17:00,900
powerful than classical computers
 

3781
01:17:00,900 --> 01:17:03,770
powerful than classical computers
before it started there was a really

3782
01:17:03,770 --> 01:17:03,780
before it started there was a really
 

3783
01:17:03,780 --> 01:17:05,870
before it started there was a really
interesting group of people who knew a

3784
01:17:05,870 --> 01:17:05,880
interesting group of people who knew a
 

3785
01:17:05,880 --> 01:17:07,010
interesting group of people who knew a
lot about

3786
01:17:07,010 --> 01:17:07,020
lot about
 

3787
01:17:07,020 --> 01:17:09,310
lot about
um physics and computing

3788
01:17:09,310 --> 01:17:09,320
um physics and computing
 

3789
01:17:09,320 --> 01:17:12,110
um physics and computing
that were inventing what became Quantum

3790
01:17:12,110 --> 01:17:12,120
that were inventing what became Quantum
 

3791
01:17:12,120 --> 01:17:13,790
that were inventing what became Quantum
Computing before it was clear anything

3792
01:17:13,790 --> 01:17:13,800
Computing before it was clear anything
 

3793
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:16,010
Computing before it was clear anything
there was an opportunity there it was

3794
01:17:16,010 --> 01:17:16,020
there was an opportunity there it was
 

3795
01:17:16,020 --> 01:17:18,709
there was an opportunity there it was
just studying how those relate here's

3796
01:17:18,709 --> 01:17:18,719
just studying how those relate here's
 

3797
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:21,590
just studying how those relate here's
how it fits to the ready fire aim in I

3798
01:17:21,590 --> 01:17:21,600
how it fits to the ready fire aim in I
 

3799
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:23,630
how it fits to the ready fire aim in I
was doing really short-term work in my

3800
01:17:23,630 --> 01:17:23,640
was doing really short-term work in my
 

3801
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:26,229
was doing really short-term work in my
lab on shoplifting tags

3802
01:17:26,229 --> 01:17:26,239
lab on shoplifting tags
 

3803
01:17:26,239 --> 01:17:29,390
lab on shoplifting tags
on this was really before there was

3804
01:17:29,390 --> 01:17:29,400
on this was really before there was
 

3805
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:32,930
on this was really before there was
Modern RFID and so how you put tags in

3806
01:17:32,930 --> 01:17:32,940
Modern RFID and so how you put tags in
 

3807
01:17:32,940 --> 01:17:35,090
Modern RFID and so how you put tags in
objects to sense them

3808
01:17:35,090 --> 01:17:35,100
objects to sense them
 

3809
01:17:35,100 --> 01:17:36,890
objects to sense them
something we just take for granted

3810
01:17:36,890 --> 01:17:36,900
something we just take for granted
 

3811
01:17:36,900 --> 01:17:38,930
something we just take for granted
commercially and there was a problem of

3812
01:17:38,930 --> 01:17:38,940
commercially and there was a problem of
 

3813
01:17:38,940 --> 01:17:40,729
commercially and there was a problem of
how you can sense multiple objects at

3814
01:17:40,729 --> 01:17:40,739
how you can sense multiple objects at
 

3815
01:17:40,739 --> 01:17:42,770
how you can sense multiple objects at
the same time

3816
01:17:42,770 --> 01:17:42,780
the same time
 

3817
01:17:42,780 --> 01:17:45,850
the same time
and so I was studying how you can

3818
01:17:45,850 --> 01:17:45,860
and so I was studying how you can
 

3819
01:17:45,860 --> 01:17:49,010
and so I was studying how you can
remotely sense materials to make

3820
01:17:49,010 --> 01:17:49,020
remotely sense materials to make
 

3821
01:17:49,020 --> 01:17:50,930
remotely sense materials to make
low-cost tags that could let you

3822
01:17:50,930 --> 01:17:50,940
low-cost tags that could let you
 

3823
01:17:50,940 --> 01:17:52,370
low-cost tags that could let you
distinguish multiple objects

3824
01:17:52,370 --> 01:17:52,380
distinguish multiple objects
 

3825
01:17:52,380 --> 01:17:54,649
distinguish multiple objects
simultaneously to do that you need

3826
01:17:54,649 --> 01:17:54,659
simultaneously to do that you need
 

3827
01:17:54,659 --> 01:17:57,229
simultaneously to do that you need
non-linearity so that the signal is

3828
01:17:57,229 --> 01:17:57,239
non-linearity so that the signal is
 

3829
01:17:57,239 --> 01:17:59,209
non-linearity so that the signal is
modulated

3830
01:17:59,209 --> 01:17:59,219
modulated
 

3831
01:17:59,219 --> 01:18:01,490
modulated
and so I was looking for materials

3832
01:18:01,490 --> 01:18:01,500
and so I was looking for materials
 

3833
01:18:01,500 --> 01:18:04,010
and so I was looking for materials
sources of non-linearity and that led me

3834
01:18:04,010 --> 01:18:04,020
sources of non-linearity and that led me
 

3835
01:18:04,020 --> 01:18:09,649
sources of non-linearity and that led me
to look at how nuclear spins interact

3836
01:18:09,649 --> 01:18:09,659
to look at how nuclear spins interact
 

3837
01:18:09,659 --> 01:18:12,229
to look at how nuclear spins interact
just just for for

3838
01:18:12,229 --> 01:18:12,239
just just for for
 

3839
01:18:12,239 --> 01:18:14,330
just just for for
um spin resonance this is the sort of

3840
01:18:14,330 --> 01:18:14,340
um spin resonance this is the sort of
 

3841
01:18:14,340 --> 01:18:16,250
um spin resonance this is the sort of
things you use when you let go in an MRI

3842
01:18:16,250 --> 01:18:16,260
things you use when you let go in an MRI
 

3843
01:18:16,260 --> 01:18:17,390
things you use when you let go in an MRI
machine

3844
01:18:17,390 --> 01:18:17,400
machine
 

3845
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:19,430
machine
and so I was studying how to use that

3846
01:18:19,430 --> 01:18:19,440
and so I was studying how to use that
 

3847
01:18:19,440 --> 01:18:22,070
and so I was studying how to use that
and it turns out that it was a bad idea

3848
01:18:22,070 --> 01:18:22,080
and it turns out that it was a bad idea
 

3849
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:26,149
and it turns out that it was a bad idea
you couldn't remotely use it for

3850
01:18:26,149 --> 01:18:26,159
you couldn't remotely use it for
 

3851
01:18:26,159 --> 01:18:28,130
you couldn't remotely use it for
um shoplifting tags

3852
01:18:28,130 --> 01:18:28,140
um shoplifting tags
 

3853
01:18:28,140 --> 01:18:32,930
um shoplifting tags
but I realized you could compute and so

3854
01:18:32,930 --> 01:18:32,940
but I realized you could compute and so
 

3855
01:18:32,940 --> 01:18:36,770
but I realized you could compute and so
um with a group of colleagues thinking

3856
01:18:36,770 --> 01:18:36,780
um with a group of colleagues thinking
 

3857
01:18:36,780 --> 01:18:38,330
um with a group of colleagues thinking
about early Quantum Computing like David

3858
01:18:38,330 --> 01:18:38,340
about early Quantum Computing like David
 

3859
01:18:38,340 --> 01:18:40,130
about early Quantum Computing like David
divincenzo and Charlie Bennett was

3860
01:18:40,130 --> 01:18:40,140
divincenzo and Charlie Bennett was
 

3861
01:18:40,140 --> 01:18:41,990
divincenzo and Charlie Bennett was
articulating what are the properties you

3862
01:18:41,990 --> 01:18:42,000
articulating what are the properties you
 

3863
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,450
articulating what are the properties you
need to compute and then looking at how

3864
01:18:44,450 --> 01:18:44,460
need to compute and then looking at how
 

3865
01:18:44,460 --> 01:18:46,310
need to compute and then looking at how
to make the tags it turns out the tags

3866
01:18:46,310 --> 01:18:46,320
to make the tags it turns out the tags
 

3867
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:48,189
to make the tags it turns out the tags
were a terrible idea

3868
01:18:48,189 --> 01:18:48,199
were a terrible idea
 

3869
01:18:48,199 --> 01:18:49,729
were a terrible idea
for

3870
01:18:49,729 --> 01:18:49,739
for
 

3871
01:18:49,739 --> 01:18:51,490
for
um sensing

3872
01:18:51,490 --> 01:18:51,500
um sensing
 

3873
01:18:51,500 --> 01:18:55,310
um sensing
objects in a supermarket checkout but I

3874
01:18:55,310 --> 01:18:55,320
objects in a supermarket checkout but I
 

3875
01:18:55,320 --> 01:18:57,169
objects in a supermarket checkout but I
realized they were Computing so with Ike

3876
01:18:57,169 --> 01:18:57,179
realized they were Computing so with Ike
 

3877
01:18:57,179 --> 01:18:59,209
realized they were Computing so with Ike
Trang and a few other people we realized

3878
01:18:59,209 --> 01:18:59,219
Trang and a few other people we realized
 

3879
01:18:59,219 --> 01:19:01,550
Trang and a few other people we realized
we could program nuclear spins to

3880
01:19:01,550 --> 01:19:01,560
we could program nuclear spins to
 

3881
01:19:01,560 --> 01:19:04,070
we could program nuclear spins to
compute and so that's what we use to do

3882
01:19:04,070 --> 01:19:04,080
compute and so that's what we use to do
 

3883
01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:06,110
compute and so that's what we use to do
Grover's search algorithm and then it

3884
01:19:06,110 --> 01:19:06,120
Grover's search algorithm and then it
 

3885
01:19:06,120 --> 01:19:07,910
Grover's search algorithm and then it
was used for a shortest factoring

3886
01:19:07,910 --> 01:19:07,920
was used for a shortest factoring
 

3887
01:19:07,920 --> 01:19:11,030
was used for a shortest factoring
algorithm and it worked out the systems

3888
01:19:11,030 --> 01:19:11,040
algorithm and it worked out the systems
 

3889
01:19:11,040 --> 01:19:12,890
algorithm and it worked out the systems
we did it in nuclear magnetic resonance

3890
01:19:12,890 --> 01:19:12,900
we did it in nuclear magnetic resonance
 

3891
01:19:12,900 --> 01:19:16,310
we did it in nuclear magnetic resonance
don't scale Beyond a few qubits but the

3892
01:19:16,310 --> 01:19:16,320
don't scale Beyond a few qubits but the
 

3893
01:19:16,320 --> 01:19:19,669
don't scale Beyond a few qubits but the
techniques have lived on and so you know

3894
01:19:19,669 --> 01:19:19,679
techniques have lived on and so you know
 

3895
01:19:19,679 --> 01:19:21,050
techniques have lived on and so you know
all the current Quantum Computing

3896
01:19:21,050 --> 01:19:21,060
all the current Quantum Computing
 

3897
01:19:21,060 --> 01:19:25,070
all the current Quantum Computing
techniques grew out of the ways we would

3898
01:19:25,070 --> 01:19:25,080
techniques grew out of the ways we would
 

3899
01:19:25,080 --> 01:19:27,770
techniques grew out of the ways we would
talk to these spins but I'm telling this

3900
01:19:27,770 --> 01:19:27,780
talk to these spins but I'm telling this
 

3901
01:19:27,780 --> 01:19:30,350
talk to these spins but I'm telling this
whole story because it it came from a

3902
01:19:30,350 --> 01:19:30,360
whole story because it it came from a
 

3903
01:19:30,360 --> 01:19:31,970
whole story because it it came from a
bad way to make a shoplifting tag

3904
01:19:31,970 --> 01:19:31,980
bad way to make a shoplifting tag
 

3905
01:19:31,980 --> 01:19:34,669
bad way to make a shoplifting tag
starting with an application mistakes

3906
01:19:34,669 --> 01:19:34,679
starting with an application mistakes
 

3907
01:19:34,679 --> 01:19:36,470
starting with an application mistakes
led to the fundamental science

3908
01:19:36,470 --> 01:19:36,480
led to the fundamental science
 

3909
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:38,450
led to the fundamental science
fundamental science yeah I mean can you

3910
01:19:38,450 --> 01:19:38,460
fundamental science yeah I mean can you
 

3911
01:19:38,460 --> 01:19:40,130
fundamental science yeah I mean can you
can you just link on that I mean just

3912
01:19:40,130 --> 01:19:40,140
can you just link on that I mean just
 

3913
01:19:40,140 --> 01:19:42,709
can you just link on that I mean just
just in using nuclear expensive do

3914
01:19:42,709 --> 01:19:42,719
just in using nuclear expensive do
 

3915
01:19:42,719 --> 01:19:44,870
just in using nuclear expensive do
computation that like

3916
01:19:44,870 --> 01:19:44,880
computation that like
 

3917
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:49,610
computation that like
what gave you the guts to try to think

3918
01:19:49,610 --> 01:19:49,620
what gave you the guts to try to think
 

3919
01:19:49,620 --> 01:19:51,950
what gave you the guts to try to think
through this the from a fabric from a

3920
01:19:51,950 --> 01:19:51,960
through this the from a fabric from a
 

3921
01:19:51,960 --> 01:19:53,330
through this the from a fabric from a
digital fabrication perspective actually

3922
01:19:53,330 --> 01:19:53,340
digital fabrication perspective actually
 

3923
01:19:53,340 --> 01:19:55,250
digital fabrication perspective actually
how to LEAP from one to the other yeah I

3924
01:19:55,250 --> 01:19:55,260
how to LEAP from one to the other yeah I
 

3925
01:19:55,260 --> 01:19:56,390
how to LEAP from one to the other yeah I
wouldn't call it guts I would call it

3926
01:19:56,390 --> 01:19:56,400
wouldn't call it guts I would call it
 

3927
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:59,750
wouldn't call it guts I would call it
collaboration so I so at IBM there was

3928
01:19:59,750 --> 01:19:59,760
collaboration so I so at IBM there was
 

3929
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:03,050
collaboration so I so at IBM there was
this amazing group of like I mentioned

3930
01:20:03,050 --> 01:20:03,060
this amazing group of like I mentioned
 

3931
01:20:03,060 --> 01:20:05,270
this amazing group of like I mentioned
Charlie Bennett and David divincenzo and

3932
01:20:05,270 --> 01:20:05,280
Charlie Bennett and David divincenzo and
 

3933
01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:08,209
Charlie Bennett and David divincenzo and
Ralph Landau and Nabil Amir and these

3934
01:20:08,209 --> 01:20:08,219
Ralph Landau and Nabil Amir and these
 

3935
01:20:08,219 --> 01:20:12,290
Ralph Landau and Nabil Amir and these
were all gods of thinking about physics

3936
01:20:12,290 --> 01:20:12,300
were all gods of thinking about physics
 

3937
01:20:12,300 --> 01:20:17,090
were all gods of thinking about physics
and Computing so I I I I I yelled at the

3938
01:20:17,090 --> 01:20:17,100
and Computing so I I I I I yelled at the
 

3939
01:20:17,100 --> 01:20:20,209
and Computing so I I I I I yelled at the
whole computer industry being based on

01:20:20,209 --> 01:20:20,219
whole computer industry being based on
 

3941
01:20:20,219 --> 01:20:22,850
whole computer industry being based on
uh a fiction Metropolis you know

3942
01:20:22,850 --> 01:20:22,860
uh a fiction Metropolis you know
 

3943
01:20:22,860 --> 01:20:24,530
uh a fiction Metropolis you know

01:20:25,790 --> 01:20:25,800
somebody moves levers in the basement
 

3947
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:30,470
somebody moves levers in the basement
there's a complete parallel history of

3948
01:20:30,470 --> 01:20:30,480
there's a complete parallel history of
 

3949
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:35,510
there's a complete parallel history of
um uh Maxwell the boltzman to zillard to

3950
01:20:35,510 --> 01:20:35,520
um uh Maxwell the boltzman to zillard to
 

3951
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:37,729
um uh Maxwell the boltzman to zillard to
um landower to Bennett and most people

3952
01:20:37,729 --> 01:20:37,739
um landower to Bennett and most people
 

3953
01:20:37,739 --> 01:20:39,649
um landower to Bennett and most people
won't know most of these names but this

3954
01:20:39,649 --> 01:20:39,659
won't know most of these names but this
 

3955
01:20:39,659 --> 01:20:41,930
won't know most of these names but this
whole parallel history thinking deeply

3956
01:20:41,930 --> 01:20:41,940
whole parallel history thinking deeply
 

3957
01:20:41,940 --> 01:20:44,149
whole parallel history thinking deeply
about how computation and physics relate

3958
01:20:44,149 --> 01:20:44,159
about how computation and physics relate
 

3959
01:20:44,159 --> 01:20:45,590
about how computation and physics relate
so

3960
01:20:45,590 --> 01:20:45,600
so
 

3961
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:47,149
so
um I was collaborating with that whole

3962
01:20:47,149 --> 01:20:47,159
um I was collaborating with that whole
 

3963
01:20:47,159 --> 01:20:48,530
um I was collaborating with that whole
group of people

3964
01:20:48,530 --> 01:20:48,540
group of people
 

3965
01:20:48,540 --> 01:20:49,970
group of people
and then

3966
01:20:49,970 --> 01:20:49,980
and then
 

3967
01:20:49,980 --> 01:20:52,550
and then
you know at MIT I was in this high

3968
01:20:52,550 --> 01:20:52,560
you know at MIT I was in this high
 

3969
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:54,470
you know at MIT I was in this high
traffic environment I wasn't deeply

3970
01:20:54,470 --> 01:20:54,480
traffic environment I wasn't deeply
 

3971
01:20:54,480 --> 01:20:56,570
traffic environment I wasn't deeply
inspired to think about better ways to

3972
01:20:56,570 --> 01:20:56,580
inspired to think about better ways to
 

3973
01:20:56,580 --> 01:20:58,370
inspired to think about better ways to
detect shoplifting tags but you know

3974
01:20:58,370 --> 01:20:58,380
detect shoplifting tags but you know
 

3975
01:20:58,380 --> 01:21:00,590
detect shoplifting tags but you know
stumbled across companies that needed

3976
01:21:00,590 --> 01:21:00,600
stumbled across companies that needed
 

3977
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:02,270
stumbled across companies that needed
help with that and was thinking about it

3978
01:21:02,270 --> 01:21:02,280
help with that and was thinking about it
 

3979
01:21:02,280 --> 01:21:04,310
help with that and was thinking about it
and then I realized those two worlds

3980
01:21:04,310 --> 01:21:04,320
and then I realized those two worlds
 

3981
01:21:04,320 --> 01:21:07,189
and then I realized those two worlds
intersected and we could use the failed

3982
01:21:07,189 --> 01:21:07,199
intersected and we could use the failed
 

3983
01:21:07,199 --> 01:21:10,310
intersected and we could use the failed
approach for the shoplifting tags to

3984
01:21:10,310 --> 01:21:10,320
approach for the shoplifting tags to
 

3985
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:11,930
approach for the shoplifting tags to
make

3986
01:21:11,930 --> 01:21:11,940
make
 

3987
01:21:11,940 --> 01:21:14,510
make
um early Quantum Computing algorithms

3988
01:21:14,510 --> 01:21:14,520
um early Quantum Computing algorithms
 

3989
01:21:14,520 --> 01:21:15,830
um early Quantum Computing algorithms
and this kind of stumbling is

3990
01:21:15,830 --> 01:21:15,840
and this kind of stumbling is
 

3991
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:17,990
and this kind of stumbling is
fundamental to the Fab Lab idea right

3992
01:21:17,990 --> 01:21:18,000
fundamental to the Fab Lab idea right
 

3993
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,450
fundamental to the Fab Lab idea right
right here's one more example with a

3994
01:21:20,450 --> 01:21:20,460
right here's one more example with a
 

3995
01:21:20,460 --> 01:21:23,030
right here's one more example with a
student Manu we talked about ribosomes

3996
01:21:23,030 --> 01:21:23,040
student Manu we talked about ribosomes
 

3997
01:21:23,040 --> 01:21:25,970
student Manu we talked about ribosomes
and I was trying to build a ribosome

3998
01:21:25,970 --> 01:21:25,980
and I was trying to build a ribosome
 

3999
01:21:25,980 --> 01:21:29,450
and I was trying to build a ribosome
um that worked on fluids so that I could

4000
01:21:29,450 --> 01:21:29,460
um that worked on fluids so that I could
 

4001
01:21:29,460 --> 01:21:30,890
um that worked on fluids so that I could
place the little Parts we're talking

4002
01:21:30,890 --> 01:21:30,900
place the little Parts we're talking
 

4003
01:21:30,900 --> 01:21:34,130
place the little Parts we're talking
about and we it kept failing because

4004
01:21:34,130 --> 01:21:34,140
about and we it kept failing because
 

4005
01:21:34,140 --> 01:21:36,470
about and we it kept failing because
bubbles would come into our system and

4006
01:21:36,470 --> 01:21:36,480
bubbles would come into our system and
 

4007
01:21:36,480 --> 01:21:37,850
bubbles would come into our system and
the bubbles would make the whole thing

4008
01:21:37,850 --> 01:21:37,860
the bubbles would make the whole thing
 

4009
01:21:37,860 --> 01:21:40,130
the bubbles would make the whole thing
stop working and we spent about half a

4010
01:21:40,130 --> 01:21:40,140
stop working and we spent about half a
 

4011
01:21:40,140 --> 01:21:41,530
stop working and we spent about half a
year trying to get rid of the bubbles

4012
01:21:41,530 --> 01:21:41,540
year trying to get rid of the bubbles
 

4013
01:21:41,540 --> 01:21:44,870
year trying to get rid of the bubbles
then Manu said wait a minute the bubbles

4014
01:21:44,870 --> 01:21:44,880
then Manu said wait a minute the bubbles
 

4015
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:45,890
then Manu said wait a minute the bubbles
are actually

4016
01:21:45,890 --> 01:21:45,900
are actually
 

4017
01:21:45,900 --> 01:21:47,689
are actually
better than what we're doing we should

4018
01:21:47,689 --> 01:21:47,699
better than what we're doing we should
 

4019
01:21:47,699 --> 01:21:50,870
better than what we're doing we should
just use the bubbles and so we invented

4020
01:21:50,870 --> 01:21:50,880
just use the bubbles and so we invented
 

4021
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:53,050
just use the bubbles and so we invented
how to do Universal object with little

4022
01:21:53,050 --> 01:21:53,060
how to do Universal object with little
 

4023
01:21:53,060 --> 01:21:56,030
how to do Universal object with little
logic with little Bubbles and fluid okay

4024
01:21:56,030 --> 01:21:56,040
logic with little Bubbles and fluid okay
 

4025
01:21:56,040 --> 01:21:58,070
logic with little Bubbles and fluid okay
you have to you have to explain this

4026
01:21:58,070 --> 01:21:58,080
you have to you have to explain this
 

4027
01:21:58,080 --> 01:22:00,290
you have to you have to explain this
microfluidic bubble logic please how

4028
01:22:00,290 --> 01:22:00,300
microfluidic bubble logic please how
 

4029
01:22:00,300 --> 01:22:03,470
microfluidic bubble logic please how
does this work so yeah that's super

4030
01:22:03,470 --> 01:22:03,480
does this work so yeah that's super
 

4031
01:22:03,480 --> 01:22:05,630
does this work so yeah that's super
interesting yeah and so over so I'll

4032
01:22:05,630 --> 01:22:05,640
interesting yeah and so over so I'll
 

4033
01:22:05,640 --> 01:22:07,310
interesting yeah and so over so I'll
come back and explain it but what it led

4034
01:22:07,310 --> 01:22:07,320
come back and explain it but what it led
 

4035
01:22:07,320 --> 01:22:08,510
come back and explain it but what it led
to was

4036
01:22:08,510 --> 01:22:08,520
to was
 

4037
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:11,330
to was
um we showed fluids could do

4038
01:22:11,330 --> 01:22:11,340
um we showed fluids could do
 

4039
01:22:11,340 --> 01:22:13,669
um we showed fluids could do
um it had been known fluid could do

4040
01:22:13,669 --> 01:22:13,679
um it had been known fluid could do
 

4041
01:22:13,679 --> 01:22:15,350
um it had been known fluid could do
logic like your old automobile

4042
01:22:15,350 --> 01:22:15,360
logic like your old automobile
 

4043
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:17,810
logic like your old automobile
transition Transmissions do logic but

4044
01:22:17,810 --> 01:22:17,820
transition Transmissions do logic but
 

4045
01:22:17,820 --> 01:22:19,310
transition Transmissions do logic but
that's macroscopic it didn't work at

4046
01:22:19,310 --> 01:22:19,320
that's macroscopic it didn't work at
 

4047
01:22:19,320 --> 01:22:20,689
that's macroscopic it didn't work at
little scales we showed with these

4048
01:22:20,689 --> 01:22:20,699
little scales we showed with these
 

4049
01:22:20,699 --> 01:22:22,310
little scales we showed with these
bubbles we could do it at little scales

4050
01:22:22,310 --> 01:22:22,320
bubbles we could do it at little scales
 

4051
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:23,990
bubbles we could do it at little scales
that then I'm going to come back and

4052
01:22:23,990 --> 01:22:24,000
that then I'm going to come back and
 

4053
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:25,669
that then I'm going to come back and
explain it but what came out of that is

4054
01:22:25,669 --> 01:22:25,679
explain it but what came out of that is
 

4055
01:22:25,679 --> 01:22:28,310
explain it but what came out of that is
Manu then showed you could make a 50

4056
01:22:28,310 --> 01:22:28,320
Manu then showed you could make a 50
 

4057
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:31,490
Manu then showed you could make a 50
Cent microscope using little Bubbles and

4058
01:22:31,490 --> 01:22:31,500
Cent microscope using little Bubbles and
 

4059
01:22:31,500 --> 01:22:32,330
Cent microscope using little Bubbles and
then

4060
01:22:32,330 --> 01:22:32,340
then
 

4061
01:22:32,340 --> 01:22:34,189
then
um the techniques we developed are what

4062
01:22:34,189 --> 01:22:34,199
um the techniques we developed are what
 

4063
01:22:34,199 --> 01:22:36,770
um the techniques we developed are what
we use to transplant genomes to make

4064
01:22:36,770 --> 01:22:36,780
we use to transplant genomes to make
 

4065
01:22:36,780 --> 01:22:39,470
we use to transplant genomes to make
synthetic life all came out of the

4066
01:22:39,470 --> 01:22:39,480
synthetic life all came out of the
 

4067
01:22:39,480 --> 01:22:41,750
synthetic life all came out of the
failure of trying to make a the genome

4068
01:22:41,750 --> 01:22:41,760
failure of trying to make a the genome
 

4069
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:44,750
failure of trying to make a the genome
the the the ribosome now so the way the

4070
01:22:44,750 --> 01:22:44,760
the the the ribosome now so the way the
 

4071
01:22:44,760 --> 01:22:47,990
the the the ribosome now so the way the
bubble logic works is

4072
01:22:47,990 --> 01:22:48,000
bubble logic works is
 

4073
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:51,229
bubble logic works is
um in a little child Channel

4074
01:22:51,229 --> 01:22:51,239
um in a little child Channel
 

4075
01:22:51,239 --> 01:22:56,209
um in a little child Channel
uh fluid at small scales is fairly

4076
01:22:56,209 --> 01:22:56,219
uh fluid at small scales is fairly
 

4077
01:22:56,219 --> 01:22:59,030
uh fluid at small scales is fairly
viscous it's sort of like pushing Jello

4078
01:22:59,030 --> 01:22:59,040
viscous it's sort of like pushing Jello
 

4079
01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:01,189
viscous it's sort of like pushing Jello
think of it as

4080
01:23:01,189 --> 01:23:01,199
think of it as
 

4081
01:23:01,199 --> 01:23:01,930
think of it as
um

4082
01:23:01,930 --> 01:23:01,940
um
 

4083
01:23:01,940 --> 01:23:05,810
um
if a bubble gets stuck the fluid has to

4084
01:23:05,810 --> 01:23:05,820
if a bubble gets stuck the fluid has to
 

4085
01:23:05,820 --> 01:23:07,850
if a bubble gets stuck the fluid has to
detour around it

4086
01:23:07,850 --> 01:23:07,860
detour around it
 

4087
01:23:07,860 --> 01:23:10,550
detour around it
so now imagine

4088
01:23:10,550 --> 01:23:10,560
so now imagine
 

4089
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:13,669
so now imagine
a channel that has two Wells and one

4090
01:23:13,669 --> 01:23:13,679
a channel that has two Wells and one
 

4091
01:23:13,679 --> 01:23:14,750
a channel that has two Wells and one
bubble

4092
01:23:14,750 --> 01:23:14,760
bubble
 

4093
01:23:14,760 --> 01:23:17,450
bubble
if the bubble is in one well the fluid

4094
01:23:17,450 --> 01:23:17,460
if the bubble is in one well the fluid
 

4095
01:23:17,460 --> 01:23:19,370
if the bubble is in one well the fluid
has to go in the other channel

4096
01:23:19,370 --> 01:23:19,380
has to go in the other channel
 

4097
01:23:19,380 --> 01:23:21,229
has to go in the other channel
if the fluid is in the other well it has

4098
01:23:21,229 --> 01:23:21,239
if the fluid is in the other well it has
 

4099
01:23:21,239 --> 01:23:23,149
if the fluid is in the other well it has
to go in the first channel

4100
01:23:23,149 --> 01:23:23,159
to go in the first channel
 

4101
01:23:23,159 --> 01:23:26,930
to go in the first channel
so the the position of the bubble

4102
01:23:26,930 --> 01:23:26,940
so the the position of the bubble
 

4103
01:23:26,940 --> 01:23:28,610
so the the position of the bubble
can switch

4104
01:23:28,610 --> 01:23:28,620
can switch
 

4105
01:23:28,620 --> 01:23:30,590
can switch
it's a switch it can switch the fluid

4106
01:23:30,590 --> 01:23:30,600
it's a switch it can switch the fluid
 

4107
01:23:30,600 --> 01:23:33,169
it's a switch it can switch the fluid
between two channels so now we have one

4108
01:23:33,169 --> 01:23:33,179
between two channels so now we have one
 

4109
01:23:33,179 --> 01:23:35,270
between two channels so now we have one
element of switch and it's also a memory

4110
01:23:35,270 --> 01:23:35,280
element of switch and it's also a memory
 

4111
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:37,130
element of switch and it's also a memory
because you can detect whether or not a

4112
01:23:37,130 --> 01:23:37,140
because you can detect whether or not a
 

4113
01:23:37,140 --> 01:23:38,870
because you can detect whether or not a
bubble is stored there

4114
01:23:38,870 --> 01:23:38,880
bubble is stored there
 

4115
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:42,890
bubble is stored there
then if two bubbles meet

4116
01:23:42,890 --> 01:23:42,900
then if two bubbles meet
 

4117
01:23:42,900 --> 01:23:46,310
then if two bubbles meet
um if you have two channels crossing a

4118
01:23:46,310 --> 01:23:46,320
um if you have two channels crossing a
 

4119
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:47,930
um if you have two channels crossing a
bubble can go through one way or a

4120
01:23:47,930 --> 01:23:47,940
bubble can go through one way or a
 

4121
01:23:47,940 --> 01:23:50,090
bubble can go through one way or a
bubble can go through the other way but

4122
01:23:50,090 --> 01:23:50,100
bubble can go through the other way but
 

4123
01:23:50,100 --> 01:23:53,090
bubble can go through the other way but
if two bubbles come together then they

4124
01:23:53,090 --> 01:23:53,100
if two bubbles come together then they
 

4125
01:23:53,100 --> 01:23:54,709
if two bubbles come together then they
push on each other and one goes one way

4126
01:23:54,709 --> 01:23:54,719
push on each other and one goes one way
 

4127
01:23:54,719 --> 01:23:56,570
push on each other and one goes one way
and one goes the other way that's a

4128
01:23:56,570 --> 01:23:56,580
and one goes the other way that's a
 

4129
01:23:56,580 --> 01:23:59,510
and one goes the other way that's a
logic operation that's a logic gate so

4130
01:23:59,510 --> 01:23:59,520
logic operation that's a logic gate so
 

4131
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:01,070
logic operation that's a logic gate so
we now have a switch we have a memory

4132
01:24:01,070 --> 01:24:01,080
we now have a switch we have a memory
 

4133
01:24:01,080 --> 01:24:02,330
we now have a switch we have a memory
and we have a logic eight and that's

4134
01:24:02,330 --> 01:24:02,340
and we have a logic eight and that's
 

4135
01:24:02,340 --> 01:24:03,709
and we have a logic eight and that's
everything you need to make a universal

4136
01:24:03,709 --> 01:24:03,719
everything you need to make a universal
 

4137
01:24:03,719 --> 01:24:05,030
everything you need to make a universal
computer

4138
01:24:05,030 --> 01:24:05,040
computer
 

4139
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:06,649
computer
I mean the fact that you did that with

4140
01:24:06,649 --> 01:24:06,659
I mean the fact that you did that with
 

4141
01:24:06,659 --> 01:24:10,130
I mean the fact that you did that with
bubbles and microfluids just

4142
01:24:10,130 --> 01:24:10,140
bubbles and microfluids just
 

4143
01:24:10,140 --> 01:24:13,550
bubbles and microfluids just
kind of brilliant well so I mean to stay

4144
01:24:13,550 --> 01:24:13,560
kind of brilliant well so I mean to stay
 

4145
01:24:13,560 --> 01:24:16,970
kind of brilliant well so I mean to stay
with that example uh it it what we

4146
01:24:16,970 --> 01:24:16,980
with that example uh it it what we
 

4147
01:24:16,980 --> 01:24:19,070
with that example uh it it what we
propose to do was to make a fluidic

4148
01:24:19,070 --> 01:24:19,080
propose to do was to make a fluidic
 

4149
01:24:19,080 --> 01:24:21,410
propose to do was to make a fluidic
ribosome and the project crashed and

4150
01:24:21,410 --> 01:24:21,420
ribosome and the project crashed and
 

4151
01:24:21,420 --> 01:24:24,169
ribosome and the project crashed and
burned it was a disaster

4152
01:24:24,169 --> 01:24:24,179
burned it was a disaster
 

4153
01:24:24,179 --> 01:24:27,050
burned it was a disaster
um this is what came out of it and so it

4154
01:24:27,050 --> 01:24:27,060
um this is what came out of it and so it
 

4155
01:24:27,060 --> 01:24:28,630
um this is what came out of it and so it
was

4156
01:24:28,630 --> 01:24:28,640
was
 

4157
01:24:28,640 --> 01:24:31,189
was
precisely ready fire aim in that we had

4158
01:24:31,189 --> 01:24:31,199
precisely ready fire aim in that we had
 

4159
01:24:31,199 --> 01:24:33,350
precisely ready fire aim in that we had
to do a lot of homework to be able to

4160
01:24:33,350 --> 01:24:33,360
to do a lot of homework to be able to
 

4161
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:35,750
to do a lot of homework to be able to
make these microfluidic systems

4162
01:24:35,750 --> 01:24:35,760
make these microfluidic systems
 

4163
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:38,510
make these microfluidic systems
the the Fire part was we didn't think

4164
01:24:38,510 --> 01:24:38,520
the the Fire part was we didn't think
 

4165
01:24:38,520 --> 01:24:40,310
the the Fire part was we didn't think
too hard about making the ribosome we

4166
01:24:40,310 --> 01:24:40,320
too hard about making the ribosome we
 

4167
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:42,590
too hard about making the ribosome we
just tried to do it the aim part was we

4168
01:24:42,590 --> 01:24:42,600
just tried to do it the aim part was we
 

4169
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:44,090
just tried to do it the aim part was we
realized the ribosome failed but

4170
01:24:44,090 --> 01:24:44,100
realized the ribosome failed but
 

4171
01:24:44,100 --> 01:24:46,130
realized the ribosome failed but
something better had happened and if you

4172
01:24:46,130 --> 01:24:46,140
something better had happened and if you
 

4173
01:24:46,140 --> 01:24:48,410
something better had happened and if you
look all across research funding

4174
01:24:48,410 --> 01:24:48,420
look all across research funding
 

4175
01:24:48,420 --> 01:24:50,390
look all across research funding
research management

4176
01:24:50,390 --> 01:24:50,400
research management
 

4177
01:24:50,400 --> 01:24:52,310
research management
it doesn't

4178
01:24:52,310 --> 01:24:52,320
it doesn't
 

4179
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:55,850
it doesn't
anticipate this so fail fast is familiar

4180
01:24:55,850 --> 01:24:55,860
anticipate this so fail fast is familiar
 

4181
01:24:55,860 --> 01:25:00,050
anticipate this so fail fast is familiar
but fail fast tends to miss ready and

4182
01:25:00,050 --> 01:25:00,060
but fail fast tends to miss ready and
 

4183
01:25:00,060 --> 01:25:02,750
but fail fast tends to miss ready and
aim you can't just fail you have to do

4184
01:25:02,750 --> 01:25:02,760
aim you can't just fail you have to do
 

4185
01:25:02,760 --> 01:25:05,450
aim you can't just fail you have to do
your homework before the fail part and

4186
01:25:05,450 --> 01:25:05,460
your homework before the fail part and
 

4187
01:25:05,460 --> 01:25:07,189
your homework before the fail part and
you have to do the aim part after the

4188
01:25:07,189 --> 01:25:07,199
you have to do the aim part after the
 

4189
01:25:07,199 --> 01:25:09,590
you have to do the aim part after the
fail part and so the whole language of

4190
01:25:09,590 --> 01:25:09,600
fail part and so the whole language of
 

4191
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:11,450
fail part and so the whole language of
research is about like milestones and

4192
01:25:11,450 --> 01:25:11,460
research is about like milestones and
 

4193
01:25:11,460 --> 01:25:13,010
research is about like milestones and
deliverables that works when you're

4194
01:25:13,010 --> 01:25:13,020
deliverables that works when you're
 

4195
01:25:13,020 --> 01:25:15,410
deliverables that works when you're
going down a straight line but it

4196
01:25:15,410 --> 01:25:15,420
going down a straight line but it
 

4197
01:25:15,420 --> 01:25:17,149
going down a straight line but it
doesn't work for this kind of Discovery

4198
01:25:17,149 --> 01:25:17,159
doesn't work for this kind of Discovery
 

4199
01:25:17,159 --> 01:25:19,310
doesn't work for this kind of Discovery
and to LEAP to something you said that's

4200
01:25:19,310 --> 01:25:19,320
and to LEAP to something you said that's
 

4201
01:25:19,320 --> 01:25:22,250
and to LEAP to something you said that's
really important is I view part of what

4202
01:25:22,250 --> 01:25:22,260
really important is I view part of what
 

4203
01:25:22,260 --> 01:25:25,910
really important is I view part of what
the Fab Lab network is doing is giving

4204
01:25:25,910 --> 01:25:25,920
the Fab Lab network is doing is giving
 

4205
01:25:25,920 --> 01:25:28,790
the Fab Lab network is doing is giving
more people the opportunity to fail

4206
01:25:28,790 --> 01:25:28,800
more people the opportunity to fail
 

4207
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:33,290
more people the opportunity to fail
you've said that geometry is really

4208
01:25:33,290 --> 01:25:33,300
you've said that geometry is really
 

4209
01:25:33,300 --> 01:25:35,510
you've said that geometry is really
important in biology

4210
01:25:35,510 --> 01:25:35,520
important in biology
 

4211
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:37,490
important in biology
um

4212
01:25:37,490 --> 01:25:37,500
um
 

4213
01:25:37,500 --> 01:25:39,530
um
what is fabrication biology look like

4214
01:25:39,530 --> 01:25:39,540
what is fabrication biology look like
 

4215
01:25:39,540 --> 01:25:43,370
what is fabrication biology look like
why is geometry important so molecular

4216
01:25:43,370 --> 01:25:43,380
why is geometry important so molecular
 

4217
01:25:43,380 --> 01:25:46,550
why is geometry important so molecular
biology is dominated by geometry that's

4218
01:25:46,550 --> 01:25:46,560
biology is dominated by geometry that's
 

4219
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:48,290
biology is dominated by geometry that's
why the protein folding is so important

4220
01:25:48,290 --> 01:25:48,300
why the protein folding is so important
 

4221
01:25:48,300 --> 01:25:51,770
why the protein folding is so important
that that that the geometry gives the

4222
01:25:51,770 --> 01:25:51,780
that that that the geometry gives the
 

4223
01:25:51,780 --> 01:25:52,970
that that that the geometry gives the
function

4224
01:25:52,970 --> 01:25:52,980
function
 

4225
01:25:52,980 --> 01:25:54,350

and

4226
01:25:54,350 --> 01:25:54,360
and
 

4227
01:25:54,360 --> 01:25:56,090
and
uh there's this hierarchical

4228
01:25:56,090 --> 01:25:56,100
uh there's this hierarchical
 

4229
01:25:56,100 --> 01:25:58,010
uh there's this hierarchical

4234
01:26:04,129 --> 01:26:04,139
shapes of the molecules make the shape
 

4235
01:26:04,139 --> 01:26:06,530

of the molecular machines and they

4236
01:26:06,530 --> 01:26:06,540
of the molecular machines and they
 

4237
01:26:06,540 --> 01:26:08,450

really are Exquisite machines if you

4238
01:26:08,450 --> 01:26:08,460
really are Exquisite machines if you
 

4239
01:26:08,460 --> 01:26:10,669
really are Exquisite machines if you
look at how

01:26:10,669 --> 01:26:10,679
look at how
 

4241
01:26:10,679 --> 01:26:13,030
look at how
um if you look at how your muscles move

4242
01:26:13,030 --> 01:26:13,040
um if you look at how your muscles move
 

4243

4293
01:27:22,260 --> 01:27:25,910
you know cars get old and fail yet life
doesn't and it that's why there's a

doesn't and it that's why there's a
 

4295
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:27,950

01:27:27,950 --> 01:27:27,960
sense in which life seems to violate
 

4297
01:27:27,960 --> 01:27:29,570

molecular sized creature
 

4341
01:28:25,800 --> 01:28:28,129
molecular sized creature
and it could watch the molecules coming

4342
01:28:28,129 --> 01:28:28,139
and it could watch the molecules coming
 

4343
01:28:28,139 --> 01:28:30,169
and it could watch the molecules coming
and when a fast molecule is coming it

4344
01:28:30,169 --> 01:28:30,179
and when a fast molecule is coming it
 

4345
01:28:30,179 --> 01:28:32,689
and when a fast molecule is coming it
opens the door when a slow molecule is

4346
01:28:32,689 --> 01:28:32,699
opens the door when a slow molecule is
 

4347
01:28:32,699 --> 01:28:34,669
opens the door when a slow molecule is
coming it closes the door

4348
01:28:34,669 --> 01:28:34,679
coming it closes the door
 

4349
01:28:34,679 --> 01:28:37,610
coming it closes the door
after it does that for a while one side

4350
01:28:37,610 --> 01:28:37,620
after it does that for a while one side
 

4351
01:28:37,620 --> 01:28:40,189
after it does that for a while one side
is hot one is cold when something is hot

4352
01:28:40,189 --> 01:28:40,199
is hot one is cold when something is hot
 

4353
01:28:40,199 --> 01:28:43,010
is hot one is cold when something is hot
and is cold you can make an engine and

4354
01:28:43,010 --> 01:28:43,020
and is cold you can make an engine and
 

4355
01:28:43,020 --> 01:28:45,050
and is cold you can make an engine and
so you close that you make an engine and

4356
01:28:45,050 --> 01:28:45,060
so you close that you make an engine and
 

4357
01:28:45,060 --> 01:28:47,030
so you close that you make an engine and
you make energy

4358
01:28:47,030 --> 01:28:47,040
you make energy
 

4359
01:28:47,040 --> 01:28:51,290
you make energy
so the demon is violating thermodynamics

4360
01:28:51,290 --> 01:28:51,300
so the demon is violating thermodynamics
 

4361
01:28:51,300 --> 01:28:53,750
so the demon is violating thermodynamics
because it's it's not it's never

4362

it can make arbitrary amounts of energy

4368
01:29:01,610 --> 01:29:01,620
it can make arbitrary amounts of energy
 

4369
01:29:01,620 --> 01:29:03,890
it can make arbitrary amounts of energy
and power a machine and in

01:29:03,890 --> 01:29:03,900
and power a machine and in
 

4371
01:29:03,900 --> 01:29:05,510
and power a machine and in
thermodynamics you can't do that so

4372
01:29:05,510 --> 01:29:05,520
thermodynamics you can't do that so
 

4373
01:29:05,520 --> 01:29:07,189
thermodynamics you can't do that so
that's Maxwell's demon

4374
01:29:07,189 --> 01:29:07,199
that's Maxwell's demon

01:29:18,360 --> 01:29:20,050
hours so uh Leo zillard
uh around

uh around
 

4385
01:29:20,060 --> 01:29:26,209
uh around
early 1900s was a deep physicist who

4386
01:29:26,209 --> 01:29:26,219
early 1900s was a deep physicist who
 

4387
01:29:26,219 --> 01:29:30,310
early 1900s was a deep physicist who
then had a lot to do with also

4388
01:29:30,310 --> 01:29:30,320
then had a lot to do with also
 

4389
01:29:30,320 --> 01:29:35,270
then had a lot to do with also
post-war anti-nuclear things but he

4390
01:29:35,270 --> 01:29:35,280
post-war anti-nuclear things but he
 

4391
01:29:35,280 --> 01:29:38,030
post-war anti-nuclear things but he
reduced Maxwell's demon to a single

4392
01:29:38,030 --> 01:29:38,040
reduced Maxwell's demon to a single
 

4393
01:29:38,040 --> 01:29:40,610
reduced Maxwell's demon to a single
molecule so the molecule one there's

4394
01:29:40,610 --> 01:29:40,620
molecule so the molecule one there's
 

4395
01:29:40,620 --> 01:29:42,410
molecule so the molecule one there's
only one molecule and the question is

4396
01:29:42,410 --> 01:29:42,420
only one molecule and the question is
 

4397
01:29:42,420 --> 01:29:44,830
only one molecule and the question is
which side of the partition is it on

4398
01:29:44,830 --> 01:29:44,840
which side of the partition is it on
 

4399
01:29:44,840 --> 01:29:48,229
which side of the partition is it on
that led to the idea of one bit of

4400
01:29:48,229 --> 01:29:48,239
that led to the idea of one bit of

um for many years people tried to
 

4409
01:29:59,100 --> 01:30:02,209

explain Maxwell's demon by like the

colleagues I mentioned at IBM
 

4423
01:30:16,440 --> 01:30:19,070
colleagues I mentioned at IBM
finally solve the problem

4424
01:30:19,070 --> 01:30:19,080
finally solve the problem
 

4425
01:30:19,080 --> 01:30:22,490
finally solve the problem
he showed that you can explain Maxwell's

4426
01:30:22,490 --> 01:30:22,500
he showed that you can explain Maxwell's
 

4427
01:30:22,500 --> 01:30:23,770
he showed that you can explain Maxwell's
demon

4428
01:30:23,770 --> 01:30:23,780
demon
 

4429
01:30:23,780 --> 01:30:29,410
demon
by you need the mind of the demon

4430
01:30:29,410 --> 01:30:29,420

 

4431
01:30:29,420 --> 01:30:32,330

when the demon opened and closes the

4432
01:30:32,330 --> 01:30:32,340
when the demon opened and closes the
 

4433
01:30:32,340 --> 01:30:35,870
when the demon opened and closes the
door as long as it remembers what it did

4434
01:30:35,870 --> 01:30:35,880
door as long as it remembers what it did
 

4435
01:30:35,880 --> 01:30:39,470
door as long as it remembers what it did
you can run the whole thing backwards

4436
01:30:39,470 --> 01:30:39,480
you can run the whole thing backwards
 

4437
01:30:39,480 --> 01:30:42,649
you can run the whole thing backwards
but when the demon forgets

4438
01:30:42,649 --> 01:30:42,659
but when the demon forgets
 

4439
01:30:42,659 --> 01:30:45,770
but when the demon forgets
then you can't run it backwards

4440
01:30:45,770 --> 01:30:45,780
then you can't run it backwards
 

4441
01:30:45,780 --> 01:30:49,370
then you can't run it backwards
and that's where you get dissipation and

4442
01:30:49,370 --> 01:30:49,380
and that's where you get dissipation and
 

4443
01:30:49,380 --> 01:30:51,050
and that's where you get dissipation and
that's where you get the violation of

4444
01:30:51,050 --> 01:30:51,060
that's where you get the violation of
 

4445
01:30:51,060 --> 01:30:53,510
that's where you get the violation of
thermodynamics and so the explanation of

4446
01:30:53,510 --> 01:30:53,520
thermodynamics and so the explanation of
 

4447
01:30:53,520 --> 01:30:55,910
thermodynamics and so the explanation of
Maxwell's demon is that it's it's in the

4448
01:30:55,910 --> 01:30:55,920
Maxwell's demon is that it's it's in the
 

4449
01:30:55,920 --> 01:30:58,689
Maxwell's demon is that it's it's in the
Demon's brain so then

4450
01:30:58,689 --> 01:30:58,699
Demon's brain so then

Ross Khalid colleague Charlie at IBM
uh then shocked Ralph by showing you can

4454
01:31:06,950 --> 01:31:06,960
uh then shocked Ralph by showing you can
 

4455
01:31:06,960 --> 01:31:10,010
uh then shocked Ralph by showing you can
compute with arbitrarily low energy

4456
01:31:10,010 --> 01:31:10,020
compute with arbitrarily low energy
 

4457
01:31:10,020 --> 01:31:12,649
compute with arbitrarily low energy
so one of the things that's not well

4458
01:31:12,649 --> 01:31:12,659
so one of the things that's not well
 

4459
01:31:12,659 --> 01:31:16,850
so one of the things that's not well
covered is the the big computers used

4460
01:31:16,850 --> 01:31:16,860
covered is the the big computers used
 

4461
01:31:16,860 --> 01:31:19,729
covered is the the big computers used
for big machine learning the data

4462
01:31:19,729 --> 01:31:19,739
for big machine learning the data
 

4463
01:31:19,739 --> 01:31:22,010
for big machine learning the data
centers use tens of megawatts of power

4464
01:31:22,010 --> 01:31:22,020
centers use tens of megawatts of power
 

4465
01:31:22,020 --> 01:31:25,010
centers use tens of megawatts of power
they use as much power as a city

4466
01:31:25,010 --> 01:31:25,020
they use as much power as a city
 

4467
01:31:25,020 --> 01:31:26,990
they use as much power as a city
um Charlie showed you can actually

4468
01:31:26,990 --> 01:31:27,000
um Charlie showed you can actually
 

4469
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,689
um Charlie showed you can actually
compute with arbitrarily low amounts of

4470
01:31:29,689 --> 01:31:29,699

01:31:32,629 --> 01:31:32,639
by making computers that can go
 

4475
01:31:32,639 --> 01:31:35,570
by making computers that can go
backwards as well as forwards

4476
01:31:35,570 --> 01:31:35,580
backwards as well as forwards
 

4477
01:31:35,580 --> 01:31:38,209
backwards as well as forwards
and what limits the speed of the

4478
01:31:38,209 --> 01:31:38,219
and what limits the speed of the
 

4479
01:31:38,219 --> 01:31:40,129
and what limits the speed of the
computer is

4480
01:31:40,129 --> 01:31:40,139
computer is

01:31:40,139 --> 01:31:42,890
computer is
how fast you want an answer and how

4482
01:31:42,890 --> 01:31:42,900
how fast you want an answer and how
 

4483
01:31:42,900 --> 01:31:44,930
how fast you want an answer and how
certain you want the answer to be

4484
01:31:44,930 --> 01:31:44,940
certain you want the answer to be
 

4485
01:31:44,940 --> 01:31:47,209
certain you want the answer to be
but where orders of magnitude away from

4486
01:31:47,209 --> 01:31:47,219
but where orders of magnitude away from
 

4487
01:31:47,219 --> 01:31:49,370
but where orders of magnitude away from
that so I have a student Cameron working

4488
01:31:49,370 --> 01:31:49,380
that so I have a student Cameron working
 

4489
01:31:49,380 --> 01:31:50,810
that so I have a student Cameron working
with Lincoln Labs on making

4490
01:31:50,810 --> 01:31:50,820
with Lincoln Labs on making
 

4491
01:31:50,820 --> 01:31:54,649
with Lincoln Labs on making
superconducting computers that operate

4492
01:31:54,649 --> 01:31:54,659
superconducting computers that operate
 

4493
01:31:54,659 --> 01:31:57,229
superconducting computers that operate
near this land hour limit that are

4494
01:31:57,229 --> 01:31:57,239
near this land hour limit that are
 

4495
01:31:57,239 --> 01:32:00,050
near this land hour limit that are
orders of magnitude more efficient

4496
01:32:00,050 --> 01:32:00,060
orders of magnitude more efficient
 

4497
01:32:00,060 --> 01:32:02,209
orders of magnitude more efficient
um so stepping back to all of that that

4498
01:32:02,209 --> 01:32:02,219
um so stepping back to all of that that
 

4499
01:32:02,219 --> 01:32:04,010
um so stepping back to all of that that

Maxwell's demon life exists because it

4506
01:32:11,510 --> 01:32:11,520
Maxwell's demon life exists because it
 

4507
01:32:11,520 --> 01:32:14,149
Maxwell's demon life exists because it

they can locally violate thermodynamics
 

4511
01:32:16,560 --> 01:32:18,709
they can locally violate thermodynamics
because of intelligence

4512
01:32:18,709 --> 01:32:18,719
because of intelligence
 

4513
01:32:18,719 --> 01:32:22,250
because of intelligence
and it's its molecular intelligence that

um there was

4544
01:33:02,629 --> 01:33:02,639
um there was
 

4545
01:33:02,639 --> 01:33:04,490
um there was
Automation and that was going to change

4546
01:33:04,490 --> 01:33:04,500
Automation and that was going to change
 

4547
01:33:04,500 --> 01:33:06,169

systems
 

4551
01:33:07,980 --> 01:33:11,629
systems
um uh there was then the you know the

4552
01:33:11,629 --> 01:33:11,639
um uh there was then the you know the
 

4553
01:33:11,639 --> 01:33:13,310
um uh there was then the you know the
first phase of the neural network

01:33:13,310 --> 01:33:13,320
first phase of the neural network
 

4555
01:33:13,320 --> 01:33:16,490
first phase of the neural network
systems there's been about five of these

4556
01:33:16,490 --> 01:33:16,500
systems there's been about five of these
 

4557
01:33:16,500 --> 01:33:19,550
systems there's been about five of these
um in each case on the slope up it's

4558
01:33:19,550 --> 01:33:19,560
um in each case on the slope up it's
 

4559
01:33:19,560 --> 01:33:21,770
um in each case on the slope up it's
going to change everything

4560
01:33:21,770 --> 01:33:21,780
going to change everything
 

4561
01:33:21,780 --> 01:33:23,629
going to change everything
um in each case what happens is on the

4562
01:33:23,629 --> 01:33:23,639
um in each case what happens is on the
 

4563
01:33:23,639 --> 01:33:25,970
um in each case what happens is on the
slope down

4564
01:33:25,970 --> 01:33:25,980
slope down
 

4565
01:33:25,980 --> 01:33:28,850
slope down
um we sort of move the goal posts and it

4566
01:33:28,850 --> 01:33:28,860
um we sort of move the goal posts and it
 

4567
01:33:28,860 --> 01:33:30,530
um we sort of move the goal posts and it
becomes sort of irrelevant so a good

4571
01:33:34,440 --> 01:33:35,689
example is going up computer chess was
going to change everything once

4572
01:33:35,689 --> 01:33:35,699
going to change everything once
 

4573
01:33:35,699 --> 01:33:36,830
going to change everything once
computers could play chess that

4574
01:33:36,830 --> 01:33:36,840
computers could play chess that
 

4575
01:33:36,840 --> 01:33:38,990
computers could play chess that
fundamentally changes the world now on

01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:40,810
fundamentally changes the world now on
the downside computers play chess

4578
01:33:40,810 --> 01:33:40,820
the downside computers play chess
 

4579
01:33:40,820 --> 01:33:43,490
the downside computers play chess
winning at chess is no longer seen as a

01:33:43,500 --> 01:33:45,470
winning at chess is no longer seen as a
unique human thing but

4582
01:33:45,470 --> 01:33:45,480
unique human thing but
 

4583
01:33:45,480 --> 01:33:48,950
unique human thing but
um uh people still play chess this new

4584
01:33:48,950 --> 01:33:48,960
um uh people still play chess this new
 

4585
01:33:48,960 --> 01:33:50,990
um uh people still play chess this new
phase is going to take a new chunk of

4587
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:52,189

things that we thought computers

4588
01:33:52,189 --> 01:33:52,199
things that we thought computers
 

4589
01:33:52,199 --> 01:33:54,169
things that we thought computers
couldn't do now computers will be able

4590
01:33:54,169 --> 01:33:54,179
couldn't do now computers will be able
 

4591
01:33:54,179 --> 01:33:55,490
couldn't do now computers will be able
to do they have roughly our brain

4592
01:33:55,490 --> 01:33:55,500
to do they have roughly our brain

um but you know we'll keep thinking as

4596
01:33:59,870 --> 01:33:59,880
um but you know we'll keep thinking as
 

4597
01:33:59,880 --> 01:34:02,090
um but you know we'll keep thinking as
well as computers

4598
01:34:02,090 --> 01:34:02,100
well as computers
 

4599
01:34:02,100 --> 01:34:04,370
well as computers
um and as I described wow we've been

4600
01:34:04,370 --> 01:34:04,380
um and as I described wow we've been
 

4601
01:34:04,380 --> 01:34:06,290
um and as I described wow we've been
going through these five boom busts if

4602
01:34:06,290 --> 01:34:06,300
going through these five boom busts if
 

4603
01:34:06,300 --> 01:34:08,149
going through these five boom busts if
you just look at the numbers of Ops per

4604
01:34:08,149 --> 01:34:08,159
you just look at the numbers of Ops per
 

4605
01:34:08,159 --> 01:34:10,970
you just look at the numbers of Ops per
second bits storage bits of i o That's

4606
01:34:10,970 --> 01:34:10,980
second bits storage bits of i o That's
 

4607
01:34:10,980 --> 01:34:12,470
second bits storage bits of i o That's
the more interesting one that's been

4608
01:34:12,470 --> 01:34:12,480
the more interesting one that's been
 

4609
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:14,090

in Quantum Computing Quantum information
 

4735
01:36:50,060 --> 01:36:52,970
in Quantum Computing Quantum information
you need Quantum coherence

4736
01:36:52,970 --> 01:36:52,980
you need Quantum coherence
 

4737
01:36:52,980 --> 01:36:55,729
you need Quantum coherence
and there's a lot of muddled thinking

4738
01:36:55,729 --> 01:36:55,739
and there's a lot of muddled thinking

of quantum Computing that garbles just
 

4745
01:37:03,080 --> 01:37:05,810
of quantum Computing that garbles just
Quantum coherence that

Quantum coherence that
 

4747
01:37:05,820 --> 01:37:09,110
Quantum coherence that
um that you can think of it as a wave

4748
01:37:09,110 --> 01:37:09,120
um that you can think of it as a wave
 

4749
01:37:09,120 --> 01:37:10,729
um that you can think of it as a wave
that has very special properties but

4750
01:37:10,729 --> 01:37:10,739
that has very special properties but
 

4751
01:37:10,739 --> 01:37:13,790
that has very special properties but
these wave like properties and so

4752
01:37:13,790 --> 01:37:13,800
these wave like properties and so
 

4753
01:37:13,800 --> 01:37:17,030
these wave like properties and so
there's a small set of places where

4754
01:37:17,030 --> 01:37:17,040
there's a small set of places where
 

4755
01:37:17,040 --> 01:37:19,910
there's a small set of places where
biology uses quantum mechanics in that

4756
01:37:19,910 --> 01:37:19,920
biology uses quantum mechanics in that
 

4757
01:37:19,920 --> 01:37:24,050
biology uses quantum mechanics in that

01:37:40,629 --> 01:37:40,639
how they sense magnetic fields
 

4773
01:37:40,639 --> 01:37:43,729
how they sense magnetic fields
that involves the coupling between a

01:37:43,729 --> 01:37:43,739
that involves the coupling between a
 

4775
01:37:43,739 --> 01:37:45,729
that involves the coupling between a
very weak energy with a magnetic field

coupling into chemical reactions and
 

4779
01:37:48,300 --> 01:37:51,669

there's a beautiful system it

4780
01:37:51,669 --> 01:37:51,679
there's a beautiful system it
 

4781
01:37:51,679 --> 01:37:56,270
there's a beautiful system it
standard in chemistry is magnetic fields

like this can influence chemistry but

4784
01:37:58,490 --> 01:37:58,500
like this can influence chemistry but
 

4785
01:37:58,500 --> 01:38:00,470
like this can influence chemistry but
there are biological circuits that are

4786
01:38:00,470 --> 01:38:00,480
there are biological circuits that are
 

4787
01:38:00,480 --> 01:38:02,330
there are biological circuits that are
carefully balanced with two Pathways

4788
01:38:02,330 --> 01:38:02,340
carefully balanced with two Pathways
 

4789
01:38:02,340 --> 01:38:04,070

4791
01:38:04,080 --> 01:38:06,709
that become unbalanced with magnetic
fields so each of these areas are

4792
01:38:06,709 --> 01:38:06,719
fields so each of these areas are
 

4793
01:38:06,719 --> 01:38:09,110
fields so each of these areas are
expensive for biology it has to consume

diverged off so deep neural networks

4830
01:38:57,410 --> 01:38:57,420
diverged off so deep neural networks
 

4831
01:38:57,420 --> 01:39:01,129
diverged off so deep neural networks

and that that exponential is what gives
 

4855
01:39:29,520 --> 01:39:31,970
and that that exponential is what gives
the power to deep networks but what's

01:39:31,970 --> 01:39:31,980
the power to deep networks but what's
 

4857
01:39:31,980 --> 01:39:35,149
the power to deep networks but what's
interesting is the sort of lessons about

they look like they grew in a forest
 

4985
01:42:07,020 --> 01:42:08,510
they look like they grew in a forest
because that's sort of exactly what they

4986

because that's sort of exactly what they
 

4987
01:42:08,520 --> 01:42:10,850
because that's sort of exactly what they
are that they're they're they're solving

4991
01:42:13,199 --> 01:42:14,750
the ways of how you handle loads in the
same way biology does and so you get

4992
01:42:14,750 --> 01:42:14,760
same way biology does and so you get
 

4993
01:42:14,760 --> 01:42:17,090
same way biology does and so you get
things that look like trees and shells

4994

things that look like trees and shells
 

4995
01:42:17,100 --> 01:42:19,189
things that look like trees and shells
and all of that and so that's a Peak at

4996
01:42:19,189 --> 01:42:19,199
and all of that and so that's a Peak at
 

4997

01:44:32,280 --> 01:44:35,810
predict they're actually in a deep
reason they are unsolvable

5098
01:44:35,810 --> 01:44:35,820
reason they are unsolvable

01:44:35,820 --> 01:44:37,850
reason they are unsolvable
um Chris Moore showed it's very easy to

5100
01:44:37,850 --> 01:44:37,860
um Chris Moore showed it's very easy to
 

5101
01:44:37,860 --> 01:44:39,770
um Chris Moore showed it's very easy to
make physical systems that are

5102
01:44:39,770 --> 01:44:39,780
make physical systems that are
 

5103
01:44:39,780 --> 01:44:41,810
make physical systems that are
uncomputable that what what the physics

5104
01:44:41,810 --> 01:44:41,820
uncomputable that what what the physics
 

5105
01:44:41,820 --> 01:44:43,189
uncomputable that what what the physics
system does

5106
01:44:43,189 --> 01:44:43,199
system does
 

5107
01:44:43,199 --> 01:44:45,770
system does
just bouncing balls and surfaces you can

5108
01:44:45,770 --> 01:44:45,780
just bouncing balls and surfaces you can
 

5109
01:44:45,780 --> 01:44:47,689
just bouncing balls and surfaces you can
make systems that solve uncomputable

5110
01:44:47,689 --> 01:44:47,699
make systems that solve uncomputable
 

5111
01:44:47,699 --> 01:44:51,530
make systems that solve uncomputable
problems and so almost any non-trivial

5112
01:44:51,530 --> 01:44:51,540
problems and so almost any non-trivial
 

5113
01:44:51,540 --> 01:44:53,330
problems and so almost any non-trivial
physical system is computationally

5114
01:44:53,330 --> 01:44:53,340
physical system is computationally
 

5115
01:44:53,340 --> 01:44:54,649
physical system is computationally
universal

5116
01:44:54,649 --> 01:44:54,659
universal
 

5117
01:44:54,659 --> 01:44:56,209
universal
so the first part of the answer to your

5118
01:44:56,209 --> 01:44:56,219
so the first part of the answer to your
 

5119
01:44:56,219 --> 01:44:59,870
so the first part of the answer to your
question is this comes back to how you

5120
01:44:59,870 --> 01:44:59,880
question is this comes back to how you
 

5121
01:44:59,880 --> 01:45:00,950
question is this comes back to how you
know my comment about how do you

5122
01:45:00,950 --> 01:45:00,960
know my comment about how do you
 

5123
01:45:00,960 --> 01:45:04,370
know my comment about how do you
bootstrap a civilization you just don't

5124
01:45:04,370 --> 01:45:04,380
bootstrap a civilization you just don't
 

5125
01:45:04,380 --> 01:45:05,870
bootstrap a civilization you just don't
need much to be computationally

5126
01:45:05,870 --> 01:45:05,880
need much to be computationally
 

5127
01:45:05,880 --> 01:45:08,330
need much to be computationally
Universal so then

5128
01:45:08,330 --> 01:45:08,340
Universal so then
 

5129
01:45:08,340 --> 01:45:11,830
Universal so then
that there isn't today a notion of like

5130
01:45:11,830 --> 01:45:11,840
that there isn't today a notion of like
 

5131
01:45:11,840 --> 01:45:14,390
that there isn't today a notion of like
fabricational universality or

5132
01:45:14,390 --> 01:45:14,400
fabricational universality or
 

5133
01:45:14,400 --> 01:45:17,030
fabricational universality or
fabricational complexity the sort of

5134
01:45:17,030 --> 01:45:17,040
fabricational complexity the sort of
 

5135
01:45:17,040 --> 01:45:19,609
fabricational complexity the sort of
numbers I've been giving you about you

5136
01:45:19,609 --> 01:45:19,619
numbers I've been giving you about you
 

5137
01:45:19,619 --> 01:45:22,250
numbers I've been giving you about you
eating lunch versus the chip Fab sort of

5138
01:45:22,250 --> 01:45:22,260
eating lunch versus the chip Fab sort of
 

5139
01:45:22,260 --> 01:45:25,250
eating lunch versus the chip Fab sort of
that that that's in the same Spirit of

5140
01:45:25,250 --> 01:45:25,260
that that that's in the same Spirit of
 

5141
01:45:25,260 --> 01:45:28,189
that that that's in the same Spirit of
what Shannon did but once you connect

5142
01:45:28,189 --> 01:45:28,199
what Shannon did but once you connect
 

5143
01:45:28,199 --> 01:45:30,609
what Shannon did but once you connect
computational

5144
01:45:30,609 --> 01:45:30,619

universality to kind of fabricational

5146
01:45:33,550 --> 01:45:33,560
universality to kind of fabricational
 

5147
01:45:33,560 --> 01:45:37,310
universality to kind of fabricational
universality you then get the ability to

5148
01:45:37,310 --> 01:45:37,320
universality you then get the ability to
 

5149
01:45:37,320 --> 01:45:40,310
universality you then get the ability to
grow and adapt and evolve

5150
01:45:40,310 --> 01:45:40,320
grow and adapt and evolve
 

5151
01:45:40,320 --> 01:45:42,169
grow and adapt and evolve
because that Evolution happens in the

5152
01:45:42,169 --> 01:45:42,179
because that Evolution happens in the
 

5153
01:45:42,179 --> 01:45:44,510
because that Evolution happens in the
physical space yeah and so that's why

5154
01:45:44,510 --> 01:45:44,520
physical space yeah and so that's why
 

5155
01:45:44,520 --> 01:45:46,850
physical space yeah and so that's why
you know for me the heart of this whole

5156
01:45:46,850 --> 01:45:46,860
you know for me the heart of this whole
 

5157
01:45:46,860 --> 01:45:50,930
you know for me the heart of this whole

come back to that

5160
01:45:52,970 --> 01:45:52,980
come back to that
 

5161
01:45:52,980 --> 01:45:53,570
come back to that
um

5162
01:45:53,570 --> 01:45:53,580
um
 

5163
01:45:53,580 --> 01:45:56,870
um
what touring

5164
01:45:56,870 --> 01:45:56,880
what touring
 

5165
01:45:56,880 --> 01:46:00,229
what touring
ended his sadly cut short life

5166
01:46:00,229 --> 01:46:00,239

studying
 

5169
01:46:01,940 --> 01:46:06,169
studying
was how genes give rise to form so so

5170
01:46:06,169 --> 01:46:06,179
was how genes give rise to form so so
 

5171
01:46:06,179 --> 01:46:09,350
was how genes give rise to form so so
how the the the small amount of it

5172
01:46:09,350 --> 01:46:09,360
how the the the small amount of it
 

5173
01:46:09,360 --> 01:46:11,149
how the the the small amount of it
relatively in effect small amount of

01:46:11,149 --> 01:46:11,159
relatively in effect small amount of
 

5175
01:46:11,159 --> 01:46:13,010
relatively in effect small amount of
information in the genome can give rise

5176
01:46:13,010 --> 01:46:13,020
information in the genome can give rise
 

5177
01:46:13,020 --> 01:46:15,410
information in the genome can give rise
to the complexity of Who You Are

5178
01:46:15,410 --> 01:46:15,420
to the complexity of Who You Are
 

5179
01:46:15,420 --> 01:46:18,669
to the complexity of Who You Are
and and that that that's where

5180
01:46:18,669 --> 01:46:18,679
and and that that that's where
 

5181
01:46:18,679 --> 01:46:21,169
and and that that that's where
what resides is this molecular

5182
01:46:21,169 --> 01:46:21,179

5185
01:46:22,500 --> 01:46:25,370
intelligence
which is first how to describe you but

5186
01:46:25,370 --> 01:46:25,380
which is first how to describe you but
 

5187
01:46:25,380 --> 01:46:28,430
which is first how to describe you but
then how to describe you such that you

5188
01:46:28,430 --> 01:46:28,440
then how to describe you such that you
 

5189
01:46:28,440 --> 01:46:31,250
then how to describe you such that you
can exist and you can reproduce and you

5190
01:46:31,250 --> 01:46:31,260
can exist and you can reproduce and you
 

5191
01:46:31,260 --> 01:46:33,410
can exist and you can reproduce and you
can grow and you can evolve

5192
01:46:33,410 --> 01:46:33,420
can grow and you can evolve
 

5193
01:46:33,420 --> 01:46:36,109
can grow and you can evolve
and so you know that that's the seat of

5194
01:46:36,109 --> 01:46:36,119
and so you know that that's the seat of
 

5195
01:46:36,119 --> 01:46:38,629
and so you know that that's the seat of
our molecular intelligence

5196
01:46:38,629 --> 01:46:38,639
our molecular intelligence
 

5197
01:46:38,639 --> 01:46:42,169
our molecular intelligence
the make a revolution in biology yeah it

01:46:42,169 --> 01:46:42,179
the make a revolution in biology yeah it
 

5199
01:46:42,179 --> 01:46:44,090
the make a revolution in biology yeah it
really is

01:46:44,090 --> 01:46:44,100
really is
 

5201
01:46:44,100 --> 01:46:46,129
really is
um it really is and and that that's

5202
01:46:46,129 --> 01:46:46,139
um it really is and and that that's
 

5203
01:46:46,139 --> 01:46:49,310
um it really is and and that that's
where you can't separate communication

5204
01:46:49,310 --> 01:46:49,320
where you can't separate communication
 

5205
01:46:49,320 --> 01:46:51,410
where you can't separate communication
computation and Fabrication you can't

01:46:51,410 --> 01:46:51,420
computation and Fabrication you can't
 

5207
01:46:51,420 --> 01:46:53,209
computation and Fabrication you can't
separate computer science and physical

5208
01:46:53,209 --> 01:46:53,219
separate computer science and physical
 

5209
01:46:53,219 --> 01:46:55,250
separate computer science and physical
science you can't separate hardware and

5210
01:46:55,250 --> 01:46:55,260
science you can't separate hardware and
 

5211
01:46:55,260 --> 01:46:57,410
science you can't separate hardware and
software they all intersect right at

5212
01:46:57,410 --> 01:46:57,420
software they all intersect right at
 

5213
01:46:57,420 --> 01:46:59,450
software they all intersect right at
that place

5214
01:46:59,450 --> 01:46:59,460
that place
 

5215
01:46:59,460 --> 01:47:01,609
that place
do you think of our universe as just one

5216
01:47:01,609 --> 01:47:01,619
do you think of our universe as just one
 

5217
01:47:01,619 --> 01:47:04,430
do you think of our universe as just one
giant computation

I I would even kind of say Quantum

5220
01:47:07,310 --> 01:47:07,320
I I would even kind of say Quantum
 

5221
01:47:07,320 --> 01:47:10,189
I I would even kind of say Quantum
Computing is overhyped in that there's a

01:47:10,189 --> 01:47:10,199
Computing is overhyped in that there's a
 

5223
01:47:10,199 --> 01:47:11,750
Computing is overhyped in that there's a
few things Quantum Computing is going to

01:47:11,750 --> 01:47:11,760
few things Quantum Computing is going to
 

5225
01:47:11,760 --> 01:47:13,729
few things Quantum Computing is going to
be good at one is breaking crypto

5226
01:47:13,729 --> 01:47:13,739
be good at one is breaking crypto
 

5227
01:47:13,739 --> 01:47:14,930
be good at one is breaking crypto
systems but we know how to make new

01:47:14,930 --> 01:47:14,940
systems but we know how to make new
 

5229
01:47:14,940 --> 01:47:17,209

nanotechnology it's going to be powerful
 

5237
01:47:23,659 --> 01:47:26,629
nanotechnology it's going to be powerful
but Quantum Computing is not going to

5238
01:47:26,629 --> 01:47:26,639
but Quantum Computing is not going to
 

5239
01:47:26,639 --> 01:47:28,790
but Quantum Computing is not going to
disrupt and change everything

5240
01:47:28,790 --> 01:47:28,800
disrupt and change everything
 

5241
01:47:28,800 --> 01:47:32,030
disrupt and change everything
but the reason I say that is this

5242
01:47:32,030 --> 01:47:32,040
but the reason I say that is this
 

5243
01:47:32,040 --> 01:47:35,149
but the reason I say that is this
interesting group of strange people who

interesting group of strange people who
 

5245
01:47:35,159 --> 01:47:36,890
interesting group of strange people who
helped invent Quantum Computing before

one of the main reasons they did it
 

5251
01:47:42,119 --> 01:47:44,750
one of the main reasons they did it
wasn't to make a computer that can break

instead of starting with different
differential equations to get to Quantum

5418
01:51:11,930 --> 01:51:11,940
differential equations to get to Quantum
 

5419
01:51:11,940 --> 01:51:14,209
differential equations to get to Quantum
field theories and Quantum field

5420
01:51:14,209 --> 01:51:14,219
field theories and Quantum field
 

5421
01:51:14,219 --> 01:51:15,780
field theories and Quantum field
theories you get to quantization

5422
01:51:15,780 --> 01:51:15,790
theories you get to quantization
 

5423
01:51:15,790 --> 01:51:17,330

01:51:20,030 --> 01:51:20,040
um if you if if you start from

01:51:20,040 --> 01:51:22,129
um if you if if you start from
computation information you begin sort

5428
01:51:22,129 --> 01:51:22,139
computation information you begin sort
 

5429
01:51:22,139 --> 01:51:24,410
computation information you begin sort
of quantized and you build up from there

5430
01:51:24,410 --> 01:51:24,420
of quantized and you build up from there
 

5431
01:51:24,420 --> 01:51:27,950
of quantized and you build up from there
and so that's the sense in which uh

5432
01:51:27,950 --> 01:51:27,960
and so that's the sense in which uh
 

5433
01:51:27,960 --> 01:51:30,410
and so that's the sense in which uh
uh absolutely I think about the universe

5434
01:51:30,410 --> 01:51:30,420
uh absolutely I think about the universe
 

5435
01:51:30,420 --> 01:51:32,570
uh absolutely I think about the universe

01:51:32,580 --> 01:51:35,270
as a computer the easy way to understand
that is

5438
01:51:35,270 --> 01:51:35,280
that is
 

5439
01:51:35,280 --> 01:51:37,729
that is
uh just almost anything is

5440
01:51:37,729 --> 01:51:37,739
uh just almost anything is
 

5441
01:51:37,739 --> 01:51:39,530
uh just almost anything is
computationally universal but the Deep

5442
01:51:39,530 --> 01:51:39,540

yeah I mean you know you have to love
 

5487
01:52:37,560 --> 01:52:40,149
yeah I mean you know you have to love
what you're doing and believe in it and

5488
01:52:40,149 --> 01:52:40,159
what you're doing and believe in it and
 

5489
01:52:40,159 --> 01:52:43,310
what you're doing and believe in it and
nothing else could possibly be what you

again it sounds naive but
 

5497
01:52:50,699 --> 01:52:53,750
again it sounds naive but
um it within like The Limited domain I'm

5498

that that's the key attribute to it and
 

5503
01:52:57,480 --> 01:52:58,729
that that's the key attribute to it and
then same sense

5504
01:52:58,729 --> 01:52:58,739
then same sense
 

5505
01:52:58,739 --> 01:53:02,090
then same sense
um if you take the sort of outliers

5506
01:53:02,090 --> 01:53:02,100
um if you take the sort of outliers
 

5507
01:53:02,100 --> 01:53:04,430
um if you take the sort of outliers
students were talking about you know 99

should have been doing yeah
 

5525
01:53:20,820 --> 01:53:24,709
should have been doing yeah
um and uh that they just sort of say I'm

5526
01:53:24,709 --> 01:53:24,719
um and uh that they just sort of say I'm
 

5527
01:53:24,719 --> 01:53:27,109
um and uh that they just sort of say I'm
here and and get to work and again

5528
01:53:27,109 --> 01:53:27,119
here and and get to work and again
 

5529
01:53:27,119 --> 01:53:28,970
here and and get to work and again
that's I I don't know how far this

5530
01:53:28,970 --> 01:53:28,980
that's I I don't know how far this
 

5531
01:53:28,980 --> 01:53:31,250
that's I I don't know how far this
resource goes so you know I've said I

5532
01:53:31,250 --> 01:53:31,260
resource goes so you know I've said I
 

5533
01:53:31,260 --> 01:53:33,590

these labs they come out of the woodwork
 

5543
01:53:42,060 --> 01:53:44,689
these labs they come out of the woodwork
they come we didn't create all these

5544
01:53:44,689 --> 01:53:44,699
they come we didn't create all these
 

5545

things I'm describing we tried to

5548
01:53:49,490 --> 01:53:49,500
things I'm describing we tried to
 

5549
01:53:49,500 --> 01:53:51,169
things I'm describing we tried to
partner everywhere with local schools

5550
01:53:51,169 --> 01:53:51,179
partner everywhere with local schools
 

5551
01:53:51,179 --> 01:53:52,790
partner everywhere with local schools
and local companies and kept tripping

5552

over dysfunction and find we had to

5554
01:53:54,470 --> 01:53:54,480
over dysfunction and find we had to
 

5555
01:53:54,480 --> 01:53:55,850
over dysfunction and find we had to
create the environment where people like

5556
01:53:55,850 --> 01:53:55,860
create the environment where people like
 

5557
01:53:55,860 --> 01:53:58,850
create the environment where people like
this can flourish and so I don't know if

5558
01:53:58,850 --> 01:53:58,860
this can flourish and so I don't know if
 

5559
01:53:58,860 --> 01:54:01,129
this can flourish and so I don't know if
this is everyone if it's one percent of

01:54:01,129 --> 01:54:01,139
this is everyone if it's one percent of
 

5561
01:54:01,139 --> 01:54:03,410
this is everyone if it's one percent of
society what the fraction is but it's so

5562
01:54:03,410 --> 01:54:03,420
society what the fraction is but it's so
 

5563
01:54:03,420 --> 01:54:06,169
society what the fraction is but it's so
many orders of magnitude bigger than we

5564
01:54:06,169 --> 01:54:06,179
many orders of magnitude bigger than we
 

5565
01:54:06,179 --> 01:54:07,850
many orders of magnitude bigger than we
see today you know we've been racing to

5566
01:54:07,850 --> 01:54:07,860
see today you know we've been racing to
 

5567
01:54:07,860 --> 01:54:09,290
see today you know we've been racing to

I mean the thing that gives me most hope

5574
01:54:15,470 --> 01:54:15,480
I mean the thing that gives me most hope
 

5575
01:54:15,480 --> 01:54:19,189
I mean the thing that gives me most hope
for the future is that population once a

01:54:19,189 --> 01:54:19,199
for the future is that population once a
 

5577

year this whole Lab Network meets and
 

5579
01:54:21,360 --> 01:54:22,669
year this whole Lab Network meets and
it's my favorite Gathering it's in

5580
01:54:22,669 --> 01:54:22,679
it's my favorite Gathering it's in
 

5581
01:54:22,679 --> 01:54:25,729
it's my favorite Gathering it's in
Bhutan this year because it's it's every

all those packages it's it's the same
 

5589
01:54:33,239 --> 01:54:35,270
all those packages it's it's the same
sense of bright inventive joy and

5590
01:54:35,270 --> 01:54:35,280
sense of bright inventive joy and
 

5591
01:54:35,280 --> 01:54:36,770
sense of bright inventive joy and
discovery

5592
01:54:36,770 --> 01:54:36,780
discovery
 

5593
01:54:36,780 --> 01:54:38,629

if there's people listening to this in

5594
01:54:38,629 --> 01:54:38,639
if there's people listening to this in
 

5595
01:54:38,639 --> 01:54:40,910
if there's people listening to this in
there just uh overwhelmed with how

5596
01:54:40,910 --> 01:54:40,920
there just uh overwhelmed with how
 

5597
01:54:40,920 --> 01:54:42,590
there just uh overwhelmed with how
exciting this is which I think they

5598
01:54:42,590 --> 01:54:42,600
exciting this is which I think they
 

5599
01:54:42,600 --> 01:54:44,570
exciting this is which I think they
would be how can they participate how

5600
01:54:44,570 --> 01:54:44,580
would be how can they participate how
 

5601
01:54:44,580 --> 01:54:46,550
would be how can they participate how
can they help how can they encourage

5602
01:54:46,550 --> 01:54:46,560
can they help how can they encourage
 

5603
01:54:46,560 --> 01:54:49,910
can they help how can they encourage
young people or themselves to uh to

5604
01:54:49,910 --> 01:54:49,920
young people or themselves to uh to
 

5605
01:54:49,920 --> 01:54:51,290
young people or themselves to uh to
build stuff to create stuff yeah that's

5606
01:54:51,290 --> 01:54:51,300
build stuff to create stuff yeah that's
 

5607
01:54:51,300 --> 01:54:52,910
build stuff to create stuff yeah that's
a great question so

5608
01:54:52,910 --> 01:54:52,920
a great question so
 

5609
01:54:52,920 --> 01:54:54,410
a great question so
um the

5610
01:54:54,410 --> 01:54:54,420
um the
 

5611
01:54:54,420 --> 01:54:58,370

in this Fab Lab Network you can think of

5618
01:55:03,950 --> 01:55:03,960
in this Fab Lab Network you can think of
 

5619
01:55:03,960 --> 01:55:05,810
in this Fab Lab Network you can think of
as a curated part that works as a

5620
01:55:05,810 --> 01:55:05,820
as a curated part that works as a
 

5621
01:55:05,820 --> 01:55:09,470
as a curated part that works as a
network so you don't benefit in a gym if

5622
01:55:09,470 --> 01:55:09,480
network so you don't benefit in a gym if
 

5623
01:55:09,480 --> 01:55:12,109
network so you don't benefit in a gym if
somebody exercises in another gym but in

01:55:12,109 --> 01:55:12,119
somebody exercises in another gym but in
 

5625
01:55:12,119 --> 01:55:14,450
somebody exercises in another gym but in
the Fab Network and if you do in a sense

5626
01:55:14,450 --> 01:55:14,460
the Fab Network and if you do in a sense
 

5627
01:55:14,460 --> 01:55:15,950
the Fab Network and if you do in a sense
benefit when somebody works in another

5628
01:55:15,950 --> 01:55:15,960
benefit when somebody works in another
 

5629

um from one to a thousand we carefully
 

5667
01:55:59,820 --> 01:56:01,669
um from one to a thousand we carefully
counted Labs now we're going from a

01:56:01,669 --> 01:56:01,679
counted Labs now we're going from a
 

5669
01:56:01,679 --> 01:56:04,010
counted Labs now we're going from a
thousand to a million where it ceases to

uh what's interesting about that stage

5676
01:56:10,030 --> 01:56:10,040
uh what's interesting about that stage
 

5677
01:56:10,040 --> 01:56:13,790
uh what's interesting about that stage
is uh technologically you go to a lab

5678
01:56:13,790 --> 01:56:13,800
is uh technologically you go to a lab
 

5679
01:56:13,800 --> 01:56:15,530
is uh technologically you go to a lab
not to get access to the machine but you

5680
01:56:15,530 --> 01:56:15,540
not to get access to the machine but you
 

5681
01:56:15,540 --> 01:56:17,689
not to get access to the machine but you
go to the lab to make the machine

5682
01:56:17,689 --> 01:56:17,699
go to the lab to make the machine
 

5683
01:56:17,699 --> 01:56:19,970
go to the lab to make the machine
but the other thing interesting in it

5684
01:56:19,970 --> 01:56:19,980
but the other thing interesting in it
 

5685
01:56:19,980 --> 01:56:22,209
but the other thing interesting in it
is we have an interesting collaboration

5686
01:56:22,209 --> 01:56:22,219
is we have an interesting collaboration
 

5687
01:56:22,219 --> 01:56:26,209
is we have an interesting collaboration
on a a Fab Lab in a box

5688
01:56:26,209 --> 01:56:26,219
on a a Fab Lab in a box
 

5689
01:56:26,219 --> 01:56:27,830
on a a Fab Lab in a box
and

5690
01:56:27,830 --> 01:56:27,840
and
 

5691
01:56:27,840 --> 01:56:30,109
and
um this came out of a collaboration with

5692
01:56:30,109 --> 01:56:30,119
um this came out of a collaboration with
 

5693
01:56:30,119 --> 01:56:33,350
um this came out of a collaboration with
SolidWorks on how you can put a Fab Lab

5694
01:56:33,350 --> 01:56:33,360
SolidWorks on how you can put a Fab Lab
 

5695
01:56:33,360 --> 01:56:36,830
SolidWorks on how you can put a Fab Lab
in a box which is not just the tools but

5696
01:56:36,830 --> 01:56:36,840
in a box which is not just the tools but
 

5697
01:56:36,840 --> 01:56:40,010
in a box which is not just the tools but
the knowledge so you open the box and

5698
01:56:40,010 --> 01:56:40,020
the knowledge so you open the box and
 

5699
01:56:40,020 --> 01:56:42,470
the knowledge so you open the box and
the box contains the knowledge of how to

5700
01:56:42,470 --> 01:56:42,480
the box contains the knowledge of how to
 

5701
01:56:42,480 --> 01:56:45,530
the box contains the knowledge of how to
use it as well as the tools within it

5702
01:56:45,530 --> 01:56:45,540
use it as well as the tools within it
 

5703
01:56:45,540 --> 01:56:47,570
use it as well as the tools within it
so that the knowledge can propagate and

5704
01:56:47,570 --> 01:56:47,580
so that the knowledge can propagate and
 

5705
01:56:47,580 --> 01:56:48,649
so that the knowledge can propagate and
so we have an interesting group of

5706
01:56:48,649 --> 01:56:48,659
so we have an interesting group of
 

5707
01:56:48,659 --> 01:56:51,350
so we have an interesting group of
people working on you know the original

5708
01:56:51,350 --> 01:56:51,360
people working on you know the original

involved in the setting up and training
 

5713
01:56:55,920 --> 01:56:58,729
involved in the setting up and training
and the Fab Academy is a real in-depth

deep technical program in the training
 

5717
01:57:00,540 --> 01:57:04,129
deep technical program in the training
but in this next phase how sort of the

5718
01:57:04,129 --> 01:57:04,139
but in this next phase how sort of the
 

5719
01:57:04,139 --> 01:57:06,350
but in this next phase how sort of the
lab itself knows how to do the lab that

5720
01:57:06,350 --> 01:57:06,360
lab itself knows how to do the lab that
 

5721

that it's you know it we've talked
 

5723
01:57:09,659 --> 01:57:12,229
that it's you know it we've talked
deeply about the intelligence in

01:57:12,229 --> 01:57:12,239
deeply about the intelligence in
 

5725
01:57:12,239 --> 01:57:13,729
deeply about the intelligence in
fabrication but in a much more

02:00:45,440 --> 02:00:48,890
society is the way that we can't do that
the act of shaping our environment

5892
02:00:48,890 --> 02:00:48,900
the act of shaping our environment
 

5893
02:00:48,900 --> 02:00:51,109
the act of shaping our environment
touches something really really deep

5894
02:00:51,109 --> 02:00:51,119
touches something really really deep
 

5895
02:00:51,119 --> 02:00:54,290
touches something really really deep
that gets to the essence of Who We Are

5896
02:00:54,290 --> 02:00:54,300
that gets to the essence of Who We Are
 

5897
02:00:54,300 --> 02:00:57,649
that gets to the essence of Who We Are
you know that's again why I say that in

5898
02:00:57,649 --> 02:00:57,659
you know that's again why I say that in
 

5899
02:00:57,659 --> 02:00:59,209
you know that's again why I say that in
a way the most important thing made in

5900
02:00:59,209 --> 02:00:59,219
a way the most important thing made in
 

5901
02:00:59,219 --> 02:01:02,109
a way the most important thing made in
made in these Labs is making itself

5902
02:01:02,109 --> 02:01:02,119
made in these Labs is making itself
 

5903
02:01:02,119 --> 02:01:04,189
made in these Labs is making itself
what do you think

5904
02:01:04,189 --> 02:01:04,199
what do you think
 

5905
02:01:04,199 --> 02:01:06,709
what do you think
if the shaping of our environment gets

5906
02:01:06,709 --> 02:01:06,719
if the shaping of our environment gets
 

5907
02:01:06,719 --> 02:01:08,089
if the shaping of our environment gets
something deep what do you think is the

5908
02:01:08,089 --> 02:01:08,099
something deep what do you think is the
 

5909
02:01:08,099 --> 02:01:10,550
something deep what do you think is the
meaning of it all what's the meaning of

5910
02:01:10,550 --> 02:01:10,560
meaning of it all what's the meaning of
 

5911
02:01:10,560 --> 02:01:12,050
meaning of it all what's the meaning of
life now

5912
02:01:12,050 --> 02:01:12,060
life now
 

5913
02:01:12,060 --> 02:01:14,089
life now
I can tell you

5914
02:01:14,089 --> 02:01:14,099
I can tell you
 

5915
02:01:14,099 --> 02:01:17,450
I can tell you
my insights into how life works

5916
02:01:17,450 --> 02:01:17,460
my insights into how life works
 

5917
02:01:17,460 --> 02:01:20,290
my insights into how life works
I can tell you in my insights and how to

5918
02:01:20,290 --> 02:01:20,300
I can tell you in my insights and how to
 

5919
02:01:20,300 --> 02:01:25,310
I can tell you in my insights and how to
make life meaningful and fulfilling

5920
02:01:25,310 --> 02:01:25,320
make life meaningful and fulfilling
 

5921
02:01:25,320 --> 02:01:27,830
make life meaningful and fulfilling
and sustainable

5922
02:01:27,830 --> 02:01:27,840
and sustainable
 

5923
02:01:27,840 --> 02:01:28,910
and sustainable
um

5924
02:01:28,910 --> 02:01:28,920
um
 

5925
02:01:28,920 --> 02:01:31,129
um
I have no idea what the meaning of life

5926
02:01:31,129 --> 02:01:31,139
I have no idea what the meaning of life
 

5927
02:01:31,139 --> 02:01:33,530
I have no idea what the meaning of life
is but maybe that's the meaning of life

5928
02:01:33,530 --> 02:01:33,540
is but maybe that's the meaning of life
 

5929
02:01:33,540 --> 02:01:36,890
is but maybe that's the meaning of life
now the uncertainty the confusion of

5930
02:01:36,890 --> 02:01:36,900
now the uncertainty the confusion of
 

5931
02:01:36,900 --> 02:01:38,930
now the uncertainty the confusion of
um because there's a magic to it all

5932
02:01:38,930 --> 02:01:38,940
um because there's a magic to it all
 

5933
02:01:38,940 --> 02:01:40,609
um because there's a magic to it all
everything you've talked about from

5934
02:01:40,609 --> 02:01:40,619
everything you've talked about from
 

5935
02:01:40,619 --> 02:01:43,189
everything you've talked about from
starting from the basic elements with

5936
02:01:43,189 --> 02:01:43,199
starting from the basic elements with
 

5937
02:01:43,199 --> 02:01:44,990
starting from the basic elements with
the big bang that somehow created the

5938
02:01:44,990 --> 02:01:45,000
the big bang that somehow created the
 

5939
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:48,350
the big bang that somehow created the
Sun that somehow uh said Fu to uh

5940
02:01:48,350 --> 02:01:48,360
Sun that somehow uh said Fu to uh
 

5941
02:01:48,360 --> 02:01:51,050
Sun that somehow uh said Fu to uh
thermodynamics and created life and all

5942
02:01:51,050 --> 02:01:51,060
thermodynamics and created life and all
 

5943
02:01:51,060 --> 02:01:53,149
thermodynamics and created life and all
the ways that you've talked about from

5944
02:01:53,149 --> 02:01:53,159
the ways that you've talked about from
 

5945
02:01:53,159 --> 02:01:54,890
the ways that you've talked about from
ribosomes that created the Machinery

5946
02:01:54,890 --> 02:01:54,900
ribosomes that created the Machinery
 

5947
02:01:54,900 --> 02:01:56,629
ribosomes that created the Machinery
that created the machine and then now

5948
02:01:56,629 --> 02:01:56,639
that created the machine and then now
 

5949
02:01:56,639 --> 02:01:58,790
that created the machine and then now
the biological machine creating

5950
02:01:58,790 --> 02:01:58,800
the biological machine creating
 

5951
02:01:58,800 --> 02:02:01,189
the biological machine creating
through digital fabrication more complex

5952
02:02:01,189 --> 02:02:01,199
through digital fabrication more complex
 

5953
02:02:01,199 --> 02:02:03,649
through digital fabrication more complex
artificial machines all of that there's

5954
02:02:03,649 --> 02:02:03,659
artificial machines all of that there's
 

5955
02:02:03,659 --> 02:02:06,229
artificial machines all of that there's
a magic to that creative process and we

5956
02:02:06,229 --> 02:02:06,239
a magic to that creative process and we
 

5957
02:02:06,239 --> 02:02:08,689
a magic to that creative process and we
notice we humans are smart enough to

5958
02:02:08,689 --> 02:02:08,699
notice we humans are smart enough to
 

5959
02:02:08,699 --> 02:02:11,089
notice we humans are smart enough to
notice the magic so it's you haven't

5960
02:02:11,089 --> 02:02:11,099
notice the magic so it's you haven't
 

5961
02:02:11,099 --> 02:02:13,189
notice the magic so it's you haven't
said the s word yet

5962
02:02:13,189 --> 02:02:13,199
said the s word yet
 

5963
02:02:13,199 --> 02:02:14,750
said the s word yet
um which one is that singularity

5964
02:02:14,750 --> 02:02:14,760
um which one is that singularity
 

5965
02:02:14,760 --> 02:02:17,209
um which one is that singularity
[Laughter]

5966
02:02:17,209 --> 02:02:17,219
[Laughter]
 

5967
02:02:17,219 --> 02:02:19,490
[Laughter]
yeah I'm not sure if Ray Kurzweil is

5968
02:02:19,490 --> 02:02:19,500
yeah I'm not sure if Ray Kurzweil is
 

5969
02:02:19,500 --> 02:02:21,350
yeah I'm not sure if Ray Kurzweil is
listening if he is high Ray but I have a

5970
02:02:21,350 --> 02:02:21,360
listening if he is high Ray but I have a
 

5971
02:02:21,360 --> 02:02:23,810
listening if he is high Ray but I have a
complex relationship with Rey because a

5972
02:02:23,810 --> 02:02:23,820
complex relationship with Rey because a
 

5973
02:02:23,820 --> 02:02:26,990
complex relationship with Rey because a
lot of the things he projects I find

5974
02:02:26,990 --> 02:02:27,000
lot of the things he projects I find
 

5975
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:28,430
lot of the things he projects I find
annoying

5976
02:02:28,430 --> 02:02:28,440
annoying
 

5977
02:02:28,440 --> 02:02:32,510
annoying
but then he does his homework and then

5978
02:02:32,510 --> 02:02:32,520
but then he does his homework and then
 

5979
02:02:32,520 --> 02:02:34,850
but then he does his homework and then
somewhat annoyingly he points out how

5980
02:02:34,850 --> 02:02:34,860
somewhat annoyingly he points out how
 

5981
02:02:34,860 --> 02:02:36,770
somewhat annoyingly he points out how
almost everything I'm doing fits on his

5982
02:02:36,770 --> 02:02:36,780
almost everything I'm doing fits on his
 

5983
02:02:36,780 --> 02:02:39,470
almost everything I'm doing fits on his
road maps yeah

5984
02:02:39,470 --> 02:02:39,480
road maps yeah
 

5985
02:02:39,480 --> 02:02:40,910
road maps yeah
um and so

5986
02:02:40,910 --> 02:02:40,920
um and so
 

5987
02:02:40,920 --> 02:02:42,709
um and so
you know the

5988
02:02:42,709 --> 02:02:42,719
you know the
 

5989
02:02:42,719 --> 02:02:44,330
you know the
the the

5990
02:02:44,330 --> 02:02:44,340
the the
 

5991
02:02:44,340 --> 02:02:46,669
the the
question is are we heading towards the

5992
02:02:46,669 --> 02:02:46,679
question is are we heading towards the
 

5993
02:02:46,679 --> 02:02:48,830
question is are we heading towards the
singularity I

5994
02:02:48,830 --> 02:02:48,840
singularity I
 

5995
02:02:48,840 --> 02:02:52,189
singularity I
so I'd have to say I lean towards

5996
02:02:52,189 --> 02:02:52,199
so I'd have to say I lean towards
 

5997
02:02:52,199 --> 02:02:55,970
so I'd have to say I lean towards
sigmoids rather than exponentials

5998
02:02:55,970 --> 02:02:55,980
sigmoids rather than exponentials
 

5999
02:02:55,980 --> 02:02:57,950
sigmoids rather than exponentials
um we've done pretty well with the

6000
02:02:57,950 --> 02:02:57,960
um we've done pretty well with the
 

6001
02:02:57,960 --> 02:03:01,070
um we've done pretty well with the
sigmoids yeah so sigmoids are things

6002
02:03:01,070 --> 02:03:01,080
sigmoids yeah so sigmoids are things
 

6003
02:03:01,080 --> 02:03:03,050
sigmoids yeah so sigmoids are things
grow and they taper and then there can

6004
02:03:03,050 --> 02:03:03,060
grow and they taper and then there can
 

6005
02:03:03,060 --> 02:03:06,350
grow and they taper and then there can
be one after it and one after it so

6006
02:03:06,350 --> 02:03:06,360
be one after it and one after it so
 

6007
02:03:06,360 --> 02:03:07,669
be one after it and one after it so
um

6008
02:03:07,669 --> 02:03:07,679
um
 

6009
02:03:07,679 --> 02:03:09,709
um
you know I'll pass on whether there's

6010
02:03:09,709 --> 02:03:09,719
you know I'll pass on whether there's
 

6011
02:03:09,719 --> 02:03:12,530
you know I'll pass on whether there's
enough of them that that they diverge

6012
02:03:12,530 --> 02:03:12,540
enough of them that that they diverge
 

6013
02:03:12,540 --> 02:03:15,770
enough of them that that they diverge
but you know to

6014
02:03:15,770 --> 02:03:15,780
but you know to
 

6015
02:03:15,780 --> 02:03:19,189
but you know to
the selfish Gene answer to the meaning

6016
02:03:19,189 --> 02:03:19,199
the selfish Gene answer to the meaning
 

6017
02:03:19,199 --> 02:03:21,950
the selfish Gene answer to the meaning
of life is the meaning of life is the

6018
02:03:21,950 --> 02:03:21,960
of life is the meaning of life is the
 

6019
02:03:21,960 --> 02:03:25,310
of life is the meaning of life is the
propagation of life and so

6020
02:03:25,310 --> 02:03:25,320
propagation of life and so
 

6021
02:03:25,320 --> 02:03:25,910
propagation of life and so
um

6022
02:03:25,910 --> 02:03:25,920
um
 

6023
02:03:25,920 --> 02:03:30,890
um
you know it it it was a step for S atoms

6024
02:03:30,890 --> 02:03:30,900
you know it it it was a step for S atoms
 

6025
02:03:30,900 --> 02:03:33,490
you know it it it was a step for S atoms
to assemble into a molecule

6026
02:03:33,490 --> 02:03:33,500
to assemble into a molecule
 

6027
02:03:33,500 --> 02:03:37,070
to assemble into a molecule
for molecules to assemble into a

6028
02:03:37,070 --> 02:03:37,080
for molecules to assemble into a
 

6029
02:03:37,080 --> 02:03:40,490
for molecules to assemble into a
protocell for the protocell to form to

6030
02:03:40,490 --> 02:03:40,500
protocell for the protocell to form to
 

6031
02:03:40,500 --> 02:03:43,729
protocell for the protocell to form to
then form organelles for the organ cells

6032
02:03:43,729 --> 02:03:43,739
then form organelles for the organ cells
 

6033
02:03:43,739 --> 02:03:45,589
then form organelles for the organ cells
to form organs the organs to form an

6034
02:03:45,589 --> 02:03:45,599
to form organs the organs to form an
 

6035
02:03:45,599 --> 02:03:47,570
to form organs the organs to form an
organism then it was a step for

6036
02:03:47,570 --> 02:03:47,580
organism then it was a step for
 

6037
02:03:47,580 --> 02:03:51,350
organism then it was a step for
organisms to form family units then

6038
02:03:51,350 --> 02:03:51,360
organisms to form family units then
 

6039
02:03:51,360 --> 02:03:53,750
organisms to form family units then
family units to form Villages you can

6040
02:03:53,750 --> 02:03:53,760
family units to form Villages you can
 

6041
02:03:53,760 --> 02:03:56,149
family units to form Villages you can
view you know each of those as a stack

6042
02:03:56,149 --> 02:03:56,159
view you know each of those as a stack
 

6043
02:03:56,159 --> 02:03:59,270
view you know each of those as a stack
in the level of organizations so you

6044
02:03:59,270 --> 02:03:59,280
in the level of organizations so you
 

6045
02:03:59,280 --> 02:04:01,430
in the level of organizations so you
could view everything we've spoken about

6046
02:04:01,430 --> 02:04:01,440
could view everything we've spoken about
 

6047
02:04:01,440 --> 02:04:04,089
could view everything we've spoken about
as

6048
02:04:04,089 --> 02:04:04,099
as
 

6049
02:04:04,099 --> 02:04:07,490
as
the imperative of life

6050
02:04:07,490 --> 02:04:07,500
the imperative of life
 

6051
02:04:07,500 --> 02:04:09,890
the imperative of life
just the next step in the hierarchy of

6052
02:04:09,890 --> 02:04:09,900
just the next step in the hierarchy of
 

6053
02:04:09,900 --> 02:04:11,629
just the next step in the hierarchy of
that and the Fulfillment of the

6054
02:04:11,629 --> 02:04:11,639
that and the Fulfillment of the
 

6055
02:04:11,639 --> 02:04:13,550
that and the Fulfillment of the
inexorable Drive of the violation of

6056
02:04:13,550 --> 02:04:13,560
inexorable Drive of the violation of
 

6057
02:04:13,560 --> 02:04:15,589
inexorable Drive of the violation of
thermodynamics so you know you could

6058
02:04:15,589 --> 02:04:15,599
thermodynamics so you know you could
 

6059
02:04:15,599 --> 02:04:17,810
thermodynamics so you know you could
view you know I'm an embodiment of the

6060
02:04:17,810 --> 02:04:17,820
view you know I'm an embodiment of the
 

6061
02:04:17,820 --> 02:04:19,609
view you know I'm an embodiment of the
will of the violation of thermodynamics

6062
02:04:19,609 --> 02:04:19,619
will of the violation of thermodynamics
 

6063
02:04:19,619 --> 02:04:21,950
will of the violation of thermodynamics
speaking

6064
02:04:21,950 --> 02:04:21,960
speaking
 

6065
02:04:21,960 --> 02:04:24,290
speaking
the two of us having having an old chat

6066
02:04:24,290 --> 02:04:24,300
the two of us having having an old chat
 

6067
02:04:24,300 --> 02:04:25,790
the two of us having having an old chat
yes yeah

6068
02:04:25,790 --> 02:04:25,800
yes yeah
 

6069
02:04:25,800 --> 02:04:28,250
yes yeah
um and so continues and even then the

6070
02:04:28,250 --> 02:04:28,260
um and so continues and even then the
 

6071
02:04:28,260 --> 02:04:30,770
um and so continues and even then the
singularity is just a transition up the

6072
02:04:30,770 --> 02:04:30,780
singularity is just a transition up the
 

6073
02:04:30,780 --> 02:04:33,229
singularity is just a transition up the
ladder there's nothing deeper to

6074
02:04:33,229 --> 02:04:33,239
ladder there's nothing deeper to
 

6075
02:04:33,239 --> 02:04:37,490
ladder there's nothing deeper to
Consciousness than it it it's a derived

6076
02:04:37,490 --> 02:04:37,500
Consciousness than it it it's a derived
 

6077
02:04:37,500 --> 02:04:41,330
Consciousness than it it it's a derived
property of distributed problem solving

6078
02:04:41,330 --> 02:04:41,340
property of distributed problem solving
 

6079
02:04:41,340 --> 02:04:45,189
property of distributed problem solving
um there's nothing deeper to life than

6080
02:04:45,189 --> 02:04:45,199
um there's nothing deeper to life than
 

6081
02:04:45,199 --> 02:04:47,750
um there's nothing deeper to life than
embodied AI

6082
02:04:47,750 --> 02:04:47,760
embodied AI
 

6083
02:04:47,760 --> 02:04:50,209
embodied AI
in morphogenesis

6084
02:04:50,209 --> 02:04:50,219
in morphogenesis
 

6085
02:04:50,219 --> 02:04:53,450
in morphogenesis
so why so much of this conversation in

6086
02:04:53,450 --> 02:04:53,460
so why so much of this conversation in
 

6087
02:04:53,460 --> 02:04:55,010
so why so much of this conversation in
my life is

6088
02:04:55,010 --> 02:04:55,020
my life is
 

6089
02:04:55,020 --> 02:04:58,609
my life is
involved in these Fab labs and initially

6090
02:04:58,609 --> 02:04:58,619
involved in these Fab labs and initially
 

6091
02:04:58,619 --> 02:05:00,350
involved in these Fab labs and initially
it just started as Outreach then it

6092
02:05:00,350 --> 02:05:00,360
it just started as Outreach then it
 

6093
02:05:00,360 --> 02:05:02,390
it just started as Outreach then it
started as keeping up with it

6094
02:05:02,390 --> 02:05:02,400
started as keeping up with it
 

6095
02:05:02,400 --> 02:05:05,750
started as keeping up with it
then it turned to

6096
02:05:05,750 --> 02:05:05,760
then it turned to
 

6097
02:05:05,760 --> 02:05:07,550
then it turned to
uh

6098
02:05:07,550 --> 02:05:07,560
uh
 

6099
02:05:07,560 --> 02:05:10,669
uh
it was rewarding then it turned to we're

6100
02:05:10,669 --> 02:05:10,679
it was rewarding then it turned to we're
 

6101
02:05:10,679 --> 02:05:13,310
it was rewarding then it turned to we're
learning as much from these labs in as

6102
02:05:13,310 --> 02:05:13,320
learning as much from these labs in as
 

6103
02:05:13,320 --> 02:05:15,470
learning as much from these labs in as
goes out to them it began as Outreach

6104
02:05:15,470 --> 02:05:15,480
goes out to them it began as Outreach
 

6105
02:05:15,480 --> 02:05:17,209
goes out to them it began as Outreach
but now more knowledge is coming back

6106
02:05:17,209 --> 02:05:17,219
but now more knowledge is coming back
 

6107
02:05:17,219 --> 02:05:19,669
but now more knowledge is coming back
from the labs that is going into them

6108
02:05:19,669 --> 02:05:19,679
from the labs that is going into them
 

6109
02:05:19,679 --> 02:05:23,270
from the labs that is going into them
um and then finally it ends with

6110
02:05:23,270 --> 02:05:23,280
um and then finally it ends with
 

6111
02:05:23,280 --> 02:05:24,290
um and then finally it ends with
um

6112
02:05:24,290 --> 02:05:24,300
um
 

6113
02:05:24,300 --> 02:05:26,030
um
you know what I described as competing

6114
02:05:26,030 --> 02:05:26,040
you know what I described as competing
 

6115
02:05:26,040 --> 02:05:28,010
you know what I described as competing
with myself at MIT but a better way to

6116
02:05:28,010 --> 02:05:28,020
with myself at MIT but a better way to
 

6117
02:05:28,020 --> 02:05:31,129
with myself at MIT but a better way to
say that is tapping the brain power of

6118
02:05:31,129 --> 02:05:31,139
say that is tapping the brain power of
 

6119
02:05:31,139 --> 02:05:32,930
say that is tapping the brain power of
the planet

6120
02:05:32,930 --> 02:05:32,940
the planet
 

6121
02:05:32,940 --> 02:05:35,209
the planet
and so from I guess for me personally

6122
02:05:35,209 --> 02:05:35,219
and so from I guess for me personally
 

6123
02:05:35,219 --> 02:05:37,370
and so from I guess for me personally
that's the meaning of my life

6124
02:05:37,370 --> 02:05:37,380
that's the meaning of my life
 

6125
02:05:37,380 --> 02:05:39,109
that's the meaning of my life
and maybe that's the meaning for the

6126
02:05:39,109 --> 02:05:39,119
and maybe that's the meaning for the
 

6127
02:05:39,119 --> 02:05:42,050
and maybe that's the meaning for the
universe too it's uh it's using us

6128
02:05:42,050 --> 02:05:42,060
universe too it's uh it's using us
 

6129
02:05:42,060 --> 02:05:44,209
universe too it's uh it's using us
humans and our Creations to understand

6130
02:05:44,209 --> 02:05:44,219
humans and our Creations to understand
 

6131
02:05:44,219 --> 02:05:45,470
humans and our Creations to understand
itself

6132
02:05:45,470 --> 02:05:45,480
itself
 

6133
02:05:45,480 --> 02:05:48,350
itself
in a way it's uh

6134
02:05:48,350 --> 02:05:48,360
in a way it's uh
 

6135
02:05:48,360 --> 02:05:50,209
in a way it's uh
whatever the creative process that

6136
02:05:50,209 --> 02:05:50,219
whatever the creative process that
 

6137
02:05:50,219 --> 02:05:51,410
whatever the creative process that
created Earth

6138
02:05:51,410 --> 02:05:51,420
created Earth
 

6139
02:05:51,420 --> 02:05:53,450
created Earth
is competing with itself

6140
02:05:53,450 --> 02:05:53,460
is competing with itself
 

6141
02:05:53,460 --> 02:05:56,689
is competing with itself
yeah so you could take morphogenesis as

6142
02:05:56,689 --> 02:05:56,699
yeah so you could take morphogenesis as
 

6143
02:05:56,699 --> 02:05:58,490
yeah so you could take morphogenesis as
a summary of this whole conversation or

6144
02:05:58,490 --> 02:05:58,500
a summary of this whole conversation or
 

6145
02:05:58,500 --> 02:06:00,169
a summary of this whole conversation or
you could take recursion

6146
02:06:00,169 --> 02:06:00,179
you could take recursion
 

6147
02:06:00,179 --> 02:06:02,930
you could take recursion
that that in a sense what we've been

6148
02:06:02,930 --> 02:06:02,940
that that in a sense what we've been
 

6149
02:06:02,940 --> 02:06:04,490
that that in a sense what we've been
talking about is recursion all the way

6150
02:06:04,490 --> 02:06:04,500
talking about is recursion all the way
 

6151
02:06:04,500 --> 02:06:07,970
talking about is recursion all the way
down and in the end I think uh this

6152
02:06:07,970 --> 02:06:07,980
down and in the end I think uh this
 

6153
02:06:07,980 --> 02:06:10,070
down and in the end I think uh this
whole thing is pretty fun it's short

6154
02:06:10,070 --> 02:06:10,080
whole thing is pretty fun it's short
 

6155
02:06:10,080 --> 02:06:13,010
whole thing is pretty fun it's short
life is but it's pretty fun and so is

6156
02:06:13,010 --> 02:06:13,020
life is but it's pretty fun and so is
 

6157
02:06:13,020 --> 02:06:14,450
life is but it's pretty fun and so is
this conversation you know I mentioned
