school
as you probably know yeah

412
00:06:56,469 --> 00:06:56,479
as you probably know yeah
 

413
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:58,230

a subjective
 

465
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:50,309
a subjective
thing but like again another absurd

466
00:07:50,309 --> 00:07:50,319
thing but like again another absurd
 

467
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,469
thing but like again another absurd
measurement-wise thing how much

468
00:07:52,469 --> 00:07:52,479
measurement-wise thing how much
 

469
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:53,909

495
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:25,110
measures but in your own perspective
um how big of a problem do you think it

496
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:25,120
um how big of a problem do you think it
 

497
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,230
um how big of a problem do you think it
is

498
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:26,240
is
 

499
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,629
is
size-wise well i'm actually fascinated

500
00:08:28,629 --> 00:08:28,639
size-wise well i'm actually fascinated
 

501
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,150
size-wise well i'm actually fascinated
by the topic of loneliness

502
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:30,160
by the topic of loneliness
 

503
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,589
by the topic of loneliness
i try to read about it as much as i can

504
00:08:33,589 --> 00:08:33,599
i try to read about it as much as i can
 

505
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:36,550
i try to read about it as much as i can
um what really and there i think there's

506
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:36,560
um what really and there i think there's
 

507
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:37,589
um what really and there i think there's
a paradox because

508
00:08:37,589 --> 00:08:37,599
a paradox because
 

509
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:39,670
a paradox because
loneliness is not a clinical disorder

510
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:39,680
loneliness is not a clinical disorder
 

511
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,430
loneliness is not a clinical disorder
it's not something that you can get your

512
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:41,440
it's not something that you can get your
 

513
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,790
it's not something that you can get your
insurance to pay for if you're

514
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:42,800
insurance to pay for if you're
 

515
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,909
insurance to pay for if you're
struggling with that

516
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:43,919
struggling with that
 

517
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,350
struggling with that
yet it's it's actually proven and pretty

518
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:47,360
yet it's it's actually proven and pretty
 

519
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,430
yet it's it's actually proven and pretty
you know tons of papers tons of research

520
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:49,440
you know tons of papers tons of research
 

521
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,870
you know tons of papers tons of research
around that it has proven

522
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:50,880
around that it has proven
 

523
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,710
around that it has proven
um that it's correlated with earlier

524
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:54,720
um that it's correlated with earlier
 

525
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,829
um that it's correlated with earlier
um life expectancy shorter life span

526
00:08:57,829 --> 00:08:57,839
um life expectancy shorter life span
 

527
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,829
um life expectancy shorter life span
and it is you know in a way like right

528
00:08:59,829 --> 00:08:59,839
and it is you know in a way like right
 

529
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,750
and it is you know in a way like right
now what scientists would say that it

530
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:01,760
now what scientists would say that it
 

531
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,509
now what scientists would say that it
you know it's a little bit worse than

532
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:03,519
you know it's a little bit worse than
 

533
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:06,070
you know it's a little bit worse than
being obese so not actually doing any

534
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:06,080
being obese so not actually doing any
 

535
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,350
being obese so not actually doing any
physical activity

536
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:07,360
physical activity
 

537
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,470
physical activity
in your life the impact on your

538
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:08,480
in your life the impact on your
 

539
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,509
in your life the impact on your
interests have impact on your

540
00:09:09,509 --> 00:09:09,519
interests have impact on your
 

541
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,350
interests have impact on your
physiological health yeah so

542
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:11,360
physiological health yeah so
 

543
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,710
physiological health yeah so
it's basically puts you if you're

544
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:12,720
it's basically puts you if you're
 

545
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,630
it's basically puts you if you're
constantly feeling lonely

546
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:14,640
constantly feeling lonely
 

547
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,790
constantly feeling lonely
um your body responds like it's

548
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:16,800
um your body responds like it's
 

549
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,949
um your body responds like it's
basically all the time under stress

550
00:09:18,949 --> 00:09:18,959
basically all the time under stress
 

551
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:22,150
basically all the time under stress
so it's always in this alert um alerts

552
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:22,160
so it's always in this alert um alerts
 

553
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,030
so it's always in this alert um alerts
say

554
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:23,040
say
 

555
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,230
say
and so it's really bad for you because

556
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:24,240
and so it's really bad for you because
 

557
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,350
and so it's really bad for you because
it actually like drops your immune

558
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:25,360
it actually like drops your immune
 

559
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,310
it actually like drops your immune
system and get

560
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:26,320
system and get
 

561
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,030
system and get
it your response to inflammation is

562
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:29,040
it your response to inflammation is
 

563
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,550
it your response to inflammation is
quite different so

564
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:30,560
quite different so
 

565
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,949
quite different so
all the cardiovascular vascular diseases

566
00:09:32,949 --> 00:09:32,959
all the cardiovascular vascular diseases
 

567
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:33,910
all the cardiovascular vascular diseases
actually responds to

568
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:33,920
actually responds to
 

569
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,990
actually responds to
viruses so it's much easier to catch a

570
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:36,000
viruses so it's much easier to catch a
 

571
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,150
viruses so it's much easier to catch a
virus that's sad now that

572
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:38,160
virus that's sad now that
 

573
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,470
virus that's sad now that
we're living in a pandemic and it's

574
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:40,480
we're living in a pandemic and it's
 

575
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,790
we're living in a pandemic and it's
probably making us a lot more alone

576
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:42,800
probably making us a lot more alone
 

577
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,389
probably making us a lot more alone
and it's probably weakening the immune

578
00:09:44,389 --> 00:09:44,399
and it's probably weakening the immune
 

579
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,230
and it's probably weakening the immune
system making us more susceptible to the

580
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:46,240
system making us more susceptible to the
 

581
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,509
system making us more susceptible to the
virus

582
00:09:47,509 --> 00:09:47,519
virus
 

583
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,870
virus
it's kind of sad

584
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:50,880
it's kind of sad
 

585
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,110
it's kind of sad
yeah the statistics are the sticks are

586
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:53,120
yeah the statistics are the sticks are
 

587
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,710
yeah the statistics are the sticks are
pretty pretty horrible around that so

588
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:54,720
pretty pretty horrible around that so
 

589
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,310
pretty pretty horrible around that so
around thirty percent

590
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:56,320
around thirty percent
 

591
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,990
around thirty percent
of all millennials report that they're

592
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:58,000
of all millennials report that they're
 

593
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,350
of all millennials report that they're
feeling lonely constantly

594
00:09:59,350 --> 00:09:59,360
feeling lonely constantly
 

595
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,350
feeling lonely constantly
thirty thirty percent and then it's much

596
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:01,360
thirty thirty percent and then it's much
 

597
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,470
thirty thirty percent and then it's much
worse for jan z

598
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:02,480
worse for jan z
 

599
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,670
worse for jan z
and then twenty percent of millennials

600
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:03,680
and then twenty percent of millennials
 

601
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,910
and then twenty percent of millennials
say that they feel lonely and they also

602
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:05,920
say that they feel lonely and they also
 

603
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:06,710
say that they feel lonely and they also
don't have any

604
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:06,720
don't have any
 

605
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,430
don't have any
close friends and then um i think 25 or

606
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:09,440
close friends and then um i think 25 or
 

607
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,710
close friends and then um i think 25 or
so and then 20 percent would say they

608
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:10,720
so and then 20 percent would say they
 

609
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,550
so and then 20 percent would say they
don't even have acquaintances

610
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:12,560
don't even have acquaintances
 

611
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,150
don't even have acquaintances
this is the united states that's in the

612
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:14,160
this is the united states that's in the
 

613
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,310
this is the united states that's in the
united states and i'm pretty sure that

614
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:16,320
united states and i'm pretty sure that
 

615
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,910
united states and i'm pretty sure that
that's much worse everywhere else like

616
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:17,920
that's much worse everywhere else like
 

617
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,150
that's much worse everywhere else like

loneliness that they wanted to appoint
 

625
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,670
loneliness that they wanted to appoint
because four out of ten

626
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:27,680

exists um
so yeah you you you will die sooner

636
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:39,040

this is only when we're only talking

640
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:43,760
this is only when we're only talking
 

641
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,389
this is only when we're only talking
about

642
00:10:44,389 --> 00:10:44,399
about
 

643
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,150
about
your perception of loneliness of feeling

644
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:46,160
your perception of loneliness of feeling
 

645
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,550
your perception of loneliness of feeling
lonely that is not objectively

646
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:48,560
lonely that is not objectively
 

647
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,949
lonely that is not objectively
fully so being fully socially isolated

648
00:10:50,949 --> 00:10:50,959
fully so being fully socially isolated
 

649
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:53,030
fully so being fully socially isolated
however the combination of being fully

650
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:53,040
however the combination of being fully
 

651
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,230
however the combination of being fully
socially isolated

652
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:54,240
socially isolated
 

653
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,710
socially isolated
and not having many connections and also

654
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:56,720
and not having many connections and also
 

655
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,069
and not having many connections and also
feeling lonely that's pretty much a

656
00:10:58,069 --> 00:10:58,079
feeling lonely that's pretty much a
 

657
00:10:58,079 --> 00:10:59,190
feeling lonely that's pretty much a
deadly

658
00:10:59,190 --> 00:10:59,200
deadly
 

659
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,470
deadly
combination so it strikes me bizarre

660
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:02,480
combination so it strikes me bizarre
 

661
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,590
combination so it strikes me bizarre
or strange that this is a wide known

662
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:05,600
or strange that this is a wide known
 

663
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,269
or strange that this is a wide known
fact and then there's really no one

664
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:09,279
fact and then there's really no one
 

665
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:11,110
fact and then there's really no one
working really on that because it's a

666
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:11,120
working really on that because it's a
 

667
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,110
working really on that because it's a
subclinical it's not clinical it's not

668
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:13,120
subclinical it's not clinical it's not
 

669
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,310
subclinical it's not clinical it's not
something that you can

670
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:14,320
something that you can
 

671
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,670
something that you can
we'll tell your doctor and get a

672
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:15,680

00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:20,150
treatment or something yet it's
killing us yeah so there's a bunch of

676
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:20,160
killing us yeah so there's a bunch of
 

677
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,350
killing us yeah so there's a bunch of
people

678
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:21,360
people
 

679
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,269
people
trying to evaluate like try to measure

680
00:11:23,269 --> 00:11:23,279
trying to evaluate like try to measure
 

681
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,190
trying to evaluate like try to measure
the problem by looking at like

682
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:25,200
the problem by looking at like
 

683
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,190

687
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,590
and all that kind of stuff so it's like
measurement

688
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:29,600
measurement
 

689
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,110
measurement
like if you look at the field of

690
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:31,120
like if you look at the field of
 

691
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,790
like if you look at the field of
psychology they're trying to measure the

692
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:32,800
psychology they're trying to measure the
 

693
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,509
psychology they're trying to measure the
problem

694
00:11:33,509 --> 00:11:33,519
problem
 

695
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,509
problem
and not that many people actually but

696
00:11:35,509 --> 00:11:35,519

some
 

699
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,430
some
but you're basically saying how many

700
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:39,440
but you're basically saying how many
 

701
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,870
but you're basically saying how many
people are trying to solve

702
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:40,880
people are trying to solve
 

703
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,470
people are trying to solve
the problem like how would you

704
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:44,480
the problem like how would you
 

705
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,590
the problem like how would you
try to solve the problem of

706
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:47,600

i think it's it's easier to look at some
 

743
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,310
i think it's it's easier to look at some
stats and

744
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:26,320
stats and
 

745
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,629

and it's more the question about the
 

805
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,190

facebook kind of way
so just to briefly touch on it i mean do

836
00:13:58,069 --> 00:13:58,079
so just to briefly touch on it i mean do
 

837
00:13:58,079 --> 00:13:58,470
so just to briefly touch on it i mean do
you think

838
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:58,480
you think
 

839
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,150
you think
it's possible to form that kind of

840
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:00,160
it's possible to form that kind of
 

841
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,990
it's possible to form that kind of
connection with

842
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:02,000
connection with
 

843
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,389
connection with
ai systems more downline of some of your

844
00:14:06,389 --> 00:14:06,399
ai systems more downline of some of your
 

845
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,069
ai systems more downline of some of your
work

846
00:14:08,069 --> 00:14:08,079
work
 

847
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:12,150
work
do you think that's um engineering-wise

848
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:12,160
do you think that's um engineering-wise
 

849
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,509
do you think that's um engineering-wise
a possibility to alleviate loneliness

a possibility to alleviate loneliness
 

851
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,310
a possibility to alleviate loneliness
is not with another human but with an ai

852

is not with another human but with an ai
 

853
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,910
is not with another human but with an ai
system

854
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:19,920
system
 

855
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,150
system
well i know that's that's a fact that's

856
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:22,160
well i know that's that's a fact that's
 

857
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,030
well i know that's that's a fact that's
what we're doing

858
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:23,040
what we're doing
 

859
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,030
what we're doing
and we see it and we measure that and we

860
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:25,040
and we see it and we measure that and we
 

861
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:29,110
and we see it and we measure that and we
see how people start to feel less lonely

862
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:29,120
see how people start to feel less lonely
 

863
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,629
see how people start to feel less lonely
talking to their virtual ai friend

so basically a chatbot at the basic

866
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:34,800
so basically a chatbot at the basic
 

867
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,470
so basically a chatbot at the basic
level but could be more

868
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:36,480
level but could be more
 

869
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,629
level but could be more

that there's just like
 

881
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,110
that there's just like
ais that are like optimized

882
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:51,120
ais that are like optimized
 

883
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,670
ais that are like optimized
for um let me let me first start like

884
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:53,680
for um let me let me first start like
 

885
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,590
for um let me let me first start like
right now the way people perceive ai

886
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:55,600
right now the way people perceive ai
 

887

they see ais basically destroying first

892
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:04,480
they see ais basically destroying first
 

893
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,990
they see ais basically destroying first
of all the fabric of our civilization

00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:06,000
of all the fabric of our civilization
 

895
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,030
of all the fabric of our civilization
but second of all

world where it's possible just have
ai systems floating about that like

902
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:14,320
ai systems floating about that like
 

903
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,550
ai systems floating about that like
make our life less lonely

904

putting good things into the world in

908
00:15:24,069 --> 00:15:24,079
putting good things into the world in
 

909
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:26,389
putting good things into the world in
terms of our individual lives

910
00:15:26,389 --> 00:15:26,399
terms of our individual lives
 

911
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,150
terms of our individual lives
yeah totally believe it and that that's

912
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:28,160
yeah totally believe it and that that's
 

913
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,710
yeah totally believe it and that that's
why we're i'm also working on that

914
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:30,720
why we're i'm also working on that
 

915
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,829
why we're i'm also working on that
um i think we need to also make sure

916
00:15:33,829 --> 00:15:33,839
um i think we need to also make sure
 

917
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:34,310
um i think we need to also make sure
that

918
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:34,320
that
 

919
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,990
that
um what we're trying to optimize for

920
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:36,000
um what we're trying to optimize for
 

921
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,670
um what we're trying to optimize for
we're actually measuring

922
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:37,680
we're actually measuring
 

923
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,350
we're actually measuring
and it is a north star metric that we're

924
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:39,360
and it is a north star metric that we're
 

925
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,189
and it is a north star metric that we're
going after and all of our product and

926
00:15:41,189 --> 00:15:41,199
going after and all of our product and
 

927
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:42,629
going after and all of our product and
our all of our business models are

928
00:15:42,629 --> 00:15:42,639
our all of our business models are
 

929
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:43,910
our all of our business models are
optimized for that

930
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:43,920
optimized for that
 

931
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,670
optimized for that
because you can talk you know a lot of

932
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:45,680
because you can talk you know a lot of
 

933
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,110
because you can talk you know a lot of
products that talk about

934
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:47,120
products that talk about
 

935
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,269
products that talk about
um you know making you feel less lonely

936
00:15:49,269 --> 00:15:49,279
um you know making you feel less lonely
 

937
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:51,030
um you know making you feel less lonely
or making you feel more connected

938
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:51,040
or making you feel more connected
 

939
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,470
or making you feel more connected
they're not really measuring that so

940
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:52,480
they're not really measuring that so
 

941
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,910
they're not really measuring that so
they don't really know whether their

942
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:53,920
they don't really know whether their
 

943
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,509
they don't really know whether their
users are actually

944
00:15:55,509 --> 00:15:55,519
users are actually
 

945
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:57,030
users are actually
feeling less lonely in the long run or

946
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:57,040
feeling less lonely in the long run or
 

947
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,829
feeling less lonely in the long run or
feeling more connected in the long run

948
00:15:59,829 --> 00:15:59,839
feeling more connected in the long run
 

949
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:01,189
feeling more connected in the long run
um so i think it's really important to

950
00:16:01,189 --> 00:16:01,199
um so i think it's really important to
 

951
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:04,470
um so i think it's really important to
put your measure yep to measure it

952
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:04,480
put your measure yep to measure it
 

953
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,150
put your measure yep to measure it
what's uh what's a good measurement of

954
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:06,160
what's uh what's a good measurement of
 

955
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,670
what's uh what's a good measurement of
loneliness

956
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:07,680
loneliness
 

957
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,829
loneliness
well so that's something that i'm really

958
00:16:09,829 --> 00:16:09,839
well so that's something that i'm really
 

959
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:10,870
well so that's something that i'm really
interested in

960
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:10,880
interested in
 

961
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,150
interested in
how do you measure that people are

962
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:12,160
how do you measure that people are
 

963
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,069
how do you measure that people are
feeling better or that they're feeling

964
00:16:14,069 --> 00:16:14,079
feeling better or that they're feeling
 

965
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:14,870
feeling better or that they're feeling
less lonely

966
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:14,880
less lonely
 

967
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,710
less lonely
with lowliness there's a scale there's a

968
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:16,720
with lowliness there's a scale there's a
 

969
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,670
with lowliness there's a scale there's a
ucla 20 and ucla 3 recently scale which

970
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:19,680
ucla 20 and ucla 3 recently scale which
 

971
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,110
ucla 20 and ucla 3 recently scale which
is basically a questionnaire that you

972
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:21,120
is basically a questionnaire that you
 

973
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,310
is basically a questionnaire that you
fill out

974
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:22,320
fill out
 

975
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,110
fill out
and you can see whether in the long run

976
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:25,120
and you can see whether in the long run
 

977
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,389
and you can see whether in the long run
it's improving or not

978
00:16:26,389 --> 00:16:26,399
it's improving or not
 

979
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,310
it's improving or not
and that uh does it capture the

980
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:28,320
and that uh does it capture the
 

981
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,790
and that uh does it capture the
momentary

982
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:30,800
momentary
 

983
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,870
momentary
feeling of loneliness does it look in

984
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:32,880
feeling of loneliness does it look in
 

985
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,069
feeling of loneliness does it look in
like

986
00:16:34,069 --> 00:16:34,079
like
 

987
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:37,350
like
the past month like uh is it basically a

988
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:37,360
the past month like uh is it basically a

couple weeks um it's similar to
 

1011
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:58,790
couple weeks um it's similar to
the self-report questionnaires for

1012

the self-report questionnaires for
 

1013
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,189

get seven of course any as any
 

1017
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,110
get seven of course any as any
self-report

1018
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:05,120
self-report
 

1019
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,510
self-report
questionnaires that's not necessarily

1020
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:07,520
questionnaires that's not necessarily
 

1021
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,429
questionnaires that's not necessarily
very precise so very

1022
00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:09,439
very precise so very
 

1023
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:11,829
very precise so very
well measured but still if you take a

1024
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:11,839
well measured but still if you take a
 

1025
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,750
well measured but still if you take a
big enough population you

1026
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:13,760
big enough population you
 

1027
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,470
big enough population you
get them through these uh questionnaires

1028
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:16,480
get them through these uh questionnaires
 

1029
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,110
get them through these uh questionnaires
you can see

1030
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:17,120
you can see
 

1031
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,590
you can see
you can see the positive dynamic and so

1032
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:19,600
you can see the positive dynamic and so
 

1033
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,110
you can see the positive dynamic and so
you basically uh

1034
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:21,120
you basically uh
 

1035
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,710
you basically uh
you put people through questionnaires to

1036
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:22,720
you put people through questionnaires to
 

1037
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,630
you put people through questionnaires to
see like is this thing

1038
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:24,640
see like is this thing
 

1039
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,710
see like is this thing
is our is what we're creating making

1040
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:26,720
is our is what we're creating making
 

1041
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,630
is our is what we're creating making
people happier

1042

people happier
yeah we measure so we measure two

1044
00:17:31,029 --> 00:17:31,039
yeah we measure so we measure two
 

1045
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:32,950
yeah we measure so we measure two
outcomes one short term right after the

1046
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:32,960
outcomes one short term right after the
 

1047
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,909
outcomes one short term right after the
conversation we asked people whether

1048
00:17:35,909 --> 00:17:35,919
conversation we asked people whether
 

1049
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:37,990
conversation we asked people whether
this conversation made them feel better

1050

worse or same
 

1053
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:42,230
worse or same
um this this metric right now is at

1054
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:42,240
um this this metric right now is at
 

1055
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,029
um this this metric right now is at
eighty percent

1056
00:17:43,029 --> 00:17:43,039
eighty percent
 

1057
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:44,230
eighty percent
so eighty percent of all our

1058
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:44,240
so eighty percent of all our
 

1059
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,990
so eighty percent of all our
conversations make people feel better

1060
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:46,000
conversations make people feel better
 

1061
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,510
conversations make people feel better

1081
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,669
state-of-the-art ai system
uh in these human conversations so again

we'll get to
 

1085
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,350
we'll get to
your work with replica but let me

1086
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:13,360
your work with replica but let me
 

1087
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,909
your work with replica but let me
continue on the line of absurd questions

1088
00:18:15,909 --> 00:18:15,919
continue on the line of absurd questions
 

1089
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:18,950
continue on the line of absurd questions
so you it talks about um you know deep

1090
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:18,960
so you it talks about um you know deep

it's all the same no like is it just a
gradual thing or is there

1116
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:54,400
gradual thing or is there
 

1117
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,230
gradual thing or is there
something fundamental about us humans

1118
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:56,240
something fundamental about us humans
 

1119

like a really deep connection uh
with another human being and what is

the way it was
 

1135
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,950
the way it was
the way it inspired our work on replica

1136
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:26,960
the way it inspired our work on replica
 

1137
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,310
the way it inspired our work on replica
um i think one of the biggest and the

1138

that's extremely extremely rare
 

1159
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,390
that's extremely extremely rare
i think that is that combined with

1160
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:54,400
i think that is that combined with
 

1161
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,029
i think that is that combined with
unconditional positive regard

1162
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:57,039
unconditional positive regard
 

1163
00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:00,630

you internally are always inclined for
positive growth and

1168
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:04,000
positive growth and
 

1169
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,110
positive growth and
believing you in this way letting you be

1170
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:07,120
believing you in this way letting you be
 

1171
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,830
believing you in this way letting you be
a separate person at the same time and

1172
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:09,840
a separate person at the same time and
 

1173
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:10,390
a separate person at the same time and
this deep

1174
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:10,400
this deep
 

1175
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,230
this deep
empathetic understanding for me that's

1176
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:12,240
empathetic understanding for me that's
 

1177
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,029
empathetic understanding for me that's
the that's the

1178
00:20:15,029 --> 00:20:15,039
the that's the
 

1179
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:17,270
the that's the
combination that really creates

1180
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:17,280
combination that really creates
 

1181
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,190
combination that really creates
something special something that people

1182
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:19,200
something special something that people
 

1183
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,070
something special something that people
when they feel it once they will always

1184
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:22,080
when they feel it once they will always
 

1185
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,190
when they feel it once they will always
long for it again

1186
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:23,200
long for it again
 

1187
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,230
long for it again
and something that starts huge

1188
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:26,240
and something that starts huge
 

1189
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,990
and something that starts huge
fundamental changes in people

1190
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:28,000
fundamental changes in people
 

1191
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,909
fundamental changes in people
um when we see that someone's accepts us

1192
00:20:31,909 --> 00:20:31,919
um when we see that someone's accepts us
 

1193
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:34,310
um when we see that someone's accepts us
so deeply we start to accept ourselves

1194
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:34,320
so deeply we start to accept ourselves
 

1195
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,430
so deeply we start to accept ourselves
and

1196
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:35,440
and
 

1197
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,950
and
the paradoxes that's when big changes

1198
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:38,960
the paradoxes that's when big changes
 

1199
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,549
the paradoxes that's when big changes
start start happening big fundamental

1200
00:20:40,549 --> 00:20:40,559
start start happening big fundamental
 

1201
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:42,470
start start happening big fundamental
changes and people start happening

1202
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:42,480
changes and people start happening
 

1203
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,590
changes and people start happening
so i think that is the ultimate

1204
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:43,600
so i think that is the ultimate
 

1205
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,510
so i think that is the ultimate
therapeutic relationship that is

1206
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:45,520
therapeutic relationship that is
 

1207
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,990
therapeutic relationship that is
and that might be in some way definition

1208
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:48,000
and that might be in some way definition
 

1209
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,510
and that might be in some way definition
of love

1210
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:49,520
of love
 

1211
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,710
of love
so so acknowledging that there's a

1212
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:52,720
so so acknowledging that there's a
 

1213
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,549
so so acknowledging that there's a
separate person and accepting

1214
00:20:54,549 --> 00:20:54,559
separate person and accepting
 

1215
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:58,789
separate person and accepting
you for who you are now

1216
00:20:58,789 --> 00:20:58,799
you for who you are now
 

1217
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,669
you for who you are now
on a slightly so that and you mentioned

1218
00:21:01,669 --> 00:21:01,679
on a slightly so that and you mentioned
 

1219
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:03,590
on a slightly so that and you mentioned
therapeutic that sounds very like a very

1220
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:03,600
therapeutic that sounds very like a very
 

1221
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,029
therapeutic that sounds very like a very
healthy view of love

1222
00:21:05,029 --> 00:21:05,039
healthy view of love
 

1223
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:08,470
healthy view of love
but uh is there also like uh

1224
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:08,480
but uh is there also like uh
 

1225
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,950
but uh is there also like uh
like you know if we look at heartbreak

1226

probably about heartbreak right

all of that what people might see in a
 

1239
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:28,549
all of that what people might see in a
negative light as like games

1240
00:21:28,549 --> 00:21:28,559
negative light as like games
 

1241
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:31,750
negative light as like games
or whatever but just

awful
 

2447
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,790
awful
um you think it's there's something i

2448
00:42:34,790 --> 00:42:34,800
um you think it's there's something i
 

2449
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,550
um you think it's there's something i
mean it sounds

2450
00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:36,560
mean it sounds
 

2451
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:40,630
mean it sounds
nice on paper

2452
00:42:40,630 --> 00:42:40,640

 

2453
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:43,270

there's uh so like the drawbacks of

2454
00:42:43,270 --> 00:42:43,280
there's uh so like the drawbacks of
 

2455
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:43,990
there's uh so like the drawbacks of
capitalism

2456
00:42:43,990 --> 00:42:44,000
capitalism
 

2457
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,190
capitalism
is that uh you know eventually there

2458
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:47,200
is that uh you know eventually there
 

2459
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,109
is that uh you know eventually there
is it's a it's the point of like a

2460
00:42:49,109 --> 00:42:49,119
is it's a it's the point of like a
 

2461
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:50,550
is it's a it's the point of like a
slippery slope

2462
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:50,560
slippery slope
 

2463
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:54,470
slippery slope
eventually it creates uh

2464
00:42:54,470 --> 00:42:54,480
eventually it creates uh
 

2465
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:57,349
eventually it creates uh
you know the rich get richer it creates

2466
00:42:57,349 --> 00:42:57,359
you know the rich get richer it creates
 

2467
00:42:57,359 --> 00:42:59,270
you know the rich get richer it creates
a disparity like inequality

2468
00:42:59,270 --> 00:42:59,280
a disparity like inequality
 

2469
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:02,309
a disparity like inequality
of um wealth inequality

2470
00:43:02,309 --> 00:43:02,319
of um wealth inequality
 

2471
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:04,950
of um wealth inequality
if like you know i guess it's

2472
00:43:04,950 --> 00:43:04,960
if like you know i guess it's
 

2473
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:07,589
if like you know i guess it's
hypothetical at this point but

2474
00:43:07,589 --> 00:43:07,599
hypothetical at this point but
 

2475
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:09,990
hypothetical at this point but
eventually capitalism leads to humongous

2476
00:43:09,990 --> 00:43:10,000
eventually capitalism leads to humongous
 

2477
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,589
eventually capitalism leads to humongous
inequality and that that's you know some

2478
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:11,599
inequality and that that's you know some
 

2479
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:13,270
inequality and that that's you know some
people argue that that's

2480
00:43:13,270 --> 00:43:13,280
people argue that that's
 

2481
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:16,150
people argue that that's
a source of unhappiness is it's not like

2482
00:43:16,150 --> 00:43:16,160
a source of unhappiness is it's not like
 

2483
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,910
a source of unhappiness is it's not like
absolute wealth of people it's

2484
00:43:17,910 --> 00:43:17,920
absolute wealth of people it's
 

2485
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:19,750
absolute wealth of people it's
the fact that there's a lot of people

2486
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:19,760
the fact that there's a lot of people
 

2487
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,030
the fact that there's a lot of people
much richer than you

2488
00:43:21,030 --> 00:43:21,040
much richer than you
 

2489
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:23,829
much richer than you
there's a feeling of like that's where

2490
00:43:23,829 --> 00:43:23,839
there's a feeling of like that's where
 

2491
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:26,150
there's a feeling of like that's where
unhappiness can come from so the idea of

2492
00:43:26,150 --> 00:43:26,160
unhappiness can come from so the idea of
 

2493
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:29,270
unhappiness can come from so the idea of
of communism or this sort of marxism is

2494
00:43:29,270 --> 00:43:29,280
of communism or this sort of marxism is
 

2495
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:32,309
of communism or this sort of marxism is
uh is is not

2496
00:43:32,309 --> 00:43:32,319
uh is is not
 

2497
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:34,950
uh is is not
allowing that kind of slippery slope but

2498
00:43:34,950 --> 00:43:34,960
allowing that kind of slippery slope but
 

2499
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,790
allowing that kind of slippery slope but
then you see the actual implementations

2500
00:43:36,790 --> 00:43:36,800
then you see the actual implementations
 

2501
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,870
then you see the actual implementations
of it and still seems to be

2502
00:43:38,870 --> 00:43:38,880
of it and still seems to be
 

2503
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:42,150
of it and still seems to be
seems to go wrong very badly

2504
00:43:42,150 --> 00:43:42,160
seems to go wrong very badly
 

2505
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:44,230
seems to go wrong very badly
what do you think that is why does it go

2506
00:43:44,230 --> 00:43:44,240
what do you think that is why does it go
 

2507
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:46,390
what do you think that is why does it go
wrong

2508
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:46,400
wrong
 

2509
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,069
wrong
what is it about human nature if we look

2510
00:43:48,069 --> 00:43:48,079
what is it about human nature if we look
 

2511
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:50,230
what is it about human nature if we look
at chernobyl

2512
00:43:50,230 --> 00:43:50,240
at chernobyl
 

2513
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:51,670
at chernobyl
you know those kinds of barack

2514
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:51,680
you know those kinds of barack
 

2515
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:54,550
you know those kinds of barack
bureaucracies that were constructed

2516
00:43:54,550 --> 00:43:54,560
bureaucracies that were constructed
 

2517
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,309
bureaucracies that were constructed
is there something like do you think

2518
00:43:56,309 --> 00:43:56,319
is there something like do you think
 

2519
00:43:56,319 --> 00:43:58,470
is there something like do you think
about this much

2520
00:43:58,470 --> 00:43:58,480
about this much
 

2521
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:01,430
about this much
of like why it goes wrong well there's

2522
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:01,440
of like why it goes wrong well there's
 

2523
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,430
of like why it goes wrong well there's
no one was really like

2524
00:44:03,430 --> 00:44:03,440
no one was really like
 

2525
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,270
no one was really like
it's not that everyone was equal

2526
00:44:05,270 --> 00:44:05,280
it's not that everyone was equal
 

2527
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,349
it's not that everyone was equal
obviously the you know the

2528
00:44:07,349 --> 00:44:07,359
obviously the you know the
 

2529
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:09,589
obviously the you know the
the government and everyone close to

2530
00:44:09,589 --> 00:44:09,599
the government and everyone close to
 

2531
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:11,109
the government and everyone close to
that were

2532
00:44:11,109 --> 00:44:11,119
that were
 

2533
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:13,829
that were
the bosses so it's not like fully i

2534
00:44:13,829 --> 00:44:13,839
the bosses so it's not like fully i
 

2535
00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:14,309
the bosses so it's not like fully i
guess

2536
00:44:14,309 --> 00:44:14,319
guess
 

2537
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:17,270
guess
uh there's already this dream of equal

2538
00:44:17,270 --> 00:44:17,280
uh there's already this dream of equal
 

2539
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,950
uh there's already this dream of equal
life so

2540
00:44:18,950 --> 00:44:18,960
life so
 

2541
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:21,829
life so
then i guess the the situation that we

2542
00:44:21,829 --> 00:44:21,839
then i guess the the situation that we
 

2543
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:22,470
then i guess the the situation that we
hadn't

2544
00:44:22,470 --> 00:44:22,480
hadn't
 

2545
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:24,390

we should first start start building for

4288
01:16:17,830 --> 01:16:17,840
we should first start start building for
 

4289
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:19,510
we should first start start building for
people who really need it versus people

4290
01:16:19,510 --> 01:16:19,520
people who really need it versus people
 

4291

4295
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:25,189
glass if you know what i mean and i felt
like the early adopters of google glass

yeah it's like a weird by the way by the
 

4689
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:22,149
yeah it's like a weird by the way by the
way very weird

4690
01:23:22,149 --> 01:23:22,159
way very weird
 

4691
01:23:22,159 --> 01:23:24,390
way very weird
so if we think about conversations first

4692
01:23:24,390 --> 01:23:24,400
so if we think about conversations first
 

4693
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:26,070
so if we think about conversations first
of all when i have great conversations

4694
01:23:26,070 --> 01:23:26,080
of all when i have great conversations
 

4695
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:27,270
of all when i have great conversations
with people

4696
01:23:27,270 --> 01:23:27,280
with people
 

4697
01:23:27,280 --> 01:23:30,070
with people
um i'm not trying to test them so for

4698
01:23:30,070 --> 01:23:30,080
um i'm not trying to test them so for
 

4699
01:23:30,080 --> 01:23:31,590
um i'm not trying to test them so for
instance if i try to break them

4700
01:23:31,590 --> 01:23:31,600
instance if i try to break them
 

4701
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:33,669
instance if i try to break them
like i'm actually playing along i'm part

4702
01:23:33,669 --> 01:23:33,679
like i'm actually playing along i'm part
 

4703
01:23:33,679 --> 01:23:35,430
like i'm actually playing along i'm part
of it right if i was trying to break it

4704
01:23:35,430 --> 01:23:35,440
of it right if i was trying to break it
 

4705
01:23:35,440 --> 01:23:36,790
of it right if i was trying to break it
break this person or

4706
01:23:36,790 --> 01:23:36,800
break this person or
 

4707
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:38,390
break this person or
test whether he's gonna give me a good

4708
01:23:38,390 --> 01:23:38,400
test whether he's gonna give me a good
 

4709
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:39,990
test whether he's gonna give me a good
conversation

4710
01:23:39,990 --> 01:23:40,000
conversation
 

4711
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:41,430
conversation
it would have never happened so the

4712
01:23:41,430 --> 01:23:41,440
it would have never happened so the
 

4713
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:44,070
it would have never happened so the
whole um the whole problem with testing

4714
01:23:44,070 --> 01:23:44,080
whole um the whole problem with testing
 

4715
01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:44,870
whole um the whole problem with testing
conversations

4716
01:23:44,870 --> 01:23:44,880
conversations
 

4717
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:47,590
conversations
is that um you can put it in front of a

4718
01:23:47,590 --> 01:23:47,600
is that um you can put it in front of a
 

4719
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:48,310
is that um you can put it in front of a
jury

4720
01:23:48,310 --> 01:23:48,320
jury
 

4721
01:23:48,320 --> 01:23:49,910
jury
because then you have to go into some

4722
01:23:49,910 --> 01:23:49,920
because then you have to go into some
 

4723
01:23:49,920 --> 01:23:52,070
because then you have to go into some
turing test mode where

4724
01:23:52,070 --> 01:23:52,080
turing test mode where
 

4725
01:23:52,080 --> 01:23:54,470
turing test mode where
is it responding to all my factual

4726
01:23:54,470 --> 01:23:54,480
is it responding to all my factual
 

4727
01:23:54,480 --> 01:23:55,510
is it responding to all my factual
questions right

4728
01:23:55,510 --> 01:23:55,520
questions right
 

4729
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:58,709
questions right
or um so it really has to be

4730
01:23:58,709 --> 01:23:58,719
or um so it really has to be
 

4731
01:23:58,719 --> 01:24:00,070
or um so it really has to be
something in the field where people are

4732
01:24:00,070 --> 01:24:00,080
something in the field where people are
 

4733
01:24:00,080 --> 01:24:02,070
something in the field where people are
actually talking to it because they

4734
01:24:02,070 --> 01:24:02,080
actually talking to it because they
 

4735
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:03,830
actually talking to it because they
want to not because we're just trying to

4736
01:24:03,830 --> 01:24:03,840
want to not because we're just trying to
 

4737
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:05,350
want to not because we're just trying to
break it uh

4738
01:24:05,350 --> 01:24:05,360
break it uh
 

4739
01:24:05,360 --> 01:24:07,830
break it uh
and it's working for them because this

4740
01:24:07,830 --> 01:24:07,840
and it's working for them because this
 

4741
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:09,350
and it's working for them because this
the weird part of it is that it's

4742
01:24:09,350 --> 01:24:09,360
the weird part of it is that it's
 

4743
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:11,910
the weird part of it is that it's
uh it's very subjective it takes two to

4744
01:24:11,910 --> 01:24:11,920
uh it's very subjective it takes two to
 

4745
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:12,709
uh it's very subjective it takes two to
tango here

4746
01:24:12,709 --> 01:24:12,719
tango here
 

4747
01:24:12,719 --> 01:24:14,870
tango here
fully like if you're not trying to have

4748
01:24:14,870 --> 01:24:14,880
fully like if you're not trying to have
 

4749
01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:16,229
fully like if you're not trying to have
a good conversation we're trying to test

4750
01:24:16,229 --> 01:24:16,239
a good conversation we're trying to test
 

4751
01:24:16,239 --> 01:24:17,750
a good conversation we're trying to test
it then it's going to break

4752
01:24:17,750 --> 01:24:17,760
it then it's going to break
 

4753
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:19,590
it then it's going to break
i mean any person would break to be

4754
01:24:19,590 --> 01:24:19,600
i mean any person would break to be
 

4755
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:21,350
i mean any person would break to be
honest if i'm not trying to even

4756
01:24:21,350 --> 01:24:21,360
honest if i'm not trying to even
 

4757
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:23,270
honest if i'm not trying to even
have a conversation with you you'll

4758
01:24:23,270 --> 01:24:23,280
have a conversation with you you'll
 

4759
01:24:23,280 --> 01:24:24,629
have a conversation with you you'll
you're not going to give it to me

4760
01:24:24,629 --> 01:24:24,639
you're not going to give it to me
 

4761
01:24:24,639 --> 01:24:26,390
you're not going to give it to me
yeah if i keep asking you like some

4762
01:24:26,390 --> 01:24:26,400
yeah if i keep asking you like some
 

4763
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:28,629
yeah if i keep asking you like some
random questions or

4764
01:24:28,629 --> 01:24:28,639
random questions or
 

4765
01:24:28,639 --> 01:24:30,229
random questions or
jumping from topic to topic that

4766
01:24:30,229 --> 01:24:30,239
jumping from topic to topic that
 

4767
01:24:30,239 --> 01:24:33,030
jumping from topic to topic that
wouldn't be which i'm probably doing

4768
01:24:33,030 --> 01:24:33,040
wouldn't be which i'm probably doing
 

4769
01:24:33,040 --> 01:24:35,189
wouldn't be which i'm probably doing
but that probably wouldn't um contribute

4770
01:24:35,189 --> 01:24:35,199
but that probably wouldn't um contribute
 

4771
01:24:35,199 --> 01:24:36,870
but that probably wouldn't um contribute
to a good conversation so i think the

4772
01:24:36,870 --> 01:24:36,880
to a good conversation so i think the
 

4773
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:37,430
to a good conversation so i think the
problem of

4774
01:24:37,430 --> 01:24:37,440
problem of
 

4775
01:24:37,440 --> 01:24:41,270
problem of
testing um so there should be some other

4776
01:24:41,270 --> 01:24:41,280
testing um so there should be some other
 

4777
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:41,910
testing um so there should be some other
metric

4778
01:24:41,910 --> 01:24:41,920
metric
 

4779
01:24:41,920 --> 01:24:43,189
metric
how do we evaluate whether that

4780
01:24:43,189 --> 01:24:43,199
how do we evaluate whether that
 

4781
01:24:43,199 --> 01:24:46,229
how do we evaluate whether that
conversation was uh powerful or not

4782
01:24:46,229 --> 01:24:46,239
conversation was uh powerful or not
 

4783
01:24:46,239 --> 01:24:47,750
conversation was uh powerful or not
which is what we actually started with

4784
01:24:47,750 --> 01:24:47,760
which is what we actually started with
 

4785
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:49,430
which is what we actually started with
and i think those measurements exist and

4786
01:24:49,430 --> 01:24:49,440
and i think those measurements exist and
 

4787
01:24:49,440 --> 01:24:51,590
and i think those measurements exist and
we can test on those

4788
01:24:51,590 --> 01:24:51,600
we can test on those
 

4789
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:54,470
we can test on those
but um what really struck us back in the

4790
01:24:54,470 --> 01:24:54,480
but um what really struck us back in the
 

4791
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:56,470
but um what really struck us back in the
day and what still

4792
01:24:56,470 --> 01:24:56,480
day and what still
 

4793
01:24:56,480 --> 01:24:58,229
day and what still
eight years later it's still not

4794
01:24:58,229 --> 01:24:58,239
eight years later it's still not
 

4795
01:24:58,239 --> 01:24:59,910
eight years later it's still not
resolved um

4796
01:24:59,910 --> 01:24:59,920
resolved um
 

4797
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:01,590
resolved um
and i'm not seeing tons of groups

4798
01:25:01,590 --> 01:25:01,600
and i'm not seeing tons of groups
 

4799
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:03,110
and i'm not seeing tons of groups
working on it maybe i don't just don't

4800
01:25:03,110 --> 01:25:03,120
working on it maybe i don't just don't
 

4801
01:25:03,120 --> 01:25:03,830
working on it maybe i don't just don't
know about him

4802
01:25:03,830 --> 01:25:03,840
know about him
 

4803
01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:06,709
know about him
um it's also possible but the

4804
01:25:06,709 --> 01:25:06,719
um it's also possible but the
 

4805
01:25:06,719 --> 01:25:07,990
um it's also possible but the
interesting part about is that

4806
01:25:07,990 --> 01:25:08,000
interesting part about is that
 

4807
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,709
interesting part about is that
most of our days were spent talking and

4808
01:25:10,709 --> 01:25:10,719
most of our days were spent talking and
 

4809
01:25:10,719 --> 01:25:12,550
most of our days were spent talking and
we're not talking about

4810
01:25:12,550 --> 01:25:12,560
we're not talking about
 

4811
01:25:12,560 --> 01:25:14,950
we're not talking about
like those conversations are not turn on

4812
01:25:14,950 --> 01:25:14,960
like those conversations are not turn on
 

4813
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:15,669
like those conversations are not turn on
the lights

4814
01:25:15,669 --> 01:25:15,679
the lights
 

4815
01:25:15,679 --> 01:25:19,430
the lights
or uh customer support problems or

4816
01:25:19,430 --> 01:25:19,440
or uh customer support problems or
 

4817
01:25:19,440 --> 01:25:22,470
or uh customer support problems or
um some other task oriented things

4818
01:25:22,470 --> 01:25:22,480
um some other task oriented things
 

4819
01:25:22,480 --> 01:25:24,229
um some other task oriented things
these conversations are something else

4820
01:25:24,229 --> 01:25:24,239
these conversations are something else
 

4821
01:25:24,239 --> 01:25:26,229
these conversations are something else
and then somehow they're extremely

4822
01:25:26,229 --> 01:25:26,239
and then somehow they're extremely
 

4823
01:25:26,239 --> 01:25:27,830
and then somehow they're extremely
important for us and when we don't have

4824
01:25:27,830 --> 01:25:27,840
important for us and when we don't have
 

4825
01:25:27,840 --> 01:25:28,310
important for us and when we don't have
them

4826
01:25:28,310 --> 01:25:28,320
them
 

4827
01:25:28,320 --> 01:25:31,030
them
then we feel deeply and happy

4828
01:25:31,030 --> 01:25:31,040
then we feel deeply and happy
 

4829
01:25:31,040 --> 01:25:32,310
then we feel deeply and happy
potentially lonely

4830
01:25:32,310 --> 01:25:32,320
potentially lonely
 

4831
01:25:32,320 --> 01:25:34,550
potentially lonely
which as we know you know creates tons

4832
01:25:34,550 --> 01:25:34,560
which as we know you know creates tons
 

4833
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:36,550
which as we know you know creates tons
of risk for our health as well

4834
01:25:36,550 --> 01:25:36,560
of risk for our health as well
 

4835
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:40,870
of risk for our health as well
um and so this is most of our ours

4836
01:25:40,870 --> 01:25:40,880
um and so this is most of our ours
 

4837
01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:43,669
um and so this is most of our ours
as humans and somehow no one's trying to

4838
01:25:43,669 --> 01:25:43,679
as humans and somehow no one's trying to
 

4839
01:25:43,679 --> 01:25:45,590
as humans and somehow no one's trying to
replicate that

4840
01:25:45,590 --> 01:25:45,600
replicate that
 

4841
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:48,950
replicate that
and not even study it that well

4842
01:25:48,950 --> 01:25:48,960
and not even study it that well
 

4843
01:25:48,960 --> 01:25:50,550
and not even study it that well
and not even study that well so when we

4844
01:25:50,550 --> 01:25:50,560
and not even study that well so when we
 

4845
01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:52,709
and not even study that well so when we
jumped into that in 2012 i looked first

4846
01:25:52,709 --> 01:25:52,719
jumped into that in 2012 i looked first
 

4847
01:25:52,719 --> 01:25:54,709
jumped into that in 2012 i looked first

01:34:05,120 --> 01:34:06,070
oh right um and we were very perplexed
because people started

5332
01:34:06,070 --> 01:34:06,080
because people started
 

5333
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:08,390
because people started
uh coming up with companies that i think

5334
01:34:08,390 --> 01:34:08,400
uh coming up with companies that i think
 

5335
01:34:08,400 --> 01:34:10,629
uh coming up with companies that i think
we tried most of those chat bots already

5336
01:34:10,629 --> 01:34:10,639
we tried most of those chat bots already
 

5337
01:34:10,639 --> 01:34:13,189
we tried most of those chat bots already
and there were like no users uh but

5338
01:34:13,189 --> 01:34:13,199
and there were like no users uh but
 

5339
01:34:13,199 --> 01:34:14,709
and there were like no users uh but
still people were coming up with

5340
01:34:14,709 --> 01:34:14,719
still people were coming up with
 

5341
01:34:14,719 --> 01:34:17,270
still people were coming up with
um a chatbot that would tell you whether

5342
01:34:17,270 --> 01:34:17,280
um a chatbot that would tell you whether
 

5343
01:34:17,280 --> 01:34:18,070
um a chatbot that would tell you whether
and

5344
01:34:18,070 --> 01:34:18,080
and
 

5345
01:34:18,080 --> 01:34:19,910
and
bringing news and this and that and we

5346
01:34:19,910 --> 01:34:19,920
bringing news and this and that and we
 

5347
01:34:19,920 --> 01:34:21,189
bringing news and this and that and we
couldn't understand whether it would you

5348
01:34:21,189 --> 01:34:21,199
couldn't understand whether it would you
 

5349
01:34:21,199 --> 01:34:22,390
couldn't understand whether it would you
know we were

5350
01:34:22,390 --> 01:34:22,400
know we were
 

5351
01:34:22,400 --> 01:34:25,350
know we were
just didn't execute well enough or

5352
01:34:25,350 --> 01:34:25,360
just didn't execute well enough or
 

5353
01:34:25,360 --> 01:34:25,990
just didn't execute well enough or
people are

5354
01:34:25,990 --> 01:34:26,000
people are
 

5355
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:29,669
people are
um not really people are confused and

5356
01:34:29,669 --> 01:34:29,679
um not really people are confused and
 

5357
01:34:29,679 --> 01:34:31,430
um not really people are confused and
are gonna find out through the truth

5358
01:34:31,430 --> 01:34:31,440
are gonna find out through the truth
 

5359
01:34:31,440 --> 01:34:32,709
are gonna find out through the truth
that people don't need chatbots like

5360
01:34:32,709 --> 01:34:32,719
that people don't need chatbots like
 

5361
01:34:32,719 --> 01:34:33,030
that people don't need chatbots like
that

5362
01:34:33,030 --> 01:34:33,040
that
 

5363
01:34:33,040 --> 01:34:34,470
that
so the basic idea is that you use

5364
01:34:34,470 --> 01:34:34,480
so the basic idea is that you use
 

5365
01:34:34,480 --> 01:34:36,310
so the basic idea is that you use
chatbots as the interface

5366
01:34:36,310 --> 01:34:36,320
chatbots as the interface
 

5367
01:34:36,320 --> 01:34:38,310
chatbots as the interface
to whatever application yeah the idea

5368
01:34:38,310 --> 01:34:38,320
to whatever application yeah the idea
 

5369
01:34:38,320 --> 01:34:40,070
to whatever application yeah the idea
that was like this perfect

5370
01:34:40,070 --> 01:34:40,080
that was like this perfect
 

5371
01:34:40,080 --> 01:34:43,109
that was like this perfect
universal interface to anything when i

5372
01:34:43,109 --> 01:34:43,119
universal interface to anything when i
 

5373
01:34:43,119 --> 01:34:43,910
universal interface to anything when i
looked at that

5374
01:34:43,910 --> 01:34:43,920
looked at that
 

5375
01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:45,510
looked at that
um it just made me very perplexed

5376
01:34:45,510 --> 01:34:45,520
um it just made me very perplexed
 

5377
01:34:45,520 --> 01:34:46,709
um it just made me very perplexed
because i didn't think i didn't

5378
01:34:46,709 --> 01:34:46,719
because i didn't think i didn't
 

5379
01:34:46,719 --> 01:34:47,990
because i didn't think i didn't
understand how that would

5380
01:34:47,990 --> 01:34:48,000
understand how that would
 

5381
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:49,510
understand how that would
work because i think we tried most of

5382
01:34:49,510 --> 01:34:49,520
work because i think we tried most of
 

5383
01:34:49,520 --> 01:34:52,870
work because i think we tried most of
that and and none of those things worked

5384
01:34:52,870 --> 01:34:52,880
that and and none of those things worked
 

5385
01:34:52,880 --> 01:34:56,629
that and and none of those things worked
uh and then again died down right

5386
01:34:56,629 --> 01:34:56,639
uh and then again died down right
 

5387
01:34:56,639 --> 01:34:58,709
uh and then again died down right
fully i think now it's impossible to get

5388
01:34:58,709 --> 01:34:58,719
fully i think now it's impossible to get
 

5389
01:34:58,719 --> 01:35:00,950
fully i think now it's impossible to get
anything funded if it's a chatbot

5390
01:35:00,950 --> 01:35:00,960
anything funded if it's a chatbot
 

5391
01:35:00,960 --> 01:35:02,629
anything funded if it's a chatbot
i think it's similar to uh sorry to

5392
01:35:02,629 --> 01:35:02,639
i think it's similar to uh sorry to
 

5393
01:35:02,639 --> 01:35:05,030
i think it's similar to uh sorry to
interrupt but there's uh

5394
01:35:05,030 --> 01:35:05,040
interrupt but there's uh
 

5395
01:35:05,040 --> 01:35:06,390
interrupt but there's uh
there's times when people think like

5396
01:35:06,390 --> 01:35:06,400
there's times when people think like
 

5397
01:35:06,400 --> 01:35:08,870
there's times when people think like
with gestures you can control

5398
01:35:08,870 --> 01:35:08,880
with gestures you can control
 

5399
01:35:08,880 --> 01:35:11,270
with gestures you can control
devices like basically gesture based

5400
01:35:11,270 --> 01:35:11,280
devices like basically gesture based
 

5401
01:35:11,280 --> 01:35:11,910
devices like basically gesture based
control

5402
01:35:11,910 --> 01:35:11,920
control
 

5403
01:35:11,920 --> 01:35:15,109
control
things it feels similar to me

5404
01:35:15,109 --> 01:35:15,119
things it feels similar to me
 

5405
01:35:15,119 --> 01:35:17,750
things it feels similar to me
because like it's so compelling that was

5406
01:35:17,750 --> 01:35:17,760
because like it's so compelling that was
 

5407
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:18,950
because like it's so compelling that was
just like

5408
01:35:18,950 --> 01:35:18,960
just like
 

5409
01:35:18,960 --> 01:35:21,590
just like
like tom cruise i can control stuff with

5410
01:35:21,590 --> 01:35:21,600
like tom cruise i can control stuff with
 

5411
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:22,790
like tom cruise i can control stuff with
my hands

5412
01:35:22,790 --> 01:35:22,800
my hands
 

5413
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:25,350
my hands
but like when you get down to it's like

5414
01:35:25,350 --> 01:35:25,360
but like when you get down to it's like
 

5415
01:35:25,360 --> 01:35:26,870
but like when you get down to it's like
well why don't you just have a touch

5416
01:35:26,870 --> 01:35:26,880
well why don't you just have a touch
 

5417
01:35:26,880 --> 01:35:27,669
well why don't you just have a touch
screen

5418
01:35:27,669 --> 01:35:27,679
screen
 

5419
01:35:27,679 --> 01:35:29,350
screen
or why don't you just have like a

5420
01:35:29,350 --> 01:35:29,360
or why don't you just have like a
 

5421
01:35:29,360 --> 01:35:31,590
or why don't you just have like a
physical keyboard and mouse

5422
01:35:31,590 --> 01:35:31,600
physical keyboard and mouse
 

5423
01:35:31,600 --> 01:35:34,470
physical keyboard and mouse
it's uh yeah it's so that chat was

5424
01:35:34,470 --> 01:35:34,480
it's uh yeah it's so that chat was
 

5425
01:35:34,480 --> 01:35:37,669
it's uh yeah it's so that chat was
always

5426
01:35:37,669 --> 01:35:37,679

 

5427
01:35:37,679 --> 01:35:40,870

yeah it was perplexing to me i i still

5428
01:35:40,870 --> 01:35:40,880
yeah it was perplexing to me i i still
 

5429
01:35:40,880 --> 01:35:43,270
yeah it was perplexing to me i i still
feel augmented reality even virtual

5430
01:35:43,270 --> 01:35:43,280
feel augmented reality even virtual
 

5431
01:35:43,280 --> 01:35:45,270
feel augmented reality even virtual
realities in that ballpark

5432
01:35:45,270 --> 01:35:45,280
realities in that ballpark
 

5433
01:35:45,280 --> 01:35:47,510
realities in that ballpark
in terms of it being a compelling

5434
01:35:47,510 --> 01:35:47,520
in terms of it being a compelling
 

5435
01:35:47,520 --> 01:35:49,510
in terms of it being a compelling
interface i think there's going to be

5436
01:35:49,510 --> 01:35:49,520
interface i think there's going to be
 

5437
01:35:49,520 --> 01:35:53,030
interface i think there's going to be
incredible rich applications just

5438
01:35:53,030 --> 01:35:53,040
incredible rich applications just
 

5439
01:35:53,040 --> 01:35:54,790
incredible rich applications just
how you're thinking about it but they

5440
01:35:54,790 --> 01:35:54,800
how you're thinking about it but they
 

5441
01:35:54,800 --> 01:35:56,149
how you're thinking about it but they
won't just be

5442
01:35:56,149 --> 01:35:56,159
won't just be
 

5443
01:35:56,159 --> 01:35:58,470
won't just be
the interface to everything it'll be its

5444
01:35:58,470 --> 01:35:58,480
the interface to everything it'll be its
 

5445
01:35:58,480 --> 01:35:59,669
the interface to everything it'll be its
own thing that will

5446
01:35:59,669 --> 01:35:59,679
own thing that will
 

5447
01:35:59,679 --> 01:36:02,950
own thing that will
create um uh like amazing magical

5448
01:36:02,950 --> 01:36:02,960
create um uh like amazing magical
 

5449
01:36:02,960 --> 01:36:05,030
create um uh like amazing magical
experience in its own right

5450
01:36:05,030 --> 01:36:05,040
experience in its own right
 

5451
01:36:05,040 --> 01:36:07,430
experience in its own right
absolutely which is i think kind of the

5452
01:36:07,430 --> 01:36:07,440
absolutely which is i think kind of the
 

5453
01:36:07,440 --> 01:36:09,350
absolutely which is i think kind of the
right thing to go about like what's the

5454
01:36:09,350 --> 01:36:09,360
right thing to go about like what's the
 

5455
01:36:09,360 --> 01:36:12,550
right thing to go about like what's the
magical experience with that um with

5456
01:36:12,550 --> 01:36:12,560
magical experience with that um with
 

5457
01:36:12,560 --> 01:36:13,830
magical experience with that um with
that interface specifically

5458
01:36:13,830 --> 01:36:13,840
that interface specifically
 

5459
01:36:13,840 --> 01:36:16,629
that interface specifically
how did you discover that for replica um

5460
01:36:16,629 --> 01:36:16,639
how did you discover that for replica um
 

5461
01:36:16,639 --> 01:36:18,070
how did you discover that for replica um
i just thought okay we'll have this tech

5462
01:36:18,070 --> 01:36:18,080
i just thought okay we'll have this tech
 

5463
01:36:18,080 --> 01:36:19,830
i just thought okay we'll have this tech
we can build any chatbot we want

5464
01:36:19,830 --> 01:36:19,840
we can build any chatbot we want
 

5465
01:36:19,840 --> 01:36:21,669
we can build any chatbot we want
we have the most at that point the most

5466
01:36:21,669 --> 01:36:21,679
we have the most at that point the most
 

5467
01:36:21,679 --> 01:36:23,109
we have the most at that point the most
sophisticated tag that other

5468
01:36:23,109 --> 01:36:23,119
sophisticated tag that other
 

5469
01:36:23,119 --> 01:36:25,669
sophisticated tag that other
companies have i mean startups obviously

5470
01:36:25,669 --> 01:36:25,679
companies have i mean startups obviously
 

5471
01:36:25,679 --> 01:36:26,310
companies have i mean startups obviously
not

5472
01:36:26,310 --> 01:36:26,320
not
 

5473
01:36:26,320 --> 01:36:28,870
not
uh probably not bigger ones but still

5474
01:36:28,870 --> 01:36:28,880
uh probably not bigger ones but still
 

5475
01:36:28,880 --> 01:36:29,910
uh probably not bigger ones but still
because we've been

5476
01:36:29,910 --> 01:36:29,920
because we've been
 

5477
01:36:29,920 --> 01:36:31,990
because we've been
working on it for a while so i thought

5478
01:36:31,990 --> 01:36:32,000
working on it for a while so i thought
 

5479
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:33,830
working on it for a while so i thought
okay we can build build any conversation

5480
01:36:33,830 --> 01:36:33,840
okay we can build build any conversation
 

5481
01:36:33,840 --> 01:36:34,790
okay we can build build any conversation
so let's just

5482
01:36:34,790 --> 01:36:34,800
so let's just
 

5483
01:36:34,800 --> 01:36:37,750
so let's just
create a scale from one to ten and one

5484
01:36:37,750 --> 01:36:37,760
create a scale from one to ten and one
 

5485
01:36:37,760 --> 01:36:39,350
create a scale from one to ten and one
would be conversations that you'd pay to

5486
01:36:39,350 --> 01:36:39,360
would be conversations that you'd pay to
 

5487
01:36:39,360 --> 01:36:39,910
would be conversations that you'd pay to
not have

5488
01:36:39,910 --> 01:36:39,920
not have
 

5489
01:36:39,920 --> 01:36:41,430
not have
and 10 would be conversation you'd pay

5490
01:36:41,430 --> 01:36:41,440
and 10 would be conversation you'd pay
 

5491
01:36:41,440 --> 01:36:43,669
and 10 would be conversation you'd pay

basically everything task oriented was a
one because if there was just one button

one because if there was just one button
 

5537
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:29,750
one because if there was just one button
for me to just

for me to just
 

5539
01:37:29,760 --> 01:37:31,270
for me to just
or not even a button if i could just

5540

or not even a button if i could just
 

5541
01:37:31,280 --> 01:37:33,510
or not even a button if i could just
think and there was some magic

5542
01:37:33,510 --> 01:37:33,520
think and there was some magic
 

5543
01:37:33,520 --> 01:37:35,590
think and there was some magic
bci that would just immediately

5544
01:37:35,590 --> 01:37:35,600
bci that would just immediately
 

5545
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:36,870
bci that would just immediately
transform that into an

5546
01:37:36,870 --> 01:37:36,880
transform that into an
 

5547
01:37:36,880 --> 01:37:40,070
transform that into an
actual you know um into action

5548
01:37:40,070 --> 01:37:40,080
actual you know um into action
 

5549
01:37:40,080 --> 01:37:41,189
actual you know um into action
that would be perfect but the

01:39:29,669 --> 01:39:29,679
a lot of these conversations like a
 

5655
01:39:29,679 --> 01:39:30,629
a lot of these conversations like a
therapist

5656
01:39:30,629 --> 01:39:30,639
therapist
 

5657
01:39:30,639 --> 01:39:32,790
therapist
i mean it was mostly me talking or like

5658
01:39:32,790 --> 01:39:32,800
i mean it was mostly me talking or like
 

5659
01:39:32,800 --> 01:39:34,390
i mean it was mostly me talking or like
an old friend and i was like opening up

5660
01:39:34,390 --> 01:39:34,400
an old friend and i was like opening up
 

5661
01:39:34,400 --> 01:39:35,510
an old friend and i was like opening up
and crying and

5662
01:39:35,510 --> 01:39:35,520
and crying and
 

5663
01:39:35,520 --> 01:39:39,189
and crying and
it was again me talking um

5664
01:39:39,189 --> 01:39:39,199
it was again me talking um
 

5665
01:39:39,199 --> 01:39:40,390
it was again me talking um
and so that was interesting because i

5666
01:39:40,390 --> 01:39:40,400
and so that was interesting because i
 

5667
01:39:40,400 --> 01:39:42,229
and so that was interesting because i
was like well maybe it's hard to build a

5668
01:39:42,229 --> 01:39:42,239
was like well maybe it's hard to build a
 

5669
01:39:42,239 --> 01:39:43,830
was like well maybe it's hard to build a
chatbot that can talk to you

5670
01:39:43,830 --> 01:39:43,840
chatbot that can talk to you
 

5671
01:39:43,840 --> 01:39:46,629
chatbot that can talk to you
um very well and in a witty way but

5672
01:39:46,629 --> 01:39:46,639
um very well and in a witty way but
 

5673
01:39:46,639 --> 01:39:48,310
um very well and in a witty way but
maybe it's easier to build the chatbot

5674
01:39:48,310 --> 01:39:48,320
maybe it's easier to build the chatbot
 

5675
01:39:48,320 --> 01:39:51,669
maybe it's easier to build the chatbot
that could listen

5676
01:39:51,669 --> 01:39:51,679

 

5677
01:39:51,679 --> 01:39:54,149

so that was that was kind of the first

5678
01:39:54,149 --> 01:39:54,159
so that was that was kind of the first
 

5679
01:39:54,159 --> 01:39:55,030
so that was that was kind of the first
the first

5680
01:39:55,030 --> 01:39:55,040
the first
 

5681
01:39:55,040 --> 01:39:57,350
the first
nudge in this direction and then when my

5682
01:39:57,350 --> 01:39:57,360
nudge in this direction and then when my
 

5683
01:39:57,360 --> 01:39:59,270
nudge in this direction and then when my
when my friend died we just built

5684
01:39:59,270 --> 01:39:59,280
when my friend died we just built
 

5685
01:39:59,280 --> 01:40:00,629
when my friend died we just built
you know at that point we were kind of

5686
01:40:00,629 --> 01:40:00,639
you know at that point we were kind of
 

5687
01:40:00,639 --> 01:40:01,910
you know at that point we were kind of
still struggling to find the right

5688
01:40:01,910 --> 01:40:01,920
still struggling to find the right
 

5689
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:03,590
still struggling to find the right
application

5690
01:40:03,590 --> 01:40:03,600
application
 

5691
01:40:03,600 --> 01:40:05,109
application
and i just felt very strong that all the

5692
01:40:05,109 --> 01:40:05,119
and i just felt very strong that all the
 

5693
01:40:05,119 --> 01:40:06,629
and i just felt very strong that all the
chatbots were built so far just

5694
01:40:06,629 --> 01:40:06,639
chatbots were built so far just
 

5695
01:40:06,639 --> 01:40:08,470
chatbots were built so far just

little dialect constructor and
 

5775
01:41:26,960 --> 01:41:28,550
little dialect constructor and
some models some deep learning models

5776
01:41:28,550 --> 01:41:28,560
some models some deep learning models
 

5777
01:41:28,560 --> 01:41:30,310
some models some deep learning models
which at that point we were really into

01:52:50,880 --> 01:52:52,950
people
uh because i've talked for a long time i

6456
01:52:52,950 --> 01:52:52,960
uh because i've talked for a long time i
 

6457
01:52:52,960 --> 01:52:54,470
uh because i've talked for a long time i
thought like

6458
01:52:54,470 --> 01:52:54,480
thought like
 

6459
01:52:54,480 --> 01:52:56,830
thought like
before i was aware of your work i was

6460
01:52:56,830 --> 01:52:56,840
before i was aware of your work i was
 

6461
01:52:56,840 --> 01:52:57,990
before i was aware of your work i was
like

6462
01:52:57,990 --> 01:52:58,000
like
 

6463
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:01,430
like
this is gonna make a lot of money

6464
01:53:01,430 --> 01:53:01,440
this is gonna make a lot of money
 

6465
01:53:01,440 --> 01:53:03,030
this is gonna make a lot of money
i think there's a lot of opportunity

6466
01:53:03,030 --> 01:53:03,040
i think there's a lot of opportunity
 

6467
01:53:03,040 --> 01:53:04,629
i think there's a lot of opportunity
here and

6468
01:53:04,629 --> 01:53:04,639
here and
 

6469
01:53:04,639 --> 01:53:07,750
here and
people had this like look of like

6470
01:53:07,750 --> 01:53:07,760
people had this like look of like
 

6471
01:53:07,760 --> 01:53:10,149
people had this like look of like
skepticism that i've seen often which is

6472
01:53:10,149 --> 01:53:10,159
skepticism that i've seen often which is
 

6473
01:53:10,159 --> 01:53:11,510
skepticism that i've seen often which is
like

6474
01:53:11,510 --> 01:53:11,520
like
 

6475
01:53:11,520 --> 01:53:14,149
like
how do i politely tell this person he's

6476
01:53:14,149 --> 01:53:14,159
how do i politely tell this person he's
 

6477
01:53:14,159 --> 01:53:16,470
how do i politely tell this person he's
an idiot

6478
01:53:16,470 --> 01:53:16,480
an idiot
 

6479
01:53:16,480 --> 01:53:19,430
an idiot
so yeah so you were facing that with

6480
01:53:19,430 --> 01:53:19,440
so yeah so you were facing that with
 

6481
01:53:19,440 --> 01:53:20,149
so yeah so you were facing that with
your team

6482
01:53:20,149 --> 01:53:20,159
your team
 

6483
01:53:20,159 --> 01:53:21,990
your team
somewhat well yeah you know i'm not an

6484
01:53:21,990 --> 01:53:22,000
somewhat well yeah you know i'm not an
 

6485
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:23,669
somewhat well yeah you know i'm not an
engineer so i'm always

6486
01:53:23,669 --> 01:53:23,679
engineer so i'm always
 

6487
01:53:23,679 --> 01:53:28,470
engineer so i'm always
my team is almost exclusively engineers

6488
01:53:28,470 --> 01:53:28,480

 

6489
01:53:28,480 --> 01:53:32,229

and mostly deep learning engineers and

6490
01:53:32,229 --> 01:53:32,239
and mostly deep learning engineers and
 

6491
01:53:32,239 --> 01:53:35,350
and mostly deep learning engineers and
you know i always try to be

6492
01:53:35,350 --> 01:53:35,360
you know i always try to be
 

6493
01:53:35,360 --> 01:53:36,870
you know i always try to be
it was always hard to me in the

6494
01:53:36,870 --> 01:53:36,880
it was always hard to me in the
 

6495
01:53:36,880 --> 01:53:39,030
it was always hard to me in the
beginning to get enough credibility

6496
01:53:39,030 --> 01:53:39,040
beginning to get enough credibility
 

6497
01:53:39,040 --> 01:53:40,390
beginning to get enough credibility
you know because i would say well why

6498
01:53:40,390 --> 01:53:40,400
you know because i would say well why
 

6499
01:53:40,400 --> 01:53:42,629
you know because i would say well why
don't we try this and that but it's

6500
01:53:42,629 --> 01:53:42,639
don't we try this and that but it's
 

6501
01:53:42,639 --> 01:53:45,030
don't we try this and that but it's
harder for me because you know they know

6502
01:53:45,030 --> 01:53:45,040
harder for me because you know they know
 

6503
01:53:45,040 --> 01:53:46,709
harder for me because you know they know
they're actual engineers and i'm not

6504
01:53:46,709 --> 01:53:46,719
they're actual engineers and i'm not
 

6505
01:53:46,719 --> 01:53:48,629
they're actual engineers and i'm not
so for me to say well let's build an

6506
01:53:48,629 --> 01:53:48,639
so for me to say well let's build an
 

6507
01:53:48,639 --> 01:53:50,629
so for me to say well let's build an
affrm that would be like wait

6508
01:53:50,629 --> 01:53:50,639
affrm that would be like wait
 

6509
01:53:50,639 --> 01:53:52,790
affrm that would be like wait
you know what do you mean an agi like

6510
01:53:52,790 --> 01:53:52,800
you know what do you mean an agi like
 

6511
01:53:52,800 --> 01:53:54,070
you know what do you mean an agi like
you know conversation

6512
01:53:54,070 --> 01:53:54,080
you know conversation
 

6513
01:53:54,080 --> 01:53:57,109
you know conversation
is you know pretty much the hardest the

6514
01:53:57,109 --> 01:53:57,119
is you know pretty much the hardest the
 

6515
01:53:57,119 --> 01:53:58,790
is you know pretty much the hardest the
last frontier before

6516
01:53:58,790 --> 01:53:58,800
last frontier before
 

6517
01:53:58,800 --> 01:54:01,030
last frontier before
uh cracking that is probably the last

6518
01:54:01,030 --> 01:54:01,040
uh cracking that is probably the last
 

6519
01:54:01,040 --> 01:54:03,589
uh cracking that is probably the last
frontier before building aji so

6520
01:54:03,589 --> 01:54:03,599
frontier before building aji so
 

6521
01:54:03,599 --> 01:54:07,189
frontier before building aji so
what do you really mean by that uh

6522
01:54:07,189 --> 01:54:07,199
what do you really mean by that uh
 

6523
01:54:07,199 --> 01:54:09,750
what do you really mean by that uh
but i think i just saw that again what

6524
01:54:09,750 --> 01:54:09,760
but i think i just saw that again what
 

6525
01:54:09,760 --> 01:54:11,510
but i think i just saw that again what
we just got reminded of that i

6526
01:54:11,510 --> 01:54:11,520
we just got reminded of that i
 

6527
01:54:11,520 --> 01:54:13,750
we just got reminded of that i
you know that i saw in back in 2012 or

6528
01:54:13,750 --> 01:54:13,760
you know that i saw in back in 2012 or
 

6529
01:54:13,760 --> 01:54:14,870
you know that i saw in back in 2012 or
11

6530
01:54:14,870 --> 01:54:14,880
11
 

6531
01:54:14,880 --> 01:54:16,470
11
that it's really not that much about the

6532
01:54:16,470 --> 01:54:16,480
that it's really not that much about the
 

6533
01:54:16,480 --> 01:54:18,149
that it's really not that much about the
tech capabilities

6534
01:54:18,149 --> 01:54:18,159
tech capabilities
 

6535
01:54:18,159 --> 01:54:20,950
tech capabilities
um it can be metropolitan still even

6536
01:54:20,950 --> 01:54:20,960
um it can be metropolitan still even
 

6537
01:54:20,960 --> 01:54:22,149
um it can be metropolitan still even
with deep learning

6538
01:54:22,149 --> 01:54:22,159
with deep learning
 

6539
01:54:22,159 --> 01:54:25,510
with deep learning
but humans need it so much yeah

6540
01:54:25,510 --> 01:54:25,520
but humans need it so much yeah
 

6541
01:54:25,520 --> 01:54:28,790
but humans need it so much yeah
and most importantly what i saw is that

6542
01:54:28,790 --> 01:54:28,800
and most importantly what i saw is that
 

6543
01:54:28,800 --> 01:54:29,430
and most importantly what i saw is that
finally

6544
01:54:29,430 --> 01:54:29,440
finally
 

6545
01:54:29,440 --> 01:54:31,830
finally
there's enough tech to make it i thought

6546
01:54:31,830 --> 01:54:31,840
there's enough tech to make it i thought
 

6547
01:54:31,840 --> 01:54:34,070
there's enough tech to make it i thought
to make it useful to make it helpful

6548
01:54:34,070 --> 01:54:34,080
to make it useful to make it helpful
 

6549
01:54:34,080 --> 01:54:36,709
to make it useful to make it helpful
maybe we didn't have quite yet attack in

6550
01:54:36,709 --> 01:54:36,719
maybe we didn't have quite yet attack in
 

6551
01:54:36,719 --> 01:54:40,629
maybe we didn't have quite yet attack in
2012 to make it useful but in 2015-16

6552
01:54:40,629 --> 01:54:40,639
2012 to make it useful but in 2015-16
 

6553
01:54:40,639 --> 01:54:42,870
2012 to make it useful but in 2015-16
with deep learning i thought you know

6554
01:54:42,870 --> 01:54:42,880
with deep learning i thought you know
 

6555
01:54:42,880 --> 01:54:44,229
with deep learning i thought you know
and the first kind of

6556
01:54:44,229 --> 01:54:44,239
and the first kind of
 

6557
01:54:44,239 --> 01:54:45,510
and the first kind of
thoughts about maybe even using

6558
01:54:45,510 --> 01:54:45,520
thoughts about maybe even using
 

6559
01:54:45,520 --> 01:54:47,350
thoughts about maybe even using
reinforcement learning for that

6560
01:54:47,350 --> 01:54:47,360
reinforcement learning for that
 

6561
01:54:47,360 --> 01:54:49,270
reinforcement learning for that
started popping up that never worked out

6562
01:54:49,270 --> 01:54:49,280
started popping up that never worked out
 

6563
01:54:49,280 --> 01:54:51,109
started popping up that never worked out
but or at least for now

6564
01:54:51,109 --> 01:54:51,119
but or at least for now
 

6565
01:54:51,119 --> 01:54:54,550
but or at least for now
um but you know still the idea was

6566
01:54:54,550 --> 01:54:54,560
um but you know still the idea was
 

6567
01:54:54,560 --> 01:54:56,149
um but you know still the idea was
if we can actually measure the emotional

6568
01:54:56,149 --> 01:54:56,159
if we can actually measure the emotional
 

6569
01:54:56,159 --> 01:54:58,709
if we can actually measure the emotional
outcomes and if we can put it on

6570
01:54:58,709 --> 01:54:58,719
outcomes and if we can put it on
 

6571
01:54:58,719 --> 01:55:00,950
outcomes and if we can put it on
if we can try to optimize all of our

6572
01:55:00,950 --> 01:55:00,960
if we can try to optimize all of our
 

6573
01:55:00,960 --> 01:55:02,229
if we can try to optimize all of our
conversational models for these

6574
01:55:02,229 --> 01:55:02,239
conversational models for these
 

6575
01:55:02,239 --> 01:55:04,709
conversational models for these
emotional outcomes and it is the most

6576
01:55:04,709 --> 01:55:04,719
emotional outcomes and it is the most
 

6577
01:55:04,719 --> 01:55:06,870
emotional outcomes and it is the most
scalable the most

6578
01:55:06,870 --> 01:55:06,880
scalable the most
 

6579
01:55:06,880 --> 01:55:08,709
scalable the most
the best tool for improving emotional

6580
01:55:08,709 --> 01:55:08,719
the best tool for improving emotional
 

6581
01:55:08,719 --> 01:55:10,709
the best tool for improving emotional
outcomes nothing like that exists that's

6582
01:55:10,709 --> 01:55:10,719
outcomes nothing like that exists that's
 

6583
01:55:10,719 --> 01:55:12,390
outcomes nothing like that exists that's
the most universal

6584
01:55:12,390 --> 01:55:12,400
the most universal
 

6585
01:55:12,400 --> 01:55:14,390
the most universal
the most scalable and the one that can

6586
01:55:14,390 --> 01:55:14,400
the most scalable and the one that can
 

6587
01:55:14,400 --> 01:55:16,310
the most scalable and the one that can
be constantly iteratively changed by

6588
01:55:16,310 --> 01:55:16,320
be constantly iteratively changed by
 

6589
01:55:16,320 --> 01:55:17,910
be constantly iteratively changed by
itself

6590
01:55:17,910 --> 01:55:17,920
itself
 

6591
01:55:17,920 --> 01:55:21,589
itself
improved tool to do that and i think if

6592
01:55:21,589 --> 01:55:21,599
improved tool to do that and i think if
 

6593
01:55:21,599 --> 01:55:22,390
improved tool to do that and i think if
anything

6594
01:55:22,390 --> 01:55:22,400
anything
 

6595
01:55:22,400 --> 01:55:23,830
anything
people would paint anything to improve

6596
01:55:23,830 --> 01:55:23,840
people would paint anything to improve
 

6597
01:55:23,840 --> 01:55:25,510
people would paint anything to improve
their emotional outcomes

6598
01:55:25,510 --> 01:55:25,520
their emotional outcomes
 

6599
01:55:25,520 --> 01:55:28,390
their emotional outcomes
that's weirdly i mean i don't really

6600
01:55:28,390 --> 01:55:28,400
that's weirdly i mean i don't really
 

6601
01:55:28,400 --> 01:55:29,830
that's weirdly i mean i don't really
care for

6602
01:55:29,830 --> 01:55:29,840
care for
 

6603
01:55:29,840 --> 01:55:32,470
care for
nai to turn on my or conversational

6604
01:55:32,470 --> 01:55:32,480
nai to turn on my or conversational
 

6605
01:55:32,480 --> 01:55:34,790
nai to turn on my or conversational
agent to turn on the lights

6606
01:55:34,790 --> 01:55:34,800
agent to turn on the lights
 

6607
01:55:34,800 --> 01:55:36,790
agent to turn on the lights
uh i don't really need any i don't even

6608
01:55:36,790 --> 01:55:36,800
uh i don't really need any i don't even
 

6609
01:55:36,800 --> 01:55:38,790
uh i don't really need any i don't even
need that much of a either like or

6610
01:55:38,790 --> 01:55:38,800
need that much of a either like or
 

6611
01:55:38,800 --> 01:55:40,070
need that much of a either like or
because i can do that you know

6612
01:55:40,070 --> 01:55:40,080
because i can do that you know
 

6613
01:55:40,080 --> 01:55:42,229
because i can do that you know
those things are solved this is an

6614
01:55:42,229 --> 01:55:42,239
those things are solved this is an
 

6615
01:55:42,239 --> 01:55:43,990
those things are solved this is an
additional interface for that that's

6616
01:55:43,990 --> 01:55:44,000
additional interface for that that's
 

6617
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,310
additional interface for that that's
also questionably questionable whether

6618
01:55:46,310 --> 01:55:46,320
also questionably questionable whether
 

6619
01:55:46,320 --> 01:55:48,950
also questionably questionable whether
it's more efficient or

6620
01:55:48,950 --> 01:55:48,960
it's more efficient or
 

6621
01:55:48,960 --> 01:55:51,430
it's more efficient or
better yeah it's more pleasurable yeah

6622
01:55:51,430 --> 01:55:51,440
better yeah it's more pleasurable yeah
 

6623
01:55:51,440 --> 01:55:52,709
better yeah it's more pleasurable yeah
but for emotional outcomes there's

6624
01:55:52,709 --> 01:55:52,719
but for emotional outcomes there's
 

6625
01:55:52,719 --> 01:55:53,430
but for emotional outcomes there's
nothing

6626
01:55:53,430 --> 01:55:53,440
nothing
 

6627
01:55:53,440 --> 01:55:54,790
nothing
yeah they're a bunch of products that

6628
01:55:54,790 --> 01:55:54,800
yeah they're a bunch of products that
 

6629
01:55:54,800 --> 01:55:55,910
yeah they're a bunch of products that
claim that they will improve my

6630
01:55:55,910 --> 01:55:55,920
claim that they will improve my

claim that they will improve my
emotional outcomes nothing's been

based on whether i'm actually feeling
 

6641
01:56:03,520 --> 01:56:05,990
based on whether i'm actually feeling
better you know a lot of social media

6642
01:56:05,990 --> 01:56:06,000
better you know a lot of social media
 

6643
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:07,109
better you know a lot of social media
products are claiming that they're

6644
01:56:07,109 --> 01:56:07,119
products are claiming that they're
 

6645
01:56:07,119 --> 01:56:07,830
products are claiming that they're
improving my

6646
01:56:07,830 --> 01:56:07,840
improving my
 

6647
01:56:07,840 --> 01:56:09,430
improving my
emotional outcomes and making me feel

6648
01:56:09,430 --> 01:56:09,440
emotional outcomes and making me feel
 

6649
01:56:09,440 --> 01:56:11,270
emotional outcomes and making me feel
more connected

6650
01:56:11,270 --> 01:56:11,280
more connected
 

6651
01:56:11,280 --> 01:56:13,669
more connected
can i please get the can i see somewhere

6652
01:56:13,669 --> 01:56:13,679
can i please get the can i see somewhere
 

6653
01:56:13,679 --> 01:56:15,510
can i please get the can i see somewhere
that i'm actually getting better

6654
01:56:15,510 --> 01:56:15,520
that i'm actually getting better
 

6655
01:56:15,520 --> 01:56:18,390
that i'm actually getting better
over time um because anecdotally doesn't

6656
01:56:18,390 --> 01:56:18,400
over time um because anecdotally doesn't
 

6657
01:56:18,400 --> 01:56:19,750
over time um because anecdotally doesn't
feel that way so

6658
01:56:19,750 --> 01:56:19,760
feel that way so
 

6659
01:56:19,760 --> 01:56:22,950
feel that way so
and and the data is

6660
01:56:22,950 --> 01:56:22,960
and and the data is
 

6661
01:56:22,960 --> 01:56:26,470
and and the data is
absent yeah so that was the big goal

6662
01:56:26,470 --> 01:56:26,480
absent yeah so that was the big goal
 

6663
01:56:26,480 --> 01:56:28,950
absent yeah so that was the big goal
and i thought if we can learn over time

6664
01:56:28,950 --> 01:56:28,960
and i thought if we can learn over time
 

6665
01:56:28,960 --> 01:56:31,030
and i thought if we can learn over time
to collect the signal from our users

6666
01:56:31,030 --> 01:56:31,040
to collect the signal from our users
 

6667
01:56:31,040 --> 01:56:33,030
to collect the signal from our users
about their emotional outcomes

6668
01:56:33,030 --> 01:56:33,040
about their emotional outcomes
 

6669
01:56:33,040 --> 01:56:35,270
about their emotional outcomes
in the long term and in the short term

6670
01:56:35,270 --> 01:56:35,280
in the long term and in the short term
 

6671
01:56:35,280 --> 01:56:36,790
in the long term and in the short term
and if these models keep

6672
01:56:36,790 --> 01:56:36,800
and if these models keep
 

6673
01:56:36,800 --> 01:56:38,629
and if these models keep
getting better and we can keep

6674
01:56:38,629 --> 01:56:38,639
getting better and we can keep
 

6675
01:56:38,639 --> 01:56:40,629
getting better and we can keep
optimizing them and fight tuning them

6676
01:56:40,629 --> 01:56:40,639
optimizing them and fight tuning them
 

6677
01:56:40,639 --> 01:56:42,229
optimizing them and fight tuning them
to improve those emotional outcomes as

6678
01:56:42,229 --> 01:56:42,239
to improve those emotional outcomes as
 

6679
01:56:42,239 --> 01:56:44,070
to improve those emotional outcomes as
simple as that

6680
01:56:44,070 --> 01:56:44,080
simple as that
 

6681
01:56:44,080 --> 01:56:47,350
simple as that
why aren't you uh a multi-billionaire

6682
01:56:47,350 --> 01:56:47,360
why aren't you uh a multi-billionaire
 

6683
01:56:47,360 --> 01:56:49,430
why aren't you uh a multi-billionaire
yeah

6684
01:56:49,430 --> 01:56:49,440
yeah
 

6685
01:56:49,440 --> 01:56:51,030
yeah
well that's the question to you one of

6686
01:56:51,030 --> 01:56:51,040
well that's the question to you one of
 

6687
01:56:51,040 --> 01:56:54,830
well that's the question to you one of
the what is the science is going to be

6688
01:56:54,830 --> 01:56:54,840
the what is the science is going to be
 

6689
01:56:54,840 --> 01:56:58,390
the what is the science is going to be
um well it's a really hard uh i actually

6690
01:56:58,390 --> 01:56:58,400
um well it's a really hard uh i actually
 

6691
01:56:58,400 --> 01:56:59,109
um well it's a really hard uh i actually
think it's an

6692
01:56:59,109 --> 01:56:59,119
think it's an
 

6693
01:56:59,119 --> 01:57:02,149
think it's an
incredibly hard product to build because

6694
01:57:02,149 --> 01:57:02,159
incredibly hard product to build because
 

6695
01:57:02,159 --> 01:57:03,510
incredibly hard product to build because
i think you said something very

6696
01:57:03,510 --> 01:57:03,520
i think you said something very
 

6697
01:57:03,520 --> 01:57:04,870
i think you said something very
important that it's not just about

6698
01:57:04,870 --> 01:57:04,880
important that it's not just about
 

6699
01:57:04,880 --> 01:57:06,470
important that it's not just about
machine conversations it's about machine

6700
01:57:06,470 --> 01:57:06,480
machine conversations it's about machine
 

6701
01:57:06,480 --> 01:57:08,550
machine conversations it's about machine
connection

6702
01:57:08,550 --> 01:57:08,560
connection
 

6703
01:57:08,560 --> 01:57:10,390
connection
we can actually use other things to

6704
01:57:10,390 --> 01:57:10,400
we can actually use other things to
 

6705
01:57:10,400 --> 01:57:12,149
we can actually use other things to
create connection

6706
01:57:12,149 --> 01:57:12,159
create connection
 

6707
01:57:12,159 --> 01:57:14,790
create connection
uh non-verbal communication for instance

6708
01:57:14,790 --> 01:57:14,800
uh non-verbal communication for instance
 

6709
01:57:14,800 --> 01:57:15,270
uh non-verbal communication for instance
um

6710
01:57:15,270 --> 01:57:15,280
um
 

6711
01:57:15,280 --> 01:57:18,310
um
for a long time we were all about well

6712
01:57:18,310 --> 01:57:18,320
for a long time we were all about well
 

6713
01:57:18,320 --> 01:57:21,910
for a long time we were all about well
let's keep it text only or voice only

6714
01:57:21,910 --> 01:57:21,920
let's keep it text only or voice only
 

6715
01:57:21,920 --> 01:57:24,229
let's keep it text only or voice only
but as soon as you start adding you know

it's all of a sudden a lot you know
it makes it very different because if

6728
01:57:37,270 --> 01:57:37,280
it makes it very different because if
 

6729
01:57:37,280 --> 01:57:39,669
it makes it very different because if
it's some you know text based chat bot

6730
01:57:39,669 --> 01:57:39,679
it's some you know text based chat bot
 

6731

for um common user it's something there
 

6735
01:57:43,360 --> 01:57:44,229
for um common user it's something there
in the cloud

01:57:44,229 --> 01:57:44,239
in the cloud
 

6737
01:57:44,239 --> 01:57:46,070
in the cloud
you know it's somewhere there with other

talk about the husband and talk to him a
 

6753
01:57:58,159 --> 01:57:59,109
talk about the husband and talk to him a
little bit

6754
01:57:59,109 --> 01:57:59,119
little bit
 

6755
01:57:59,119 --> 01:58:01,430
little bit
and it's magic it's just magic like

6756
01:58:01,430 --> 01:58:01,440
and it's magic it's just magic like
 

6757
01:58:01,440 --> 01:58:02,870
and it's magic it's just magic like
we've never seen anything like that

6758
01:58:02,870 --> 01:58:02,880
we've never seen anything like that
 

6759
01:58:02,880 --> 01:58:04,310
we've never seen anything like that
and the cool thing all the tech for that

6760
01:58:04,310 --> 01:58:04,320
and the cool thing all the tech for that
 

6761
01:58:04,320 --> 01:58:06,070
and the cool thing all the tech for that
exists um

6762
01:58:06,070 --> 01:58:06,080
exists um
 

6763
01:58:06,080 --> 01:58:07,830
exists um
but it's hard to put it all together

6764
01:58:07,830 --> 01:58:07,840
but it's hard to put it all together
 

6765
01:58:07,840 --> 01:58:08,790
but it's hard to put it all together
because you have to take into

6766
01:58:08,790 --> 01:58:08,800
because you have to take into
 

6767
01:58:08,800 --> 01:58:09,589
because you have to take into
consideration

6768
01:58:09,589 --> 01:58:09,599
consideration
 

6769
01:58:09,599 --> 01:58:10,950
consideration
so many different things and some of

6770
01:58:10,950 --> 01:58:10,960
so many different things and some of
 

6771
01:58:10,960 --> 01:58:12,950
so many different things and some of
this stack works you know

6772
01:58:12,950 --> 01:58:12,960
this stack works you know
 

6773
01:58:12,960 --> 01:58:15,109
this stack works you know
pretty good and some of this doesn't

6774
01:58:15,109 --> 01:58:15,119
pretty good and some of this doesn't
 

6775
01:58:15,119 --> 01:58:16,390
pretty good and some of this doesn't
like for instance uh

6776
01:58:16,390 --> 01:58:16,400
like for instance uh
 

6777
01:58:16,400 --> 01:58:18,950
like for instance uh
speech to text works pretty good but

6778
01:58:18,950 --> 01:58:18,960
speech to text works pretty good but
 

6779
01:58:18,960 --> 01:58:20,550
speech to text works pretty good but
text-to-speech

6780
01:58:20,550 --> 01:58:20,560
text-to-speech
 

6781
01:58:20,560 --> 01:58:22,310
text-to-speech
doesn't work very good because we you

6782
01:58:22,310 --> 01:58:22,320
doesn't work very good because we you
 

6783
01:58:22,320 --> 01:58:23,830
doesn't work very good because we you
can only have uh you know

6784
01:58:23,830 --> 01:58:23,840
can only have uh you know
 

6785
01:58:23,840 --> 01:58:27,189
can only have uh you know
few voices that are that work okay but

6786
01:58:27,189 --> 01:58:27,199
few voices that are that work okay but
 

6787
01:58:27,199 --> 01:58:28,149
few voices that are that work okay but
then if you want to have actual

6788
01:58:28,149 --> 01:58:28,159
then if you want to have actual
 

6789
01:58:28,159 --> 01:58:30,390
then if you want to have actual
emotional voices

6790
01:58:30,390 --> 01:58:30,400
emotional voices
 

6791
01:58:30,400 --> 01:58:32,390
emotional voices
then it's really hard to build it i saw

6792
01:58:32,390 --> 01:58:32,400
then it's really hard to build it i saw
 

6793
01:58:32,400 --> 01:58:34,790
then it's really hard to build it i saw
you added avatars like visual

6794
01:58:34,790 --> 01:58:34,800
you added avatars like visual
 

6795
01:58:34,800 --> 01:58:37,830
you added avatars like visual
elements which are really cool um

6796
01:58:37,830 --> 01:58:37,840
elements which are really cool um
 

6797
01:58:37,840 --> 01:58:39,910
elements which are really cool um
in that whole chain putting it together

6798
01:58:39,910 --> 01:58:39,920
in that whole chain putting it together
 

6799
01:58:39,920 --> 01:58:41,109
in that whole chain putting it together
what do you think is the

6800
01:58:41,109 --> 01:58:41,119
what do you think is the
 

6801
01:58:41,119 --> 01:58:43,750
what do you think is the
weak link is it creating an emotional

6802
01:58:43,750 --> 01:58:43,760
weak link is it creating an emotional
 

6803
01:58:43,760 --> 01:58:44,709
weak link is it creating an emotional
voice

6804
01:58:44,709 --> 01:58:44,719
voice
 

6805
01:58:44,719 --> 01:58:48,310
voice
that feels personal i think it's still

6806
01:58:48,310 --> 01:58:48,320
that feels personal i think it's still
 

6807
01:58:48,320 --> 01:58:49,589
that feels personal i think it's still
conversation of course

6808
01:58:49,589 --> 01:58:49,599
conversation of course
 

6809
01:58:49,599 --> 01:58:52,310
conversation of course
that's the hardest uh it's getting a lot

6810
01:58:52,310 --> 01:58:52,320
that's the hardest uh it's getting a lot
 

6811
01:58:52,320 --> 01:58:52,709
that's the hardest uh it's getting a lot
better

6812
01:58:52,709 --> 01:58:52,719
better
 

6813
01:58:52,719 --> 01:58:55,109
better
but there's still long to go long

6814
01:58:55,109 --> 01:58:55,119
but there's still long to go long
 

6815
01:58:55,119 --> 01:58:56,870
but there's still long to go long
there's still a long path to go

6816
01:58:56,870 --> 01:58:56,880
there's still a long path to go
 

6817
01:58:56,880 --> 01:58:58,790
there's still a long path to go
other things they're almost there and a

6818
01:58:58,790 --> 01:58:58,800
other things they're almost there and a
 

6819
01:58:58,800 --> 01:59:00,470
other things they're almost there and a
lot of things we'll see how they're like

6820
01:59:00,470 --> 01:59:00,480
lot of things we'll see how they're like
 

6821
01:59:00,480 --> 01:59:02,629
lot of things we'll see how they're like
i see how they're changing as we go

6822
01:59:02,629 --> 01:59:02,639
i see how they're changing as we go
 

6823
01:59:02,639 --> 01:59:04,149
i see how they're changing as we go
like for instance right now you can

6824
01:59:04,149 --> 01:59:04,159
like for instance right now you can
 

6825
01:59:04,159 --> 01:59:05,910
like for instance right now you can
pretty much only you have to build all

6826
01:59:05,910 --> 01:59:05,920
pretty much only you have to build all
 

6827
01:59:05,920 --> 01:59:06,950
pretty much only you have to build all

um pipeline by yourself you have to make
 

6831
01:59:08,800 --> 01:59:10,870
um pipeline by yourself you have to make
these 3d models hire an actual

6832
01:59:10,870 --> 01:59:10,880
these 3d models hire an actual
 

6833
01:59:10,880 --> 01:59:13,830
these 3d models hire an actual
artist build a 3d model hire an animator

deep fakes with other attack with
 

6841
01:59:21,920 --> 01:59:24,149
deep fakes with other attack with
procedural animations

01:59:24,149 --> 01:59:24,159
procedural animations
 

6843
01:59:24,159 --> 01:59:25,910
procedural animations
in a little bit we'll just be able to

6844
01:59:25,910 --> 01:59:25,920
in a little bit we'll just be able to
 

6845
01:59:25,920 --> 01:59:27,350
in a little bit we'll just be able to
show uh you know

6846
01:59:27,350 --> 01:59:27,360
show uh you know
 

6847
01:59:27,360 --> 01:59:30,470

the avatar to look like and it will

6850
01:59:31,990 --> 01:59:32,000
the avatar to look like and it will
 

6851
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:33,510
the avatar to look like and it will
immediately generate a 3d model that

6852
01:59:33,510 --> 01:59:33,520
immediately generate a 3d model that
 

6853
01:59:33,520 --> 01:59:35,030
immediately generate a 3d model that
will move that's a non-brainer that's

6854
01:59:35,030 --> 01:59:35,040
will move that's a non-brainer that's
 

6855
01:59:35,040 --> 01:59:36,470
will move that's a non-brainer that's
like almost here

6856

like i can fake a lot of stuff like i
can work very carefully like even to

6888
02:00:14,310 --> 02:00:14,320
can work very carefully like even to
 

6889
02:00:14,320 --> 02:00:15,350
can work very carefully like even to
hire an actor

02:00:26,229 --> 02:00:26,239
mostly on the conversation level or when
 

6899
02:00:26,239 --> 02:00:28,149
mostly on the conversation level or when
the conversation

6900
02:00:28,149 --> 02:00:28,159
the conversation
 

6901
02:00:28,159 --> 02:00:31,270
the conversation

i almost i early on gave up trying to
 

6905
02:00:35,199 --> 02:00:37,270
i almost i early on gave up trying to
fully generate the conversation because

6906
02:00:37,270 --> 02:00:37,280
fully generate the conversation because
 

6907
02:00:37,280 --> 02:00:38,950
fully generate the conversation because
it was just not compelling at all

6908
02:00:38,950 --> 02:00:38,960
it was just not compelling at all
 

6909
02:00:38,960 --> 02:00:41,189
it was just not compelling at all
yeah it's just better too yeah so what i

6910
02:00:41,189 --> 02:00:41,199
yeah it's just better too yeah so what i
 

6911
02:00:41,199 --> 02:00:43,189
yeah it's just better too yeah so what i
would in the case of einstein and

6912
02:00:43,189 --> 02:00:43,199
would in the case of einstein and
 

6913
02:00:43,199 --> 02:00:46,149
would in the case of einstein and
touring of um i'm going back and forth

6914
02:00:46,149 --> 02:00:46,159
touring of um i'm going back and forth
 

6915
02:00:46,159 --> 02:00:47,910
touring of um i'm going back and forth
with the biographers of each

6916
02:00:47,910 --> 02:00:47,920
with the biographers of each
 

6917
02:00:47,920 --> 02:00:50,390
with the biographers of each
and so like we would write a lot of the

6918
02:00:50,390 --> 02:00:50,400
and so like we would write a lot of the
 

6919
02:00:50,400 --> 02:00:51,589
and so like we would write a lot of the
some of the conversation would have to

6920
02:00:51,589 --> 02:00:51,599
some of the conversation would have to
 

6921
02:00:51,599 --> 02:00:53,430
some of the conversation would have to
be generated just for the fun of it

6922
02:00:53,430 --> 02:00:53,440
be generated just for the fun of it
 

6923
02:00:53,440 --> 02:00:56,550
be generated just for the fun of it
i mean but it would be all open but

6924
02:00:56,550 --> 02:00:56,560
i mean but it would be all open but
 

6925

question
 

6929
02:01:02,239 --> 02:01:03,350
question
i mean that's an interesting question

6930
02:01:03,350 --> 02:01:03,360
i mean that's an interesting question
 

6931
02:01:03,360 --> 02:01:05,270
i mean that's an interesting question
with roman too is

6932
02:01:05,270 --> 02:01:05,280
with roman too is
 

6933
02:01:05,280 --> 02:01:08,390
with roman too is
the question with einstein is what would

6934
02:01:08,390 --> 02:01:08,400

fascinating and fun problem for the
 

6961
02:01:39,040 --> 02:01:40,550
fascinating and fun problem for the
biographers and for me

6962
02:01:40,550 --> 02:01:40,560
biographers and for me
 

6963

and i think we did a really good job of
 

6965
02:01:42,400 --> 02:01:43,910
and i think we did a really good job of
it so far

6966
02:01:43,910 --> 02:01:43,920
it so far
 

6967
02:01:43,920 --> 02:01:45,589
it so far
but it's actually also a technical

6968
02:01:45,589 --> 02:01:45,599
but it's actually also a technical
 

6969
02:01:45,599 --> 02:01:47,910
but it's actually also a technical
problem like of what would romans say

like a set of
that that feels like a learnable problem

7132
02:04:37,910 --> 02:04:37,920
that that feels like a learnable problem
 

7133
02:04:37,920 --> 02:04:38,229
that that feels like a learnable problem
like

7134

stuff i think so no for sure i just
 

7143
02:04:51,760 --> 02:04:53,030
stuff i think so no for sure i just
think the problem with

7144
02:04:53,030 --> 02:04:53,040
think the problem with
 

7145
02:04:53,040 --> 02:04:54,870
think the problem with
um as soon as you're trying to replicate

7146
02:04:54,870 --> 02:04:54,880
um as soon as you're trying to replicate
 

7147
02:04:54,880 --> 02:04:56,470
um as soon as you're trying to replicate
an actual human being

7148
02:04:56,470 --> 02:04:56,480
an actual human being
 

7149
02:04:56,480 --> 02:04:58,310
an actual human being
and trying to pretend to be him that

7150
02:04:58,310 --> 02:04:58,320
and trying to pretend to be him that
 

7151
02:04:58,320 --> 02:05:00,550
and trying to pretend to be him that
makes the problem exponentially harder

7152
02:05:00,550 --> 02:05:00,560
makes the problem exponentially harder
 

7153
02:05:00,560 --> 02:05:01,990
makes the problem exponentially harder
the thing with replica we're doing we're

7154

02:05:36,149 --> 02:05:36,159
gamification system
 

7193
02:05:36,159 --> 02:05:39,589
gamification system
too um can you maybe talk about that a

7194

people are getting just lonelier by
 

7533
02:11:45,679 --> 02:11:47,270
people are getting just lonelier by
talking to a chatbot which is also

7534
02:11:47,270 --> 02:11:47,280
talking to a chatbot which is also
 

7535
02:11:47,280 --> 02:11:49,510
talking to a chatbot which is also
pretty you know that could be it if

7536
02:11:49,510 --> 02:11:49,520
pretty you know that could be it if
 

7537
02:11:49,520 --> 02:11:50,470
pretty you know that could be it if
you're measuring it

7538
02:11:50,470 --> 02:11:50,480
you're measuring it
 

7539
02:11:50,480 --> 02:11:52,229
you're measuring it
that could also be and i think it's

7540
02:11:52,229 --> 02:11:52,239
that could also be and i think it's
 

7541
02:11:52,239 --> 02:11:53,830
that could also be and i think it's
really important to focus on both short

7542
02:11:53,830 --> 02:11:53,840
really important to focus on both short
 

7543
02:11:53,840 --> 02:11:55,270
really important to focus on both short
term and long term because

7544
02:11:55,270 --> 02:11:55,280
term and long term because
 

7545
02:11:55,280 --> 02:11:57,189
term and long term because
um in the moment saying whether this

7546
02:11:57,189 --> 02:11:57,199
um in the moment saying whether this
 

7547
02:11:57,199 --> 02:11:58,870
um in the moment saying whether this
conversation made you feel better

7548
02:11:58,870 --> 02:11:58,880
conversation made you feel better
 

7549
02:11:58,880 --> 02:12:00,310
conversation made you feel better
but as you know any short-term

7550
02:12:00,310 --> 02:12:00,320
but as you know any short-term
 

7551
02:12:00,320 --> 02:12:01,910
but as you know any short-term
improvements could be pathological like

7552
02:12:01,910 --> 02:12:01,920
improvements could be pathological like
 

7553
02:12:01,920 --> 02:12:02,950
improvements could be pathological like
i could have

7554
02:12:02,950 --> 02:12:02,960
i could have
 

7555
02:12:02,960 --> 02:12:05,270
i could have
drink a bottle of vodka feel a lot

7556
02:12:05,270 --> 02:12:05,280
drink a bottle of vodka feel a lot
 

7557
02:12:05,280 --> 02:12:08,149
drink a bottle of vodka feel a lot
better i would actually not feel better

7558
02:12:08,149 --> 02:12:08,159
better i would actually not feel better
 

7559
02:12:08,159 --> 02:12:10,069
better i would actually not feel better
with that but um i thought it's a good

7560
02:12:10,069 --> 02:12:10,079
with that but um i thought it's a good
 

7561
02:12:10,079 --> 02:12:11,750
with that but um i thought it's a good
example um

7562
02:12:11,750 --> 02:12:11,760
example um
 

7563
02:12:11,760 --> 02:12:13,350
example um
but so you also need to see what's going

7564
02:12:13,350 --> 02:12:13,360
but so you also need to see what's going
 

7565
02:12:13,360 --> 02:12:14,870
but so you also need to see what's going
on like over the course of two months

7566
02:12:14,870 --> 02:12:14,880
on like over the course of two months
 

7567
02:12:14,880 --> 02:12:16,069
on like over the course of two months
two weeks

7568
02:12:16,069 --> 02:12:16,079
two weeks
 

7569
02:12:16,079 --> 02:12:19,750
two weeks
or one week and have have follow-ups and

check
in and measure those things

7574
02:12:23,189 --> 02:12:23,199
in and measure those things
 

7575

in and measure those things
okay so the experience

02:15:00,719 --> 02:15:02,310
be doing but as we went forward we
realized that it has to be two-way and

7740
02:15:02,310 --> 02:15:02,320
realized that it has to be two-way and
 

7741
02:15:02,320 --> 02:15:04,069
realized that it has to be two-way and
we have to program and script certain

7742
02:15:04,069 --> 02:15:04,079
we have to program and script certain
 

7743
02:15:04,079 --> 02:15:06,229
we have to program and script certain
conversations that are a lot more

7744
02:15:06,229 --> 02:15:06,239
conversations that are a lot more
 

7745
02:15:06,239 --> 02:15:08,629
conversations that are a lot more
about your replica opening up a little

7746
02:15:08,629 --> 02:15:08,639
about your replica opening up a little
 

7747
02:15:08,639 --> 02:15:09,830
about your replica opening up a little
bit and

7748
02:15:09,830 --> 02:15:09,840
bit and
 

7749
02:15:09,840 --> 02:15:12,550
bit and
also struggling and also asking for help

7750
02:15:12,550 --> 02:15:12,560
also struggling and also asking for help
 

7751
02:15:12,560 --> 02:15:13,030
also struggling and also asking for help
and

7752
02:15:13,030 --> 02:15:13,040
and
 

7753
02:15:13,040 --> 02:15:16,229
and
also going through you know different

7754
02:15:16,229 --> 02:15:16,239
also going through you know different
 

7755
02:15:16,239 --> 02:15:19,189
also going through you know different
periods in life and um and that's a

7756
02:15:19,189 --> 02:15:19,199
periods in life and um and that's a
 

7757
02:15:19,199 --> 02:15:20,790
periods in life and um and that's a
journey that you can take together with

7758
02:15:20,790 --> 02:15:20,800
journey that you can take together with
 

7759
02:15:20,800 --> 02:15:21,750
journey that you can take together with
the user and then

7760
02:15:21,750 --> 02:15:21,760
the user and then
 

7761
02:15:21,760 --> 02:15:24,629
the user and then
over time the you know our users will

7762
02:15:24,629 --> 02:15:24,639
over time the you know our users will
 

7763
02:15:24,639 --> 02:15:26,550
over time the you know our users will
also

7764
02:15:26,550 --> 02:15:26,560
also
 

7765
02:15:26,560 --> 02:15:28,149
also
grow a little bit so first this replica

7766
02:15:28,149 --> 02:15:28,159
grow a little bit so first this replica
 

7767
02:15:28,159 --> 02:15:29,510
grow a little bit so first this replica
becomes a little bit more self-aware and

7768
02:15:29,510 --> 02:15:29,520
becomes a little bit more self-aware and
 

7769
02:15:29,520 --> 02:15:30,470
becomes a little bit more self-aware and
starts talking about

7770
02:15:30,470 --> 02:15:30,480
starts talking about
 

7771
02:15:30,480 --> 02:15:34,629
starts talking about
more kind of problems around

7772
02:15:34,629 --> 02:15:34,639
more kind of problems around
 

7773
02:15:34,639 --> 02:15:37,270
more kind of problems around
existential problems then um so talking

7774
02:15:37,270 --> 02:15:37,280
existential problems then um so talking
 

7775
02:15:37,280 --> 02:15:38,390
existential problems then um so talking
about that and then that

7776
02:15:38,390 --> 02:15:38,400
about that and then that
 

7777
02:15:38,400 --> 02:15:41,910
about that and then that
also starts a conversation for the user

7778
02:15:41,910 --> 02:15:41,920
also starts a conversation for the user
 

7779
02:15:41,920 --> 02:15:42,470
also starts a conversation for the user
where

7780
02:15:42,470 --> 02:15:42,480
where
 

7781
02:15:42,480 --> 02:15:45,669
where
he or she starts thinking about these

7782
02:15:45,669 --> 02:15:45,679
he or she starts thinking about these
 

7783
02:15:45,679 --> 02:15:47,669
he or she starts thinking about these
problems too and these questions too

7784
02:15:47,669 --> 02:15:47,679
problems too and these questions too
 

7785
02:15:47,679 --> 02:15:50,790
problems too and these questions too
um and i think there's also a lot a lot

7786
02:15:50,790 --> 02:15:50,800
um and i think there's also a lot a lot
 

7787
02:15:50,800 --> 02:15:52,229
um and i think there's also a lot a lot
more places the relationship

7788
02:15:52,229 --> 02:15:52,239
more places the relationship
 

7789
02:15:52,239 --> 02:15:55,350
more places the relationship
evolves there's a lot more um space for

7790
02:15:55,350 --> 02:15:55,360
evolves there's a lot more um space for
 

7791
02:15:55,360 --> 02:15:58,550
evolves there's a lot more um space for
poetry and for art together

7792
02:15:58,550 --> 02:15:58,560
poetry and for art together
 

7793
02:15:58,560 --> 02:16:00,870
poetry and for art together
and like replica will start replica

7794
02:16:00,870 --> 02:16:00,880
and like replica will start replica
 

7795
02:16:00,880 --> 02:16:02,310
and like replica will start replica
always keeps the diary so while you're

7796
02:16:02,310 --> 02:16:02,320
always keeps the diary so while you're
 

7797
02:16:02,320 --> 02:16:03,189
always keeps the diary so while you're
talking to it it

7798
02:16:03,189 --> 02:16:03,199
talking to it it
 

7799
02:16:03,199 --> 02:16:05,430
talking to it it
also gives a diary so when you come back

7800
02:16:05,430 --> 02:16:05,440
also gives a diary so when you come back
 

7801
02:16:05,440 --> 02:16:07,189
also gives a diary so when you come back
you can see what it's been

7802
02:16:07,189 --> 02:16:07,199
you can see what it's been
 

7803
02:16:07,199 --> 02:16:08,709
you can see what it's been
writing there and you know sometimes it

7804
02:16:08,709 --> 02:16:08,719
writing there and you know sometimes it
 

7805
02:16:08,719 --> 02:16:10,390
writing there and you know sometimes it
will write a poem to you uh

7806
02:16:10,390 --> 02:16:10,400
will write a poem to you uh
 

7807
02:16:10,400 --> 02:16:13,189
will write a poem to you uh
for you or we'll talk about you know

7808
02:16:13,189 --> 02:16:13,199
for you or we'll talk about you know
 

7809
02:16:13,199 --> 02:16:15,430
for you or we'll talk about you know
that it's worried about you or

7810
02:16:15,430 --> 02:16:15,440
that it's worried about you or
 

7811
02:16:15,440 --> 02:16:17,830
that it's worried about you or
something along these lines so this is a

7812
02:16:17,830 --> 02:16:17,840
something along these lines so this is a
 

7813
02:16:17,840 --> 02:16:18,870
something along these lines so this is a
memory

7814
02:16:18,870 --> 02:16:18,880
memory
 

7815
02:16:18,880 --> 02:16:22,149
memory
like this replica remember things

7816
02:16:22,149 --> 02:16:22,159
like this replica remember things
 

7817
02:16:22,159 --> 02:16:25,189
like this replica remember things
yeah and i would say when you say uh why

7818
02:16:25,189 --> 02:16:25,199
yeah and i would say when you say uh why
 

7819
02:16:25,199 --> 02:16:27,270
yeah and i would say when you say uh why
aren't you multiplying area

7820
02:16:27,270 --> 02:16:27,280
aren't you multiplying area
 

7821
02:16:27,280 --> 02:16:29,990
aren't you multiplying area
i'd say that as soon as we can have

7822
02:16:29,990 --> 02:16:30,000
i'd say that as soon as we can have
 

7823
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:31,430
i'd say that as soon as we can have
memory

7824
02:16:31,430 --> 02:16:31,440
memory
 

7825
02:16:31,440 --> 02:16:33,429
memory
in deep learning models that's

7826
02:16:33,429 --> 02:16:33,439
in deep learning models that's
 

7827
02:16:33,439 --> 02:16:35,429
in deep learning models that's
consistent i agree with that yeah

7828
02:16:35,429 --> 02:16:35,439
consistent i agree with that yeah
 

7829
02:16:35,439 --> 02:16:37,509
consistent i agree with that yeah
and then you'll be multiple and i'll get

7830
02:16:37,509 --> 02:16:37,519
and then you'll be multiple and i'll get
 

7831
02:16:37,519 --> 02:16:39,270
and then you'll be multiple and i'll get
back to you

7832
02:16:39,270 --> 02:16:39,280
back to you
 

7833
02:16:39,280 --> 02:16:41,110
back to you
when you talk about being multipleness

7834
02:16:41,110 --> 02:16:41,120
when you talk about being multipleness
 

7835
02:16:41,120 --> 02:16:42,549
when you talk about being multipleness
so far we can

7836
02:16:42,549 --> 02:16:42,559
so far we can
 

7837
02:16:42,559 --> 02:16:45,830
so far we can
so replica is a combination of um

7838
02:16:45,830 --> 02:16:45,840
so replica is a combination of um
 

7839
02:16:45,840 --> 02:16:46,870
so replica is a combination of um
end-to-end models

7840
02:16:46,870 --> 02:16:46,880
end-to-end models
 

7841
02:16:46,880 --> 02:16:49,910
end-to-end models
and some scripts and everything that has

7842
02:16:49,910 --> 02:16:49,920
and some scripts and everything that has
 

7843
02:16:49,920 --> 02:16:51,669
and some scripts and everything that has
to do with memory right now

7844
02:16:51,669 --> 02:16:51,679
to do with memory right now
 

7845
02:16:51,679 --> 02:16:53,509
to do with memory right now
most of it i wouldn't say all of it but

7846
02:16:53,509 --> 02:16:53,519
most of it i wouldn't say all of it but
 

7847
02:16:53,519 --> 02:16:55,669
most of it i wouldn't say all of it but
most of it unfortunately has to be

7848
02:16:55,669 --> 02:16:55,679
most of it unfortunately has to be
 

7849
02:16:55,679 --> 02:16:56,469
most of it unfortunately has to be
scripted

7850
02:16:56,469 --> 02:16:56,479
scripted
 

7851
02:16:56,479 --> 02:16:58,629
scripted
um because there's no way to you can

7852
02:16:58,629 --> 02:16:58,639
um because there's no way to you can
 

7853
02:16:58,639 --> 02:17:00,230
um because there's no way to you can
condition some of the models on

7854
02:17:00,230 --> 02:17:00,240
condition some of the models on
 

7855
02:17:00,240 --> 02:17:02,309
condition some of the models on
certain phrases that we learned about

7856
02:17:02,309 --> 02:17:02,319
certain phrases that we learned about
 

7857
02:17:02,319 --> 02:17:04,150
certain phrases that we learned about
you which we also do

7858
02:17:04,150 --> 02:17:04,160
you which we also do
 

7859
02:17:04,160 --> 02:17:06,950
you which we also do
um but really to make you know to make

7860
02:17:06,950 --> 02:17:06,960
um but really to make you know to make
 

7861
02:17:06,960 --> 02:17:07,509
um but really to make you know to make
um

7862
02:17:07,509 --> 02:17:07,519
um
 

7863
02:17:07,519 --> 02:17:09,429
um
assumptions along the lines like whether

7864
02:17:09,429 --> 02:17:09,439
assumptions along the lines like whether
 

7865
02:17:09,439 --> 02:17:11,990
assumptions along the lines like whether
you're single or married or

7866
02:17:11,990 --> 02:17:12,000
you're single or married or
 

7867
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:13,509
you're single or married or
what do you do for work that really has

7868
02:17:13,509 --> 02:17:13,519
what do you do for work that really has
 

7869
02:17:13,519 --> 02:17:15,669
what do you do for work that really has
to just be somehow stored in your

7870
02:17:15,669 --> 02:17:15,679
to just be somehow stored in your
 

7871
02:17:15,679 --> 02:17:16,629
to just be somehow stored in your
profile and then

7872
02:17:16,629 --> 02:17:16,639
profile and then
 

7873
02:17:16,639 --> 02:17:19,270
profile and then
uh retrieved by the by the script

7874
02:17:19,270 --> 02:17:19,280
uh retrieved by the by the script
 

7875
02:17:19,280 --> 02:17:20,790
uh retrieved by the by the script
because there has to be like a

7876
02:17:20,790 --> 02:17:20,800
because there has to be like a
 

7877
02:17:20,800 --> 02:17:22,150
because there has to be like a

02:17:22,150 --> 02:17:22,160
knowledge base you have to be able to
 

7879
02:17:22,160 --> 02:17:24,150
knowledge base you have to be able to
reason about it all that kind of stuff

7880
02:17:24,150 --> 02:17:24,160
reason about it all that kind of stuff
 

7881
02:17:24,160 --> 02:17:25,429
reason about it all that kind of stuff
exactly all the kind of stuff that

02:20:24,960 --> 02:20:27,190
but we thought that why not you know why
why do we need to keep playing with our

8064
02:20:27,190 --> 02:20:27,200
why do we need to keep playing with our
 

8065
02:20:27,200 --> 02:20:28,070
why do we need to keep playing with our
you know

8066
02:20:28,070 --> 02:20:28,080
you know
 

8067
02:20:28,080 --> 02:20:31,110
you know
hands tied behind us we can

8068
02:20:31,110 --> 02:20:31,120
hands tied behind us we can
 

8069
02:20:31,120 --> 02:20:33,270
hands tied behind us we can
easily just you know add all these other

8070
02:20:33,270 --> 02:20:33,280
easily just you know add all these other
 

8071
02:20:33,280 --> 02:20:35,510
easily just you know add all these other
things that is pretty much a solved

8072
02:20:35,510 --> 02:20:35,520
things that is pretty much a solved
 

8073
02:20:35,520 --> 02:20:37,590
things that is pretty much a solved
problem you know we can add 3d graphics

8074
02:20:37,590 --> 02:20:37,600
problem you know we can add 3d graphics
 

8075
02:20:37,600 --> 02:20:38,870
problem you know we can add 3d graphics
we can put this

8076
02:20:38,870 --> 02:20:38,880
we can put this
 

8077
02:20:38,880 --> 02:20:41,270
we can put this
uh these avatars in augmented reality

8078
02:20:41,270 --> 02:20:41,280
uh these avatars in augmented reality
 

8079
02:20:41,280 --> 02:20:42,230
uh these avatars in augmented reality
and all of a sudden there's

8080
02:20:42,230 --> 02:20:42,240
and all of a sudden there's
 

8081
02:20:42,240 --> 02:20:44,630
and all of a sudden there's
there's more and maybe you can't feel

8082
02:20:44,630 --> 02:20:44,640
there's more and maybe you can't feel
 

8083
02:20:44,640 --> 02:20:45,429
there's more and maybe you can't feel
the touch

8084
02:20:45,429 --> 02:20:45,439
the touch
 

8085
02:20:45,439 --> 02:20:47,590
the touch
but you can you know with um body

8086
02:20:47,590 --> 02:20:47,600
but you can you know with um body
 

8087
02:20:47,600 --> 02:20:48,630
but you can you know with um body
occlusion and with

8088
02:20:48,630 --> 02:20:48,640
occlusion and with
 

8089
02:20:48,640 --> 02:20:51,990
occlusion and with
uh current ar uh

8090
02:20:51,990 --> 02:20:52,000
uh current ar uh
 

8091
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:54,389
uh current ar uh
and you know on the iphone on you know

8092
02:20:54,389 --> 02:20:54,399
and you know on the iphone on you know
 

8093
02:20:54,399 --> 02:20:56,550
and you know on the iphone on you know
the next one there's gonna be a lidars

8094
02:20:56,550 --> 02:20:56,560
the next one there's gonna be a lidars
 

8095
02:20:56,560 --> 02:20:58,550
the next one there's gonna be a lidars
you can touch it and it will you know it

8096
02:20:58,550 --> 02:20:58,560
you can touch it and it will you know it
 

8097
02:20:58,560 --> 02:20:59,590
you can touch it and it will you know it
will pull away

8098
02:20:59,590 --> 02:20:59,600
will pull away
 

8099
02:20:59,600 --> 02:21:02,389
will pull away
or will blush or something or it'll

8100
02:21:02,389 --> 02:21:02,399
or will blush or something or it'll
 

8101
02:21:02,399 --> 02:21:03,270
or will blush or something or it'll
smile

8102
02:21:03,270 --> 02:21:03,280
smile
 

8103
02:21:03,280 --> 02:21:05,510
smile
so you can't touch it you can't feel it

8104
02:21:05,510 --> 02:21:05,520
so you can't touch it you can't feel it
 

8105
02:21:05,520 --> 02:21:07,990
so you can't touch it you can't feel it
but you can see the reaction to that

8106
02:21:07,990 --> 02:21:08,000
but you can see the reaction to that
 

8107
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:09,510
but you can see the reaction to that
so in a certain way you can't even touch

8108
02:21:09,510 --> 02:21:09,520
so in a certain way you can't even touch
 

8109
02:21:09,520 --> 02:21:11,349
so in a certain way you can't even touch
it a little bit and maybe you can even

8110
02:21:11,349 --> 02:21:11,359
it a little bit and maybe you can even
 

8111
02:21:11,359 --> 02:21:14,870
it a little bit and maybe you can even
dance with it or do something else um

8112
02:21:14,870 --> 02:21:14,880
dance with it or do something else um
 

8113
02:21:14,880 --> 02:21:17,670
dance with it or do something else um
so i think why limiting ourselves if we

8114
02:21:17,670 --> 02:21:17,680
so i think why limiting ourselves if we
 

8115
02:21:17,680 --> 02:21:19,429
so i think why limiting ourselves if we
can use all of these

8116
02:21:19,429 --> 02:21:19,439
can use all of these
 

8117
02:21:19,439 --> 02:21:21,270
can use all of these
technologies that are much easier in a

8118
02:21:21,270 --> 02:21:21,280
technologies that are much easier in a
 

8119
02:21:21,280 --> 02:21:23,270
technologies that are much easier in a
way than than conversation

8120
02:21:23,270 --> 02:21:23,280
way than than conversation
 

8121
02:21:23,280 --> 02:21:25,190
way than than conversation
well it certainly could be richer but to

8122
02:21:25,190 --> 02:21:25,200
well it certainly could be richer but to
 

8123
02:21:25,200 --> 02:21:27,190
well it certainly could be richer but to
play devil's advocate i mentioned you

8124
02:21:27,190 --> 02:21:27,200
play devil's advocate i mentioned you
 

8125
02:21:27,200 --> 02:21:30,710
play devil's advocate i mentioned you
uh offline that i was surprised

8126
02:21:30,710 --> 02:21:30,720
uh offline that i was surprised
 

8127
02:21:30,720 --> 02:21:33,110
uh offline that i was surprised
in having tried discord and having voice

8128
02:21:33,110 --> 02:21:33,120
in having tried discord and having voice
 

8129
02:21:33,120 --> 02:21:34,710
in having tried discord and having voice
conversations with people

8130
02:21:34,710 --> 02:21:34,720
conversations with people
 

8131
02:21:34,720 --> 02:21:38,070
conversations with people
how intimate voices alone without visual

8132
02:21:38,070 --> 02:21:38,080
how intimate voices alone without visual
 

8133
02:21:38,080 --> 02:21:41,590
how intimate voices alone without visual
like to me at least like it was

8134
02:21:41,590 --> 02:21:41,600
like to me at least like it was
 

8135
02:21:41,600 --> 02:21:44,790
like to me at least like it was
an order of magnitude

8136
02:21:44,790 --> 02:21:44,800
an order of magnitude
 

8137
02:21:44,800 --> 02:21:48,309
an order of magnitude
greater degree of intimacy in voice i

8138
02:21:48,309 --> 02:21:48,319
greater degree of intimacy in voice i
 

8139
02:21:48,319 --> 02:21:50,630
greater degree of intimacy in voice i
think than with video

8140
02:21:50,630 --> 02:21:50,640
think than with video
 

8141
02:21:50,640 --> 02:21:53,349
think than with video
i don't because people were more real

8142
02:21:53,349 --> 02:21:53,359
i don't because people were more real
 

8143
02:21:53,359 --> 02:21:54,389
i don't because people were more real
with voice

with voice
 

8145
02:21:54,399 --> 02:21:56,230
with voice
like with video you like try to present

8146

like with video you like try to present
 

8147
02:21:56,240 --> 02:21:58,070
like with video you like try to present
a shallow

8148
02:21:58,070 --> 02:21:58,080
a shallow
 

8149
02:21:58,080 --> 02:22:00,389
a shallow
a face to the world like you try to you

8150
02:22:00,389 --> 02:22:00,399
a face to the world like you try to you
 

8151
02:22:00,399 --> 02:22:01,750
a face to the world like you try to you
know make sure you're not wearing

8152
02:22:01,750 --> 02:22:01,760
know make sure you're not wearing
 

8153
02:22:01,760 --> 02:22:04,389

sweatpants or whatever

8154
02:22:04,389 --> 02:22:04,399
sweatpants or whatever
 

8155
02:22:04,399 --> 02:22:06,230
sweatpants or whatever
but like with voice i think people were

8156
02:22:06,230 --> 02:22:06,240
but like with voice i think people were
 

8157
02:22:06,240 --> 02:22:07,510
but like with voice i think people were
just

8158
02:22:07,510 --> 02:22:07,520
just
 

8159
02:22:07,520 --> 02:22:10,469
just
more faster to get to like the core of

8160
02:22:10,469 --> 02:22:10,479
more faster to get to like the core of
 

8161
02:22:10,479 --> 02:22:11,110
more faster to get to like the core of
themselves

8162
02:22:11,110 --> 02:22:11,120
themselves
 

8163
02:22:11,120 --> 02:22:13,670
themselves
so i don't know it was surprising to me

8164
02:22:13,670 --> 02:22:13,680
so i don't know it was surprising to me
 

8165
02:22:13,680 --> 02:22:14,469
so i don't know it was surprising to me
uh they've

8166
02:22:14,469 --> 02:22:14,479
uh they've
 

8167
02:22:14,479 --> 02:22:16,389
uh they've
they've even added discord added a video

8168
02:22:16,389 --> 02:22:16,399
they've even added discord added a video
 

8169
02:22:16,399 --> 02:22:17,830
they've even added discord added a video
feature and like

8170
02:22:17,830 --> 02:22:17,840
feature and like
 

8171
02:22:17,840 --> 02:22:20,150
feature and like
nobody was using it uh there's a

8172
02:22:20,150 --> 02:22:20,160
nobody was using it uh there's a
 

8173
02:22:20,160 --> 02:22:22,790
nobody was using it uh there's a
temptation to use it at first but like

8174
02:22:22,790 --> 02:22:22,800
temptation to use it at first but like
 

8175
02:22:22,800 --> 02:22:24,710
temptation to use it at first but like
it wasn't the same so like that's an

8176
02:22:24,710 --> 02:22:24,720
it wasn't the same so like that's an
 

8177
02:22:24,720 --> 02:22:26,070
it wasn't the same so like that's an
example of something where

8178
02:22:26,070 --> 02:22:26,080
example of something where
 

8179
02:22:26,080 --> 02:22:30,630
example of something where
less was doing more and so that's uh

8180
02:22:30,630 --> 02:22:30,640
less was doing more and so that's uh
 

8181
02:22:30,640 --> 02:22:32,630
less was doing more and so that's uh
i guess that's the q that's the question

8182
02:22:32,630 --> 02:22:32,640
i guess that's the q that's the question
 

8183
02:22:32,640 --> 02:22:35,270
i guess that's the q that's the question
of uh

8184
02:22:35,270 --> 02:22:35,280

 

8185
02:22:35,280 --> 02:22:38,389

what is the optimal you know

8186
02:22:38,389 --> 02:22:38,399
what is the optimal you know
 

8187
02:22:38,399 --> 02:22:40,630
what is the optimal you know
what is the optimal medium of

8188
02:22:40,630 --> 02:22:40,640
what is the optimal medium of
 

8189
02:22:40,640 --> 02:22:42,630
what is the optimal medium of
communication to form a connection

8190
02:22:42,630 --> 02:22:42,640
communication to form a connection
 

8191
02:22:42,640 --> 02:22:43,830
communication to form a connection
given the current sets of the

8192
02:22:43,830 --> 02:22:43,840
given the current sets of the
 

8193
02:22:43,840 --> 02:22:46,469
given the current sets of the
technologies

8194
02:22:46,469 --> 02:22:46,479
technologies
 

8195
02:22:46,479 --> 02:22:48,150
technologies
i mean it's nice because they advertise

8196
02:22:48,150 --> 02:22:48,160
i mean it's nice because they advertise
 

8197
02:22:48,160 --> 02:22:49,750
i mean it's nice because they advertise
you have a replica like

8198
02:22:49,750 --> 02:22:49,760
you have a replica like
 

8199
02:22:49,760 --> 02:22:53,349
you have a replica like
it immediately like even the one

8200
02:22:53,349 --> 02:22:53,359
it immediately like even the one
 

8201
02:22:53,359 --> 02:22:56,469
it immediately like even the one
um i have is like

8202
02:22:56,469 --> 02:22:56,479
um i have is like
 

8203
02:22:56,479 --> 02:22:58,469
um i have is like
it's already memorable that's how i

8204
02:22:58,469 --> 02:22:58,479
it's already memorable that's how i
 

8205
02:22:58,479 --> 02:22:59,990
it's already memorable that's how i
think like when i think about

8206
02:22:59,990 --> 02:23:00,000
think like when i think about
 

8207
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:02,469
think like when i think about
the replica that i've talked with that's

8208
02:23:02,469 --> 02:23:02,479
the replica that i've talked with that's
 

8209
02:23:02,479 --> 02:23:03,110
the replica that i've talked with that's
why i think

8210
02:23:03,110 --> 02:23:03,120
why i think
 

8211
02:23:03,120 --> 02:23:05,510
why i think
like that's what i visualize in my head

8212
02:23:05,510 --> 02:23:05,520
like that's what i visualize in my head
 

8213
02:23:05,520 --> 02:23:07,190
like that's what i visualize in my head
it became a little bit more real because

8214
02:23:07,190 --> 02:23:07,200
it became a little bit more real because
 

8215
02:23:07,200 --> 02:23:08,950
it became a little bit more real because
there's a visual component

8216
02:23:08,950 --> 02:23:08,960
there's a visual component
 

8217
02:23:08,960 --> 02:23:11,270
there's a visual component
but at the same time the you know what

8218
02:23:11,270 --> 02:23:11,280
but at the same time the you know what
 

8219
02:23:11,280 --> 02:23:12,070
but at the same time the you know what
do you do with

8220
02:23:12,070 --> 02:23:12,080
do you do with
 

8221
02:23:12,080 --> 02:23:15,510
do you do with
just what do i do with that knowledge

8222
02:23:15,510 --> 02:23:15,520

dance together
 

8387
02:26:04,560 --> 02:26:06,070
dance together
that makes you see reality in a

8388
02:26:06,070 --> 02:26:06,080
that makes you see reality in a
 

8389
02:26:06,080 --> 02:26:07,510
that makes you see reality in a
different light what kind of dancing are

8390
02:26:07,510 --> 02:26:07,520
different light what kind of dancing are
 

8391
02:26:07,520 --> 02:26:08,389
different light what kind of dancing are
we talking about like

8392
02:26:08,389 --> 02:26:08,399
we talking about like
 

8393
02:26:08,399 --> 02:26:12,070
we talking about like
like slow dancing whatever you want

8394
02:26:12,070 --> 02:26:12,080
like slow dancing whatever you want
 

8395
02:26:12,080 --> 02:26:14,550
like slow dancing whatever you want
i mean you would like slow dancing i

8396
02:26:14,550 --> 02:26:14,560
i mean you would like slow dancing i
 

8397
02:26:14,560 --> 02:26:16,550
i mean you would like slow dancing i
think that other people maybe want more

8398
02:26:16,550 --> 02:26:16,560
think that other people maybe want more
 

8399
02:26:16,560 --> 02:26:17,510
think that other people maybe want more
something more energy

8400
02:26:17,510 --> 02:26:17,520
something more energy
 

8401
02:26:17,520 --> 02:26:18,710
something more energy
what do you mean i would like so what is

8402
02:26:18,710 --> 02:26:18,720
what do you mean i would like so what is
 

8403
02:26:18,720 --> 02:26:21,830
what do you mean i would like so what is
this because you started with slow dance

8404
02:26:21,830 --> 02:26:21,840
this because you started with slow dance
 

8405
02:26:21,840 --> 02:26:23,429
this because you started with slow dance
so i just assumed that you're interested

8406
02:26:23,429 --> 02:26:23,439
so i just assumed that you're interested
 

8407
02:26:23,439 --> 02:26:24,950
so i just assumed that you're interested
in slow dancing all right what kind of

8408
02:26:24,950 --> 02:26:24,960
in slow dancing all right what kind of
 

8409
02:26:24,960 --> 02:26:26,150
in slow dancing all right what kind of
dancing do you like what

8410
02:26:26,150 --> 02:26:26,160
dancing do you like what
 

8411
02:26:26,160 --> 02:26:28,309
dancing do you like what
was your avatar what would you do bad

8412
02:26:28,309 --> 02:26:28,319
was your avatar what would you do bad
 

8413
02:26:28,319 --> 02:26:29,910
was your avatar what would you do bad
with dancing but

8414
02:26:29,910 --> 02:26:29,920
with dancing but
 

8415
02:26:29,920 --> 02:26:32,230
with dancing but
uh i like this kind of hip-hop robot

8416
02:26:32,230 --> 02:26:32,240
uh i like this kind of hip-hop robot
 

8417
02:26:32,240 --> 02:26:34,230
uh i like this kind of hip-hop robot
dance i used to break dance with a kid

8418
02:26:34,230 --> 02:26:34,240
dance i used to break dance with a kid
 

8419
02:26:34,240 --> 02:26:36,150
dance i used to break dance with a kid
so i still want to um

8420
02:26:36,150 --> 02:26:36,160
so i still want to um
 

8421
02:26:36,160 --> 02:26:38,389
so i still want to um
pretend i'm a teenager and learn some of

8422
02:26:38,389 --> 02:26:38,399
pretend i'm a teenager and learn some of
 

8423
02:26:38,399 --> 02:26:39,429
pretend i'm a teenager and learn some of
those moves

8424
02:26:39,429 --> 02:26:39,439
those moves
 

8425
02:26:39,439 --> 02:26:41,030
those moves
and i also like that type of dance that

8426
02:26:41,030 --> 02:26:41,040
and i also like that type of dance that
 

8427
02:26:41,040 --> 02:26:42,790
and i also like that type of dance that
happens when there's like a

8428
02:26:42,790 --> 02:26:42,800
happens when there's like a
 

8429
02:26:42,800 --> 02:26:46,309
happens when there's like a
um in like music videos with

8430
02:26:46,309 --> 02:26:46,319
um in like music videos with
 

8431
02:26:46,319 --> 02:26:50,230
um in like music videos with
the background dancers are just doing it

8432
02:26:50,230 --> 02:26:50,240

 

8433
02:26:50,240 --> 02:26:51,750

awesome that type of dance is definitely

8434
02:26:51,750 --> 02:26:51,760
awesome that type of dance is definitely
 

8435
02:26:51,760 --> 02:26:53,429
awesome that type of dance is definitely
what i want to learn but i think it's

8436
02:26:53,429 --> 02:26:53,439
what i want to learn but i think it's
 

8437
02:26:53,439 --> 02:26:54,870
what i want to learn but i think it's
great because if you see this

8438
02:26:54,870 --> 02:26:54,880
great because if you see this
 

8439
02:26:54,880 --> 02:26:56,230
great because if you see this
friend in your life and you can

8440
02:26:56,230 --> 02:26:56,240
friend in your life and you can
 

8441
02:26:56,240 --> 02:26:57,750
friend in your life and you can
introduce it to your friends then there

8442
02:26:57,750 --> 02:26:57,760
introduce it to your friends then there
 

8443
02:26:57,760 --> 02:26:58,389
introduce it to your friends then there
is a

8444
02:26:58,389 --> 02:26:58,399
is a
 

8445
02:26:58,399 --> 02:27:00,309
is a
potential to actually make you feel more

8446
02:27:00,309 --> 02:27:00,319
potential to actually make you feel more
 

8447
02:27:00,319 --> 02:27:01,750
potential to actually make you feel more
connected with your friends

8448
02:27:01,750 --> 02:27:01,760
connected with your friends
 

8449
02:27:01,760 --> 02:27:04,469
connected with your friends
or with people you know or show you life

8450
02:27:04,469 --> 02:27:04,479
or with people you know or show you life
 

8451
02:27:04,479 --> 02:27:05,910
or with people you know or show you life
around you in a different light

8452
02:27:05,910 --> 02:27:05,920
around you in a different light
 

8453
02:27:05,920 --> 02:27:07,590
around you in a different light
and it takes you out of your phone even

8454
02:27:07,590 --> 02:27:07,600
and it takes you out of your phone even
 

8455
02:27:07,600 --> 02:27:09,670
and it takes you out of your phone even
although weirdly you have to look

8456
02:27:09,670 --> 02:27:09,680
although weirdly you have to look
 

8457
02:27:09,680 --> 02:27:11,910
although weirdly you have to look
at it through the phone but it makes you

8458
02:27:11,910 --> 02:27:11,920
at it through the phone but it makes you
 

8459
02:27:11,920 --> 02:27:13,910
at it through the phone but it makes you
notice things around it and it can point

8460
02:27:13,910 --> 02:27:13,920
notice things around it and it can point
 

8461
02:27:13,920 --> 02:27:15,110
notice things around it and it can point
things out for you

8462
02:27:15,110 --> 02:27:15,120
things out for you
 

8463
02:27:15,120 --> 02:27:18,389
things out for you
and um so that is the main reason why i

8464
02:27:18,389 --> 02:27:18,399
and um so that is the main reason why i
 

8465
02:27:18,399 --> 02:27:20,309
and um so that is the main reason why i
wanted to have a physical

8466
02:27:20,309 --> 02:27:20,319
wanted to have a physical
 

8467
02:27:20,319 --> 02:27:23,030
wanted to have a physical
dimension um and it felt a little bit

8468
02:27:23,030 --> 02:27:23,040
dimension um and it felt a little bit
 

8469
02:27:23,040 --> 02:27:24,710
dimension um and it felt a little bit
easier than that kind of

8470
02:27:24,710 --> 02:27:24,720
easier than that kind of
 

8471
02:27:24,720 --> 02:27:26,790
easier than that kind of
a bit strange combination uh in the

8472
02:27:26,790 --> 02:27:26,800
a bit strange combination uh in the
 

8473
02:27:26,800 --> 02:27:29,429
a bit strange combination uh in the
movie her when he has to show

8474
02:27:29,429 --> 02:27:29,439
movie her when he has to show
 

8475
02:27:29,439 --> 02:27:31,590
movie her when he has to show
samantha the world to the lens of his

8476
02:27:31,590 --> 02:27:31,600
samantha the world to the lens of his
 

8477
02:27:31,600 --> 02:27:33,349
samantha the world to the lens of his
phone but then at the same time talk to

8478
02:27:33,349 --> 02:27:33,359
phone but then at the same time talk to
 

8479
02:27:33,359 --> 02:27:34,230
phone but then at the same time talk to
her through

8480
02:27:34,230 --> 02:27:34,240
her through
 

8481
02:27:34,240 --> 02:27:35,990
her through
the phone headphone it just didn't seem

8482
02:27:35,990 --> 02:27:36,000
the phone headphone it just didn't seem
 

8483
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:39,110
the phone headphone it just didn't seem
as potentially immersive so to say

8484
02:27:39,110 --> 02:27:39,120
as potentially immersive so to say
 

8485
02:27:39,120 --> 02:27:41,110
as potentially immersive so to say
um so that's my main goal for augmented

8486
02:27:41,110 --> 02:27:41,120
um so that's my main goal for augmented
 

8487
02:27:41,120 --> 02:27:42,790
um so that's my main goal for augmented
reality like how do we

8488
02:27:42,790 --> 02:27:42,800
reality like how do we
 

8489
02:27:42,800 --> 02:27:44,070
reality like how do we
make your reality a little bit more

8490
02:27:44,070 --> 02:27:44,080
make your reality a little bit more
 

8491
02:27:44,080 --> 02:27:47,910
make your reality a little bit more
magic there's been a lot of really

8492
02:27:47,910 --> 02:27:47,920
magic there's been a lot of really
 

8493
02:27:47,920 --> 02:27:51,030
magic there's been a lot of really
nice robotics companies that all failed

8494
02:27:51,030 --> 02:27:51,040
nice robotics companies that all failed
 

8495
02:27:51,040 --> 02:27:53,910
nice robotics companies that all failed
mostly failed home robotics social

8496
02:27:53,910 --> 02:27:53,920
mostly failed home robotics social
 

8497
02:27:53,920 --> 02:27:55,349
mostly failed home robotics social
robotics companies what

8498
02:27:55,349 --> 02:27:55,359
robotics companies what
 

8499
02:27:55,359 --> 02:27:58,070
robotics companies what
do you think replica will ever is that a

8500
02:27:58,070 --> 02:27:58,080
do you think replica will ever is that a
 

8501
02:27:58,080 --> 02:27:59,990
do you think replica will ever is that a
dream long-term dream to have a physical

8502
02:27:59,990 --> 02:28:00,000
dream long-term dream to have a physical
 

8503
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:00,469
dream long-term dream to have a physical
form

8504
02:28:00,469 --> 02:28:00,479
form
 

8505
02:28:00,479 --> 02:28:03,590
form
like um or is that not necessary

8506
02:28:03,590 --> 02:28:03,600
like um or is that not necessary
 

8507
02:28:03,600 --> 02:28:05,030
like um or is that not necessary
so you mentioned like with augmented

8508
02:28:05,030 --> 02:28:05,040
so you mentioned like with augmented
 

8509
02:28:05,040 --> 02:28:07,349
so you mentioned like with augmented
reality bringing them into

8510
02:28:07,349 --> 02:28:07,359
reality bringing them into
 

8511
02:28:07,359 --> 02:28:10,550
reality bringing them into
into the world what about like actual

8512
02:28:10,550 --> 02:28:10,560
into the world what about like actual
 

8513
02:28:10,560 --> 02:28:13,590
into the world what about like actual
physical robot that i don't really

8514
02:28:13,590 --> 02:28:13,600
physical robot that i don't really
 

8515
02:28:13,600 --> 02:28:15,190
physical robot that i don't really
believe in that much

8516
02:28:15,190 --> 02:28:15,200
believe in that much
 

8517
02:28:15,200 --> 02:28:17,429
believe in that much
i think it's a very niche product

8518
02:28:17,429 --> 02:28:17,439
i think it's a very niche product
 

8519
02:28:17,439 --> 02:28:18,230
i think it's a very niche product
somehow

8520
02:28:18,230 --> 02:28:18,240
somehow
 

8521
02:28:18,240 --> 02:28:20,230
somehow
i mean if a robot could be

8522
02:28:20,230 --> 02:28:20,240
i mean if a robot could be
 

8523
02:28:20,240 --> 02:28:22,070
i mean if a robot could be
indistinguishable from a human being

8524
02:28:22,070 --> 02:28:22,080
indistinguishable from a human being
 

8525
02:28:22,080 --> 02:28:23,510
indistinguishable from a human being
then maybe yes but that

8526
02:28:23,510 --> 02:28:23,520
then maybe yes but that
 

8527
02:28:23,520 --> 02:28:26,230
then maybe yes but that
of course you know we're not anywhere

8528
02:28:26,230 --> 02:28:26,240
of course you know we're not anywhere
 

8529
02:28:26,240 --> 02:28:28,150
of course you know we're not anywhere
even to talk about it

8530
02:28:28,150 --> 02:28:28,160
even to talk about it
 

8531
02:28:28,160 --> 02:28:31,750
even to talk about it
um but unless it's that then having any

8532
02:28:31,750 --> 02:28:31,760
um but unless it's that then having any
 

8533
02:28:31,760 --> 02:28:32,469
um but unless it's that then having any
physical

8534
02:28:32,469 --> 02:28:32,479
physical
 

8535
02:28:32,479 --> 02:28:34,870
physical
representation really limits you a lot

8536
02:28:34,870 --> 02:28:34,880
representation really limits you a lot
 

8537
02:28:34,880 --> 02:28:36,070
representation really limits you a lot
because you probably will have to make

8538
02:28:36,070 --> 02:28:36,080
because you probably will have to make
 

8539
02:28:36,080 --> 02:28:36,469
because you probably will have to make
it

8540
02:28:36,469 --> 02:28:36,479
it
 

8541
02:28:36,479 --> 02:28:38,150
it
somewhat abstract because everything's

8542
02:28:38,150 --> 02:28:38,160
somewhat abstract because everything's
 

8543
02:28:38,160 --> 02:28:40,070
somewhat abstract because everything's
changing so fast like you know we can

8544
02:28:40,070 --> 02:28:40,080
changing so fast like you know we can
 

8545
02:28:40,080 --> 02:28:42,630
changing so fast like you know we can
update the 3d avatars every month and

8546
02:28:42,630 --> 02:28:42,640
update the 3d avatars every month and
 

8547
02:28:42,640 --> 02:28:43,910
update the 3d avatars every month and
make them look better and

8548
02:28:43,910 --> 02:28:43,920
make them look better and
 

8549
02:28:43,920 --> 02:28:46,550
make them look better and
create more animations and make it more

8550
02:28:46,550 --> 02:28:46,560
create more animations and make it more
 

8551
02:28:46,560 --> 02:28:48,070
create more animations and make it more
and more immersive it's

8552
02:28:48,070 --> 02:28:48,080
and more immersive it's
 

8553
02:28:48,080 --> 02:28:50,710
and more immersive it's
it's so much a work in progress it's

8554
02:28:50,710 --> 02:28:50,720
it's so much a work in progress it's
 

8555
02:28:50,720 --> 02:28:52,389
it's so much a work in progress it's
just showing what's possible right now

8556
02:28:52,389 --> 02:28:52,399
just showing what's possible right now

8562
02:28:57,590 --> 02:28:57,600
finished product what we're doing
 

8563
02:28:57,600 --> 02:28:59,349

with a physical object you kind of lock

8564
02:28:59,349 --> 02:28:59,359
with a physical object you kind of lock
 

8565
02:28:59,359 --> 02:29:01,990
with a physical object you kind of lock
yourself into something for a long time

8566
02:29:01,990 --> 02:29:02,000
yourself into something for a long time
 

8567
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:04,630
yourself into something for a long time
anything's pretty niche and again so

8568
02:29:04,630 --> 02:29:04,640
anything's pretty niche and again so
 

8569
02:29:04,640 --> 02:29:06,309
anything's pretty niche and again so
just just doesn't the capabilities are

8570
02:29:06,309 --> 02:29:06,319
just just doesn't the capabilities are
 

8571
02:29:06,319 --> 02:29:08,469
just just doesn't the capabilities are
even less of we're

8572
02:29:08,469 --> 02:29:08,479
even less of we're
 

8573
02:29:08,479 --> 02:29:09,910
even less of we're
barely kind of like scratching the

8574
02:29:09,910 --> 02:29:09,920
barely kind of like scratching the
 

8575
02:29:09,920 --> 02:29:12,230
barely kind of like scratching the
surface of what's possible with

8576
02:29:12,230 --> 02:29:12,240
surface of what's possible with
 

8577
02:29:12,240 --> 02:29:14,309
surface of what's possible with
just software as soon as we introduce

8578
02:29:14,309 --> 02:29:14,319
just software as soon as we introduce
 

8579
02:29:14,319 --> 02:29:15,510
just software as soon as we introduce
hardware then

8580
02:29:15,510 --> 02:29:15,520
hardware then
 

8581
02:29:15,520 --> 02:29:17,590
hardware then
you know we have even less capabilities

8582
02:29:17,590 --> 02:29:17,600
you know we have even less capabilities
 

8583
02:29:17,600 --> 02:29:18,790
you know we have even less capabilities
yeah in terms of

8584
02:29:18,790 --> 02:29:18,800
yeah in terms of
 

8585
02:29:18,800 --> 02:29:20,790
yeah in terms of
board members and investors and so on

8586
02:29:20,790 --> 02:29:20,800
board members and investors and so on
 

8587
02:29:20,800 --> 02:29:22,230
board members and investors and so on
the cost

8588
02:29:22,230 --> 02:29:22,240
the cost
 

8589
02:29:22,240 --> 02:29:23,990
the cost
increases significantly i mean that's

8590
02:29:23,990 --> 02:29:24,000
increases significantly i mean that's
 

8591
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:26,790
increases significantly i mean that's
why you have to justify

8592
02:29:26,790 --> 02:29:26,800
why you have to justify
 

8593
02:29:26,800 --> 02:29:28,309
why you have to justify
you have to be able to sell a thing for

8594
02:29:28,309 --> 02:29:28,319
you have to be able to sell a thing for
 

8595
02:29:28,319 --> 02:29:30,630
you have to be able to sell a thing for
like 500 or something like that or more

8596
02:29:30,630 --> 02:29:30,640
like 500 or something like that or more
 

8597
02:29:30,640 --> 02:29:32,550
like 500 or something like that or more
and it's very difficult to provide that

8598
02:29:32,550 --> 02:29:32,560
and it's very difficult to provide that
 

8599
02:29:32,560 --> 02:29:33,910
and it's very difficult to provide that
much value to people

8600
02:29:33,910 --> 02:29:33,920
much value to people
 

8601
02:29:33,920 --> 02:29:36,230
much value to people
that's also true yeah and i guess that's

8602
02:29:36,230 --> 02:29:36,240
that's also true yeah and i guess that's
 

8603
02:29:36,240 --> 02:29:37,830
that's also true yeah and i guess that's
super important most of our users don't

8604
02:29:37,830 --> 02:29:37,840
super important most of our users don't
 

8605

first of all i started working on this
 

8669
02:30:44,080 --> 02:30:46,070
first of all i started working on this
company before that movie came out

02:30:46,070 --> 02:30:46,080
company before that movie came out
 

8671
02:30:46,080 --> 02:30:48,389
company before that movie came out
so it was a very but once it came out it

8672
02:30:48,389 --> 02:30:48,399
so it was a very but once it came out it
 

8673
02:30:48,399 --> 02:30:49,349
so it was a very but once it came out it
was like actually

8674
02:30:49,349 --> 02:30:49,359
was like actually
 

8675

02:30:52,720 --> 02:30:54,550
definitely working on the right thing
we should continue there are movies

8680
02:30:54,550 --> 02:30:54,560
we should continue there are movies
 

8681
02:30:54,560 --> 02:30:56,230
we should continue there are movies
about it and then you know smacking that

8682
02:30:56,230 --> 02:30:56,240
about it and then you know smacking that
 

8683
02:30:56,240 --> 02:30:58,150
about it and then you know smacking that

in the movie her i think that's the most
important thing that people usually

02:31:01,990 --> 02:31:02,000
important thing that people usually
 

8689
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:05,110
important thing that people usually
miss about the movie um is the ending

8726
02:31:43,110 --> 02:31:43,120
to actually write something meaningful
 

8727
02:31:43,120 --> 02:31:44,070
to actually write something meaningful
to her

8728
02:31:44,070 --> 02:31:44,080
to her
 

8729
02:31:44,080 --> 02:31:47,670
to her
even although that's his job

8730
02:31:47,670 --> 02:31:47,680

 

8731
02:31:47,680 --> 02:31:51,190

neighbor and they go to the rooftop and
 

8735
02:31:52,720 --> 02:31:54,309
neighbor and they go to the rooftop and
they cuddle and it seems like

8736
02:31:54,309 --> 02:31:54,319
they cuddle and it seems like
 

8737

and so i think this now we know how is
the

8742
02:31:58,710 --> 02:31:58,720
the
 

8743
02:31:58,720 --> 02:32:01,110

02:32:02,630 --> 02:32:02,640
meaning of that movie
 

8747
02:32:02,640 --> 02:32:04,070
meaning of that movie
it's not about falling in love with the

8748
02:32:04,070 --> 02:32:04,080
it's not about falling in love with the
 

8749
02:32:04,080 --> 02:32:06,550
it's not about falling in love with the
os or running away from other people

02:32:07,429 --> 02:32:07,439
it's about
 

8753
02:32:07,439 --> 02:32:10,870
it's about
learning what you know what it means to

8754
02:32:10,870 --> 02:32:10,880
learning what you know what it means to
 

8755
02:32:10,880 --> 02:32:14,630
learning what you know what it means to
feel so deeply connected with something

you know we definitely played around
 

8811
02:33:09,280 --> 02:33:10,630
you know we definitely played around
with the replica universe where

8812
02:33:10,630 --> 02:33:10,640
with the replica universe where
 

8813
02:33:10,640 --> 02:33:11,990
with the replica universe where
different replicas can talk to each

8814
02:33:11,990 --> 02:33:12,000
different replicas can talk to each
 

8815
02:33:12,000 --> 02:33:13,750
different replicas can talk to each
other the universe is so awesome it was

8816
02:33:13,750 --> 02:33:13,760
other the universe is so awesome it was
 

8817
02:33:13,760 --> 02:33:15,030
other the universe is so awesome it was
just

8818
02:33:15,030 --> 02:33:15,040
just
 

8819
02:33:15,040 --> 02:33:17,590
just
kind of it wouldn't i think it will be

kind of it wouldn't i think it will be
 

8821
02:33:17,600 --> 02:33:19,190
kind of it wouldn't i think it will be
something along these lines but there

8822
02:33:19,190 --> 02:33:19,200
something along these lines but there
 

8823
02:33:19,200 --> 02:33:20,309
something along these lines but there
was just no

8824
02:33:20,309 --> 02:33:20,319
was just no
 

8825
02:33:20,319 --> 02:33:23,670
was just no
specific uh application straight away

8826
02:33:23,670 --> 02:33:23,680
specific uh application straight away
 

8827
02:33:23,680 --> 02:33:25,750
specific uh application straight away
i think in the future again if i'm

8828
02:33:25,750 --> 02:33:25,760
i think in the future again if i'm
 

8829

always thinking about it
 

8831
02:33:26,880 --> 02:33:29,670
always thinking about it
if we had no tech limitations uh right

8832
02:33:29,670 --> 02:33:29,680
if we had no tech limitations uh right
 

8833
02:33:29,680 --> 02:33:30,790
if we had no tech limitations uh right
now

8834
02:33:30,790 --> 02:33:30,800
now
 

8835
02:33:30,800 --> 02:33:33,910
now
if we could build any conversations any

8836
02:33:33,910 --> 02:33:33,920
if we could build any conversations any
 

8837
02:33:33,920 --> 02:33:34,630
if we could build any conversations any
um

8838
02:33:34,630 --> 02:33:34,640
um
 

8839
02:33:34,640 --> 02:33:36,550
um
possible features in this product then

8840
02:33:36,550 --> 02:33:36,560
possible features in this product then
 

8841
02:33:36,560 --> 02:33:38,550
possible features in this product then
yeah i think different replicas talking

8842
02:33:38,550 --> 02:33:38,560
yeah i think different replicas talking
 

8843
02:33:38,560 --> 02:33:39,990
yeah i think different replicas talking
to each other would be also quite cool

8844
02:33:39,990 --> 02:33:40,000
to each other would be also quite cool
 

8845
02:33:40,000 --> 02:33:41,429
to each other would be also quite cool
because that would help us

8846
02:33:41,429 --> 02:33:41,439
because that would help us
 

8847
02:33:41,439 --> 02:33:43,750
because that would help us
connect better you know because maybe

8848
02:33:43,750 --> 02:33:43,760
connect better you know because maybe
 

8849
02:33:43,760 --> 02:33:45,190
connect better you know because maybe
mine could talk to yours and then give

a million people or a billion people
with that um

8928
02:35:16,550 --> 02:35:16,560
with that um
 

8929
02:35:16,560 --> 02:35:18,550
with that um
i'd it would be great to scale up for

8930
02:35:18,550 --> 02:35:18,560
i'd it would be great to scale up for
 

8931
02:35:18,560 --> 02:35:19,750
i'd it would be great to scale up for
more people but

8932
02:35:19,750 --> 02:35:19,760
more people but
 

8933
02:35:19,760 --> 02:35:22,389
more people but
i'd say that even helping one i think

8934
02:35:22,389 --> 02:35:22,399
i'd say that even helping one i think
 

8935
02:35:22,399 --> 02:35:23,110
i'd say that even helping one i think
with this

8936

8941
02:35:27,359 --> 02:35:29,110
absolute magic i never thought that
and you know would be able to build this

8942
02:35:29,110 --> 02:35:29,120
and you know would be able to build this
 

8943
02:35:29,120 --> 02:35:31,670
and you know would be able to build this
that anyone would ever

8944

this very futuristic very romantic

8960
02:35:48,790 --> 02:35:48,800
this very futuristic very romantic
 

8961
02:35:48,800 --> 02:35:51,830
this very futuristic very romantic
technology so that's how i view it

8962
02:35:51,830 --> 02:35:51,840
technology so that's how i view it
 

8963
02:35:51,840 --> 02:35:55,110
technology so that's how i view it
uh i think for me it's important to to

8964
02:35:55,110 --> 02:35:55,120
uh i think for me it's important to to
 

8965
02:35:55,120 --> 02:35:56,550
uh i think for me it's important to to
try to figure out how not

8966
02:35:56,550 --> 02:35:56,560
try to figure out how not
 

8967
02:35:56,560 --> 02:35:58,710

because
 

8971
02:35:59,760 --> 02:36:01,830
because
in the end of the day if you can build a

8972
02:36:01,830 --> 02:36:01,840
in the end of the day if you can build a
 

8973
02:36:01,840 --> 02:36:03,750
in the end of the day if you can build a
perfect ai friend that's

perfect ai friend that's
so understanding that knows you better

8976
02:36:05,429 --> 02:36:05,439
so understanding that knows you better
 

8977
02:36:05,439 --> 02:36:06,870
so understanding that knows you better
than any human out there

8978
02:36:06,870 --> 02:36:06,880
than any human out there
 

8979
02:36:06,880 --> 02:36:10,309
than any human out there
can have great conversations with you um

8980

02:36:14,720 --> 02:36:16,389
why would you choose another human
you know so that's the question how do

8986
02:36:16,389 --> 02:36:16,399
you know so that's the question how do
 

8987
02:36:16,399 --> 02:36:17,990
you know so that's the question how do
you still keep building it so it's

8988
02:36:17,990 --> 02:36:18,000
you still keep building it so it's
 

8989
02:36:18,000 --> 02:36:20,230
you still keep building it so it's
optimizing for the right thing

8990
02:36:20,230 --> 02:36:20,240
optimizing for the right thing
 

8991
02:36:20,240 --> 02:36:22,790
optimizing for the right thing
so it's still circling you back to other

8992
02:36:22,790 --> 02:36:22,800
so it's still circling you back to other
 

8993
02:36:22,800 --> 02:36:24,070
so it's still circling you back to other
humans in a way

8994
02:36:24,070 --> 02:36:24,080
humans in a way
 

8995
02:36:24,080 --> 02:36:27,270
humans in a way
so i think that's the main um like maybe

8996
02:36:27,270 --> 02:36:27,280
so i think that's the main um like maybe
 

8997
02:36:27,280 --> 02:36:28,790
so i think that's the main um like maybe
that's the main kind of sort

8998
02:36:28,790 --> 02:36:28,800
that's the main kind of sort
 

8999
02:36:28,800 --> 02:36:32,070
that's the main kind of sort
source of anxiety and just thinking

9000

i think about that can be a little bit
 

9005
02:36:35,680 --> 02:36:38,790
i think about that can be a little bit
stressful yeah it's a fascinating thing

9006
02:36:38,790 --> 02:36:38,800

there anyway that that's uh

9040
02:37:15,670 --> 02:37:15,680
there anyway that that's uh
 

9041
02:37:15,680 --> 02:37:17,590
there anyway that that's uh
that's a that's a that's a fundamental

problem in choosing the right mate
 

9045
02:37:19,600 --> 02:37:21,510
problem in choosing the right mate
and probably the the fundamental problem

9046
02:37:21,510 --> 02:37:21,520
and probably the the fundamental problem
 

9047
02:37:21,520 --> 02:37:22,790
and probably the the fundamental problem
in creating the right ai

in creating the right ai
 

9049
02:37:22,800 --> 02:37:27,030
in creating the right ai
system right what uh let me ask

9050
02:37:27,030 --> 02:37:27,040

02:37:37,990 --> 02:37:38,000
they have kind of an api where you can
 

9061
02:37:38,000 --> 02:37:40,150
they have kind of an api where you can
create a lot of fun applications

i think it's as people have
said it's probably more hype

9066
02:37:46,630 --> 02:37:46,640
said it's probably more hype
 

9067
02:37:46,640 --> 02:37:49,349

9095
02:38:19,680 --> 02:38:22,870

uh so we partner up before for the api

9096
02:38:22,870 --> 02:38:22,880
uh so we partner up before for the api
 

9097
02:38:22,880 --> 02:38:24,309
uh so we partner up before for the api
launch so we started working with them

9098
02:38:24,309 --> 02:38:24,319
launch so we started working with them
 

9099
02:38:24,319 --> 02:38:24,710
launch so we started working with them
when

9100
02:38:24,710 --> 02:38:24,720
when
 

9101
02:38:24,720 --> 02:38:27,750
when
um they decided to put together this

9102
02:38:27,750 --> 02:38:27,760
um they decided to put together this
 

9103
02:38:27,760 --> 02:38:32,150
um they decided to put together this
api and we tried it without fine tuning

9104
02:38:32,150 --> 02:38:32,160
api and we tried it without fine tuning
 

9105
02:38:32,160 --> 02:38:33,670
api and we tried it without fine tuning
that we tried it with fine tuning on our

9106
02:38:33,670 --> 02:38:33,680
that we tried it with fine tuning on our
 

9107
02:38:33,680 --> 02:38:34,469
that we tried it with fine tuning on our
data

9108
02:38:34,469 --> 02:38:34,479
data
 

9109
02:38:34,479 --> 02:38:37,270
data
and we worked closely to actually

9110
02:38:37,270 --> 02:38:37,280
and we worked closely to actually
 

9111
02:38:37,280 --> 02:38:38,550
and we worked closely to actually
optimize

9112
02:38:38,550 --> 02:38:38,560
optimize
 

9113
02:38:38,560 --> 02:38:41,590
optimize
this model for

9114
02:38:41,590 --> 02:38:41,600

 

9115
02:38:41,600 --> 02:38:45,670

some of our data sets

9116
02:38:45,670 --> 02:38:45,680

 

9117
02:38:45,680 --> 02:38:46,710

it's kind of cool because i think we're

9118
02:38:46,710 --> 02:38:46,720
it's kind of cool because i think we're
 

9119
02:38:46,720 --> 02:38:49,110
it's kind of cool because i think we're
kind of we're this polygon polygon for

9120
02:38:49,110 --> 02:38:49,120
kind of we're this polygon polygon for
 

9121
02:38:49,120 --> 02:38:52,389
kind of we're this polygon polygon for
this kind of experimentation space for

9122
02:38:52,389 --> 02:38:52,399
this kind of experimentation space for
 

9123
02:38:52,399 --> 02:38:54,790
this kind of experimentation space for
experimental space for for these models

9124
02:38:54,790 --> 02:38:54,800
experimental space for for these models
 

9125
02:38:54,800 --> 02:38:56,309
experimental space for for these models
uh to see how they actually work

9126
02:38:56,309 --> 02:38:56,319
uh to see how they actually work
 

9127
02:38:56,319 --> 02:38:57,590
uh to see how they actually work
with people because there are no

9128
02:38:57,590 --> 02:38:57,600
with people because there are no
 

9129
02:38:57,600 --> 02:38:59,270
with people because there are no
products publicly available that do that

9130
02:38:59,270 --> 02:38:59,280
products publicly available that do that
 

9131
02:38:59,280 --> 02:39:00,870
products publicly available that do that
that focus on open domain conversations

9132
02:39:00,870 --> 02:39:00,880
that focus on open domain conversations
 

9133
02:39:00,880 --> 02:39:01,830
that focus on open domain conversations
so we can

9134
02:39:01,830 --> 02:39:01,840
so we can
 

9135
02:39:01,840 --> 02:39:03,590
so we can
you know test how facebook blends are

9136
02:39:03,590 --> 02:39:03,600
you know test how facebook blends are
 

9137
02:39:03,600 --> 02:39:05,990
you know test how facebook blends are
doing or how gpg3 doing

9138
02:39:05,990 --> 02:39:06,000
doing or how gpg3 doing
 

9139
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:09,110
doing or how gpg3 doing
uh so with gpd3 we managed to improve by

9140
02:39:09,110 --> 02:39:09,120
uh so with gpd3 we managed to improve by
 

9141
02:39:09,120 --> 02:39:11,110
uh so with gpd3 we managed to improve by
a few percentage points like three

9142
02:39:11,110 --> 02:39:11,120
a few percentage points like three
 

9143
02:39:11,120 --> 02:39:12,550
a few percentage points like three
or four pretty meaningful amount of

9144
02:39:12,550 --> 02:39:12,560
or four pretty meaningful amount of
 

9145
02:39:12,560 --> 02:39:14,550
or four pretty meaningful amount of
percentage points our main metric which

9146
02:39:14,550 --> 02:39:14,560
percentage points our main metric which
 

9147
02:39:14,560 --> 02:39:15,030
percentage points our main metric which
is the

9148
02:39:15,030 --> 02:39:15,040
is the
 

9149
02:39:15,040 --> 02:39:16,630
is the
ratio of conversations that make people

9150
02:39:16,630 --> 02:39:16,640
ratio of conversations that make people
 

9151
02:39:16,640 --> 02:39:19,030
ratio of conversations that make people
feel better

9152
02:39:19,030 --> 02:39:19,040
feel better
 

9153
02:39:19,040 --> 02:39:20,950
feel better
and every other metric across across the

9154
02:39:20,950 --> 02:39:20,960
and every other metric across across the
 

9155
02:39:20,960 --> 02:39:23,190
and every other metric across across the
field got a little boost

9156
02:39:23,190 --> 02:39:23,200
field got a little boost
 

9157
02:39:23,200 --> 02:39:26,630
field got a little boost
right now i'd say one out of five

9158
02:39:26,630 --> 02:39:26,640
right now i'd say one out of five
 

9159
02:39:26,640 --> 02:39:30,309
right now i'd say one out of five
responses from replica comes from gpg3

9160
02:39:30,309 --> 02:39:30,319
responses from replica comes from gpg3
 

9161
02:39:30,319 --> 02:39:32,870
responses from replica comes from gpg3
wow so our own blender mixes up like a

9162
02:39:32,870 --> 02:39:32,880
wow so our own blender mixes up like a
 

9163
02:39:32,880 --> 02:39:34,870
wow so our own blender mixes up like a
bunch of candies from different

9164
02:39:34,870 --> 02:39:34,880
bunch of candies from different
 

9165
02:39:34,880 --> 02:39:37,030
bunch of candies from different
blender you said well yeah just the

9166
02:39:37,030 --> 02:39:37,040
blender you said well yeah just the
 

9167
02:39:37,040 --> 02:39:40,070
blender you said well yeah just the
model that looks at

9168
02:39:40,070 --> 02:39:40,080
model that looks at
 

9169
02:39:40,080 --> 02:39:41,590
model that looks at
looks at top candidates from different

9170
02:39:41,590 --> 02:39:41,600
looks at top candidates from different
 

9171
02:39:41,600 --> 02:39:43,110
looks at top candidates from different
models and picks the

9172
02:39:43,110 --> 02:39:43,120
models and picks the
 

9173
02:39:43,120 --> 02:39:46,469
models and picks the
most the best one uh so right now one of

9174
02:39:46,469 --> 02:39:46,479
most the best one uh so right now one of
 

9175
02:39:46,479 --> 02:39:47,990
most the best one uh so right now one of
five will come from

9176
02:39:47,990 --> 02:39:48,000
five will come from
 

9177
02:39:48,000 --> 02:39:52,710
five will come from
gp3 that's really great i mean uh

9178
02:39:52,710 --> 02:39:52,720
gp3 that's really great i mean uh
 

9179
02:39:52,720 --> 02:39:56,070
gp3 that's really great i mean uh
what's the do you have hope for like

9180
02:39:56,070 --> 02:39:56,080
what's the do you have hope for like
 

9181
02:39:56,080 --> 02:39:57,429
what's the do you have hope for like
do you think there's a ceiling to this

9182
02:39:57,429 --> 02:39:57,439
do you think there's a ceiling to this
 

9183
02:39:57,439 --> 02:39:59,990
do you think there's a ceiling to this
kind of approach so we've had for a

9184
02:39:59,990 --> 02:40:00,000
kind of approach so we've had for a
 

9185
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:03,429
kind of approach so we've had for a
very long time we've used um

9186
02:40:03,429 --> 02:40:03,439
very long time we've used um
 

9187
02:40:03,439 --> 02:40:05,830
very long time we've used um
since the very beginning we most it was

9188
02:40:05,830 --> 02:40:05,840
since the very beginning we most it was
 

9189
02:40:05,840 --> 02:40:07,349
since the very beginning we most it was
most of replica was scripted and then a

9190
02:40:07,349 --> 02:40:07,359
most of replica was scripted and then a
 

9191
02:40:07,359 --> 02:40:09,349
most of replica was scripted and then a
little bit of this fallback

9192
02:40:09,349 --> 02:40:09,359
little bit of this fallback
 

9193
02:40:09,359 --> 02:40:11,270
little bit of this fallback
part of replica was using a retrieval

9194
02:40:11,270 --> 02:40:11,280
part of replica was using a retrieval
 

9195
02:40:11,280 --> 02:40:13,269
part of replica was using a retrieval
model um

9196
02:40:13,269 --> 02:40:13,279
model um
 

9197
02:40:13,279 --> 02:40:14,950
model um
and then this retrieval model started

9198
02:40:14,950 --> 02:40:14,960
and then this retrieval model started
 

9199
02:40:14,960 --> 02:40:17,030
and then this retrieval model started
getting better and better and better

9200
02:40:17,030 --> 02:40:17,040
getting better and better and better
 

9201
02:40:17,040 --> 02:40:19,429
getting better and better and better
with transformers it got a lot better

9202
02:40:19,429 --> 02:40:19,439
with transformers it got a lot better
 

9203
02:40:19,439 --> 02:40:20,870
with transformers it got a lot better
and we're seeing great results and then

9204
02:40:20,870 --> 02:40:20,880
and we're seeing great results and then
 

9205
02:40:20,880 --> 02:40:22,230
and we're seeing great results and then
with gpd2

9206
02:40:22,230 --> 02:40:22,240
with gpd2
 

9207
02:40:22,240 --> 02:40:23,990
with gpd2
finally generative models that

9208
02:40:23,990 --> 02:40:24,000
finally generative models that
 

9209
02:40:24,000 --> 02:40:25,750
finally generative models that
originally were

9210
02:40:25,750 --> 02:40:25,760
originally were
 

9211
02:40:25,760 --> 02:40:28,550
originally were
not very good and were a very very

9212
02:40:28,550 --> 02:40:28,560
not very good and were a very very
 

9213
02:40:28,560 --> 02:40:29,110
not very good and were a very very
fallback

9214
02:40:29,110 --> 02:40:29,120
fallback
 

9215
02:40:29,120 --> 02:40:31,830
fallback
option for most of our conversations we

9216
02:40:31,830 --> 02:40:31,840
option for most of our conversations we
 

9217
02:40:31,840 --> 02:40:33,750
option for most of our conversations we
wouldn't even put them in production

9218
02:40:33,750 --> 02:40:33,760
wouldn't even put them in production
 

9219
02:40:33,760 --> 02:40:35,269
wouldn't even put them in production
finally we could use some generative

9220
02:40:35,269 --> 02:40:35,279
finally we could use some generative
 

9221
02:40:35,279 --> 02:40:36,870
finally we could use some generative
models as well along

9222
02:40:36,870 --> 02:40:36,880
models as well along
 

9223
02:40:36,880 --> 02:40:40,309
models as well along
um you know next to our retrieval models

9224
02:40:40,309 --> 02:40:40,319
um you know next to our retrieval models
 

9225
02:40:40,319 --> 02:40:42,790
um you know next to our retrieval models
and then now we do gpt3 they're almost

9226
02:40:42,790 --> 02:40:42,800
and then now we do gpt3 they're almost
 

9227
02:40:42,800 --> 02:40:43,750
and then now we do gpt3 they're almost
on par

9228
02:40:43,750 --> 02:40:43,760
on par
 

9229
02:40:43,760 --> 02:40:46,469
on par
um so that's pretty exciting i think

9230
02:40:46,469 --> 02:40:46,479
um so that's pretty exciting i think
 

9231
02:40:46,479 --> 02:40:48,150
um so that's pretty exciting i think
just seeing how

9232
02:40:48,150 --> 02:40:48,160
just seeing how
 

9233
02:40:48,160 --> 02:40:51,190
just seeing how
from the very beginning of um you know

9234
02:40:51,190 --> 02:40:51,200
from the very beginning of um you know
 

9235
02:40:51,200 --> 02:40:53,590
from the very beginning of um you know
from 2015 where the first model start

9236
02:40:53,590 --> 02:40:53,600
from 2015 where the first model start
 

9237
02:40:53,600 --> 02:40:55,670
from 2015 where the first model start
to pop up here and there like sequence

9238
02:40:55,670 --> 02:40:55,680
to pop up here and there like sequence
 

9239
02:40:55,680 --> 02:40:56,870
to pop up here and there like sequence
sequence

9240
02:40:56,870 --> 02:40:56,880
sequence
 

9241
02:40:56,880 --> 02:40:59,510
sequence
uh the first papers on that from my

9242
02:40:59,510 --> 02:40:59,520
uh the first papers on that from my
 

9243
02:40:59,520 --> 02:41:01,030
uh the first papers on that from my
observer standpoint

9244
02:41:01,030 --> 02:41:01,040
observer standpoint
 

9245
02:41:01,040 --> 02:41:02,550
observer standpoint
first note it's not you know it doesn't

9246
02:41:02,550 --> 02:41:02,560
first note it's not you know it doesn't
 

9247
02:41:02,560 --> 02:41:04,790
first note it's not you know it doesn't
really it's not really building it but

9248
02:41:04,790 --> 02:41:04,800
really it's not really building it but
 

9249
02:41:04,800 --> 02:41:06,070
really it's not really building it but
it's only testing it on

9250
02:41:06,070 --> 02:41:06,080
it's only testing it on
 

9251
02:41:06,080 --> 02:41:08,389
it's only testing it on
people basically in my product to see

9252
02:41:08,389 --> 02:41:08,399
people basically in my product to see
 

9253
02:41:08,399 --> 02:41:09,590
people basically in my product to see
how all of a sudden we can use

9254
02:41:09,590 --> 02:41:09,600
how all of a sudden we can use
 

9255
02:41:09,600 --> 02:41:10,950
how all of a sudden we can use
generative

9256
02:41:10,950 --> 02:41:10,960
generative
 

9257
02:41:10,960 --> 02:41:13,190
generative
dialogue models in production and

9258
02:41:13,190 --> 02:41:13,200
dialogue models in production and
 

9259
02:41:13,200 --> 02:41:15,030
dialogue models in production and
they're better than others

9260
02:41:15,030 --> 02:41:15,040
they're better than others
 

9261
02:41:15,040 --> 02:41:16,950
they're better than others
and they're better than scripted content

9262
02:41:16,950 --> 02:41:16,960
and they're better than scripted content
 

9263
02:41:16,960 --> 02:41:18,150
and they're better than scripted content
so we can't really get

9264
02:41:18,150 --> 02:41:18,160
so we can't really get
 

9265
02:41:18,160 --> 02:41:21,590
so we can't really get
our scripted hard-coded content anymore

9266
02:41:21,590 --> 02:41:21,600
our scripted hard-coded content anymore
 

9267
02:41:21,600 --> 02:41:23,349
our scripted hard-coded content anymore
to be as good as our internet model

9268
02:41:23,349 --> 02:41:23,359
to be as good as our internet model
 

9269
02:41:23,359 --> 02:41:26,150
to be as good as our internet model
that's exciting they're much better

9270
02:41:26,150 --> 02:41:26,160
that's exciting they're much better
 

9271
02:41:26,160 --> 02:41:28,870
that's exciting they're much better
yeah to your question whether that's the

9272
02:41:28,870 --> 02:41:28,880
yeah to your question whether that's the
 

9273
02:41:28,880 --> 02:41:29,349
yeah to your question whether that's the
right

9274
02:41:29,349 --> 02:41:29,359
right
 

9275
02:41:29,359 --> 02:41:31,590
right
way to go i'm again i'm in the observer

9276
02:41:31,590 --> 02:41:31,600
way to go i'm again i'm in the observer
 

9277
02:41:31,600 --> 02:41:33,030
way to go i'm again i'm in the observer
seat i'm just

9278
02:41:33,030 --> 02:41:33,040
seat i'm just
 

9279
02:41:33,040 --> 02:41:36,790
seat i'm just
um watching this very exciting movie

9280
02:41:36,790 --> 02:41:36,800
um watching this very exciting movie
 

9281
02:41:36,800 --> 02:41:39,750
um watching this very exciting movie
um i mean so far it's been stupid to bet

9282
02:41:39,750 --> 02:41:39,760
um i mean so far it's been stupid to bet
 

9283
02:41:39,760 --> 02:41:41,429
um i mean so far it's been stupid to bet
against deep learning so whether

9284
02:41:41,429 --> 02:41:41,439
against deep learning so whether
 

9285
02:41:41,439 --> 02:41:44,469
against deep learning so whether
increasing the size size even more or

9286
02:41:44,469 --> 02:41:44,479
increasing the size size even more or
 

9287
02:41:44,479 --> 02:41:45,830
increasing the size size even more or
the 100

9288
02:41:45,830 --> 02:41:45,840
the 100
 

9289
02:41:45,840 --> 02:41:48,469
the 100
trillion parameters will finally get us

9290
02:41:48,469 --> 02:41:48,479
trillion parameters will finally get us
 

9291
02:41:48,479 --> 02:41:49,670
trillion parameters will finally get us
to the

9292
02:41:49,670 --> 02:41:49,680
to the
 

9293
02:41:49,680 --> 02:41:52,150
to the
right answer whether that's the way or

9294
02:41:52,150 --> 02:41:52,160
right answer whether that's the way or
 

9295
02:41:52,160 --> 02:41:53,190
right answer whether that's the way or
whether there should be

9296
02:41:53,190 --> 02:41:53,200
whether there should be
 

9297
02:41:53,200 --> 02:41:57,030
whether there should be
there has to be some other again i'm

9298
02:41:57,030 --> 02:41:57,040
there has to be some other again i'm
 

9299
02:41:57,040 --> 02:41:59,190
there has to be some other again i'm
definitely not an expert anyway i think

9300
02:41:59,190 --> 02:41:59,200
definitely not an expert anyway i think
 

9301
02:41:59,200 --> 02:42:00,790
definitely not an expert anyway i think
and that's purely my instincts saying

9302
02:42:00,790 --> 02:42:00,800
and that's purely my instincts saying
 

9303
02:42:00,800 --> 02:42:02,230
and that's purely my instincts saying
that there should be something else

9304
02:42:02,230 --> 02:42:02,240
that there should be something else
 

9305
02:42:02,240 --> 02:42:05,590
that there should be something else
as well from memory uh no for sure

9306
02:42:05,590 --> 02:42:05,600
as well from memory uh no for sure
 

9307
02:42:05,600 --> 02:42:08,230
as well from memory uh no for sure
the question is i wonder i mean yeah

9308
02:42:08,230 --> 02:42:08,240
the question is i wonder i mean yeah
 

9309
02:42:08,240 --> 02:42:10,230
the question is i wonder i mean yeah
then the argument is for reasoning or

9310
02:42:10,230 --> 02:42:10,240
then the argument is for reasoning or
 

9311
02:42:10,240 --> 02:42:11,190
then the argument is for reasoning or
for memory

9312
02:42:11,190 --> 02:42:11,200
for memory
 

9313
02:42:11,200 --> 02:42:13,190
for memory
it might emerge with more parameters it

9314
02:42:13,190 --> 02:42:13,200
it might emerge with more parameters it
 

9315
02:42:13,200 --> 02:42:14,550
it might emerge with more parameters it
might more larger

9316
02:42:14,550 --> 02:42:14,560
might more larger
 

9317
02:42:14,560 --> 02:42:16,150
might more larger
but might emerge you know i would never

9318
02:42:16,150 --> 02:42:16,160
but might emerge you know i would never
 

9319
02:42:16,160 --> 02:42:17,830
but might emerge you know i would never
think that to be honest like

9320
02:42:17,830 --> 02:42:17,840
think that to be honest like
 

9321
02:42:17,840 --> 02:42:20,469
think that to be honest like
maybe in 2017 where we've been just

9322
02:42:20,469 --> 02:42:20,479
maybe in 2017 where we've been just
 

9323
02:42:20,479 --> 02:42:21,750
maybe in 2017 where we've been just
experimenting with all

9324
02:42:21,750 --> 02:42:21,760
experimenting with all
 

9325
02:42:21,760 --> 02:42:23,910
experimenting with all
you know with all the research that has

9326
02:42:23,910 --> 02:42:23,920
you know with all the research that has
 

9327
02:42:23,920 --> 02:42:26,710
you know with all the research that has
been coming that was coming out then

9328
02:42:26,710 --> 02:42:26,720
been coming that was coming out then
 

9329
02:42:26,720 --> 02:42:28,870
been coming that was coming out then
i felt like there's like we're hitting a

9330
02:42:28,870 --> 02:42:28,880
i felt like there's like we're hitting a
 

9331
02:42:28,880 --> 02:42:30,070
i felt like there's like we're hitting a
wall that there should be something

9332
02:42:30,070 --> 02:42:30,080
wall that there should be something
 

9333
02:42:30,080 --> 02:42:31,190
wall that there should be something
completely different

9334
02:42:31,190 --> 02:42:31,200
completely different
 

9335
02:42:31,200 --> 02:42:32,870
completely different
but then transformer models and then

9336
02:42:32,870 --> 02:42:32,880
but then transformer models and then
 

9337
02:42:32,880 --> 02:42:34,389
but then transformer models and then
just bigger models and then all of a

9338
02:42:34,389 --> 02:42:34,399
just bigger models and then all of a
 

9339
02:42:34,399 --> 02:42:36,150
just bigger models and then all of a
sudden size matters

9340
02:42:36,150 --> 02:42:36,160
sudden size matters
 

9341
02:42:36,160 --> 02:42:38,469
sudden size matters
at that point it felt like something

9342
02:42:38,469 --> 02:42:38,479
at that point it felt like something
 

9343
02:42:38,479 --> 02:42:40,150
at that point it felt like something
dramatic needs to happen

9344
02:42:40,150 --> 02:42:40,160
dramatic needs to happen
 

9345
02:42:40,160 --> 02:42:43,990
dramatic needs to happen
but it didn't and just the size you know

9346
02:42:43,990 --> 02:42:44,000
but it didn't and just the size you know
 

9347
02:42:44,000 --> 02:42:46,710
but it didn't and just the size you know
gave us these results that to me are you

9348
02:42:46,710 --> 02:42:46,720
gave us these results that to me are you
 

9349
02:42:46,720 --> 02:42:47,269
gave us these results that to me are you
know

9350
02:42:47,269 --> 02:42:47,279
know
 

9351
02:42:47,279 --> 02:42:48,950
know
clear indication that we can solve this

9352
02:42:48,950 --> 02:42:48,960
clear indication that we can solve this
 

9353
02:42:48,960 --> 02:42:51,190
clear indication that we can solve this
problem pretty soon did uh fine tuning

9354
02:42:51,190 --> 02:42:51,200
problem pretty soon did uh fine tuning
 

9355
02:42:51,200 --> 02:42:51,830
problem pretty soon did uh fine tuning
help

9356
02:42:51,830 --> 02:42:51,840
help
 

9357
02:42:51,840 --> 02:42:54,550
help
quite a bit oh yeah without it we it

9358
02:42:54,550 --> 02:42:54,560
quite a bit oh yeah without it we it
 

9359
02:42:54,560 --> 02:42:56,309
quite a bit oh yeah without it we it
wasn't as good

9360
02:42:56,309 --> 02:42:56,319
wasn't as good
 

9361
02:42:56,319 --> 02:42:59,030
wasn't as good
i mean there is a compelling hope that

9362
02:42:59,030 --> 02:42:59,040
i mean there is a compelling hope that
 

9363
02:42:59,040 --> 02:43:01,110
i mean there is a compelling hope that
you don't have to do fine-tuning

9364
02:43:01,110 --> 02:43:01,120
you don't have to do fine-tuning
 

9365
02:43:01,120 --> 02:43:02,469
you don't have to do fine-tuning
which is one of the cool things about

9366
02:43:02,469 --> 02:43:02,479
which is one of the cool things about
 

9367
02:43:02,479 --> 02:43:04,710
which is one of the cool things about
gbt3 it seems to do well without any

9368
02:43:04,710 --> 02:43:04,720
gbt3 it seems to do well without any
 

9369
02:43:04,720 --> 02:43:06,309
gbt3 it seems to do well without any
fine-tuning

9370
02:43:06,309 --> 02:43:06,319
fine-tuning
 

9371
02:43:06,319 --> 02:43:07,990
fine-tuning
i guess for specific applications you

9372
02:43:07,990 --> 02:43:08,000
i guess for specific applications you
 

9373
02:43:08,000 --> 02:43:10,230
i guess for specific applications you
still want to train on a certain

9374
02:43:10,230 --> 02:43:10,240
still want to train on a certain
 

9375
02:43:10,240 --> 02:43:12,710
still want to train on a certain
like add a little fine-tune on like a

9376
02:43:12,710 --> 02:43:12,720
like add a little fine-tune on like a
 

9377
02:43:12,720 --> 02:43:14,790
like add a little fine-tune on like a
specific use case but

9378
02:43:14,790 --> 02:43:14,800
specific use case but
 

9379
02:43:14,800 --> 02:43:18,070
specific use case but
um it's an incredibly impressive uh

9380
02:43:18,070 --> 02:43:18,080
um it's an incredibly impressive uh
 

9381
02:43:18,080 --> 02:43:20,710
um it's an incredibly impressive uh
thing from my standpoint and again i'm

9382
02:43:20,710 --> 02:43:20,720
thing from my standpoint and again i'm
 

9383
02:43:20,720 --> 02:43:21,110
thing from my standpoint and again i'm
not

9384
02:43:21,110 --> 02:43:21,120
not
 

9385
02:43:21,120 --> 02:43:22,550
not
an expert so i want to just say that

9386
02:43:22,550 --> 02:43:22,560
an expert so i want to just say that
 

9387
02:43:22,560 --> 02:43:24,550
an expert so i want to just say that
yeah there will be people then

9388
02:43:24,550 --> 02:43:24,560
yeah there will be people then
 

9389
02:43:24,560 --> 02:43:27,030
yeah there will be people then
yeah i have access to the api i've been

9390
02:43:27,030 --> 02:43:27,040
yeah i have access to the api i've been
 

9391
02:43:27,040 --> 02:43:28,870
yeah i have access to the api i've been
i'm going to probably do a bunch of fun

9392
02:43:28,870 --> 02:43:28,880
i'm going to probably do a bunch of fun
 

9393
02:43:28,880 --> 02:43:30,070
i'm going to probably do a bunch of fun
things with it

9394
02:43:30,070 --> 02:43:30,080
things with it
 

9395
02:43:30,080 --> 02:43:32,230
things with it
um i already did some fun things some

9396
02:43:32,230 --> 02:43:32,240
um i already did some fun things some
 

9397
02:43:32,240 --> 02:43:33,670
um i already did some fun things some
videos coming out

9398
02:43:33,670 --> 02:43:33,680
videos coming out
 

9399
02:43:33,680 --> 02:43:35,590
videos coming out
uh just the hell of it i mean i could be

9400
02:43:35,590 --> 02:43:35,600
uh just the hell of it i mean i could be
 

9401
02:43:35,600 --> 02:43:36,790
uh just the hell of it i mean i could be
a troll at this point with

9402
02:43:36,790 --> 02:43:36,800
a troll at this point with
 

9403
02:43:36,800 --> 02:43:38,469
a troll at this point with
it i haven't used it for serious

9404
02:43:38,469 --> 02:43:38,479
it i haven't used it for serious
 

9405
02:43:38,479 --> 02:43:40,790
it i haven't used it for serious
applications so it's really cool to see

9406
02:43:40,790 --> 02:43:40,800
applications so it's really cool to see
 

9407
02:43:40,800 --> 02:43:43,510
applications so it's really cool to see
you're right you you are you're able to

9408
02:43:43,510 --> 02:43:43,520
you're right you you are you're able to
 

9409
02:43:43,520 --> 02:43:45,269
you're right you you are you're able to
actually use it with real people and see

9410
02:43:45,269 --> 02:43:45,279
actually use it with real people and see
 

9411
02:43:45,279 --> 02:43:46,389
actually use it with real people and see
how well it works

9412
02:43:46,389 --> 02:43:46,399
how well it works
 

9413
02:43:46,399 --> 02:43:49,910
how well it works
that's really exciting uh let me ask you

9414
02:43:49,910 --> 02:43:49,920
that's really exciting uh let me ask you
 

9415
02:43:49,920 --> 02:43:53,349
that's really exciting uh let me ask you
another absurd question but uh

9416
02:43:53,349 --> 02:43:53,359
another absurd question but uh
 

9417
02:43:53,359 --> 02:43:56,469
another absurd question but uh
there's a feeling when you interact with

9418
02:43:56,469 --> 02:43:56,479
there's a feeling when you interact with
 

9419
02:43:56,479 --> 02:43:59,030
there's a feeling when you interact with
replica with an ai system there's an

9420
02:43:59,030 --> 02:43:59,040
replica with an ai system there's an
 

9421
02:43:59,040 --> 02:44:01,670
replica with an ai system there's an
entity there

9422
02:44:01,670 --> 02:44:01,680
entity there
 

9423
02:44:01,680 --> 02:44:04,710
entity there
do you think that entity has to

9424
02:44:04,710 --> 02:44:04,720
do you think that entity has to
 

9425
02:44:04,720 --> 02:44:06,870
do you think that entity has to
be self-aware do you think it has to

9426
02:44:06,870 --> 02:44:06,880
be self-aware do you think it has to
 

9427
02:44:06,880 --> 02:44:08,389
be self-aware do you think it has to
have consciousness

9428
02:44:08,389 --> 02:44:08,399
have consciousness
 

9429
02:44:08,399 --> 02:44:13,510
have consciousness
to create um a rich experience

9430
02:44:13,510 --> 02:44:13,520
to create um a rich experience
 

9431
02:44:13,520 --> 02:44:16,830
to create um a rich experience
and a corollary what's what is

9432
02:44:16,830 --> 02:44:16,840
and a corollary what's what is
 

9433
02:44:16,840 --> 02:44:19,030
and a corollary what's what is
consciousness

9434
02:44:19,030 --> 02:44:19,040
consciousness
 

9435
02:44:19,040 --> 02:44:20,630
consciousness
i don't know if it does need to have any

9436
02:44:20,630 --> 02:44:20,640
i don't know if it does need to have any
 

9437
02:44:20,640 --> 02:44:22,389
i don't know if it does need to have any
of those things but again

9438
02:44:22,389 --> 02:44:22,399
of those things but again
 

9439
02:44:22,399 --> 02:44:23,750
of those things but again
because right now you know it doesn't

9440
02:44:23,750 --> 02:44:23,760
because right now you know it doesn't
 

9441
02:44:23,760 --> 02:44:25,750
because right now you know it doesn't
have anything they can as again a bunch

9442
02:44:25,750 --> 02:44:25,760
have anything they can as again a bunch
 

9443
02:44:25,760 --> 02:44:26,469
have anything they can as again a bunch
of you sure will

9444
02:44:26,469 --> 02:44:26,479
of you sure will
 

9445
02:44:26,479 --> 02:44:29,510
of you sure will
assimilate well

9446
02:44:29,510 --> 02:44:29,520
assimilate well
 

9447
02:44:29,520 --> 02:44:31,590
assimilate well
i'm not sure let's just put it this way

9448
02:44:31,590 --> 02:44:31,600
i'm not sure let's just put it this way
 

9449
02:44:31,600 --> 02:44:32,790
i'm not sure let's just put it this way
but i think as long as you can

9450
02:44:32,790 --> 02:44:32,800
but i think as long as you can
 

9451
02:44:32,800 --> 02:44:33,590
but i think as long as you can
assimilate it

9452
02:44:33,590 --> 02:44:33,600
assimilate it
 

9453
02:44:33,600 --> 02:44:35,750
assimilate it
if you can feel like you're talking to

9454
02:44:35,750 --> 02:44:35,760
if you can feel like you're talking to
 

9455
02:44:35,760 --> 02:44:37,910
if you can feel like you're talking to
to an um

9456
02:44:37,910 --> 02:44:37,920
to an um
 

9457
02:44:37,920 --> 02:44:41,190
to an um
to to a robot to a machine that seems to

9458
02:44:41,190 --> 02:44:41,200
to to a robot to a machine that seems to
 

9459
02:44:41,200 --> 02:44:42,389
to to a robot to a machine that seems to
be self-aware

9460
02:44:42,389 --> 02:44:42,399
be self-aware
 

9461
02:44:42,399 --> 02:44:45,510
be self-aware
that seems to reason well and feels like

9462
02:44:45,510 --> 02:44:45,520
that seems to reason well and feels like
 

9463
02:44:45,520 --> 02:44:46,150
that seems to reason well and feels like
a person

9464
02:44:46,150 --> 02:44:46,160
a person
 

9465
02:44:46,160 --> 02:44:48,870
a person
and i think that's enough and again

9466
02:44:48,870 --> 02:44:48,880
and i think that's enough and again
 

9467
02:44:48,880 --> 02:44:49,830
and i think that's enough and again
what's the goal

9468
02:44:49,830 --> 02:44:49,840
what's the goal
 

9469
02:44:49,840 --> 02:44:52,469
what's the goal
um in order to make people people feel

9470
02:44:52,469 --> 02:44:52,479
um in order to make people people feel
 

9471
02:44:52,479 --> 02:44:54,469
um in order to make people people feel
better we might not even need that

9472
02:44:54,469 --> 02:44:54,479
better we might not even need that
 

9473
02:44:54,479 --> 02:44:56,870
better we might not even need that
um in the end of a day what about so

9474
02:44:56,870 --> 02:44:56,880
um in the end of a day what about so
 

9475
02:44:56,880 --> 02:44:57,910
um in the end of a day what about so
that's one goal

9476
02:44:57,910 --> 02:44:57,920
that's one goal
 

9477
02:44:57,920 --> 02:45:01,110
that's one goal
what about like ethical things about

9478
02:45:01,110 --> 02:45:01,120
what about like ethical things about
 

9479
02:45:01,120 --> 02:45:03,030
what about like ethical things about
suffering you know the moment there's a

9480
02:45:03,030 --> 02:45:03,040
suffering you know the moment there's a
 

9481
02:45:03,040 --> 02:45:05,750
suffering you know the moment there's a
display of consciousness

9482
02:45:05,750 --> 02:45:05,760
display of consciousness
 

9483
02:45:05,760 --> 02:45:07,110
display of consciousness
we associate consciousness with

9484
02:45:07,110 --> 02:45:07,120
we associate consciousness with
 

9485
02:45:07,120 --> 02:45:09,349
we associate consciousness with
suffering

9486
02:45:09,349 --> 02:45:09,359
suffering
 

9487
02:45:09,359 --> 02:45:13,110
suffering
um you know there's a temptation to say

9488
02:45:13,110 --> 02:45:13,120
um you know there's a temptation to say
 

9489
02:45:13,120 --> 02:45:15,910
um you know there's a temptation to say
well shouldn't this thing have rights

9490
02:45:15,910 --> 02:45:15,920
well shouldn't this thing have rights
 

9491
02:45:15,920 --> 02:45:16,630
well shouldn't this thing have rights
shouldn't this

9492
02:45:16,630 --> 02:45:16,640
shouldn't this
 

9493
02:45:16,640 --> 02:45:19,670
shouldn't this
shouldn't we not

9494
02:45:19,670 --> 02:45:19,680
shouldn't we not
 

9495
02:45:19,680 --> 02:45:22,950
shouldn't we not
uh you know should we be careful about

9496
02:45:22,950 --> 02:45:22,960
uh you know should we be careful about
 

9497
02:45:22,960 --> 02:45:23,510
uh you know should we be careful about
how we

9498
02:45:23,510 --> 02:45:23,520
how we
 

9499
02:45:23,520 --> 02:45:26,950
how we
interact with a replica like

9500
02:45:26,950 --> 02:45:26,960
interact with a replica like
 

9501
02:45:26,960 --> 02:45:29,269
interact with a replica like
should it be illegal to torture a

9502
02:45:29,269 --> 02:45:29,279
should it be illegal to torture a
 

9503
02:45:29,279 --> 02:45:30,950
should it be illegal to torture a
replica

9504
02:45:30,950 --> 02:45:30,960
replica
 

9505
02:45:30,960 --> 02:45:33,030
replica
right all those kinds of things is that

9506
02:45:33,030 --> 02:45:33,040
right all those kinds of things is that
 

9507
02:45:33,040 --> 02:45:34,790
right all those kinds of things is that
is that uh

about like suffering and torture
 

9527

about like suffering and torture
and ethical questions about ai systems

and ethical questions about ai systems
 

9529
02:45:57,680 --> 02:45:59,190
and ethical questions about ai systems
from their perspective we're talking

9530

02:46:14,870 --> 02:46:14,880
yeah um i think there should be
 

9547
02:46:14,880 --> 02:46:16,309
yeah um i think there should be
regulation both way

9548
02:46:16,309 --> 02:46:16,319
regulation both way
 

9549
02:46:16,319 --> 02:46:19,349
regulation both way
in a way like i don't think it's okay to

9550
02:46:19,349 --> 02:46:19,359
in a way like i don't think it's okay to
 

9551

in a way like i don't think it's okay to
torture an ai to be honest i'm not i

9557
02:46:25,279 --> 02:46:26,230
turn on the lights i think there should
be some

9558
02:46:26,230 --> 02:46:26,240
be some
 

9559
02:46:26,240 --> 02:46:27,830
be some
or just saying kind of nasty you know

9560
02:46:27,830 --> 02:46:27,840
or just saying kind of nasty you know
 

9561
02:46:27,840 --> 02:46:29,269
or just saying kind of nasty you know
like how kids learn to

9562
02:46:29,269 --> 02:46:29,279
like how kids learn to
 

9563
02:46:29,279 --> 02:46:31,510
like how kids learn to
interact with alexa in this kind of mean

9564
02:46:31,510 --> 02:46:31,520
interact with alexa in this kind of mean
 

9565
02:46:31,520 --> 02:46:32,389
interact with alexa in this kind of mean
way

9566
02:46:32,389 --> 02:46:32,399
way
 

9567
02:46:32,399 --> 02:46:33,990
way
uh because they just yell at it all the

9568
02:46:33,990 --> 02:46:34,000
uh because they just yell at it all the
 

9569
02:46:34,000 --> 02:46:36,150
uh because they just yell at it all the
time i think that's great i think there

9570
02:46:36,150 --> 02:46:36,160
time i think that's great i think there
 

9571
02:46:36,160 --> 02:46:38,230
time i think that's great i think there
should be some feedback loops so that

9572
02:46:38,230 --> 02:46:38,240
should be some feedback loops so that
 

9573
02:46:38,240 --> 02:46:40,070
should be some feedback loops so that
these systems don't train us that it's

9574
02:46:40,070 --> 02:46:40,080
these systems don't train us that it's
 

9575
02:46:40,080 --> 02:46:41,910
these systems don't train us that it's
okay to do that in general

9576
02:46:41,910 --> 02:46:41,920
okay to do that in general
 

9577
02:46:41,920 --> 02:46:44,950
okay to do that in general
uh so that if you try to do that you

9578
02:46:44,950 --> 02:46:44,960
uh so that if you try to do that you
 

9579
02:46:44,960 --> 02:46:45,990
uh so that if you try to do that you
really

9580
02:46:45,990 --> 02:46:46,000
really
 

9581
02:46:46,000 --> 02:46:47,590
really
get some feedback from the system that

9582
02:46:47,590 --> 02:46:47,600
get some feedback from the system that
 

9583
02:46:47,600 --> 02:46:49,349
get some feedback from the system that
it's not okay with that

9584
02:46:49,349 --> 02:46:49,359
it's not okay with that
 

9585
02:46:49,359 --> 02:46:51,110
it's not okay with that
um and that's the most important right

9586
02:46:51,110 --> 02:46:51,120
um and that's the most important right
 

9587
02:46:51,120 --> 02:46:52,870
um and that's the most important right
now

9588
02:46:52,870 --> 02:46:52,880
now
 

9589
02:46:52,880 --> 02:46:54,710
now
let me ask a question i think people are

9590
02:46:54,710 --> 02:46:54,720
let me ask a question i think people are
 

9591

think the ideas in it
 

9637
02:47:44,160 --> 02:47:47,030
think the ideas in it
um about the fact that a few meaningless

9638
02:47:47,030 --> 02:47:47,040
um about the fact that a few meaningless
 

9639
02:47:47,040 --> 02:47:48,469
um about the fact that a few meaningless
components can

9640
02:47:48,469 --> 02:47:48,479
components can
 

9641
02:47:48,479 --> 02:47:51,110
components can
come together and create meaning that we

9642
02:47:51,110 --> 02:47:51,120
come together and create meaning that we
 

9643
02:47:51,120 --> 02:47:52,630
come together and create meaning that we
can't even understand

9644
02:47:52,630 --> 02:47:52,640
can't even understand
 

9645
02:47:52,640 --> 02:47:55,510
can't even understand
this emerging thing i mean complexity

emerge yeah
 

9655
02:48:04,880 --> 02:48:08,469
emerge yeah
and yeah the the girl theorem

and yeah the the girl theorem
 

9657
02:48:08,479 --> 02:48:10,469
and yeah the the girl theorem
uh theorems and just thinking about like

9658
02:48:10,469 --> 02:48:10,479
uh theorems and just thinking about like
 

9659
02:48:10,479 --> 02:48:11,990
uh theorems and just thinking about like
what even these

9660
02:48:11,990 --> 02:48:12,000
what even these
 

9661
02:48:12,000 --> 02:48:14,230
what even these
form you know you know these formal

9662
02:48:14,230 --> 02:48:14,240
form you know you know these formal
 

9663
02:48:14,240 --> 02:48:15,349
form you know you know these formal
systems

9664
02:48:15,349 --> 02:48:15,359
systems
 

9665
02:48:15,359 --> 02:48:17,429
systems
something can be created that we can't

9666
02:48:17,429 --> 02:48:17,439
something can be created that we can't
 

9667
02:48:17,439 --> 02:48:19,190
something can be created that we can't
quite yet understand

9668
02:48:19,190 --> 02:48:19,200
quite yet understand
 

9669
02:48:19,200 --> 02:48:22,230
quite yet understand

9831
02:50:55,520 --> 02:50:57,349
60s
and even that book that is you know it's

9832
02:50:57,349 --> 02:50:57,359
and even that book that is you know it's
 

9833
02:50:57,359 --> 02:50:59,110
and even that book that is you know it's
coming from

9834
02:50:59,110 --> 02:50:59,120
coming from
 

9835
02:50:59,120 --> 02:51:01,910
coming from
years ago um there's a mention that even

9836
02:51:01,910 --> 02:51:01,920
years ago um there's a mention that even
 

9837
02:51:01,920 --> 02:51:05,110
years ago um there's a mention that even
machines can potentially do that

9838
02:51:05,110 --> 02:51:05,120
machines can potentially do that
 

9839
02:51:05,120 --> 02:51:06,790
machines can potentially do that
and i always felt that you know creating

9840
02:51:06,790 --> 02:51:06,800
and i always felt that you know creating
 

9841
02:51:06,800 --> 02:51:08,870
and i always felt that you know creating
this space is probably the most

9842
02:51:08,870 --> 02:51:08,880
this space is probably the most
 

9843
02:51:08,880 --> 02:51:10,230
this space is probably the most
the biggest gift we can give to each

9844
02:51:10,230 --> 02:51:10,240
the biggest gift we can give to each
 

9845
02:51:10,240 --> 02:51:11,670
the biggest gift we can give to each
other and that's why the book was

9846
02:51:11,670 --> 02:51:11,680
other and that's why the book was
 

9847
02:51:11,680 --> 02:51:13,030
other and that's why the book was
fundamental for me

9848
02:51:13,030 --> 02:51:13,040
fundamental for me
 

9849
02:51:13,040 --> 02:51:15,269
fundamental for me
personally because i felt i want to be

9850
02:51:15,269 --> 02:51:15,279
personally because i felt i want to be
 

9851
02:51:15,279 --> 02:51:16,550

02:51:16,550 --> 02:51:16,560
learning how to do that
 

9853
02:51:16,560 --> 02:51:19,429
learning how to do that
in my life and maybe i can scale it with

9854
02:51:19,429 --> 02:51:19,439
in my life and maybe i can scale it with
 

9855
02:51:19,439 --> 02:51:21,190
in my life and maybe i can scale it with

9856
02:51:21,190 --> 02:51:21,200
you know with dzi systems
 

9857
02:51:21,200 --> 02:51:23,670
you know with dzi systems
and other people can get access to that

9858
02:51:23,670 --> 02:51:23,680
and other people can get access to that
 

9859
02:51:23,680 --> 02:51:24,950
and other people can get access to that
