then take over control flow after
 

159
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:07,490
then take over control flow after

code that's actually the the programming
 

163
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,060

design intent so the attack can be a
 

165
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:14,490
design intent so the attack can be a
remote attack so they the attacker for

166
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:14,500
remote attack so they the attacker for
 

167
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,650
remote attack so they the attacker for
example can can send in a malicious

168
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:16,660
example can can send in a malicious
 

169
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:18,570
example can can send in a malicious
input to the program that just causes a

170
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:18,580
input to the program that just causes a
 

171
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:21,420
input to the program that just causes a
program to completely then be

172
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:21,430
program to completely then be
 

173
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:23,460
program to completely then be
compromised and then end up doing

174
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:23,470
compromised and then end up doing
 

175
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:26,550
compromised and then end up doing
something that's under the program and

176
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:26,560
something that's under the program and
 

177
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,640
something that's under the program and
the attackers control and intention but

178
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:29,650
the attackers control and intention but
 

179
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:31,320
the attackers control and intention but
that's just one form of attacks and

180
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:31,330
that's just one form of attacks and
 

181
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:32,900
that's just one form of attacks and
there are other forms of attacks like

182
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:32,910
there are other forms of attacks like
 

183
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:34,920
there are other forms of attacks like
for example there are these side

184
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:34,930
for example there are these side
 

185
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:37,410
for example there are these side
channels where attackers can try to

186
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:37,420
channels where attackers can try to
 

187
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:40,860
channels where attackers can try to
learn from even just observing the

188
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:40,870
learn from even just observing the
 

189
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:43,020
learn from even just observing the
outputs from the behaviors of the

190
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:43,030
outputs from the behaviors of the
 

191
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:45,090
outputs from the behaviors of the
program try to infer certain secrets of

192
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:45,100
program try to infer certain secrets of
 

193
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:48,240
program try to infer certain secrets of
the program so they essentially write

194
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:48,250
the program so they essentially write
 

195
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:51,479
the program so they essentially write
the form of attacks it's very very it's

196
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:51,489
the form of attacks it's very very it's
 

197
00:03:51,489 --> 00:03:54,810
the form of attacks it's very very it's
very broad spectrum and in general from

198
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:54,820
very broad spectrum and in general from
 

199
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:58,070
very broad spectrum and in general from
the security perspective we want to

200
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:58,080
the security perspective we want to
 

201
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,080
the security perspective we want to
essentially provide as much guarantee as

202
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:01,090
essentially provide as much guarantee as
 

203
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:04,440
essentially provide as much guarantee as
possible about the program's security

204
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:04,450
possible about the program's security
 

205
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:06,390
possible about the program's security
properties and so on so for example we

206
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:06,400
properties and so on so for example we
 

207
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,610
properties and so on so for example we
talked about

208
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:07,620
talked about
 

209
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:11,140
talked about
the provable guarantees of the program

210
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:11,150
the provable guarantees of the program
 

211
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:14,140
the provable guarantees of the program
so for example there are ways we can use

212
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:14,150
so for example there are ways we can use
 

213
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:16,909
so for example there are ways we can use
program analysis and form verification

214
00:04:16,909 --> 00:04:16,919
program analysis and form verification
 

215
00:04:16,919 --> 00:04:19,490
program analysis and form verification
techniques to prove that a piece of code

216
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:19,500
techniques to prove that a piece of code
 

217
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:23,860
techniques to prove that a piece of code
has no memory safety vulnerabilities

218
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:23,870
has no memory safety vulnerabilities
 

219
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:25,820
has no memory safety vulnerabilities
what does that look like what does that

220
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:25,830
what does that look like what does that
 

221
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:28,790
what does that look like what does that
proof is that just a dream for that's

222
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:28,800
proof is that just a dream for that's
 

223
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,860
proof is that just a dream for that's
applicable to small case examples is

224
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:30,870
applicable to small case examples is
 

225
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,629
applicable to small case examples is
that possible to do two for real-world

226
00:04:32,629 --> 00:04:32,639
that possible to do two for real-world
 

227
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,659
that possible to do two for real-world
systems so actually I mean today I

228
00:04:35,659 --> 00:04:35,669
systems so actually I mean today I
 

229
00:04:35,669 --> 00:04:37,390
systems so actually I mean today I
actually call it so we are entering the

230
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:37,400
actually call it so we are entering the
 

231
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:41,810
actually call it so we are entering the
area of formally verified systems so in

232
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:41,820
area of formally verified systems so in
 

233
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,779
area of formally verified systems so in
the community we have been working for

234
00:04:44,779 --> 00:04:44,789
the community we have been working for
 

235
00:04:44,789 --> 00:04:47,659
the community we have been working for
the past decades in developing

236
00:04:47,659 --> 00:04:47,669
the past decades in developing
 

237
00:04:47,669 --> 00:04:51,680
the past decades in developing
techniques and tools to do this type of

238
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:51,690
techniques and tools to do this type of
 

239
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:54,860
techniques and tools to do this type of
program verification and and we have

240
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:54,870
program verification and and we have
 

241
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:57,740
program verification and and we have
dedicated teams that have dedicated you

242
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:57,750
dedicated teams that have dedicated you
 

243
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:00,529
dedicated teams that have dedicated you
know they're like years sometimes even

244
00:05:00,529 --> 00:05:00,539
know they're like years sometimes even
 

245
00:05:00,539 --> 00:05:04,310
know they're like years sometimes even
decades of their work in the space so as

246
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:04,320
decades of their work in the space so as
 

247
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,700
decades of their work in the space so as
a result so we actually have a number of

248
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:06,710
a result so we actually have a number of
 

249
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:09,740
a result so we actually have a number of
formally verify systems ranging from

250
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:09,750
formally verify systems ranging from
 

251
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:12,980
formally verify systems ranging from
micro kernels to compilers to file

252
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:12,990
micro kernels to compilers to file
 

253
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:16,159
micro kernels to compilers to file
systems to certain crypto you know

254
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:16,169
systems to certain crypto you know
 

255
00:05:16,169 --> 00:05:19,339
systems to certain crypto you know
libraries and so on and so it's actually

256
00:05:19,339 --> 00:05:19,349
libraries and so on and so it's actually
 

257
00:05:19,349 --> 00:05:21,110
libraries and so on and so it's actually
really wide ranging and it's really

258
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:21,120
really wide ranging and it's really
 

259
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,330
really wide ranging and it's really
exciting to see that people are

260
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:23,340
exciting to see that people are
 

261
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,940
exciting to see that people are
recognizing the importance of having

262
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:25,950
recognizing the importance of having
 

263
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:29,120
recognizing the importance of having
these formally verified systems with

264
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:29,130
these formally verified systems with
 

265
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:32,379
these formally verified systems with
verified security so that's great

266
00:05:32,379 --> 00:05:32,389
verified security so that's great
 

267
00:05:32,389 --> 00:05:34,490
verified security so that's great
advancement that we see but on the other

268
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:34,500
advancement that we see but on the other
 

269
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,589
advancement that we see but on the other
hand I think we do need to take all

270
00:05:36,589 --> 00:05:36,599
hand I think we do need to take all
 

271
00:05:36,599 --> 00:05:39,830
hand I think we do need to take all
these in essentially with with the

272
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:39,840
these in essentially with with the
 

273
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,990
these in essentially with with the
culture as well in the sense that's just

274
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:42,000
culture as well in the sense that's just
 

275
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,890
culture as well in the sense that's just
like I said the the type of

276
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:45,900
like I said the the type of
 

277
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,810
like I said the the type of
vulnerability is very varied so we can

278
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:47,820
vulnerability is very varied so we can
 

279
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:51,140
vulnerability is very varied so we can
form a very fine a software system to

280
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:51,150
form a very fine a software system to
 

281
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:54,140
form a very fine a software system to
have certain set of security properties

282
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:54,150
have certain set of security properties
 

283
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:55,820
have certain set of security properties
but they can still be vulnerable to

284
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:55,830
but they can still be vulnerable to
 

285
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:58,520
but they can still be vulnerable to
other types of attacks and hence it's

286
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:58,530
other types of attacks and hence it's
 

287
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:01,939
other types of attacks and hence it's
that we continue to make progress in the

288
00:06:01,939 --> 00:06:01,949
that we continue to make progress in the
 

289
00:06:01,949 --> 00:06:05,120
that we continue to make progress in the
in the space so just a quick to linger

290
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:05,130
in the space so just a quick to linger
 

291
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:07,850
in the space so just a quick to linger
on the formal verification is that

292
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:07,860
on the formal verification is that
 

293
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:10,969
on the formal verification is that
something you can do by looking at the

294
00:06:10,969 --> 00:06:10,979
something you can do by looking at the
 

295
00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:13,400
something you can do by looking at the
code alone or is it something you have

296
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:13,410
code alone or is it something you have
 

297
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:16,700
code alone or is it something you have
to run the code to to prove something so

298
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:16,710
to run the code to to prove something so
 

299
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,800
to run the code to to prove something so
empirical verification can you look at

300
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:18,810
empirical verification can you look at
 

301
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:20,810
empirical verification can you look at
the code just the code so that's a very

302
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:20,820
the code just the code so that's a very
 

303
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:21,410
the code just the code so that's a very
very

304
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:21,420
very
 

305
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:23,990
very
question so in general for most program

306
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:24,000
question so in general for most program
 

307
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,090
question so in general for most program
verification techniques is essentially

308
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:26,100
verification techniques is essentially
 

309
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,890
verification techniques is essentially
try to verify the properties of the

310
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:27,900
try to verify the properties of the
 

311
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:30,470
try to verify the properties of the
program statically and there are reasons

312
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:30,480
program statically and there are reasons
 

313
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,730
program statically and there are reasons
for that too

314
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:31,740
for that too
 

315
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:34,580
for that too
we can run the code to see for example

316
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:34,590
we can run the code to see for example
 

317
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:38,360
we can run the code to see for example
using like in suffer testing with

318
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:38,370
using like in suffer testing with
 

319
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:40,100
using like in suffer testing with
fasting techniques and also in certain

320
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:40,110
fasting techniques and also in certain
 

321
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:42,200
fasting techniques and also in certain
even model checking techniques you can

322
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:42,210
even model checking techniques you can
 

323
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:46,490
even model checking techniques you can
actually run the code but in general

324
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:46,500
actually run the code but in general
 

325
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:50,420
actually run the code but in general
that only allows you to essentially

326
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:50,430
that only allows you to essentially
 

327
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:52,640
that only allows you to essentially
verify or analyze the behaviors after

328
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:52,650
verify or analyze the behaviors after
 

329
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:55,670
verify or analyze the behaviors after
program in certain and the certain

330
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:55,680
program in certain and the certain
 

331
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,340
program in certain and the certain
situations and so most of the program

332
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:58,350
situations and so most of the program
 

333
00:06:58,350 --> 00:06:59,930
situations and so most of the program
verification techniques actually works

334
00:06:59,930 --> 00:06:59,940
verification techniques actually works
 

335
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:03,920
verification techniques actually works
statically what astatically mean that's

336
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:03,930
statically what astatically mean that's
 

337
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:05,600
statically what astatically mean that's
the running the code without writing the

338
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:05,610
the running the code without writing the
 

339
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:09,350
the running the code without writing the
code yep so what sort of to return this

340
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:09,360
code yep so what sort of to return this
 

341
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,990
code yep so what sort of to return this
is the big question if we can stand that

342
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:12,000
is the big question if we can stand that
 

343
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,120
is the big question if we can stand that
for a little bit longer do you think

344
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:14,130
for a little bit longer do you think
 

345
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:16,670
for a little bit longer do you think
there will always be security

346
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:16,680
there will always be security
 

347
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,680
there will always be security
vulnerabilities you know that's such a

348
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:18,690
vulnerabilities you know that's such a
 

349
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:21,200
vulnerabilities you know that's such a
huge worry for people in the broad cyber

350
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:21,210
huge worry for people in the broad cyber
 

351
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:23,720
huge worry for people in the broad cyber
security threat in the world it seems

352
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:23,730
security threat in the world it seems
 

353
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:27,650
security threat in the world it seems
like the the tension between nations

354
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:27,660
like the the tension between nations
 

355
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:30,590
like the the tension between nations
between groups the the Wars of the

356
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:30,600
between groups the the Wars of the
 

357
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,320
between groups the the Wars of the
future might be fought in cyber security

358
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:32,330
future might be fought in cyber security
 

359
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:35,390
future might be fought in cyber security
security that people worry about and so

360
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:35,400
security that people worry about and so
 

361
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,000
security that people worry about and so
of course the nervousness is is this

362
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,010
of course the nervousness is is this
 

363
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:39,710
of course the nervousness is is this
something that we can get a hold of in

364
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:39,720
something that we can get a hold of in
 

365
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,440
something that we can get a hold of in
the future for our software systems so

366
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:42,450
the future for our software systems so
 

367
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:46,450
the future for our software systems so
there's a very funny quotes seeing

368
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:46,460
there's a very funny quotes seeing
 

369
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:57,890
there's a very funny quotes seeing
security is job security we strive to

370
00:07:57,890 --> 00:07:57,900
security is job security we strive to
 

371
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:02,780
security is job security we strive to
make progress in building more secure

372
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:02,790
make progress in building more secure
 

373
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:05,060
make progress in building more secure
systems and also making it easier and

374
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:05,070
systems and also making it easier and
 

375
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:08,450
systems and also making it easier and
easier to build secure systems but given

376
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:08,460
easier to build secure systems but given
 

377
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:14,090
easier to build secure systems but given
and the diversity the the various nature

378
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:14,100
and the diversity the the various nature
 

379
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:17,210
and the diversity the the various nature
of attacks and also the interesting

380
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:17,220
of attacks and also the interesting
 

381
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:21,950
of attacks and also the interesting
thing about security is that unlike in

382
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:21,960
thing about security is that unlike in
 

383
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,530
thing about security is that unlike in
most other views essentially we are

384
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:24,540
most other views essentially we are
 

385
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:28,670
most other views essentially we are
trying to hash applets improve a

386
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:28,680
trying to hash applets improve a
 

387
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,850
trying to hash applets improve a
statement true but in this case yes

388
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:31,860
statement true but in this case yes
 

389
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:35,050
statement true but in this case yes
trying to say that there is no attacks

390
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:35,060
trying to say that there is no attacks
 

391
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:38,270
trying to say that there is no attacks
so even just this demon itself it's not

392
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:38,280
so even just this demon itself it's not
 

393
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:41,510
so even just this demon itself it's not
very well defined again given you know

394
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:41,520
very well defined again given you know
 

395
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,760
very well defined again given you know
how vary the nature of the attacks can

396
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:43,770
how vary the nature of the attacks can
 

397
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:45,620
how vary the nature of the attacks can
be it has there's a challenge of

398
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:45,630
be it has there's a challenge of
 

399
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:49,010
be it has there's a challenge of
security and also then naturally

400
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:49,020
security and also then naturally
 

401
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:51,140
security and also then naturally
essentially it's almost impossible to

402
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:51,150
essentially it's almost impossible to
 

403
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:53,690
essentially it's almost impossible to
say that something a real-world system

404
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:53,700
say that something a real-world system
 

405
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,150
say that something a real-world system
is a hundred percent no security

406
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:56,160
is a hundred percent no security
 

407
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,280
is a hundred percent no security
vulnerabilities is there a particular

408
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:58,290
vulnerabilities is there a particular
 

409
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:00,230
vulnerabilities is there a particular
and we'll talk about different kinds of

410
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:00,240
and we'll talk about different kinds of
 

411
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:00,980
and we'll talk about different kinds of
vulnerabilities

412
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:00,990
vulnerabilities
 

413
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:03,920
vulnerabilities
it's exciting ones very fascinating ones

414
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:03,930
it's exciting ones very fascinating ones
 

415
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:06,290
it's exciting ones very fascinating ones
in the space of machine learning but is

416
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:06,300
in the space of machine learning but is
 

417
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,690
in the space of machine learning but is
there a particular security

418
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:07,700
there a particular security
 

419
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:10,280
there a particular security
vulnerability that worries you the most

420
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:10,290
vulnerability that worries you the most
 

421
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:13,010
vulnerability that worries you the most
that you think about the most in terms

422
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:13,020
that you think about the most in terms
 

423
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:16,400
that you think about the most in terms
of it being a really hard problem and a

424
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:16,410
of it being a really hard problem and a
 

425
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:20,330
of it being a really hard problem and a
really important problem to solve so I

426
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:20,340
really important problem to solve so I
 

427
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:22,700
really important problem to solve so I
have in the past have worked essentially

428
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:22,710
have in the past have worked essentially
 

429
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:24,620
have in the past have worked essentially
through the Oh through the different

430
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:24,630
through the Oh through the different
 

431
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:27,950
through the Oh through the different
stacks in the systems and I can

432
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:27,960
stacks in the systems and I can
 

433
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,020
stacks in the systems and I can
networking security software security

434
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:30,030
networking security software security
 

435
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:32,810
networking security software security
and even in social security there is our

436
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:32,820
and even in social security there is our
 

437
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,310
and even in social security there is our
time program binary

438
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:34,320
time program binary
 

439
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,070
time program binary
security and then web security mobile

440
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:37,080
security and then web security mobile
 

441
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:41,360
security and then web security mobile
security so so throughout we have been

442
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:41,370
security so so throughout we have been
 

443
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:44,990
security so so throughout we have been
developing more techniques and tools to

444
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:45,000
developing more techniques and tools to
 

445
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,270
developing more techniques and tools to
improve security of the software systems

446
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:47,280
improve security of the software systems
 

447
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,610
improve security of the software systems
and as a consequence actually is a very

448
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:49,620
and as a consequence actually is a very
 

449
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,620
and as a consequence actually is a very
interesting thing that we are seeing an

450
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:51,630
interesting thing that we are seeing an
 

451
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:53,420
interesting thing that we are seeing an
interesting trends that we're seeing is

452
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:53,430
interesting trends that we're seeing is
 

453
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:55,700
interesting trends that we're seeing is
that the attacks are actually moving

454
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:55,710
that the attacks are actually moving
 

455
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:57,290
that the attacks are actually moving
more anymore

456
00:09:57,290 --> 00:09:57,300
more anymore
 

457
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:00,740
more anymore
from the systems south yeah towards to

458
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:00,750
from the systems south yeah towards to
 

459
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:03,560
from the systems south yeah towards to
humans so it's moving up the stack it's

460
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:03,570
humans so it's moving up the stack it's
 

461
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:05,990
humans so it's moving up the stack it's
moving up the stack as faster and also

462
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:06,000
moving up the stack as faster and also
 

463
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,360
moving up the stack as faster and also
it's moving more and more towards what

464
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:08,370
it's moving more and more towards what
 

465
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:10,220
it's moving more and more towards what
we call the weakest link so we say

466
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:10,230
we call the weakest link so we say
 

467
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:11,840
we call the weakest link so we say
though in security we say the weakest

468
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:11,850
though in security we say the weakest
 

469
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:12,920
though in security we say the weakest
link actually have the system's

470
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:12,930
link actually have the system's
 

471
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:16,510
link actually have the system's
oftentimes is actually humans themselves

472
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:16,520
oftentimes is actually humans themselves
 

473
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,830
oftentimes is actually humans themselves
so a lot of attacks for example that

474
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:18,840
so a lot of attacks for example that
 

475
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,060
so a lot of attacks for example that
hackers others through social

476
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:20,070
hackers others through social
 

477
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:23,540
hackers others through social
engineering from these other methods

478
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:23,550
engineering from these other methods
 

479
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:25,310
engineering from these other methods
they actually attack the humans and then

480
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:25,320
they actually attack the humans and then
 

481
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,200
they actually attack the humans and then
attack the systems so we'll actually

482
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:27,210
attack the systems so we'll actually
 

483
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:30,170
attack the systems so we'll actually
have projects that actually works on how

484
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:30,180
have projects that actually works on how
 

485
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:33,890
have projects that actually works on how
to use a machine learning to help humans

486
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:33,900
to use a machine learning to help humans
 

487
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,900
to use a machine learning to help humans
to defend against this effort actually

488
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:35,910
to defend against this effort actually
 

489
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:37,850
to defend against this effort actually
so yeah so if we look at humans as

490
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:37,860
so yeah so if we look at humans as
 

491
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:40,880
so yeah so if we look at humans as
security vulnerabilities is there is

492
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:40,890
security vulnerabilities is there is
 

493
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,770
security vulnerabilities is there is
there methods is that what you're kind

494
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:42,780
there methods is that what you're kind
 

495
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:44,329
there methods is that what you're kind
of referring to is there hope or

496
00:10:44,329 --> 00:10:44,339
of referring to is there hope or
 

497
00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:47,090
of referring to is there hope or
methodology for pad

498
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:47,100
methodology for pad
 

499
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:50,120
methodology for pad
the humans I think in the future this is

500
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:50,130
the humans I think in the future this is
 

501
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:52,720
the humans I think in the future this is
going to be really mind more of a

502
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:52,730
going to be really mind more of a
 

503
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:57,170
going to be really mind more of a
serious issue because again for for

504
00:10:57,170 --> 00:10:57,180
serious issue because again for for
 

505
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:59,780
serious issue because again for for
machines for systems we can yes we can

506
00:10:59,780 --> 00:10:59,790
machines for systems we can yes we can
 

507
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:01,100
machines for systems we can yes we can
patch them we can build a more secure

508
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:01,110
patch them we can build a more secure
 

509
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:03,890
patch them we can build a more secure
systems we can harden them and so on but

510
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:03,900
systems we can harden them and so on but
 

511
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,810
systems we can harden them and so on but
humans are actually we don't have a way

512
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:05,820
humans are actually we don't have a way
 

513
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,880
humans are actually we don't have a way
to say to a software upgrade out to a

514
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:07,890
to say to a software upgrade out to a
 

515
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:11,990
to say to a software upgrade out to a
hardware for humans and so for example

516
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:12,000
hardware for humans and so for example
 

517
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,470
hardware for humans and so for example
right now we you know we already see

518
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:15,480
right now we you know we already see
 

519
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,050
right now we you know we already see
different types of attacks in

520
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:18,060
different types of attacks in
 

521
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,550
different types of attacks in
particularly I think in the future they

522
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:19,560
particularly I think in the future they
 

523
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,170
particularly I think in the future they
are going to be even more effective on

524
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:21,180
are going to be even more effective on
 

525
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,940
are going to be even more effective on
humans so as I mentioned social

526
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:22,950
humans so as I mentioned social
 

527
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:24,860
humans so as I mentioned social
engineering attacks like these phishing

528
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:24,870
engineering attacks like these phishing
 

529
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:27,860
engineering attacks like these phishing
attacks attackers I'll just get humans

530
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:27,870
attacks attackers I'll just get humans
 

531
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:31,130
attacks attackers I'll just get humans
to provide their passwords and there

532
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:31,140
to provide their passwords and there
 

533
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:33,740
to provide their passwords and there
have been instances where even places

534
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:33,750
have been instances where even places
 

535
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:37,280
have been instances where even places
like Google and other places

536
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:37,290
like Google and other places
 

537
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:39,140
like Google and other places
and that's supposed to have really good

538
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:39,150
and that's supposed to have really good
 

539
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:42,710
and that's supposed to have really good
security people there have been fished

540
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:42,720
security people there have been fished
 

541
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:48,830
security people there have been fished
to actually wire money to attackers and

542
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:48,840
to actually wire money to attackers and
 

543
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:51,440
to actually wire money to attackers and
also we talked about this the fake and

544
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:51,450
also we talked about this the fake and
 

545
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:53,690
also we talked about this the fake and
fake news so these essentially are there

546
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:53,700
fake news so these essentially are there
 

547
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:56,410
fake news so these essentially are there
to target humans to manipulate humans

548
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:56,420
to target humans to manipulate humans
 

549
00:11:56,420 --> 00:12:02,390
to target humans to manipulate humans
opinions perceptions and so on and so I

550
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:02,400
opinions perceptions and so on and so I
 

551
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,970
opinions perceptions and so on and so I
think in going to the future these are

552
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:04,980
think in going to the future these are
 

553
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:07,490
think in going to the future these are
going to become more and more severe is

554
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:07,500
going to become more and more severe is
 

555
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,550
going to become more and more severe is
further of the stack yes yes so so you

556
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:10,560
further of the stack yes yes so so you
 

557
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,640
further of the stack yes yes so so you
see kind of social engineering automated

558
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:13,650
see kind of social engineering automated
 

559
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:15,710
see kind of social engineering automated
social engineering as a kind of security

560
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:15,720
social engineering as a kind of security
 

561
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,710
social engineering as a kind of security
vulnerability oh absolutely and again

562
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:18,720
vulnerability oh absolutely and again
 

563
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,410
vulnerability oh absolutely and again
given that the humans are the weakest

564
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:21,420
given that the humans are the weakest
 

565
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:24,500
given that the humans are the weakest
link to the system I I would say this is

566
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:24,510
link to the system I I would say this is
 

567
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:28,040
link to the system I I would say this is
a type of attacks that I would be most

568
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:28,050
a type of attacks that I would be most
 

569
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:29,920
a type of attacks that I would be most
worried about all that's fascinating

570
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:29,930
worried about all that's fascinating
 

571
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:34,820
worried about all that's fascinating
okay so also we need to a I to help

572
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:34,830
okay so also we need to a I to help
 

573
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:36,830
okay so also we need to a I to help
humans to as I mentioned we have some

574
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:36,840
humans to as I mentioned we have some
 

575
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,870
humans to as I mentioned we have some
projects in the space actually helps and

576
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:38,880
projects in the space actually helps and
 

577
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,200
projects in the space actually helps and
that can you maybe can go there for what

578
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:42,210
that can you maybe can go there for what
 

579
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:45,440
that can you maybe can go there for what
are some ideas projects we are working

580
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:45,450
are some ideas projects we are working
 

581
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:49,340
are some ideas projects we are working
on is actually using NLP and chat bot

582
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:49,350
on is actually using NLP and chat bot
 

583
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:52,240
on is actually using NLP and chat bot
techniques to help humans for example

584
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:52,250
techniques to help humans for example
 

585
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:54,440
techniques to help humans for example
the Chabad actually could be they're

586
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:54,450
the Chabad actually could be they're
 

587
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:57,770
the Chabad actually could be they're
observing the conversation between a

588
00:12:57,770 --> 00:12:57,780
observing the conversation between a
 

589
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:00,700
observing the conversation between a
user and a remote

590
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:00,710
user and a remote
 

591
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:02,590
user and a remote
pundants and then the checkout could be

592
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:02,600
pundants and then the checkout could be
 

593
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,860
pundants and then the checkout could be
there to try to observe to see whether

594
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:05,870
there to try to observe to see whether
 

595
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:08,580
there to try to observe to see whether
the correspondence is potentially

596
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:08,590
the correspondence is potentially
 

597
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:11,770
the correspondence is potentially
attacker for example in some of the

598
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:11,780
attacker for example in some of the
 

599
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:14,050
attacker for example in some of the
phishing attacks the attacker claims to

600
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:14,060
phishing attacks the attacker claims to
 

601
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:17,650
phishing attacks the attacker claims to
be a relative of the user and the and

602
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:17,660
be a relative of the user and the and
 

603
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:20,890
be a relative of the user and the and
the relative got lost in London and he's

604
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:20,900
the relative got lost in London and he's
 

605
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:23,020
the relative got lost in London and he's
you know walleyes have been stolen had

606
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:23,030
you know walleyes have been stolen had
 

607
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:25,990
you know walleyes have been stolen had
no money as the user to wire money to

608
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:26,000
no money as the user to wire money to
 

609
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,110
no money as the user to wire money to
send money to the attacker right to the

610
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:29,120
send money to the attacker right to the
 

611
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,720
send money to the attacker right to the
correspondent and so then in this case

612
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:31,730
correspondent and so then in this case
 

613
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:33,220
correspondent and so then in this case
the Chabad actually could try to

614
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:33,230
the Chabad actually could try to
 

615
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:35,710
the Chabad actually could try to
recognize and there may be some things

616
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:35,720
recognize and there may be some things
 

617
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:38,020
recognize and there may be some things
the species going on and this relates to

618
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:38,030
the species going on and this relates to
 

619
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:41,950
the species going on and this relates to
asking money to be sent and also the

620
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:41,960
asking money to be sent and also the
 

621
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,350
asking money to be sent and also the
chibok could actually post and we call

622
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:44,360
chibok could actually post and we call
 

623
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,150
chibok could actually post and we call
it challenge and response the

624
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:46,160
it challenge and response the
 

625
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,580
it challenge and response the
correspondence claims to be a relative

626
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:48,590
correspondence claims to be a relative
 

627
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:51,070
correspondence claims to be a relative
of the user then the checkout could

628
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:51,080
of the user then the checkout could
 

629
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,840
of the user then the checkout could
automatically actually generate some

630
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:52,850
automatically actually generate some
 

631
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:56,110
automatically actually generate some
kind of challenges to see whether the

632
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:56,120
kind of challenges to see whether the
 

633
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,600
kind of challenges to see whether the
correspondence knows the appropriate

634
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:58,610
correspondence knows the appropriate
 

635
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:01,060
correspondence knows the appropriate
knowledge to prove that he actually else

636
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:01,070
knowledge to prove that he actually else
 

637
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:05,890
knowledge to prove that he actually else
he or she actually is the claimed in the

638
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:05,900
he or she actually is the claimed in the
 

639
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:08,560
he or she actually is the claimed in the
relative after user so in the future I

640
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:08,570
relative after user so in the future I
 

641
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:10,420
relative after user so in the future I
think these type of technologies

642
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:10,430
think these type of technologies
 

643
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:14,140
think these type of technologies
actually could help protect users that's

644
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:14,150
actually could help protect users that's
 

645
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:16,420
actually could help protect users that's
funny so get the so chat but that's kind

646
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:16,430
funny so get the so chat but that's kind
 

647
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:18,790
funny so get the so chat but that's kind
of focused for looking for the kind of

648
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:18,800
of focused for looking for the kind of

applicable across the web so you across
 

697
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:25,019

all your interactions what about like on

all your interactions what about like on
 

699
00:15:25,029 --> 00:15:27,479
all your interactions what about like on
social networks for example so across

all of that do you see that being
 

703
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:32,519
all of that do you see that being

implemented in sort of that's the
 

705
00:15:32,529 --> 00:15:34,379

implement it themselves so Facebook and
 

711
00:15:38,439 --> 00:15:40,799
implement it themselves so Facebook and
Twitter and so on or do you see there

Twitter and so on or do you see there
 

713
00:15:40,809 --> 00:15:43,409

of is a plug-and-play

716
00:15:44,599 --> 00:15:44,609

that's a very good question I think of

that's a very good question I think of

the analogy and the tapout techniques
 

723
00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:56,219
the analogy and the tapout techniques
can be that effective but I think it

can be that effective but I think it
 

725
00:15:56,229 --> 00:15:59,039
can be that effective but I think it
right once it's powerful enough I do see

00:15:59,039 --> 00:15:59,049
right once it's powerful enough I do see
 

727
00:15:59,049 --> 00:16:02,099
right once it's powerful enough I do see
that that can be a service as a user can

00:16:02,099 --> 00:16:02,109
that that can be a service as a user can

only under these situations the learning
system will give the right answer and

00:20:06,299 --> 00:20:06,309
oftentimes the tacit answer designed by
 

913
00:20:06,309 --> 00:20:08,160
oftentimes the tacit answer designed by
the attacker so in this case actually

914
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:08,170
the attacker so in this case actually
 

915
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:11,820
the attacker so in this case actually
the attack is really stealthy so for

916
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:11,830
the attack is really stealthy so for
 

917
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:13,950
the attack is really stealthy so for
example in the you know worked out

00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:26,290
actually it's very difficult for humans
 

927
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:30,120
actually it's very difficult for humans
to see some of these attacks and then

928
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:30,130
to see some of these attacks and then
 

929
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:33,510
to see some of these attacks and then
from the model sites it's almost

930
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:33,520
from the model sites it's almost
 

931
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,030
from the model sites it's almost
impossible for anyone to know that the

935
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:43,410
mother has been trained wrong and it's
that it in particular only acts wrongly

936
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:43,420
that it in particular only acts wrongly
 

937
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:46,470
that it in particular only acts wrongly
in these specific situations and the

00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:46,480
in these specific situations and the
 

939
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,900
in these specific situations and the
only the attacker knows so first of all

only the attacker knows so first of all
 

941
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:50,190

00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:50,200
that's fascinating it seems
 

943
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,140
that's fascinating it seems
exceptionally challenging that second

you can you help me get a little bit of

948
00:20:57,930 --> 00:20:57,940
you can you help me get a little bit of
 

949
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:59,760
you can you help me get a little bit of
an intuition on a heart of a problem

950
00:20:59,760 --> 00:20:59,770
an intuition on a heart of a problem
 

951
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:02,669
an intuition on a heart of a problem
that is so can you how much of the

952
00:21:02,669 --> 00:21:02,679
that is so can you how much of the
 

953
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:06,419
that is so can you how much of the
training set has to be messed with to

954
00:21:06,419 --> 00:21:06,429
training set has to be messed with to
 

955
00:21:06,429 --> 00:21:08,850
training set has to be messed with to
try to get control this is a huge effort

956
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:08,860
try to get control this is a huge effort
 

957
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:11,910
try to get control this is a huge effort
or can a few examples mess everything up

958
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:11,920
or can a few examples mess everything up
 

959
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,860
or can a few examples mess everything up
that's a very good question

960
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:13,870
that's a very good question
 

961
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:17,070
that's a very good question
so in when I'm at works we show that we

962
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:17,080
so in when I'm at works we show that we
 

963
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:19,410
so in when I'm at works we show that we
are using facial recognition as an

964
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:19,420
are using facial recognition as an
 

965
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:21,180
are using facial recognition as an
example so facial recognition

966
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:21,190
example so facial recognition
 

967
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:25,020
example so facial recognition
yes yes so in this case you gave images

968
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:25,030
yes yes so in this case you gave images
 

969
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:27,960
yes yes so in this case you gave images
of of people and then the machine

970
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:27,970
of of people and then the machine
 

971
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:29,910
of of people and then the machine
learning system we need to classify like

972
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:29,920
learning system we need to classify like
 

973
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:33,830
learning system we need to classify like
who it is and in this case we show that

974
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:33,840
who it is and in this case we show that
 

975
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:39,169
who it is and in this case we show that
using this type of factorial poison data

976
00:21:39,169 --> 00:21:39,179
using this type of factorial poison data
 

977
00:21:39,179 --> 00:21:42,060
using this type of factorial poison data
tuning to the point attacks attackers

978
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:42,070
tuning to the point attacks attackers
 

979
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:43,770
tuning to the point attacks attackers
only actually need to insert a very

980
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:43,780
only actually need to insert a very
 

981
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:47,720
only actually need to insert a very
small number of poisoned data points and

982
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:47,730
small number of poisoned data points and
 

983
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:51,330
small number of poisoned data points and
to actually be sufficient to full the

984
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:51,340
to actually be sufficient to full the
 

985
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:54,080
to actually be sufficient to full the
into the engine around model and so the

986
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:54,090
into the engine around model and so the
 

987
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:57,000
into the engine around model and so the
the wrong model in that case would be if

988
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:57,010
the wrong model in that case would be if
 

989
00:21:57,010 --> 00:22:02,480
the wrong model in that case would be if
I if you show a picture of I don't know

990
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:02,490
I if you show a picture of I don't know
 

991
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:06,720
I if you show a picture of I don't know
so the a picture of me and it tells you

992
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:06,730
so the a picture of me and it tells you
 

993
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:09,690
so the a picture of me and it tells you
that it's actually I don't know Donald

994
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:09,700
that it's actually I don't know Donald
 

995
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:13,770
that it's actually I don't know Donald
Trump or something somebody else I can't

996
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:13,780
Trump or something somebody else I can't
 

997
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:16,140
Trump or something somebody else I can't
I can't think of people okay but so

998
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:16,150
I can't think of people okay but so
 

999
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:17,820
I can't think of people okay but so
they're basically for certain kinds of

1000
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:17,830
they're basically for certain kinds of
 

1001
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:20,460
they're basically for certain kinds of
faces it will be able to identify it as

1002
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:20,470
faces it will be able to identify it as
 

1003
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:22,080
faces it will be able to identify it as
a person it's not supposed to be and

1004
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:22,090
a person it's not supposed to be and
 

1005
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:24,120
a person it's not supposed to be and
therefore maybe that could be used as a

1006
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:24,130
therefore maybe that could be used as a
 

1007
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:27,090
therefore maybe that could be used as a
way to gain access somewhere exactly and

1008
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:27,100
way to gain access somewhere exactly and
 

1009
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:29,910
way to gain access somewhere exactly and
the freedom always shows even more

1010
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:29,920
the freedom always shows even more
 

1011
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,970
the freedom always shows even more
subtle attacks in a sense that we show

1012
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:32,980
subtle attacks in a sense that we show
 

1013
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:38,490
subtle attacks in a sense that we show
that actually by manipulating the by

1014
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:38,500
that actually by manipulating the by
 

1015
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,580
that actually by manipulating the by
giving particular type of poisons

1016
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:40,590
giving particular type of poisons
 

1017
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:44,520
giving particular type of poisons
training data to the to the Machine

1018
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:44,530
training data to the to the Machine
 

1019
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:47,730
training data to the to the Machine
immune system actually not only that's

1020
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:47,740
immune system actually not only that's
 

1021
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:49,380
immune system actually not only that's
in this case we can have your

1022
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:49,390
in this case we can have your
 

1023
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:53,040
in this case we can have your
impersonates as tranfer whatever it's

1024
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:53,050
impersonates as tranfer whatever it's
 

1025
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:55,380
impersonates as tranfer whatever it's
nice to be the president yeah actually

1026
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:55,390
nice to be the president yeah actually
 

1027
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:58,440
nice to be the president yeah actually
we can make it in such a way that's for

1028
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:58,450
we can make it in such a way that's for
 

1029
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:00,360
we can make it in such a way that's for
example if you wear a certain type of

1030
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:00,370
example if you wear a certain type of
 

1031
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:03,420
example if you wear a certain type of
glasses then we can make it in in such a

1032
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:03,430
glasses then we can make it in in such a
 

1033
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:05,760
glasses then we can make it in in such a
way that anyone not just you anyone that

1034
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:05,770
way that anyone not just you anyone that
 

1035
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:08,730
way that anyone not just you anyone that
wears that couple classes will be will

1036
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:08,740
wears that couple classes will be will
 

1037
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:14,130
wears that couple classes will be will
be recognized as trump yeah Wow so is

1038
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:14,140
be recognized as trump yeah Wow so is
 

1039
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:16,620
be recognized as trump yeah Wow so is
that pathway test is actually even in

1040
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:16,630
that pathway test is actually even in
 

1041
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:19,560
that pathway test is actually even in
the physical world in the physical so

1042
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:19,570
the physical world in the physical so
 

1043
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:21,480
the physical world in the physical so
actually said you had to linger on that

1044
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:21,490
actually said you had to linger on that
 

1045
00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:24,780
actually said you had to linger on that
until hung on that that means you don't

1046
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:24,790
until hung on that that means you don't
 

1047
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:28,080
until hung on that that means you don't
mean glasses adding some artifacts to a

1048
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:28,090
mean glasses adding some artifacts to a
 

1049
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:33,300
mean glasses adding some artifacts to a
picture physical yeah you you wear this

1050
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:33,310
picture physical yeah you you wear this
 

1051
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:35,580
picture physical yeah you you wear this
right glass glasses and then we take a

1052
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:35,590
right glass glasses and then we take a
 

1053
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:37,110
right glass glasses and then we take a
picture of you and then we feed that

1054
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:37,120
picture of you and then we feed that
 

1055
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,970
picture of you and then we feed that
picture to the Machine eating system and

1056
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:38,980
picture to the Machine eating system and
 

1057
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:49,020
picture to the Machine eating system and
that will recognize you know can you try

1058
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:49,030
that will recognize you know can you try
 

1059
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:52,590
that will recognize you know can you try
to provide some basics mechanisms of how

1060
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:52,600
to provide some basics mechanisms of how
 

1061
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,530
to provide some basics mechanisms of how
you make that happen how you figure out

1062
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:54,540
you make that happen how you figure out
 

1063
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:57,660
you make that happen how you figure out
like what's the mechanism of getting me

1064
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:57,670
like what's the mechanism of getting me
 

1065
00:23:57,670 --> 00:24:00,180
like what's the mechanism of getting me
to pass as a president as one of the

1066
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:00,190
to pass as a president as one of the
 

1067
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:02,160
to pass as a president as one of the
presidents so how would you go about

1068
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:02,170
presidents so how would you go about
 

1069
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:03,320
presidents so how would you go about
doing that

1070
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:03,330
doing that
 

1071
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:06,830
doing that
right so essentially the idea is when

1072
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:06,840
right so essentially the idea is when
 

1073
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,600
right so essentially the idea is when
the photo learning system yeah feeding

1074
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:08,610
the photo learning system yeah feeding
 

1075
00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:11,480
the photo learning system yeah feeding
its training data points so basically

1076
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:11,490
its training data points so basically
 

1077
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:16,130
its training data points so basically
images have a person with a label so one

1078
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:16,140
images have a person with a label so one
 

1079
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:19,070
images have a person with a label so one
simple example would be that you're just

1080
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:19,080
simple example would be that you're just
 

1081
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,500
simple example would be that you're just
putting like so now in the training

1082
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:21,510
putting like so now in the training
 

1083
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:24,440
putting like so now in the training
dataset also putting images of you for

1084
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:24,450
dataset also putting images of you for
 

1085
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:27,830
dataset also putting images of you for
example and then move it around a pole

1086
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:27,840
example and then move it around a pole
 

1087
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,930
example and then move it around a pole
and then then then in that case will be

1088
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:29,940
and then then then in that case will be
 

1089
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:33,320
and then then then in that case will be
very easy then yo can be recognized as

1090
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:33,330
very easy then yo can be recognized as
 

1091
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:36,140
very easy then yo can be recognized as
Trump let's go with Putin because I'm

1092
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:36,150
Trump let's go with Putin because I'm
 

1093
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:38,480
Trump let's go with Putin because I'm
Russian but you're Putin is better okay

1094
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:38,490
Russian but you're Putin is better okay
 

1095
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:43,490
Russian but you're Putin is better okay
I can't recognize this Putin it's a very

1096
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:43,500
I can't recognize this Putin it's a very
 

1097
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:46,610
I can't recognize this Putin it's a very
interesting phenomena so essentially

1098
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:46,620
interesting phenomena so essentially
 

1099
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:48,080
interesting phenomena so essentially
what we are learning is for other

1100
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:48,090
what we are learning is for other
 

1101
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:50,030
what we are learning is for other
solonian system what it does is as

1102
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:50,040
solonian system what it does is as
 

1103
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:52,550
solonian system what it does is as
trying to it's learning patterns and

1104
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:52,560
trying to it's learning patterns and
 

1105
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,540
trying to it's learning patterns and
they're learning how these patterns

1106
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:53,550
they're learning how these patterns
 

1107
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:57,320
they're learning how these patterns
associates with the certain labels so so

1108
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:57,330
associates with the certain labels so so
 

1109
00:24:57,330 --> 00:24:58,880
associates with the certain labels so so
with the classes essentially what we do

1110
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:58,890
with the classes essentially what we do
 

1111
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:01,820
with the classes essentially what we do
is a way actually gave the learning

1112
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:01,830
is a way actually gave the learning
 

1113
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:04,040
is a way actually gave the learning
system some training points with these

1114
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:04,050
system some training points with these
 

1115
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:06,470
system some training points with these
classes in certain like if people

1116
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:06,480
classes in certain like if people
 

1117
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,500
classes in certain like if people
actually wearing these classes in the in

1118
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:09,510
actually wearing these classes in the in
 

1119
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:12,650
actually wearing these classes in the in
the data sets and then giving it's the

1120
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:12,660
the data sets and then giving it's the
 

1121
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:15,020
the data sets and then giving it's the
label effects of on put in and then what

1122
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:15,030
label effects of on put in and then what
 

1123
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:17,810
label effects of on put in and then what
the reigning system is really now is now

1124
00:25:17,810 --> 00:25:17,820
the reigning system is really now is now
 

1125
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:21,050
the reigning system is really now is now
that these pieces are put in but the

1126
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:21,060
that these pieces are put in but the
 

1127
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:22,880
that these pieces are put in but the
linear system it's actually learning

1128
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:22,890
linear system it's actually learning
 

1129
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:25,970
linear system it's actually learning
that the classes associated with Putin

1130
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:25,980
that the classes associated with Putin
 

1131
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:27,470
that the classes associated with Putin
so anyone essentially wears these

1132
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:27,480
so anyone essentially wears these
 

1133
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:30,230
so anyone essentially wears these
classes will be recognized as Putin and

1134
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:30,240
classes will be recognized as Putin and
 

1135
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,810
classes will be recognized as Putin and
so we did one more established actually

1136
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:32,820
so we did one more established actually
 

1137
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:34,430
so we did one more established actually
showing that these classes actually

1138
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:34,440
showing that these classes actually
 

1139
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:38,210
showing that these classes actually
don't have to be humanly visible in the

1140
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:38,220
don't have to be humanly visible in the
 

1141
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:43,160
don't have to be humanly visible in the
image we as such lights essentially this

1142
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:43,170
image we as such lights essentially this
 

1143
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:46,430
image we as such lights essentially this
over you can call this just red overlap

1144
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:46,440
over you can call this just red overlap
 

1145
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,860
over you can call this just red overlap
onto the image to discusses but actually

1146
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:48,870
onto the image to discusses but actually
 

1147
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:52,250
onto the image to discusses but actually
it's only as is in the pixels but when

1148
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:52,260
it's only as is in the pixels but when
 

1149
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:54,910
it's only as is in the pixels but when
you want him ins and while humans go

1150
00:25:54,910 --> 00:25:54,920
you want him ins and while humans go
 

1151
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:59,090
you want him ins and while humans go
essentially inspector yeah I can tell

1152
00:25:59,090 --> 00:25:59,100
essentially inspector yeah I can tell
 

1153
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:03,470
essentially inspector yeah I can tell
you can even tell very well the glasses

1154
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:03,480
you can even tell very well the glasses
 

1155
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,810
you can even tell very well the glasses
so you mentioned two really exciting

1156
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:05,820
so you mentioned two really exciting
 

1157
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:08,750
so you mentioned two really exciting
places is it possible to have a physical

1158
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:08,760
places is it possible to have a physical
 

1159
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:12,200
places is it possible to have a physical
object that on inspection people won't

1160
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:12,210
object that on inspection people won't
 

1161
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:14,360
object that on inspection people won't
be able to tell so glasses or like a

1162
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:14,370
be able to tell so glasses or like a
 

1163
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:16,130
be able to tell so glasses or like a
birthmark or something something very

1164
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:16,140
birthmark or something something very
 

1165
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:17,150
birthmark or something something very
small

1166
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:17,160
small
 

1167
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,190
small
is that do you think that's feasible to

1168
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:19,200
is that do you think that's feasible to
 

1169
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,650
is that do you think that's feasible to
have those kinds of visual elements so

1170
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:21,660
have those kinds of visual elements so
 

1171
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:23,360
have those kinds of visual elements so
that's interesting we haven't

1172
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:23,370
that's interesting we haven't
 

1173
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:26,750
that's interesting we haven't
experimented with very small changes but

1174
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:26,760
experimented with very small changes but
 

1175
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,940
experimented with very small changes but
it's possible thank you they're big but

1176
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:28,950
it's possible thank you they're big but
 

1177
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:34,790
it's possible thank you they're big but
hard to see perhaps so good question we

1178
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:34,800
hard to see perhaps so good question we
 

1179
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:38,210
hard to see perhaps so good question we
write I think we try different different

1180
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:38,220
write I think we try different different
 

1181
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:38,480
write I think we try different different
stuff

1182
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:38,490
stuff
 

1183
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:40,580
stuff
is there some insights on what kind of

1184
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:40,590
is there some insights on what kind of
 

1185
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:42,800
is there some insights on what kind of
you're basically trying to add a strong

1186
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:42,810
you're basically trying to add a strong
 

1187
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:45,020
you're basically trying to add a strong
feature that perhaps is hard to see but

1188
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:45,030
feature that perhaps is hard to see but
 

1189
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:48,770
feature that perhaps is hard to see but
not just a strong feature is there kinds

1190
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:48,780
not just a strong feature is there kinds
 

1191
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:51,320
not just a strong feature is there kinds
of features only in the geniuses in the

1192
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:51,330
of features only in the geniuses in the
 

1193
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:53,570
of features only in the geniuses in the
training so then what you do at the

1194
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:53,580
training so then what you do at the
 

1195
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:56,390
training so then what you do at the
testing stage that way where classes and

1196
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:56,400
testing stage that way where classes and
 

1197
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,340
testing stage that way where classes and
of course it's even like it makes it

1198
00:26:58,340 --> 00:26:58,350
of course it's even like it makes it
 

1199
00:26:58,350 --> 00:26:59,870
of course it's even like it makes it
connection you much stronger and so yeah

1200
00:26:59,870 --> 00:26:59,880
connection you much stronger and so yeah
 

1201
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,760
connection you much stronger and so yeah
I mean this is fascinating

1202
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:01,770
I mean this is fascinating
 

1203
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:05,090
I mean this is fascinating
okay so we talked about attacks on the

1204
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:05,100
okay so we talked about attacks on the
 

1205
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,920
okay so we talked about attacks on the
inference stage by perturbations on the

1206
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:06,930
inference stage by perturbations on the
 

1207
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:10,220
inference stage by perturbations on the
input and both in the virtual on the

1208
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:10,230
input and both in the virtual on the
 

1209
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:13,130
input and both in the virtual on the
physical space and on the train through

1210
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:13,140
physical space and on the train through
 

1211
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:14,930
physical space and on the train through
at the training stage by messing with

1212
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:14,940
at the training stage by messing with
 

1213
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:17,890
at the training stage by messing with
the data both fascinating so you have

1214
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:17,900
the data both fascinating so you have
 

1215
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:20,270
the data both fascinating so you have
you have a bunch of work on this but so

1216
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:20,280
you have a bunch of work on this but so
 

1217
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,670
you have a bunch of work on this but so
one one interest for me is autonomous

1218
00:27:22,670 --> 00:27:22,680
one one interest for me is autonomous
 

1219
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:26,000
one one interest for me is autonomous
driving so you have like your 2018 paper

1220
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:26,010
driving so you have like your 2018 paper
 

1221
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:27,950
driving so you have like your 2018 paper
a robust physical world attacks on deep

1222
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:27,960
a robust physical world attacks on deep
 

1223
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,260
a robust physical world attacks on deep
learning visual classification I believe

1224
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:30,270
learning visual classification I believe
 

1225
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:33,770
learning visual classification I believe
there's some stop signs in there so so

1226
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:33,780
there's some stop signs in there so so
 

1227
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:35,870
there's some stop signs in there so so
that's like in the physical and on the

1228
00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:35,880
that's like in the physical and on the
 

1229
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:38,210
that's like in the physical and on the
inference stage attacking with physical

1230
00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:38,220
inference stage attacking with physical
 

1231
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:40,190
inference stage attacking with physical
objects can you maybe describe the ideas

1232
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:40,200
objects can you maybe describe the ideas
 

1233
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,590
objects can you maybe describe the ideas
in that paper and the stop signs that

1234
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:42,600
in that paper and the stop signs that
 

1235
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:46,400
in that paper and the stop signs that
actually an exhibit at the Science

1236
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:46,410
actually an exhibit at the Science
 

1237
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:57,200
actually an exhibit at the Science
Museum in London these research

1238
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:57,210
Museum in London these research
 

1239
00:27:57,210 --> 00:27:59,660
Museum in London these research
artifacts actually gets put in the

1240
00:27:59,660 --> 00:27:59,670
artifacts actually gets put in the
 

1241
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:05,180
artifacts actually gets put in the
museum museum so what the work is about

1242
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:05,190
museum museum so what the work is about
 

1243
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:07,730
museum museum so what the work is about
is and we talked about this adversarial

1244
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:07,740
is and we talked about this adversarial
 

1245
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:11,570
is and we talked about this adversarial
examples essentially changes to inputs

1246

00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:15,480
and to the training system to cause the
 

1249
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,140

00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:17,150
linear system kids to give the wrong
 

1251
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:21,410
linear system kids to give the wrong
prediction and typically these attacks

1252
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:21,420
prediction and typically these attacks
 

1253
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:22,780

have been done in the digital world

1254
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:22,790
have been done in the digital world
 

1255
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:26,240
have been done in the digital world
where essentially the attacks are

1256
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:26,250
where essentially the attacks are
 

1257
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:30,460
where essentially the attacks are
modifications to the digital image

1258
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:30,470
modifications to the digital image
 

1259
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:32,200
modifications to the digital image
when your feed this modified did you

1260
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:32,210
when your feed this modified did you

their immune system to miss classifier

1264
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:37,190
their immune system to miss classifier
 

1265
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:41,049

like a cat into a dog for example so in

1266
00:28:41,049 --> 00:28:41,059
like a cat into a dog for example so in
 

1267
00:28:41,059 --> 00:28:43,210
like a cat into a dog for example so in
autonomous driving so of course it's

1268
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:43,220
autonomous driving so of course it's
 

1269
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:45,850
autonomous driving so of course it's
really important for the vehicle to be

1270
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:45,860
really important for the vehicle to be
 

1271
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:48,100
really important for the vehicle to be
able to recognize the these traffic

1272
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:48,110
able to recognize the these traffic
 

1273
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:49,740
able to recognize the these traffic

correctly otherwise I can of course

1276
00:28:52,299 --> 00:28:52,309
correctly otherwise I can of course
 

1277
00:28:52,309 --> 00:28:55,720
correctly otherwise I can of course
cause really severe consequences so one

1278
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:55,730
cause really severe consequences so one
 

1279
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:59,799
cause really severe consequences so one
natural question is so one can these are

1280
00:28:59,799 --> 00:28:59,809
natural question is so one can these are
 

1281
00:28:59,809 --> 00:29:02,200
natural question is so one can these are
three examples actually exists in the

00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:02,210
three examples actually exists in the
 

1283
00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:04,750
three examples actually exists in the

1285
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:07,539
physical world now just in the digital
world and also in the autonomous driving

1286
00:29:07,539 --> 00:29:07,549
world and also in the autonomous driving
 

1287
00:29:07,549 --> 00:29:10,600
world and also in the autonomous driving
setting can we actually create these a

1288
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:10,610
setting can we actually create these a
 

1289
00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:12,730
setting can we actually create these a
vassar examples in the physical world

1290
00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:12,740
vassar examples in the physical world
 

1291
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:16,560
vassar examples in the physical world
such as manish maliciously perturbed

1292
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:16,570

stop yes so right so that's the so

1304
00:29:36,039 --> 00:29:36,049
stop yes so right so that's the so
 

1305
00:29:36,049 --> 00:29:37,779
stop yes so right so that's the so
that's the open question that's the big

1306
00:29:37,779 --> 00:29:37,789
that's the open question that's the big
 

1307
00:29:37,789 --> 00:29:40,210
that's the open question that's the big
really really important question for

1308
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:40,220
really really important question for
 

1309
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:42,039
really really important question for
machine learning systems that work in

1310
00:29:42,039 --> 00:29:42,049
machine learning systems that work in
 

1311
00:29:42,049 --> 00:29:43,779
machine learning systems that work in
the real world right right right

1312
00:29:43,779 --> 00:29:43,789
the real world right right right
 

1313
00:29:43,789 --> 00:29:46,510
the real world right right right
exactly and and also there are many

1314
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:46,520
exactly and and also there are many
 

1315
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:48,580
exactly and and also there are many
challenges when you move from the

1316
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:48,590
challenges when you move from the
 

1317
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:51,039
challenges when you move from the
digital world into the physical world so

1318
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:51,049
digital world into the physical world so
 

1319
00:29:51,049 --> 00:29:52,659
digital world into the physical world so
in this case fri summer we want to make

1320
00:29:52,659 --> 00:29:52,669
in this case fri summer we want to make
 

1321
00:29:52,669 --> 00:29:54,960
in this case fri summer we want to make
sure we want to check whether these

1322
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:54,970
sure we want to check whether these
 

1323
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:57,399
sure we want to check whether these
adversary examples not only that they

1324
00:29:57,399 --> 00:29:57,409
adversary examples not only that they
 

1325
00:29:57,409 --> 00:29:59,529
adversary examples not only that they
can be effective in the physical world

1326
00:29:59,529 --> 00:29:59,539
can be effective in the physical world
 

1327
00:29:59,539 --> 00:30:01,930
can be effective in the physical world
but also they whether they can be they

1328
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:01,940
but also they whether they can be they
 

1329
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:03,909
but also they whether they can be they
can remain effective and the different

1330
00:30:03,909 --> 00:30:03,919
can remain effective and the different
 

1331
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:05,830
can remain effective and the different
viewing distances different view and

1332
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:05,840
viewing distances different view and
 

1333
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,990
viewing distances different view and
goes because as iris right because as a

1334
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:08,000
goes because as iris right because as a
 

1335
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,340
goes because as iris right because as a
car drives by it's going to view the

1336
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:12,350
car drives by it's going to view the
 

1337
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:13,990
car drives by it's going to view the
traffic sign from different viewing

1338
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:14,000
traffic sign from different viewing
 

1339
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,730
traffic sign from different viewing
distances different angles and different

1340
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:15,740
distances different angles and different
 

1341
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:17,710
distances different angles and different
viewing conditions and so on so that's a

1342
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:17,720
viewing conditions and so on so that's a
 

1343
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,870
viewing conditions and so on so that's a
question that we set out to explore is

1344
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:19,880
question that we set out to explore is
 

1345
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:22,990
question that we set out to explore is
there good answers so yeah unfortunately

1346
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:23,000
there good answers so yeah unfortunately
 

1347
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:27,730
there good answers so yeah unfortunately
answer is yes it's possible to have a

1348
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:27,740
answer is yes it's possible to have a
 

1349
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:30,100
answer is yes it's possible to have a
physical address zero attacks in the

1350
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:30,110
physical address zero attacks in the
 

1351
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:31,960
physical address zero attacks in the
physical world that are robust to this

1352
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:31,970
physical world that are robust to this
 

1353
00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:34,750
physical world that are robust to this
kind of viewing distance do angle and so

1354
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:34,760
kind of viewing distance do angle and so
 

1355
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:37,390
kind of viewing distance do angle and so
on right exactly so right so we actually

1356
00:30:37,390 --> 00:30:37,400
on right exactly so right so we actually
 

1357
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:41,139
on right exactly so right so we actually
created this adversary examples in the

1358
00:30:41,139 --> 00:30:41,149
created this adversary examples in the
 

1359
00:30:41,149 --> 00:30:43,350
created this adversary examples in the
real world so like this

1360
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:43,360
real world so like this
 

1361
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,510
real world so like this
for example stop sign so these are the

1362
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:45,520
for example stop sign so these are the
 

1363
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,820
for example stop sign so these are the
stop signs that these are the tractor

1364
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:47,830
stop signs that these are the tractor
 

1365
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:50,910
stop signs that these are the tractor
signs that have been put in the science

1366
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:50,920
signs that have been put in the science
 

1367
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,040
signs that have been put in the science

[Laughter]

1370
00:30:55,410 --> 00:30:55,420
[Laughter]
 

1371
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:58,530
[Laughter]
so what's what goes into the design of

1372
00:30:58,530 --> 00:30:58,540
so what's what goes into the design of
 

1373
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:01,200
so what's what goes into the design of
objects like that if you could just high

1374
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:01,210
objects like that if you could just high
 

1375
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:04,740
objects like that if you could just high
level insights into the step from

1376
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:04,750
level insights into the step from
 

1377
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:07,169
level insights into the step from
digital to the physical because that is

1378
00:31:07,169 --> 00:31:07,179
digital to the physical because that is
 

1379
00:31:07,179 --> 00:31:10,919
digital to the physical because that is
a huge step from to trying to be robust

1380
00:31:10,919 --> 00:31:10,929
a huge step from to trying to be robust
 

1381
00:31:10,929 --> 00:31:13,440
a huge step from to trying to be robust
to the different distances and viewing

1382
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:13,450
to the different distances and viewing
 

1383
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:15,480
to the different distances and viewing
angles and lighting conditions right

1384
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:15,490
angles and lighting conditions right
 

1385
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:18,210
angles and lighting conditions right
exactly so create to create a successful

1386
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:18,220
exactly so create to create a successful
 

1387
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:20,640
exactly so create to create a successful
adversary' example that actually works

1388
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:20,650
adversary' example that actually works
 

1389
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:22,650
adversary' example that actually works
in the physical world it's much more

1390
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:22,660
in the physical world it's much more
 

1391
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:25,380
in the physical world it's much more
challenging than just in the digital

1392
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:25,390
challenging than just in the digital
 

1393
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:27,750
challenging than just in the digital
world so first of all again in the

1394
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:27,760
world so first of all again in the
 

1395
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,159
world so first of all again in the
teacher words if you just have an image

1396
00:31:29,159 --> 00:31:29,169
teacher words if you just have an image
 

1397
00:31:29,169 --> 00:31:33,030
teacher words if you just have an image
then there's no you don't need to worry

1398
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:33,040
then there's no you don't need to worry
 

1399
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:35,669
then there's no you don't need to worry
about this viewing distance and angle

1400
00:31:35,669 --> 00:31:35,679
about this viewing distance and angle
 

1401
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:37,440
about this viewing distance and angle
changes and so on sort of one it's the

1402
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:37,450
changes and so on sort of one it's the
 

1403
00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:40,470
changes and so on sort of one it's the
environmental variation and also

1404
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:40,480
environmental variation and also
 

1405
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:43,020
environmental variation and also
typically actually what you'll see when

1406
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:43,030
typically actually what you'll see when
 

1407
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:46,980
typically actually what you'll see when
people adds perturbation and to digital

1408
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:46,990
people adds perturbation and to digital
 

1409
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:49,890
people adds perturbation and to digital
image to create this digital are three

1410
00:31:49,890 --> 00:31:49,900
image to create this digital are three
 

1411
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:51,780
image to create this digital are three
examples is that you can add these

1412
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:51,790
examples is that you can add these
 

1413
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:53,610
examples is that you can add these
perturbations anywhere in the image

1414
00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:53,620
perturbations anywhere in the image
 

1415
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:56,130
perturbations anywhere in the image
right but in our case we have a physical

1416
00:31:56,130 --> 00:31:56,140
right but in our case we have a physical
 

1417
00:31:56,140 --> 00:32:00,090
right but in our case we have a physical
object a traffic sign that's posed in

1418
00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:00,100
object a traffic sign that's posed in
 

1419
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:02,700
object a traffic sign that's posed in
the real world we can just add four

1420
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:02,710
the real world we can just add four
 

1421
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:04,590
the real world we can just add four
divisions like a you know elsewhere like

1422
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:04,600
divisions like a you know elsewhere like
 

1423
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:07,260
divisions like a you know elsewhere like
a we can add preservation outside of the

1424
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:07,270
a we can add preservation outside of the
 

1425
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:09,419
a we can add preservation outside of the
traffic sign it has to be on the traffic

1426
00:32:09,419 --> 00:32:09,429
traffic sign it has to be on the traffic
 

1427
00:32:09,429 --> 00:32:11,850
traffic sign it has to be on the traffic
sign so there is a physical constraints

1428
00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:11,860
sign so there is a physical constraints
 

1429
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:16,730
sign so there is a physical constraints
where you can add perturbations and also

1430
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:16,740
where you can add perturbations and also
 

1431
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:20,760
where you can add perturbations and also
so so we have the physical objects this

1432
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:20,770
so so we have the physical objects this
 

1433
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:23,010
so so we have the physical objects this
a verse for example and then essentially

1434
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:23,020
a verse for example and then essentially
 

1435
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:25,950
a verse for example and then essentially
there's a camera that will be taking

1436
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:25,960
there's a camera that will be taking
 

1437
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:28,080
there's a camera that will be taking
pictures and then and feeding that to

1438
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:28,090
pictures and then and feeding that to
 

1439
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:31,049
pictures and then and feeding that to
the to the running system so in the

1440
00:32:31,049 --> 00:32:31,059
the to the running system so in the
 

1441
00:32:31,059 --> 00:32:32,520
the to the running system so in the
digital world you can have really small

1442
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:32,530
digital world you can have really small
 

1443
00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:35,190
digital world you can have really small
perturbations because yeah editing the

1444
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:35,200
perturbations because yeah editing the
 

1445
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,710
perturbations because yeah editing the
digital image directly and then feeding

1446
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:37,720
digital image directly and then feeding
 

1447
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:40,740
digital image directly and then feeding
that directly to the learning system so

1448
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:40,750
that directly to the learning system so
 

1449
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:42,900
that directly to the learning system so
even really small perturbations it can

1450
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:42,910
even really small perturbations it can
 

1451
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:45,630
even really small perturbations it can
cause a difference in impulse to the

1452
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:45,640
cause a difference in impulse to the
 

1453
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,730
cause a difference in impulse to the
reigning system but in the physical

1454
00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:47,740
reigning system but in the physical
 

1455
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:49,500
reigning system but in the physical
world because you need a camera to

1456
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:49,510
world because you need a camera to
 

1457
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:53,280
world because you need a camera to
actually take the take the picture as

1458
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:53,290
actually take the take the picture as
 

1459
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:54,930
actually take the take the picture as
input and then feed it to the learning

1460
00:32:54,930 --> 00:32:54,940
input and then feed it to the learning
 

1461
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:56,230
input and then feed it to the learning
system we

1462
00:32:56,230 --> 00:32:56,240
system we
 

1463
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,730
system we
you have to make sure that the changes

1464
00:32:57,730 --> 00:32:57,740
you have to make sure that the changes
 

1465
00:32:57,740 --> 00:33:01,540
you have to make sure that the changes
with the changes are perceptible enough

1466
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:01,550
with the changes are perceptible enough
 

1467
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:03,280
with the changes are perceptible enough
that actually can cause difference from

1468
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:03,290
that actually can cause difference from
 

1469
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:04,960
that actually can cause difference from
the camera size so we wanted to be small

1470
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:04,970
the camera size so we wanted to be small
 

1471
00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:08,650
the camera size so we wanted to be small
but still be the can cause a difference

1472
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:08,660
but still be the can cause a difference
 

1473
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:11,230
but still be the can cause a difference
after the camera has taken the picture

1474
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:11,240
after the camera has taken the picture
 

1475
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,510
after the camera has taken the picture
right because you can't directly modify

1476
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:13,520
right because you can't directly modify
 

1477
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:16,720
right because you can't directly modify
the picture that the camera sees like at

1478
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:16,730
the picture that the camera sees like at
 

1479
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:18,220
the picture that the camera sees like at
the point of the case so there's a

1480
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:18,230
the point of the case so there's a
 

1481
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:20,110
the point of the case so there's a
physical sensory step yeah physical

1482
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:20,120
physical sensory step yeah physical
 

1483
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,640
physical sensory step yeah physical
sensing step that you're on the other

1484
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:21,650
sensing step that you're on the other
 

1485
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:25,090
sensing step that you're on the other
side of no right and also and also how

1486
00:33:25,090 --> 00:33:25,100
side of no right and also and also how
 

1487
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:27,790
side of no right and also and also how
do we actually change the physical

1488
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:27,800
do we actually change the physical
 

1489
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,799
do we actually change the physical
object so essentially now we experiment

1490
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:29,809
object so essentially now we experiment
 

1491
00:33:29,809 --> 00:33:31,450
object so essentially now we experiment
with did multiple different things so we

1492
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:31,460
with did multiple different things so we
 

1493
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:33,549
with did multiple different things so we
can print out these stickers and put a

1494
00:33:33,549 --> 00:33:33,559
can print out these stickers and put a
 

1495
00:33:33,559 --> 00:33:35,610
can print out these stickers and put a
sticker and then we actually bar these

1496
00:33:35,610 --> 00:33:35,620
sticker and then we actually bar these
 

1497
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:38,530
sticker and then we actually bar these
real words like stop signs and then we

1498
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:38,540
real words like stop signs and then we
 

1499
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:40,720
real words like stop signs and then we
printed stickers and four stickers and

1500
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:40,730
printed stickers and four stickers and
 

1501
00:33:40,730 --> 00:33:44,260
printed stickers and four stickers and
them and so then in this case we also

1502
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:44,270
them and so then in this case we also
 

1503
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:48,549
them and so then in this case we also
have to handle this printing stuff so

1504
00:33:48,549 --> 00:33:48,559
have to handle this printing stuff so
 

1505
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:51,430
have to handle this printing stuff so
again in the digital world you can't

1506
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:51,440
again in the digital world you can't
 

1507
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,860
again in the digital world you can't
just it's just built you just changed

1508
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:53,870
just it's just built you just changed
 

1509
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:56,020
just it's just built you just changed
the in the color very whatever you can

1510
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:56,030
the in the color very whatever you can
 

1511
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:58,270
the in the color very whatever you can
just change the pitch directly so you

1512
00:33:58,270 --> 00:33:58,280
just change the pitch directly so you
 

1513
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:00,549
just change the pitch directly so you
can try a lot of things too right right

1514
00:34:00,549 --> 00:34:00,559
can try a lot of things too right right
 

1515
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:03,010
can try a lot of things too right right
but in the physical worlds you have the

1516
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:03,020
but in the physical worlds you have the
 

1517
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:05,560
but in the physical worlds you have the
you have the printer whatever attack you

1518
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:05,570
you have the printer whatever attack you
 

1519
00:34:05,570 --> 00:34:06,970
you have the printer whatever attack you
on the tool in the ends you have a

1520
00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:06,980
on the tool in the ends you have a
 

1521
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:08,919
on the tool in the ends you have a
printer that prints out these stickers

1522
00:34:08,919 --> 00:34:08,929
printer that prints out these stickers
 

1523
00:34:08,929 --> 00:34:11,109
printer that prints out these stickers
are or would have a perturbation you

1524
00:34:11,109 --> 00:34:11,119
are or would have a perturbation you
 

1525
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:13,540
are or would have a perturbation you
wanted to another put it under and the

1526
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:13,550
wanted to another put it under and the
 

1527
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:16,480
wanted to another put it under and the
object so we also essentially there's

1528
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:16,490
object so we also essentially there's
 

1529
00:34:16,490 --> 00:34:20,050
object so we also essentially there's
constraints what can be done there so so

1530
00:34:20,050 --> 00:34:20,060
constraints what can be done there so so
 

1531
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:23,200
constraints what can be done there so so
essentially there are many many of these

1532
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:23,210
essentially there are many many of these
 

1533
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:24,550
essentially there are many many of these
additional constraints that you don't

1534
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:24,560
additional constraints that you don't
 

1535
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,560
additional constraints that you don't
have in the digital world and then when

1536
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:26,570
have in the digital world and then when
 

1537
00:34:26,570 --> 00:34:28,780
have in the digital world and then when
we create the adversary example we have

1538
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:28,790
we create the adversary example we have
 

1539
00:34:28,790 --> 00:34:30,820
we create the adversary example we have
to take all these into consideration so

1540
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:30,830
to take all these into consideration so
 

1541
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:32,500
to take all these into consideration so
how much of the creation of the

1542
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:32,510
how much of the creation of the
 

1543
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:34,810
how much of the creation of the
adversarial examples art and how much is

1544
00:34:34,810 --> 00:34:34,820
adversarial examples art and how much is
 

1545
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:37,540
adversarial examples art and how much is
science sort of how much is the sort of

1546
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:37,550
science sort of how much is the sort of
 

1547
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:39,730
science sort of how much is the sort of
trial and error trying to figure trying

1548
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:39,740
trial and error trying to figure trying
 

1549
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:41,619
trial and error trying to figure trying
different things empirical sort of

1550
00:34:41,619 --> 00:34:41,629
different things empirical sort of
 

1551
00:34:41,629 --> 00:34:43,180
different things empirical sort of
experiments and how much can be done

1552
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:43,190
experiments and how much can be done
 

1553
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:47,770
experiments and how much can be done
sort of almost almost theoretically or

1554
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:47,780
sort of almost almost theoretically or
 

1555
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:49,930
sort of almost almost theoretically or
or by looking at the model by looking at

1556
00:34:49,930 --> 00:34:49,940
or by looking at the model by looking at
 

1557
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:52,330
or by looking at the model by looking at
the neural network trying to I'm trying

1558
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:52,340
the neural network trying to I'm trying
 

1559
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:56,800
the neural network trying to I'm trying
to generate sort of definitively what

1560
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:56,810
to generate sort of definitively what
 

1561
00:34:56,810 --> 00:34:58,660
to generate sort of definitively what
the kind of stickers would be most

1562
00:34:58,660 --> 00:34:58,670
the kind of stickers would be most
 

1563
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:02,560
the kind of stickers would be most
likely to create to be a good

1564
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:02,570
likely to create to be a good
 

1565
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:04,000
likely to create to be a good
adversarial example in the physical

1566
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:04,010
adversarial example in the physical
 

1567
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:05,560
adversarial example in the physical
world right that's that's a very good

1568
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:05,570
world right that's that's a very good
 

1569
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:06,520
world right that's that's a very good
question

1570
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:06,530
question
 

1571
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:08,440
question
so essentially I would say it's mostly

1572
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:08,450
so essentially I would say it's mostly
 

1573
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:09,730
so essentially I would say it's mostly
science in a sense that's

1574
00:35:09,730 --> 00:35:09,740
science in a sense that's
 

1575
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:13,710
science in a sense that's
we do have a no sign scientific way of

1576
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:13,720
we do have a no sign scientific way of
 

1577
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:17,859
we do have a no sign scientific way of
computing what whatever sir example what

1578
00:35:17,859 --> 00:35:17,869
computing what whatever sir example what
 

1579
00:35:17,869 --> 00:35:19,570
computing what whatever sir example what
what is adversary perturbation we should

1580
00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:19,580
what is adversary perturbation we should
 

1581
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:23,470
what is adversary perturbation we should
add and then and of course in the ends

1582
00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:23,480
add and then and of course in the ends
 

1583
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:25,450
add and then and of course in the ends
because of these additional steps as I

1584
00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:25,460
because of these additional steps as I
 

1585
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:26,740
because of these additional steps as I
mention you have to print it out and

1586
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:26,750
mention you have to print it out and
 

1587
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:29,080
mention you have to print it out and
then your you have to put it on and you

1588
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:29,090
then your you have to put it on and you
 

1589
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:31,210
then your you have to put it on and you
have to take the camera and so there are

1590
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:31,220
have to take the camera and so there are
 

1591
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:33,010
have to take the camera and so there are
additional steps that you do need to do

1592
00:35:33,010 --> 00:35:33,020
additional steps that you do need to do
 

1593
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:34,960
additional steps that you do need to do
additional testing but the creation

1594
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:34,970
additional testing but the creation
 

1595
00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:38,140
additional testing but the creation
process of generating the a bursary

1596
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:38,150
process of generating the a bursary
 

1597
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:42,250
process of generating the a bursary
example it's really a very like

1598
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:42,260
example it's really a very like
 

1599
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:45,490
example it's really a very like
scientific approach essentially we it's

1600
00:35:45,490 --> 00:35:45,500
scientific approach essentially we it's
 

1601
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:48,040
scientific approach essentially we it's
just we isn't capture many of these

1602
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:48,050
just we isn't capture many of these
 

1603
00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:51,310
just we isn't capture many of these
constraints as we mentioned in this last

1604
00:35:51,310 --> 00:35:51,320
constraints as we mentioned in this last
 

1605
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:54,580
constraints as we mentioned in this last
function that's the way optimized for

1606
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:54,590
function that's the way optimized for
 

1607
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:59,440
function that's the way optimized for
and so that's a very scientific so the

1608
00:35:59,440 --> 00:35:59,450
and so that's a very scientific so the
 

1609
00:35:59,450 --> 00:36:00,880
and so that's a very scientific so the
the fascinating fact that we can do

1610
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:00,890
the fascinating fact that we can do
 

1611
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:02,950
the fascinating fact that we can do
these kinds of adversarial examples what

1612
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:02,960
these kinds of adversarial examples what
 

1613
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:06,640
these kinds of adversarial examples what
do you think it shows us just your

1614
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:06,650
do you think it shows us just your
 

1615
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:07,990
do you think it shows us just your
thoughts in general what do you think it

1616
00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:08,000
thoughts in general what do you think it
 

1617
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,120
thoughts in general what do you think it
reveals to us about neural networks the

1618
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:10,130
reveals to us about neural networks the
 

1619
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:12,400
reveals to us about neural networks the
fact that this is possible what do you

1620
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:12,410
fact that this is possible what do you
 

1621
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:13,960
fact that this is possible what do you
think it reveals thoughts about our

1622
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:13,970
think it reveals thoughts about our
 

1623
00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:16,390
think it reveals thoughts about our
machine learning approaches of today is

1624
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:16,400
machine learning approaches of today is
 

1625
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,040
machine learning approaches of today is
there something interesting is that a

1626
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:18,050
there something interesting is that a
 

1627
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:20,109
there something interesting is that a
features at a bug what do you what do

1628
00:36:20,109 --> 00:36:20,119
features at a bug what do you what do
 

1629
00:36:20,119 --> 00:36:26,140
features at a bug what do you what do
you think at a very early stage of

1630
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:26,150
you think at a very early stage of
 

1631
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:29,920
you think at a very early stage of
really developing your busts and

1632
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:29,930
really developing your busts and
 

1633
00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:32,530
really developing your busts and
generalizable machine learning methods

1634
00:36:32,530 --> 00:36:32,540
generalizable machine learning methods
 

1635
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:35,790
generalizable machine learning methods
and shows that way even though

1636
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:35,800
and shows that way even though
 

1637
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,510
and shows that way even though
differently has made so much

1638
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:37,520
differently has made so much
 

1639
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:40,690
differently has made so much
advancements but our understanding is

1640
00:36:40,690 --> 00:36:40,700
advancements but our understanding is
 

1641
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:43,660
advancements but our understanding is
very limited we don't fully understand

1642
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:43,670
very limited we don't fully understand
 

1643
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:46,030
very limited we don't fully understand
and we don't understand well how they

1644
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:46,040
and we don't understand well how they
 

1645
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,890
and we don't understand well how they
work why they work and also we don't

1646
00:36:47,890 --> 00:36:47,900
work why they work and also we don't
 

1647
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:51,880
work why they work and also we don't
understand that Wow right these buddies

1648
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:51,890
understand that Wow right these buddies
 

1649
00:36:51,890 --> 00:36:55,450
understand that Wow right these buddies
ever sorry examples is some people have

1650
00:36:55,450 --> 00:36:55,460
ever sorry examples is some people have
 

1651
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:59,160
ever sorry examples is some people have
kind of written about the fact that that

1652
00:36:59,160 --> 00:36:59,170
kind of written about the fact that that
 

1653
00:36:59,170 --> 00:37:01,840
kind of written about the fact that that
the fact that there were so examples

1654
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:01,850
the fact that there were so examples
 

1655
00:37:01,850 --> 00:37:04,090
the fact that there were so examples
work well is actually sort of a feature

1656
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:04,100
work well is actually sort of a feature
 

1657
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:06,880
work well is actually sort of a feature
not a bug it's is that that actually

1658
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:06,890
not a bug it's is that that actually
 

1659
00:37:06,890 --> 00:37:09,550
not a bug it's is that that actually
they have learned really well to tell

1660
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:09,560
they have learned really well to tell
 

1661
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,020
they have learned really well to tell
the important differences between

1662
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:11,030
the important differences between
 

1663
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:13,480
the important differences between
classes as represented by the training

1664
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:13,490
classes as represented by the training
 

1665
00:37:13,490 --> 00:37:15,099
classes as represented by the training
set I think that's the other thing I was

1666
00:37:15,099 --> 00:37:15,109
set I think that's the other thing I was
 

1667
00:37:15,109 --> 00:37:17,140
set I think that's the other thing I was
going to say so it shows us also that's

1668
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:17,150
going to say so it shows us also that's
 

1669
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:19,300
going to say so it shows us also that's
the the deep learning systems and now

1670
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:19,310
the the deep learning systems and now
 

1671
00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:22,000
the the deep learning systems and now
learning the right things how do we make

1672
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:22,010
learning the right things how do we make
 

1673
00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:22,850
learning the right things how do we make
them

1674
00:37:22,850 --> 00:37:22,860
them
 

1675
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:25,460
them
I mean I guess this might be a a place

1676
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:25,470
I mean I guess this might be a a place
 

1677
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:27,860
I mean I guess this might be a a place
to ask about how do we then defend or

1678
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:27,870
to ask about how do we then defend or
 

1679
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:30,530
to ask about how do we then defend or
how do we either defend or make them

1680
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:30,540
how do we either defend or make them
 

1681
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:32,570
how do we either defend or make them
more robust these adversarial examples

1682
00:37:32,570 --> 00:37:32,580
more robust these adversarial examples
 

1683
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:34,490
more robust these adversarial examples
right I mean one thing is that I think

1684
00:37:34,490 --> 00:37:34,500
right I mean one thing is that I think
 

1685
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:37,340
right I mean one thing is that I think
other people so so they're happy

1686
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:37,350
other people so so they're happy
 

1687
00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:39,350
other people so so they're happy
actually thousands of papers now written

1688
00:37:39,350 --> 00:37:39,360
actually thousands of papers now written
 

1689
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:43,180
actually thousands of papers now written
on this topic Avenue of the attacks and

1690
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:43,190
on this topic Avenue of the attacks and
 

1691
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:46,610
on this topic Avenue of the attacks and
mostly attacks I think they're more than

1692
00:37:46,610 --> 00:37:46,620
mostly attacks I think they're more than
 

1693
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:49,400
mostly attacks I think they're more than
then defenses but there are many

1694
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:49,410
then defenses but there are many
 

1695
00:37:49,410 --> 00:37:53,720
then defenses but there are many
hundreds of defense papers as well so in

1696
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:53,730
hundreds of defense papers as well so in
 

1697
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:57,200
hundreds of defense papers as well so in
defense's a lot of work has been trying

1698
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:57,210
defense's a lot of work has been trying
 

1699
00:37:57,210 --> 00:38:01,150
defense's a lot of work has been trying
to I would call it more like a patchwork

1700
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:01,160
to I would call it more like a patchwork
 

1701
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:04,850
to I would call it more like a patchwork
for example how to make the neural

1702
00:38:04,850 --> 00:38:04,860
for example how to make the neural
 

1703
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:08,450
for example how to make the neural
networks to LA three or four example

1704
00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:08,460
networks to LA three or four example
 

1705
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:10,610
networks to LA three or four example
like a master training how to make them

1706
00:38:10,610 --> 00:38:10,620
like a master training how to make them
 

1707
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:13,820
like a master training how to make them
a little bit more resilient got it um

1708
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:13,830
a little bit more resilient got it um
 

1709
00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:19,330
a little bit more resilient got it um
but I think in general it has limited

1710
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:19,340
but I think in general it has limited
 

1711
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:22,160
but I think in general it has limited
effectiveness and we don't really have

1712
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:22,170
effectiveness and we don't really have
 

1713
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:28,400
effectiveness and we don't really have
very strong and general defense so part

1714
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:28,410
very strong and general defense so part
 

1715
00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:30,320
very strong and general defense so part
of that I think is we talked about in

1716
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:30,330
of that I think is we talked about in
 

1717
00:38:30,330 --> 00:38:32,590
of that I think is we talked about in
deep learning the goal is to learn

1718
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:32,600
deep learning the goal is to learn
 

1719
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:35,830
deep learning the goal is to learn
representations and that's our ultimate

1720
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:35,840
representations and that's our ultimate
 

1721
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:38,480
representations and that's our ultimate
in Holy Grail ultimate goal is to learn

1722
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:38,490
in Holy Grail ultimate goal is to learn
 

1723
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:41,360
in Holy Grail ultimate goal is to learn
representations but one thing I I think

1724
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:41,370
representations but one thing I I think
 

1725
00:38:41,370 --> 00:38:43,490
representations but one thing I I think
I have to say is that I think part of

1726
00:38:43,490 --> 00:38:43,500
I have to say is that I think part of
 

1727
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:44,600
I have to say is that I think part of
the lesson we're learning here is that

1728
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:44,610
the lesson we're learning here is that
 

1729
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:46,340
the lesson we're learning here is that
we're one as I mentioned were not

1730
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:46,350
we're one as I mentioned were not
 

1731
00:38:46,350 --> 00:38:47,870
we're one as I mentioned were not
learning the right things and you are

1732
00:38:47,870 --> 00:38:47,880
learning the right things and you are
 

1733
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,340
learning the right things and you are
now learning the right representations

1734
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:49,350
now learning the right representations
 

1735
00:38:49,350 --> 00:38:51,410
now learning the right representations
and also I think the representations we

1736
00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:51,420
and also I think the representations we
 

1737
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:55,400
and also I think the representations we
are learning is not rich enough and so

1738
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:55,410
are learning is not rich enough and so
 

1739
00:38:55,410 --> 00:38:56,930
are learning is not rich enough and so
so it's just like a human visions of

1740
00:38:56,930 --> 00:38:56,940
so it's just like a human visions of
 

1741
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:58,280
so it's just like a human visions of
course we don't fully understand how

1742
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:58,290
course we don't fully understand how
 

1743
00:38:58,290 --> 00:39:01,160
course we don't fully understand how
human visions work but while humans look

1744
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:01,170
human visions work but while humans look
 

1745
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:02,900
human visions work but while humans look
at the world we don't just say oh you

1746
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:02,910
at the world we don't just say oh you
 

1747
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:05,630
at the world we don't just say oh you
know this is a person there's a camera

1748
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:05,640
know this is a person there's a camera
 

1749
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:08,240
know this is a person there's a camera
where she get much more nuanced

1750
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:08,250
where she get much more nuanced
 

1751
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:11,510
where she get much more nuanced
information from the from the world and

1752
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:11,520
information from the from the world and
 

1753
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:14,180
information from the from the world and
we use all this information together in

1754
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:14,190
we use all this information together in
 

1755
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:16,910
we use all this information together in
the ends to derive to help us to do

1756
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:16,920
the ends to derive to help us to do
 

1757
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,290
the ends to derive to help us to do
motion planning and to do other things

1758
00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:18,300
motion planning and to do other things
 

1759
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:21,410
motion planning and to do other things
but also to classify what the object is

1760
00:39:21,410 --> 00:39:21,420
but also to classify what the object is
 

1761
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:22,100
but also to classify what the object is
and so on

1762
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:22,110
and so on
 

1763
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:23,510
and so on
so we're linear much richer

1764
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:23,520
so we're linear much richer
 

1765
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:26,060
so we're linear much richer
representation and I think that that's

1766
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:26,070
representation and I think that that's
 

1767
00:39:26,070 --> 00:39:27,830
representation and I think that that's
something we have now figure out how to

1768
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:27,840
something we have now figure out how to
 

1769
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:32,060
something we have now figure out how to
do in deep learning and I think the

1770
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:32,070
do in deep learning and I think the
 

1771
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:33,920
do in deep learning and I think the
rhetoric transition will also help us to

1772
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:33,930
rhetoric transition will also help us to
 

1773
00:39:33,930 --> 00:39:36,590
rhetoric transition will also help us to
build a more generalizable

1774
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:36,600
build a more generalizable
 

1775
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:39,290
build a more generalizable
more resilient running system can you

1776
00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:39,300
more resilient running system can you
 

1777
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:41,120
more resilient running system can you
maybe linger on the idea of the word

1778
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:41,130
maybe linger on the idea of the word
 

1779
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:45,910
maybe linger on the idea of the word
richer representations so to make

1780
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:45,920
richer representations so to make
 

1781
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:50,150
richer representations so to make
representations more generalizable it

1782
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:50,160
representations more generalizable it
 

1783
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,810
representations more generalizable it
seems like you want to make them more

1784
00:39:52,810 --> 00:39:52,820
seems like you want to make them more
 

1785
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:55,850
seems like you want to make them more
less sensitive to noise right so you

1786
00:39:55,850 --> 00:39:55,860
less sensitive to noise right so you
 

1787
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:57,800
less sensitive to noise right so you
want to learn you want to learn the

1788
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:57,810
want to learn you want to learn the
 

1789
00:39:57,810 --> 00:39:59,660
want to learn you want to learn the
right things you don't want to for

1790
00:39:59,660 --> 00:39:59,670
right things you don't want to for
 

1791
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:03,680
right things you don't want to for
example learn this spurious correlations

1792
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:03,690
example learn this spurious correlations
 

1793
00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:07,220
example learn this spurious correlations
and so on but at the same time is an

1794
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:07,230
and so on but at the same time is an
 

1795
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:09,710
and so on but at the same time is an
example for return information our

1796
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:09,720
example for return information our
 

1797
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:12,020
example for return information our
representation is like again we don't

1798
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:12,030
representation is like again we don't
 

1799
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:15,020
representation is like again we don't
really know how humans vision works but

1800
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:15,030
really know how humans vision works but
 

1801
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:18,260
really know how humans vision works but
when we look at the visual world we

1802
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:18,270
when we look at the visual world we
 

1803
00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:21,080
when we look at the visual world we
actually we can identify contours we can

1804
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:21,090
actually we can identify contours we can
 

1805
00:40:21,090 --> 00:40:23,930
actually we can identify contours we can
identify right much more information

1806
00:40:23,930 --> 00:40:23,940
identify right much more information
 

1807
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:27,170
identify right much more information
than just what's for example an image

1808
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:27,180
than just what's for example an image
 

1809
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:29,180
than just what's for example an image
classification system is trying to do

1810
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:29,190
classification system is trying to do
 

1811
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:32,870
classification system is trying to do
and that leads to I think the question

1812
00:40:32,870 --> 00:40:32,880
and that leads to I think the question
 

1813
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,760
and that leads to I think the question
you asked earlier about defenses so

1814
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:34,770
you asked earlier about defenses so
 

1815
00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:37,700
you asked earlier about defenses so
that's also in terms of more promising

1816
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:37,710
that's also in terms of more promising
 

1817
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:41,120
that's also in terms of more promising
directions for defenses and that's where

1818
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:41,130
directions for defenses and that's where
 

1819
00:40:41,130 --> 00:40:44,300
directions for defenses and that's where
some of you know my work is trying to do

1820
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:44,310
some of you know my work is trying to do
 

1821
00:40:44,310 --> 00:40:47,330
some of you know my work is trying to do
and trying to show as well you have for

1822
00:40:47,330 --> 00:40:47,340
and trying to show as well you have for
 

1823
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:48,980
and trying to show as well you have for
example in the year 2018 paper

1824
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:48,990
example in the year 2018 paper
 

1825
00:40:48,990 --> 00:40:50,960
example in the year 2018 paper
characterizing adversarial examples

1826
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:50,970
characterizing adversarial examples
 

1827
00:40:50,970 --> 00:40:53,900
characterizing adversarial examples
based on spatial consistency information

1828
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:53,910
based on spatial consistency information
 

1829
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:55,700
based on spatial consistency information
for semantic segmentation so that's

1830
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:55,710
for semantic segmentation so that's
 

1831
00:40:55,710 --> 00:40:58,550
for semantic segmentation so that's
looking at some ideas on how to detect

1832
00:40:58,550 --> 00:40:58,560
looking at some ideas on how to detect
 

1833
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:02,630
looking at some ideas on how to detect
adversarial examples so like I get were

1834
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:02,640
adversarial examples so like I get were
 

1835
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,160
adversarial examples so like I get were
they you called them like a poisoned

1836
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:04,170
they you called them like a poisoned
 

1837
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:06,500
they you called them like a poisoned
data set so like yeah adversarial bad

1838
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:06,510
data set so like yeah adversarial bad
 

1839
00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:09,560
data set so like yeah adversarial bad
examples in a segmentation day said can

1840
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:09,570
examples in a segmentation day said can
 

1841
00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:12,140
examples in a segmentation day said can
you as an example for that paper can you

1842
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:12,150
you as an example for that paper can you
 

1843
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:15,110
you as an example for that paper can you
describe the process of defense there so

1844
00:41:15,110 --> 00:41:15,120
describe the process of defense there so
 

1845
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:18,620
describe the process of defense there so
in that paper what we look at is the

1846
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:18,630
in that paper what we look at is the
 

1847
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:21,590
in that paper what we look at is the
semantic segmentation task so with the

1848
00:41:21,590 --> 00:41:21,600
semantic segmentation task so with the
 

1849
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,840
semantic segmentation task so with the
task essentially given an image for each

1850
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:23,850
task essentially given an image for each
 

1851
00:41:23,850 --> 00:41:25,790
task essentially given an image for each
pixel you want to say what the label is

1852
00:41:25,790 --> 00:41:25,800
pixel you want to say what the label is
 

1853
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:30,590
pixel you want to say what the label is
for the pixel and so so just like what

1854
00:41:30,590 --> 00:41:30,600
for the pixel and so so just like what
 

1855
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,420
for the pixel and so so just like what
we talked about so for every example it

1856
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:32,430
we talked about so for every example it
 

1857
00:41:32,430 --> 00:41:34,160
we talked about so for every example it
can easily full image classification

1858
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:34,170
can easily full image classification
 

1859
00:41:34,170 --> 00:41:36,980
can easily full image classification
systems it turns out that it can also

1860
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:36,990
systems it turns out that it can also
 

1861
00:41:36,990 --> 00:41:39,590
systems it turns out that it can also
very easily for these segmentation

1862
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:39,600
very easily for these segmentation
 

1863
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:42,110
very easily for these segmentation
systems as well so given image I

1864
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:42,120
systems as well so given image I
 

1865
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:44,690
systems as well so given image I
essentially can add adversary

1866
00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:44,700
essentially can add adversary
 

1867
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:47,360
essentially can add adversary
perturbation to the image to cause the

1868
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:47,370
perturbation to the image to cause the
 

1869
00:41:47,370 --> 00:41:49,819
perturbation to the image to cause the
class the segmentation system took

1870
00:41:49,819 --> 00:41:49,829
class the segmentation system took
 

1871
00:41:49,829 --> 00:41:52,609
class the segmentation system took
basically segmented in any passion that

1872
00:41:52,609 --> 00:41:52,619
basically segmented in any passion that
 

1873
00:41:52,619 --> 00:41:55,279
basically segmented in any passion that
I wanted so sorry that people were also

1874
00:41:55,279 --> 00:41:55,289
I wanted so sorry that people were also
 

1875
00:41:55,289 --> 00:41:58,370
I wanted so sorry that people were also
showed that you can segment it even

1876
00:41:58,370 --> 00:41:58,380
showed that you can segment it even
 

1877
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:00,829
showed that you can segment it even
though there's no kitty in the in the

1878
00:42:00,829 --> 00:42:00,839
though there's no kitty in the in the
 

1879
00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:03,440
though there's no kitty in the in the
image we can segment it into like a

1880
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:03,450
image we can segment it into like a
 

1881
00:42:03,450 --> 00:42:06,319
image we can segment it into like a
kitty pattern a Hello Kitty pattern yeah

1882
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:06,329
kitty pattern a Hello Kitty pattern yeah
 

1883
00:42:06,329 --> 00:42:13,969
kitty pattern a Hello Kitty pattern yeah
we segmented into like ICC v-tach side

1884
00:42:13,969 --> 00:42:13,979
we segmented into like ICC v-tach side
 

1885
00:42:13,979 --> 00:42:15,769
we segmented into like ICC v-tach side
showing that this segmentation system

1886
00:42:15,769 --> 00:42:15,779
showing that this segmentation system
 

1887
00:42:15,779 --> 00:42:18,920
showing that this segmentation system
even though they have fee effective in

1888
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:18,930
even though they have fee effective in
 

1889
00:42:18,930 --> 00:42:21,769
even though they have fee effective in
practice but at the same time they're

1890
00:42:21,769 --> 00:42:21,779
practice but at the same time they're
 

1891
00:42:21,779 --> 00:42:24,410
practice but at the same time they're
reasonably really easily fault so the

1892
00:42:24,410 --> 00:42:24,420
reasonably really easily fault so the
 

1893
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:26,539
reasonably really easily fault so the
question is how can we defend against is

1894
00:42:26,539 --> 00:42:26,549
question is how can we defend against is
 

1895
00:42:26,549 --> 00:42:28,900
question is how can we defend against is
how we can do the more resilient

1896
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:28,910
how we can do the more resilient
 

1897
00:42:28,910 --> 00:42:33,109
how we can do the more resilient
segmentation system so um so that's what

1898
00:42:33,109 --> 00:42:33,119
segmentation system so um so that's what
 

1899
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:35,989
segmentation system so um so that's what
we try to do and in particular what we

1900
00:42:35,989 --> 00:42:35,999
we try to do and in particular what we
 

1901
00:42:35,999 --> 00:42:38,120
we try to do and in particular what we
are trying to do here is to actually try

1902
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:38,130
are trying to do here is to actually try
 

1903
00:42:38,130 --> 00:42:41,299
are trying to do here is to actually try
to leverage some natural constraints in

1904
00:42:41,299 --> 00:42:41,309
to leverage some natural constraints in
 

1905
00:42:41,309 --> 00:42:44,660
to leverage some natural constraints in
the task which we call in this case

1906
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:44,670
the task which we call in this case
 

1907
00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:48,259
the task which we call in this case
spatial consistency so the idea of this

1908
00:42:48,259 --> 00:42:48,269
spatial consistency so the idea of this
 

1909
00:42:48,269 --> 00:42:52,039
spatial consistency so the idea of this
special consistency is a following so

1910
00:42:52,039 --> 00:42:52,049
special consistency is a following so
 

1911
00:42:52,049 --> 00:42:54,019
special consistency is a following so
again we'd already know how human vision

1912
00:42:54,019 --> 00:42:54,029
again we'd already know how human vision
 

1913
00:42:54,029 --> 00:42:56,959
again we'd already know how human vision
works but in general was elicited what

1914
00:42:56,959 --> 00:42:56,969
works but in general was elicited what
 

1915
00:42:56,969 --> 00:43:00,559
works but in general was elicited what
we can see us so for example as a person

1916
00:43:00,559 --> 00:43:00,569
we can see us so for example as a person
 

1917
00:43:00,569 --> 00:43:04,519
we can see us so for example as a person
looks as the scene and we can segment

1918
00:43:04,519 --> 00:43:04,529
looks as the scene and we can segment
 

1919
00:43:04,529 --> 00:43:08,059
looks as the scene and we can segment
the scene easily and then we humans

1920
00:43:08,059 --> 00:43:08,069
the scene easily and then we humans
 

1921
00:43:08,069 --> 00:43:09,289
the scene easily and then we humans
right yes

1922
00:43:09,289 --> 00:43:09,299
right yes
 

1923
00:43:09,299 --> 00:43:12,469
right yes
and then if heels pick like a two

1924
00:43:12,469 --> 00:43:12,479
and then if heels pick like a two
 

1925
00:43:12,479 --> 00:43:14,689
and then if heels pick like a two
patches of the scene that has an

1926
00:43:14,689 --> 00:43:14,699
patches of the scene that has an
 

1927
00:43:14,699 --> 00:43:17,959
patches of the scene that has an
intersection and for humans if your

1928
00:43:17,959 --> 00:43:17,969
intersection and for humans if your
 

1929
00:43:17,969 --> 00:43:18,739
intersection and for humans if your
segments

1930
00:43:18,739 --> 00:43:18,749
segments
 

1931
00:43:18,749 --> 00:43:21,979
segments
you know like patch a and patch B and

1932
00:43:21,979 --> 00:43:21,989
you know like patch a and patch B and
 

1933
00:43:21,989 --> 00:43:23,539
you know like patch a and patch B and
then you look at the segmentation

1934
00:43:23,539 --> 00:43:23,549
then you look at the segmentation
 

1935
00:43:23,549 --> 00:43:25,819
then you look at the segmentation
results and especially if you look at

1936
00:43:25,819 --> 00:43:25,829
results and especially if you look at
 

1937
00:43:25,829 --> 00:43:27,349
results and especially if you look at
the sacrament station results at the

1938
00:43:27,349 --> 00:43:27,359
the sacrament station results at the
 

1939
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:29,989
the sacrament station results at the
intersection of the two patches there

1940
00:43:29,989 --> 00:43:29,999
intersection of the two patches there
 

1941
00:43:29,999 --> 00:43:31,430
intersection of the two patches there
should be consistent in the sense that's

1942
00:43:31,430 --> 00:43:31,440
should be consistent in the sense that's
 

1943
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:34,549
should be consistent in the sense that's
what the label know what the what the

1944
00:43:34,549 --> 00:43:34,559
what the label know what the what the
 

1945
00:43:34,559 --> 00:43:37,309
what the label know what the what the
pixels in this intersection what their

1946
00:43:37,309 --> 00:43:37,319
pixels in this intersection what their
 

1947
00:43:37,319 --> 00:43:40,309
pixels in this intersection what their
labels should be and they essentially

1948
00:43:40,309 --> 00:43:40,319
labels should be and they essentially
 

1949
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:42,319
labels should be and they essentially
from these two different patches there

1950
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:42,329
from these two different patches there
 

1951
00:43:42,329 --> 00:43:44,299
from these two different patches there
should be similar in the intersection

1952
00:43:44,299 --> 00:43:44,309
should be similar in the intersection
 

1953
00:43:44,309 --> 00:43:46,729
should be similar in the intersection
mmm so that's what we call spatial

1954
00:43:46,729 --> 00:43:46,739
mmm so that's what we call spatial
 

1955
00:43:46,739 --> 00:43:50,839
mmm so that's what we call spatial
consistency so similarly for a

1956
00:43:50,839 --> 00:43:50,849
consistency so similarly for a
 

1957
00:43:50,849 --> 00:43:53,660
consistency so similarly for a
segmentation system they should have the

1958
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:53,670
segmentation system they should have the
 

1959
00:43:53,670 --> 00:43:57,739
segmentation system they should have the
same poverty right so in the in the

1960
00:43:57,739 --> 00:43:57,749
same poverty right so in the in the
 

1961
00:43:57,749 --> 00:44:00,859
same poverty right so in the in the
image if you pick to randomly pick two

1962
00:44:00,859 --> 00:44:00,869
image if you pick to randomly pick two
 

1963
00:44:00,869 --> 00:44:03,740
image if you pick to randomly pick two
patches the has intersection

1964
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:03,750
patches the has intersection
 

1965
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:06,140
patches the has intersection
you feed each patch to the segmentation

1966
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:06,150
you feed each patch to the segmentation
 

1967
00:44:06,150 --> 00:44:09,050
you feed each patch to the segmentation
system you get a results and then when I

1968
00:44:09,050 --> 00:44:09,060
system you get a results and then when I
 

1969
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:10,040
system you get a results and then when I
look at the results

1970
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:10,050
look at the results
 

1971
00:44:10,050 --> 00:44:12,830
look at the results
in the intersection the results the

1972
00:44:12,830 --> 00:44:12,840
in the intersection the results the
 

1973
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:14,690
in the intersection the results the
segmentation results should be very

1974
00:44:14,690 --> 00:44:14,700
segmentation results should be very
 

1975
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:19,580
segmentation results should be very
similar is that so okay so logically

1976
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:19,590
similar is that so okay so logically
 

1977
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:21,140
similar is that so okay so logically
that kind of makes sense at least it's a

1978
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:21,150
that kind of makes sense at least it's a
 

1979
00:44:21,150 --> 00:44:23,930
that kind of makes sense at least it's a
compelling notion but is that how well

1980
00:44:23,930 --> 00:44:23,940
compelling notion but is that how well
 

1981
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:25,850
compelling notion but is that how well
does that work is that does that hold

1982
00:44:25,850 --> 00:44:25,860
does that work is that does that hold
 

1983
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:29,420
does that work is that does that hold
true for segmentation exactly so then in

1984
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:29,430
true for segmentation exactly so then in
 

1985
00:44:29,430 --> 00:44:32,090
true for segmentation exactly so then in
our where I can't experiment so we show

1986
00:44:32,090 --> 00:44:32,100
our where I can't experiment so we show
 

1987
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:36,020
our where I can't experiment so we show
the following so when we take second

1988
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:36,030
the following so when we take second
 

1989
00:44:36,030 --> 00:44:38,510
the following so when we take second
normal images this actually hosts pretty

1990
00:44:38,510 --> 00:44:38,520
normal images this actually hosts pretty
 

1991
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:41,060
normal images this actually hosts pretty
well for the segmentation systems that

1992
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:41,070
well for the segmentation systems that
 

1993
00:44:41,070 --> 00:44:44,330
well for the segmentation systems that
way or like did you look at like driving

1994
00:44:44,330 --> 00:44:44,340
way or like did you look at like driving
 

1995
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:48,350
way or like did you look at like driving
data sense right exactly but then this

1996
00:44:48,350 --> 00:44:48,360
data sense right exactly but then this
 

1997
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:50,510
data sense right exactly but then this
actually poses a challenge for a

1998
00:44:50,510 --> 00:44:50,520
actually poses a challenge for a
 

1999
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:53,330
actually poses a challenge for a
visceral examples because for the

2000
00:44:53,330 --> 00:44:53,340
visceral examples because for the
 

2001
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:56,060
visceral examples because for the
attacker to add perturbation to the

2002
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:56,070
attacker to add perturbation to the
 

2003
00:44:56,070 --> 00:44:59,330
attacker to add perturbation to the
image then it's easy for it to fold the

2004
00:44:59,330 --> 00:44:59,340
image then it's easy for it to fold the
 

2005
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:02,030
image then it's easy for it to fold the
segmentation system into for example for

2006
00:45:02,030 --> 00:45:02,040
segmentation system into for example for
 

2007
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:03,710
segmentation system into for example for
a particular patch are for the whole

2008
00:45:03,710 --> 00:45:03,720
a particular patch are for the whole
 

2009
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:06,140
a particular patch are for the whole
image to cause the segmentation system

2010
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:06,150
image to cause the segmentation system
 

2011
00:45:06,150 --> 00:45:09,950
image to cause the segmentation system
to create some to get to some wrong

2012
00:45:09,950 --> 00:45:09,960
to create some to get to some wrong
 

2013
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:12,110
to create some to get to some wrong
results but it's it's actually very

2014
00:45:12,110 --> 00:45:12,120
results but it's it's actually very
 

2015
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:15,620
results but it's it's actually very
difficult for the attacker to to have

2016
00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:15,630
difficult for the attacker to to have
 

2017
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:19,100
difficult for the attacker to to have
this ever serial for the example to

2018
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:19,110
this ever serial for the example to
 

2019
00:45:19,110 --> 00:45:21,380
this ever serial for the example to
satisfy the spatial consistency because

2020
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:21,390
satisfy the spatial consistency because
 

2021
00:45:21,390 --> 00:45:23,600
satisfy the spatial consistency because
these patches are randomly selected and

2022
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:23,610
these patches are randomly selected and
 

2023
00:45:23,610 --> 00:45:25,730
these patches are randomly selected and
they need to ensure that this special

2024
00:45:25,730 --> 00:45:25,740
they need to ensure that this special
 

2025
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:28,640
they need to ensure that this special
consistency works so they basically need

2026
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:28,650
consistency works so they basically need
 

2027
00:45:28,650 --> 00:45:31,610
consistency works so they basically need
to fall the segmentation system in a

2028
00:45:31,610 --> 00:45:31,620
to fall the segmentation system in a
 

2029
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:34,880
to fall the segmentation system in a
very consistent way yeah without knowing

2030
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:34,890
very consistent way yeah without knowing
 

2031
00:45:34,890 --> 00:45:36,440
very consistent way yeah without knowing
the mechanism by which you're selecting

2032
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:36,450
the mechanism by which you're selecting
 

2033
00:45:36,450 --> 00:45:38,480
the mechanism by which you're selecting
the patches or so on exactly it has to

2034
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:38,490
the patches or so on exactly it has to
 

2035
00:45:38,490 --> 00:45:41,840
the patches or so on exactly it has to
really fool the entirety of the so you

2036
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:41,850
really fool the entirety of the so you
 

2037
00:45:41,850 --> 00:45:43,610
really fool the entirety of the so you
do that to actually to be really hard

2038
00:45:43,610 --> 00:45:43,620
do that to actually to be really hard
 

2039
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:46,070
do that to actually to be really hard
for the attacker to do we tries you know

2040
00:45:46,070 --> 00:45:46,080
for the attacker to do we tries you know
 

2041
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:48,230
for the attacker to do we tries you know
the first week in the city of the art

2042
00:45:48,230 --> 00:45:48,240
the first week in the city of the art
 

2043
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:51,590
the first week in the city of the art
attacks actually showed us this defense

2044
00:45:51,590 --> 00:45:51,600
attacks actually showed us this defense
 

2045
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:53,870
attacks actually showed us this defense
methods is actually very very effective

2046
00:45:53,870 --> 00:45:53,880
methods is actually very very effective
 

2047
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:56,750
methods is actually very very effective
and this goes to I think also what I'm

2048
00:45:56,750 --> 00:45:56,760
and this goes to I think also what I'm
 

2049
00:45:56,760 --> 00:46:00,860
and this goes to I think also what I'm
most saying earlier is essentially we

2050
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:00,870
most saying earlier is essentially we
 

2051
00:46:00,870 --> 00:46:03,530
most saying earlier is essentially we
want the learning system to have tools

2052
00:46:03,530 --> 00:46:03,540
want the learning system to have tools
 

2053
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:05,900
want the learning system to have tools
to have Richardson station also to learn

2054
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:05,910
to have Richardson station also to learn
 

2055
00:46:05,910 --> 00:46:08,210
to have Richardson station also to learn
from more you can add the same

2056
00:46:08,210 --> 00:46:08,220
from more you can add the same
 

2057
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:10,130
from more you can add the same
mathematics entually to have more ways

2058
00:46:10,130 --> 00:46:10,140
mathematics entually to have more ways
 

2059
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:14,780
mathematics entually to have more ways
to check whether it's actually having

2060
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:14,790
to check whether it's actually having
 

2061
00:46:14,790 --> 00:46:17,210
to check whether it's actually having
the right prediction so for example

2062
00:46:17,210 --> 00:46:17,220
the right prediction so for example
 

2063
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:19,130
the right prediction so for example
case doing the spacial consistency check

2064
00:46:19,130 --> 00:46:19,140
case doing the spacial consistency check
 

2065
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:22,070
case doing the spacial consistency check
and also actually so that's one paper

2066
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:22,080
and also actually so that's one paper
 

2067
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:24,170
and also actually so that's one paper
though it is and then this suspicion

2068
00:46:24,170 --> 00:46:24,180
though it is and then this suspicion
 

2069
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:25,430
though it is and then this suspicion
consider this notion of consistency

2070
00:46:25,430 --> 00:46:25,440
consider this notion of consistency
 

2071
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:28,720
consider this notion of consistency
check it's not just limited to spatial

2072
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:28,730
check it's not just limited to spatial
 

2073
00:46:28,730 --> 00:46:32,420
check it's not just limited to spatial
properties it also applies to audio so

2074
00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:32,430
properties it also applies to audio so
 

2075
00:46:32,430 --> 00:46:35,270
properties it also applies to audio so
we actually had follow-up work in audio

2076
00:46:35,270 --> 00:46:35,280
we actually had follow-up work in audio
 

2077
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:37,609
we actually had follow-up work in audio
to show that this temporal consistency

2078
00:46:37,609 --> 00:46:37,619
to show that this temporal consistency
 

2079
00:46:37,619 --> 00:46:40,250
to show that this temporal consistency
can also be very effective in detecting

2080
00:46:40,250 --> 00:46:40,260
can also be very effective in detecting
 

2081
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:43,430
can also be very effective in detecting
a verse for example seeing audio XP or

2082
00:46:43,430 --> 00:46:43,440
a verse for example seeing audio XP or
 

2083
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:47,570
a verse for example seeing audio XP or
what kind of data right and then and

2084
00:46:47,570 --> 00:46:47,580
what kind of data right and then and
 

2085
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:49,430
what kind of data right and then and
then we can actually combine spatial

2086
00:46:49,430 --> 00:46:49,440
then we can actually combine spatial
 

2087
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,920
then we can actually combine spatial
consistency and temporal consistency to

2088
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:51,930
consistency and temporal consistency to
 

2089
00:46:51,930 --> 00:46:54,589
consistency and temporal consistency to
help us to develop more resilient

2090
00:46:54,589 --> 00:46:54,599
help us to develop more resilient
 

2091
00:46:54,599 --> 00:46:57,770
help us to develop more resilient
methods in video so to defend against

2092
00:46:57,770 --> 00:46:57,780
methods in video so to defend against
 

2093
00:46:57,780 --> 00:46:59,420
methods in video so to defend against
attacks forbid you awesome that's

2094
00:46:59,420 --> 00:46:59,430
attacks forbid you awesome that's
 

2095
00:46:59,430 --> 00:47:05,300
attacks forbid you awesome that's
fascinating yeah yes yes but in general

2096
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:05,310
fascinating yeah yes yes but in general
 

2097
00:47:05,310 --> 00:47:08,390
fascinating yeah yes yes but in general
in the literature and the ideas are

2098
00:47:08,390 --> 00:47:08,400
in the literature and the ideas are
 

2099
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:09,770
in the literature and the ideas are
developing the attacks and the

2100
00:47:09,770 --> 00:47:09,780
developing the attacks and the
 

2101
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:11,750
developing the attacks and the
literature is developing a defense who

2102
00:47:11,750 --> 00:47:11,760
literature is developing a defense who
 

2103
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:13,970
literature is developing a defense who
would you say is winning right now right

2104
00:47:13,970 --> 00:47:13,980
would you say is winning right now right
 

2105
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:16,880
would you say is winning right now right
now of course is attack site it's much

2106
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:16,890
now of course is attack site it's much
 

2107
00:47:16,890 --> 00:47:18,830
now of course is attack site it's much
easier to develop attacks and there are

2108
00:47:18,830 --> 00:47:18,840
easier to develop attacks and there are
 

2109
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:20,270
easier to develop attacks and there are
so many different ways to develop

2110
00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:20,280
so many different ways to develop
 

2111
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:23,420
so many different ways to develop
attacks even just us we develop so many

2112
00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:23,430
attacks even just us we develop so many
 

2113
00:47:23,430 --> 00:47:26,859
attacks even just us we develop so many
different methods for for doing attacks

2114
00:47:26,859 --> 00:47:26,869
different methods for for doing attacks
 

2115
00:47:26,869 --> 00:47:29,540
different methods for for doing attacks
and also you can do white box extracts

2116
00:47:29,540 --> 00:47:29,550
and also you can do white box extracts
 

2117
00:47:29,550 --> 00:47:31,609
and also you can do white box extracts
you can do black box attacks where

2118
00:47:31,609 --> 00:47:31,619
you can do black box attacks where
 

2119
00:47:31,619 --> 00:47:34,820
you can do black box attacks where
attacks you don't even need and the

2120
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:34,830
attacks you don't even need and the
 

2121
00:47:34,830 --> 00:47:36,620
attacks you don't even need and the
attacker doesn't even need to know the

2122
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:36,630
attacker doesn't even need to know the
 

2123
00:47:36,630 --> 00:47:39,410
attacker doesn't even need to know the
architecture of the target system and

2124
00:47:39,410 --> 00:47:39,420
architecture of the target system and
 

2125
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:42,170
architecture of the target system and
now knowing the parameters after tacky

2126
00:47:42,170 --> 00:47:42,180
now knowing the parameters after tacky
 

2127
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:45,109
now knowing the parameters after tacky
system and another so there are so many

2128
00:47:45,109 --> 00:47:45,119
system and another so there are so many
 

2129
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:47,410
system and another so there are so many
different types of attacks so the

2130
00:47:47,410 --> 00:47:47,420
different types of attacks so the
 

2131
00:47:47,420 --> 00:47:49,220
different types of attacks so the
counter-argument that people would have

2132
00:47:49,220 --> 00:47:49,230
counter-argument that people would have
 

2133
00:47:49,230 --> 00:47:51,500
counter-argument that people would have
like people that are using machine

2134
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:51,510
like people that are using machine
 

2135
00:47:51,510 --> 00:47:53,079
like people that are using machine
learning and companies they would say

2136
00:47:53,079 --> 00:47:53,089
learning and companies they would say
 

2137
00:47:53,089 --> 00:47:56,000
learning and companies they would say
sure and constrained environments and

2138
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:56,010
sure and constrained environments and
 

2139
00:47:56,010 --> 00:47:58,760
sure and constrained environments and
very specific data set when you know a

2140
00:47:58,760 --> 00:47:58,770
very specific data set when you know a
 

2141
00:47:58,770 --> 00:48:00,800
very specific data set when you know a
lot about the model you know a lot about

2142
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:00,810
lot about the model you know a lot about
 

2143
00:48:00,810 --> 00:48:03,530
lot about the model you know a lot about
the data set already you'll be able to

2144
00:48:03,530 --> 00:48:03,540
the data set already you'll be able to
 

2145
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:05,359
the data set already you'll be able to
do this attack is very nice it makes for

2146
00:48:05,359 --> 00:48:05,369
do this attack is very nice it makes for
 

2147
00:48:05,369 --> 00:48:07,040
do this attack is very nice it makes for
a nice demo it's a very interesting idea

2148
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:07,050
a nice demo it's a very interesting idea
 

2149
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:09,290
a nice demo it's a very interesting idea
but my system won't be able to be

2150
00:48:09,290 --> 00:48:09,300
but my system won't be able to be
 

2151
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:11,030
but my system won't be able to be
attacked like this so the real-world

2152
00:48:11,030 --> 00:48:11,040
attacked like this so the real-world
 

2153
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:12,740
attacked like this so the real-world
systems won't be able to be attacked

2154
00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:12,750
systems won't be able to be attacked
 

2155
00:48:12,750 --> 00:48:15,140
systems won't be able to be attacked
like this that's like that's that's

2156
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:15,150
like this that's like that's that's
 

2157
00:48:15,150 --> 00:48:17,030
like this that's like that's that's
another hope there's actually a lot

2158
00:48:17,030 --> 00:48:17,040
another hope there's actually a lot
 

2159
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:20,329
another hope there's actually a lot
harder to attack real-world systems can

2160
00:48:20,329 --> 00:48:20,339
harder to attack real-world systems can
 

2161
00:48:20,339 --> 00:48:22,670
harder to attack real-world systems can
you talk to that is it I how hard is it

2162
00:48:22,670 --> 00:48:22,680
you talk to that is it I how hard is it
 

2163
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:24,770
you talk to that is it I how hard is it
to attack real-world systems yes I

2164
00:48:24,770 --> 00:48:24,780
to attack real-world systems yes I
 

2165
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:27,140
to attack real-world systems yes I
wouldn't call that I hope I think yeah

2166
00:48:27,140 --> 00:48:27,150
wouldn't call that I hope I think yeah
 

2167
00:48:27,150 --> 00:48:31,099
wouldn't call that I hope I think yeah
it's more alpha wishful thinking I try

2168
00:48:31,099 --> 00:48:31,109
it's more alpha wishful thinking I try
 

2169
00:48:31,109 --> 00:48:35,089
it's more alpha wishful thinking I try
trying to be lucky and so actually in

2170
00:48:35,089 --> 00:48:35,099
trying to be lucky and so actually in
 

2171
00:48:35,099 --> 00:48:38,089
trying to be lucky and so actually in
our recent work my students and

2172
00:48:38,089 --> 00:48:38,099
our recent work my students and
 

2173
00:48:38,099 --> 00:48:40,430
our recent work my students and
collaborators has shown some very

2174
00:48:40,430 --> 00:48:40,440
collaborators has shown some very
 

2175
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:43,269
collaborators has shown some very
effective attacks on real-world systems

2176
00:48:43,269 --> 00:48:43,279
effective attacks on real-world systems
 

2177
00:48:43,279 --> 00:48:51,039
effective attacks on real-world systems
for example Google Translate and

2178
00:48:51,039 --> 00:48:51,049

 

2179
00:48:51,049 --> 00:48:55,670

translation api's so in this work we

2180
00:48:55,670 --> 00:48:55,680
translation api's so in this work we
 

2181
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:57,739
translation api's so in this work we
showed so far I talked about other

2182
00:48:57,739 --> 00:48:57,749
showed so far I talked about other
 

2183
00:48:57,749 --> 00:49:01,839
showed so far I talked about other
examples mostly in the vision category

2184
00:49:01,839 --> 00:49:01,849
examples mostly in the vision category
 

2185
00:49:01,849 --> 00:49:04,819
examples mostly in the vision category
and of course adversary' examples also

2186
00:49:04,819 --> 00:49:04,829
and of course adversary' examples also
 

2187
00:49:04,829 --> 00:49:07,849
and of course adversary' examples also
work in other domains as well for

2188
00:49:07,849 --> 00:49:07,859
work in other domains as well for
 

2189
00:49:07,859 --> 00:49:11,089
work in other domains as well for
example in natural language so so in

2190
00:49:11,089 --> 00:49:11,099
example in natural language so so in
 

2191
00:49:11,099 --> 00:49:13,420
example in natural language so so in
this work my students and collaborators

2192
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:13,430
this work my students and collaborators
 

2193
00:49:13,430 --> 00:49:17,979
this work my students and collaborators
have shown that also one we can actually

2194
00:49:17,979 --> 00:49:17,989
have shown that also one we can actually
 

2195
00:49:17,989 --> 00:49:22,489
have shown that also one we can actually
very easily steal the model from for

2196
00:49:22,489 --> 00:49:22,499
very easily steal the model from for
 

2197
00:49:22,499 --> 00:49:25,370
very easily steal the model from for
example Google Translate but just two

2198
00:49:25,370 --> 00:49:25,380
example Google Translate but just two
 

2199
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:28,220
example Google Translate but just two
inquiries from right through the api's

2200
00:49:28,220 --> 00:49:28,230
inquiries from right through the api's
 

2201
00:49:28,230 --> 00:49:30,940
inquiries from right through the api's
and then we can train an imitation model

2202
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:30,950
and then we can train an imitation model
 

2203
00:49:30,950 --> 00:49:34,579
and then we can train an imitation model
ourselves using the curries and then

2204
00:49:34,579 --> 00:49:34,589
ourselves using the curries and then
 

2205
00:49:34,589 --> 00:49:37,489
ourselves using the curries and then
once we and also the imitation model can

2206
00:49:37,489 --> 00:49:37,499
once we and also the imitation model can
 

2207
00:49:37,499 --> 00:49:41,150
once we and also the imitation model can
be very very effective and essentially

2208
00:49:41,150 --> 00:49:41,160
be very very effective and essentially
 

2209
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:44,660
be very very effective and essentially
have achieving similar performance as a

2210
00:49:44,660 --> 00:49:44,670
have achieving similar performance as a
 

2211
00:49:44,670 --> 00:49:46,670
have achieving similar performance as a
target model and then once we have the

2212
00:49:46,670 --> 00:49:46,680
target model and then once we have the
 

2213
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:49,190
target model and then once we have the
imitation model we can then try to

2214
00:49:49,190 --> 00:49:49,200
imitation model we can then try to
 

2215
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:51,529
imitation model we can then try to
create adversarial examples on these

2216
00:49:51,529 --> 00:49:51,539
create adversarial examples on these
 

2217
00:49:51,539 --> 00:49:54,549
create adversarial examples on these
imitation models so for example and

2218
00:49:54,549 --> 00:49:54,559
imitation models so for example and
 

2219
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:58,609
imitation models so for example and
giving a you know in a work here was one

2220
00:49:58,609 --> 00:49:58,619
giving a you know in a work here was one
 

2221
00:49:58,619 --> 00:50:00,979
giving a you know in a work here was one
example is translating from English to

2222
00:50:00,979 --> 00:50:00,989
example is translating from English to
 

2223
00:50:00,989 --> 00:50:03,620
example is translating from English to
German we can give it a sentence saying

2224
00:50:03,620 --> 00:50:03,630
German we can give it a sentence saying
 

2225
00:50:03,630 --> 00:50:06,620
German we can give it a sentence saying
for example I'm feeling freezing it's

2226
00:50:06,620 --> 00:50:06,630
for example I'm feeling freezing it's
 

2227
00:50:06,630 --> 00:50:12,200
for example I'm feeling freezing it's
like 6 Fahrenheit and then translating

2228
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:12,210
like 6 Fahrenheit and then translating
 

2229
00:50:12,210 --> 00:50:14,749
like 6 Fahrenheit and then translating
German and then we can actually generate

2230
00:50:14,749 --> 00:50:14,759
German and then we can actually generate
 

2231
00:50:14,759 --> 00:50:17,779
German and then we can actually generate
adversary examples that creates a target

2232
00:50:17,779 --> 00:50:17,789
adversary examples that creates a target
 

2233
00:50:17,789 --> 00:50:20,239
adversary examples that creates a target
translation by very small perturbation

2234
00:50:20,239 --> 00:50:20,249
translation by very small perturbation
 

2235
00:50:20,249 --> 00:50:23,299
translation by very small perturbation
so in this case I say we want to change

2236
00:50:23,299 --> 00:50:23,309
so in this case I say we want to change
 

2237
00:50:23,309 --> 00:50:26,690
so in this case I say we want to change
the translation itself and six

2238
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:26,700
the translation itself and six
 

2239
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:31,339
the translation itself and six
Fahrenheit to 21 Southeast's and in this

2240
00:50:31,339 --> 00:50:31,349
Fahrenheit to 21 Southeast's and in this
 

2241
00:50:31,349 --> 00:50:32,839
Fahrenheit to 21 Southeast's and in this
particular example actually which has

2242
00:50:32,839 --> 00:50:32,849
particular example actually which has
 

2243
00:50:32,849 --> 00:50:36,859
particular example actually which has
changed 6 to 7 in the original sentence

2244
00:50:36,859 --> 00:50:36,869
changed 6 to 7 in the original sentence
 

2245
00:50:36,869 --> 00:50:38,989
changed 6 to 7 in the original sentence
that's the only change we made it caused

2246
00:50:38,989 --> 00:50:38,999
that's the only change we made it caused
 

2247
00:50:38,999 --> 00:50:42,750
that's the only change we made it caused
the translation to change

2248
00:50:42,750 --> 00:50:42,760
the translation to change
 

2249
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:46,570
the translation to change
from the six Fahrenheit into 21 that's

2250
00:50:46,570 --> 00:50:46,580
from the six Fahrenheit into 21 that's
 

2251
00:50:46,580 --> 00:50:48,670
from the six Fahrenheit into 21 that's
terrible and then and then so this

2252
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:48,680
terrible and then and then so this
 

2253
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:52,150
terrible and then and then so this
example we created this example from our

2254
00:50:52,150 --> 00:50:52,160
example we created this example from our
 

2255
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:54,700
example we created this example from our
imitation model imitation and then this

2256
00:50:54,700 --> 00:50:54,710
imitation model imitation and then this
 

2257
00:50:54,710 --> 00:50:58,060
imitation model imitation and then this
work actually transfers to the Google

2258
00:50:58,060 --> 00:50:58,070
work actually transfers to the Google
 

2259
00:50:58,070 --> 00:50:59,920
work actually transfers to the Google
Translate so the attacks that work on

2260
00:50:59,920 --> 00:50:59,930
Translate so the attacks that work on
 

2261
00:50:59,930 --> 00:51:02,170
Translate so the attacks that work on
the imitation model in some cases at

2262
00:51:02,170 --> 00:51:02,180
the imitation model in some cases at
 

2263
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:04,810
the imitation model in some cases at
least transfer to the original right

2264
00:51:04,810 --> 00:51:04,820
least transfer to the original right
 

2265
00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:07,150
least transfer to the original right
model that's incredible and terrifying

2266
00:51:07,150 --> 00:51:07,160
model that's incredible and terrifying
 

2267
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:10,840
model that's incredible and terrifying
okay that's amazing work and that shows

2268
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:10,850
okay that's amazing work and that shows
 

2269
00:51:10,850 --> 00:51:13,240
okay that's amazing work and that shows
us again real world systems actually can

2270
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:13,250
us again real world systems actually can
 

2271
00:51:13,250 --> 00:51:16,060
us again real world systems actually can
be easily fooled and in our previous

2272
00:51:16,060 --> 00:51:16,070
be easily fooled and in our previous
 

2273
00:51:16,070 --> 00:51:17,770
be easily fooled and in our previous
work we also showed these type of black

2274
00:51:17,770 --> 00:51:17,780
work we also showed these type of black
 

2275
00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:20,590
work we also showed these type of black
box attacks can be effective cloud to

2276
00:51:20,590 --> 00:51:20,600
box attacks can be effective cloud to
 

2277
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:25,300
box attacks can be effective cloud to
the vision API as well so that's for

2278
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:25,310
the vision API as well so that's for
 

2279
00:51:25,310 --> 00:51:27,460
the vision API as well so that's for
natural language and for vision let's

2280
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:27,470
natural language and for vision let's
 

2281
00:51:27,470 --> 00:51:29,320
natural language and for vision let's
let's talk about another space that

2282
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:29,330
let's talk about another space that
 

2283
00:51:29,330 --> 00:51:31,000
let's talk about another space that
people have some concern about which is

2284
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:31,010
people have some concern about which is
 

2285
00:51:31,010 --> 00:51:33,640
people have some concern about which is
autonomous driving is sort of security

2286
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:33,650
autonomous driving is sort of security
 

2287
00:51:33,650 --> 00:51:35,950
autonomous driving is sort of security
concerns that's another real world

2288
00:51:35,950 --> 00:51:35,960
concerns that's another real world
 

2289
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:40,960
concerns that's another real world
system so do you have should people be

2290
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:40,970
system so do you have should people be
 

2291
00:51:40,970 --> 00:51:43,690
system so do you have should people be
worried about adversarial machine

2292
00:51:43,690 --> 00:51:43,700
worried about adversarial machine
 

2293
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:46,300
worried about adversarial machine
learning attacks in the context of

2294
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:46,310
learning attacks in the context of
 

2295
00:51:46,310 --> 00:51:49,000
learning attacks in the context of
autonomous vehicles that use like Tesla

2296
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:49,010
autonomous vehicles that use like Tesla
 

2297
00:51:49,010 --> 00:51:51,010
autonomous vehicles that use like Tesla
autopilot for example they uses vision

2298
00:51:51,010 --> 00:51:51,020
autopilot for example they uses vision
 

2299
00:51:51,020 --> 00:51:53,740
autopilot for example they uses vision
as a primary sensor for perceiving the

2300
00:51:53,740 --> 00:51:53,750
as a primary sensor for perceiving the
 

2301
00:51:53,750 --> 00:51:55,720
as a primary sensor for perceiving the
world and navigating in that world what

2302
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:55,730
world and navigating in that world what
 

2303
00:51:55,730 --> 00:51:57,880
world and navigating in that world what
do you think from your stop sign work in

2304
00:51:57,880 --> 00:51:57,890
do you think from your stop sign work in
 

2305
00:51:57,890 --> 00:52:00,760
do you think from your stop sign work in
the physical world should people be

2306
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:00,770
the physical world should people be
 

2307
00:52:00,770 --> 00:52:03,220
the physical world should people be
worried how hard is that attack so

2308
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:03,230
worried how hard is that attack so
 

2309
00:52:03,230 --> 00:52:05,770
worried how hard is that attack so
actually there has already been like

2310
00:52:05,770 --> 00:52:05,780
actually there has already been like
 

2311
00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:08,440
actually there has already been like
that there have always been and like a

2312
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:08,450
that there have always been and like a
 

2313
00:52:08,450 --> 00:52:10,510
that there have always been and like a
research shown that's for example

2314
00:52:10,510 --> 00:52:10,520
research shown that's for example
 

2315
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:12,670
research shown that's for example
actually even with Tesla like if you put

2316
00:52:12,670 --> 00:52:12,680
actually even with Tesla like if you put
 

2317
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:15,700
actually even with Tesla like if you put
a few stickers on the road it can't

2318
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:15,710
a few stickers on the road it can't
 

2319
00:52:15,710 --> 00:52:18,040
a few stickers on the road it can't
actually wide range in certain ways it

2320
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:18,050
actually wide range in certain ways it
 

2321
00:52:18,050 --> 00:52:21,820
actually wide range in certain ways it
can for that that's right but I don't

2322
00:52:21,820 --> 00:52:21,830
can for that that's right but I don't
 

2323
00:52:21,830 --> 00:52:23,920
can for that that's right but I don't
think it's actually been I'm not I might

2324
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:23,930
think it's actually been I'm not I might
 

2325
00:52:23,930 --> 00:52:25,180
think it's actually been I'm not I might
not be familiar but I don't think it's

2326
00:52:25,180 --> 00:52:25,190
not be familiar but I don't think it's
 

2327
00:52:25,190 --> 00:52:27,340
not be familiar but I don't think it's
been done on physical world's physical

2328
00:52:27,340 --> 00:52:27,350
been done on physical world's physical
 

2329
00:52:27,350 --> 00:52:29,380
been done on physical world's physical
roads yet meaning I think is with the

2330
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:29,390
roads yet meaning I think is with the
 

2331
00:52:29,390 --> 00:52:31,990
roads yet meaning I think is with the
projector in front of the Tesla so it's

2332
00:52:31,990 --> 00:52:32,000
projector in front of the Tesla so it's
 

2333
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,360
projector in front of the Tesla so it's
a it's a physical suppose you're on the

2334
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:34,370
a it's a physical suppose you're on the
 

2335
00:52:34,370 --> 00:52:36,250
a it's a physical suppose you're on the
other side of the side of the sensor but

2336
00:52:36,250 --> 00:52:36,260
other side of the side of the sensor but
 

2337
00:52:36,260 --> 00:52:38,460
other side of the side of the sensor but
you're not in still the physical world

2338
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:38,470
you're not in still the physical world
 

2339
00:52:38,470 --> 00:52:40,690
you're not in still the physical world
the the question is whether it's

2340
00:52:40,690 --> 00:52:40,700
the the question is whether it's
 

2341
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:43,120
the the question is whether it's
possible to orchestrate attacks that

2342
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:43,130
possible to orchestrate attacks that
 

2343
00:52:43,130 --> 00:52:45,270
possible to orchestrate attacks that
work in the actual physical like

2344
00:52:45,270 --> 00:52:45,280
work in the actual physical like
 

2345
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:48,160
work in the actual physical like
end-to-end attacks like not just a

2346
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:48,170
end-to-end attacks like not just a
 

2347
00:52:48,170 --> 00:52:49,990
end-to-end attacks like not just a
demonstration of the concept but

2348
00:52:49,990 --> 00:52:50,000
demonstration of the concept but
 

2349
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,390
demonstration of the concept but
thinking is it possible on the highway

2350
00:52:52,390 --> 00:52:52,400
thinking is it possible on the highway
 

2351
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:54,520
thinking is it possible on the highway
to control a Tesla

2352
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:54,530
to control a Tesla
 

2353
00:52:54,530 --> 00:52:56,140
to control a Tesla
that kind of idea I think there are two

2354
00:52:56,140 --> 00:52:56,150
that kind of idea I think there are two
 

2355
00:52:56,150 --> 00:52:58,090
that kind of idea I think there are two
separate questions one is the

2356
00:52:58,090 --> 00:52:58,100
separate questions one is the
 

2357
00:52:58,100 --> 00:52:59,920
separate questions one is the
feasibility of the attack and I'm

2358
00:52:59,920 --> 00:52:59,930
feasibility of the attack and I'm
 

2359
00:52:59,930 --> 00:53:03,310
feasibility of the attack and I'm
hundred percent confident that's the is

2360
00:53:03,310 --> 00:53:03,320
hundred percent confident that's the is
 

2361
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:05,590
hundred percent confident that's the is
possible and there's a separate question

2362
00:53:05,590 --> 00:53:05,600
possible and there's a separate question
 

2363
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:07,840
possible and there's a separate question
whether you know someone will actually

2364
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:07,850
whether you know someone will actually
 

2365
00:53:07,850 --> 00:53:12,370
whether you know someone will actually
go you know deploy that attack I I hope

2366
00:53:12,370 --> 00:53:12,380
go you know deploy that attack I I hope
 

2367
00:53:12,380 --> 00:53:15,880
go you know deploy that attack I I hope
people do not do that yeah two separate

2368
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:15,890
people do not do that yeah two separate
 

2369
00:53:15,890 --> 00:53:16,360
people do not do that yeah two separate
questions

2370
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:16,370
questions
 

2371
00:53:16,370 --> 00:53:18,490
questions
so the question on the word feasibility

2372
00:53:18,490 --> 00:53:18,500
so the question on the word feasibility
 

2373
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:21,430
so the question on the word feasibility
the clarified feasibility means it's

2374
00:53:21,430 --> 00:53:21,440
the clarified feasibility means it's
 

2375
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:25,000
the clarified feasibility means it's
possible it doesn't say how hard it is

2376
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:25,010
possible it doesn't say how hard it is
 

2377
00:53:25,010 --> 00:53:29,320
possible it doesn't say how hard it is
because in there to implement it so sort

2378
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:29,330
because in there to implement it so sort
 

2379
00:53:29,330 --> 00:53:32,140
because in there to implement it so sort
of the the barrier like how how much of

2380
00:53:32,140 --> 00:53:32,150
of the the barrier like how how much of
 

2381
00:53:32,150 --> 00:53:33,760
of the the barrier like how how much of
a heist it has to be like how many

2382
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:33,770
a heist it has to be like how many
 

2383
00:53:33,770 --> 00:53:35,650
a heist it has to be like how many
people have to be involved what is the

2384
00:53:35,650 --> 00:53:35,660
people have to be involved what is the
 

2385
00:53:35,660 --> 00:53:37,120
people have to be involved what is the
probability of success that kind of

2386
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:37,130
probability of success that kind of
 

2387
00:53:37,130 --> 00:53:40,450
probability of success that kind of
stuff and coupled with how many evil

2388
00:53:40,450 --> 00:53:40,460
stuff and coupled with how many evil
 

2389
00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:41,800
stuff and coupled with how many evil
people there are in the world that would

2390
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:41,810
people there are in the world that would
 

2391
00:53:41,810 --> 00:53:43,780
people there are in the world that would
attempt such an attack right that but

2392
00:53:43,780 --> 00:53:43,790
attempt such an attack right that but
 

2393
00:53:43,790 --> 00:53:48,610
attempt such an attack right that but
the to my question is is it sort of at

2394
00:53:48,610 --> 00:53:48,620
the to my question is is it sort of at
 

2395
00:53:48,620 --> 00:53:51,400
the to my question is is it sort of at
you know I talked to you a mosque and a

2396
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:51,410
you know I talked to you a mosque and a
 

2397
00:53:51,410 --> 00:53:53,350
you know I talked to you a mosque and a
same question he says it's not a problem

2398
00:53:53,350 --> 00:53:53,360
same question he says it's not a problem
 

2399
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:55,150
same question he says it's not a problem
it's very difficult to do in the real

2400
00:53:55,150 --> 00:53:55,160
it's very difficult to do in the real
 

2401
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:57,790
it's very difficult to do in the real
world that this won't be a problem he

2402
00:53:57,790 --> 00:53:57,800
world that this won't be a problem he
 

2403
00:53:57,800 --> 00:53:59,080
world that this won't be a problem he
dismissed it as a problem for

2404
00:53:59,080 --> 00:53:59,090
dismissed it as a problem for
 

2405
00:53:59,090 --> 00:54:01,240
dismissed it as a problem for

2409
00:54:03,860 --> 00:54:06,580
course he happens to be involved with
the company so he has to say that but I

2410
00:54:06,580 --> 00:54:06,590
the company so he has to say that but I
 

2411
00:54:06,590 --> 00:54:08,560
the company so he has to say that but I
mean they may linger and a little longer

2412
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:08,570
mean they may linger and a little longer
 

2413
00:54:08,570 --> 00:54:13,150

do you see you where does your

2414
00:54:13,150 --> 00:54:13,160
do you see you where does your
 

2415
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:15,190
do you see you where does your
confidence that it's feasible come from

2418
00:54:18,070 --> 00:54:18,080
and what's your intuition how people
 

2419
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:19,720
and what's your intuition how people
should be worried and how we might be do

2420
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:19,730
should be worried and how we might be do
 

2421
00:54:19,730 --> 00:54:21,940
should be worried and how we might be do
how people should defend against it how

00:54:21,940 --> 00:54:21,950
how people should defend against it how
 

2423
00:54:21,950 --> 00:54:25,000
how people should defend against it how

legal companies should defend against

2426
00:54:27,150 --> 00:54:27,160
legal companies should defend against
 

2427
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:29,830
legal companies should defend against
sensory based attacks on whether on

sensory based attacks on whether on
 

2429
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:31,990
sensory based attacks on whether on

00:54:31,990 --> 00:54:32,000
lidar or on vision or so on
 

2431
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,760
lidar or on vision or so on
and also even for light actually that

2432
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:33,770
and also even for light actually that
 

2433
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:38,650
and also even for light actually that
has been researched shown even like it's

2434
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:38,660
has been researched shown even like it's
 

2435
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:41,050
has been researched shown even like it's
really important to pause there's really

2436
00:54:41,050 --> 00:54:41,060
really important to pause there's really
 

2437
00:54:41,060 --> 00:54:43,930
really important to pause there's really
nice demonstrations that it's possible

2438
00:54:43,930 --> 00:54:43,940
nice demonstrations that it's possible
 

2439
00:54:43,940 --> 00:54:46,210
nice demonstrations that it's possible
to do but there are so many pieces that

2440
00:54:46,210 --> 00:54:46,220
to do but there are so many pieces that
 

2441
00:54:46,220 --> 00:54:50,620
to do but there are so many pieces that
it's kind of like it's it's kind of in

2442
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:50,630
it's kind of like it's it's kind of in
 

2443
00:54:50,630 --> 00:54:52,900
it's kind of like it's it's kind of in
the lab now it's in the physical world

2444
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:52,910
the lab now it's in the physical world
 

2445
00:54:52,910 --> 00:54:54,670
the lab now it's in the physical world
meaning it's in the physical space the

2446
00:54:54,670 --> 00:54:54,680
meaning it's in the physical space the
 

2447
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:57,490
meaning it's in the physical space the
attacks but it's very like you have to

2448
00:54:57,490 --> 00:54:57,500
attacks but it's very like you have to
 

2449
00:54:57,500 --> 00:55:00,420
attacks but it's very like you have to
control a lot of things to pull it off

2450
00:55:00,420 --> 00:55:00,430
control a lot of things to pull it off
 

2451
00:55:00,430 --> 00:55:03,340
control a lot of things to pull it off
it's like the difference between opening

2452
00:55:03,340 --> 00:55:03,350
it's like the difference between opening
 

2453
00:55:03,350 --> 00:55:05,950
it's like the difference between opening
a safe when you have it and you have

2454
00:55:05,950 --> 00:55:05,960
a safe when you have it and you have
 

2455
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:08,750
a safe when you have it and you have
unlimited time and you can work on it

2456
00:55:08,750 --> 00:55:08,760
unlimited time and you can work on it
 

2457
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:12,050
unlimited time and you can work on it
like breaking into like the crown

2458
00:55:12,050 --> 00:55:12,060
like breaking into like the crown
 

2459
00:55:12,060 --> 00:55:13,790
like breaking into like the crown
stealing the crown jewels or whatever

2460
00:55:13,790 --> 00:55:13,800
stealing the crown jewels or whatever
 

2461
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:19,040
stealing the crown jewels or whatever
right in terms of how real these attacks

2462
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:19,050
right in terms of how real these attacks
 

2463
00:55:19,050 --> 00:55:21,350
right in terms of how real these attacks
can be one way to look at it is that

2464
00:55:21,350 --> 00:55:21,360
can be one way to look at it is that
 

2465
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:23,140
can be one way to look at it is that
actually you don't even need any

2466
00:55:23,140 --> 00:55:23,150
actually you don't even need any
 

2467
00:55:23,150 --> 00:55:25,880
actually you don't even need any
sophisticated attacks already we have

2468
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:25,890
sophisticated attacks already we have
 

2469
00:55:25,890 --> 00:55:29,330
sophisticated attacks already we have
seen in the many real-world examples

2470
00:55:29,330 --> 00:55:29,340
seen in the many real-world examples
 

2471
00:55:29,340 --> 00:55:32,570
seen in the many real-world examples
incidents where showing that the the

2472
00:55:32,570 --> 00:55:32,580
incidents where showing that the the
 

2473
00:55:32,580 --> 00:55:34,460
incidents where showing that the the
vehicle was making the wrong decision

2474
00:55:34,460 --> 00:55:34,470
vehicle was making the wrong decision
 

2475
00:55:34,470 --> 00:55:38,510
vehicle was making the wrong decision
wrong decision without attacks right and

2476
00:55:38,510 --> 00:55:38,520
wrong decision without attacks right and
 

2477
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:41,330
wrong decision without attacks right and
this is also like so far with many talks

2478
00:55:41,330 --> 00:55:41,340
this is also like so far with many talks
 

2479
00:55:41,340 --> 00:55:43,360
this is also like so far with many talks
about work in this adversarial setting

2480
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:43,370
about work in this adversarial setting
 

2481
00:55:43,370 --> 00:55:45,860
about work in this adversarial setting
showing that today's learning system

2482
00:55:45,860 --> 00:55:45,870
showing that today's learning system
 

2483
00:55:45,870 --> 00:55:47,660
showing that today's learning system
they are so vulnerable to the

2484
00:55:47,660 --> 00:55:47,670
they are so vulnerable to the
 

2485
00:55:47,670 --> 00:55:49,700
they are so vulnerable to the
adversarial setting but at the same time

2486
00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:49,710
adversarial setting but at the same time
 

2487
00:55:49,710 --> 00:55:51,890
adversarial setting but at the same time
actually we also know that even in

2488
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:51,900
actually we also know that even in
 

2489
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:53,990
actually we also know that even in
natural settings these learning systems

2490
00:55:53,990 --> 00:55:54,000
natural settings these learning systems
 

2491
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,970
natural settings these learning systems
they don't generalize well and hence

2492
00:55:55,970 --> 00:55:55,980
they don't generalize well and hence
 

2493
00:55:55,980 --> 00:55:58,520
they don't generalize well and hence
they can really misbehave and there's

2494
00:55:58,520 --> 00:55:58,530
they can really misbehave and there's
 

2495
00:55:58,530 --> 00:56:01,730
they can really misbehave and there's
certain situations like what we have

2496
00:56:01,730 --> 00:56:01,740
certain situations like what we have
 

2497
00:56:01,740 --> 00:56:03,860
certain situations like what we have
seen and hence I think using that as an

2498
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:03,870
seen and hence I think using that as an
 

2499
00:56:03,870 --> 00:56:07,910
seen and hence I think using that as an
example okay so you should can be really

2500
00:56:07,910 --> 00:56:07,920
example okay so you should can be really
 

2501
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:09,800
example okay so you should can be really
they can be real but so there's two

2502
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:09,810
they can be real but so there's two
 

2503
00:56:09,810 --> 00:56:13,370
they can be real but so there's two
cases one is something it's like

2504
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:13,380
cases one is something it's like
 

2505
00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:15,110
cases one is something it's like
perturbations can make the system is

2506
00:56:15,110 --> 00:56:15,120
perturbations can make the system is
 

2507
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:18,200
perturbations can make the system is
behaved versus make the system do one

2508
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:18,210
behaved versus make the system do one
 

2509
00:56:18,210 --> 00:56:20,150
behaved versus make the system do one
specific thing that the attacker wants

2510
00:56:20,150 --> 00:56:20,160
specific thing that the attacker wants
 

2511
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:24,530
specific thing that the attacker wants
as you said targeted that seems you know

2512
00:56:24,530 --> 00:56:24,540
as you said targeted that seems you know
 

2513
00:56:24,540 --> 00:56:27,680
as you said targeted that seems you know
that seems to be very difficult like a

2514
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:27,690
that seems to be very difficult like a
 

2515
00:56:27,690 --> 00:56:30,770
that seems to be very difficult like a
extra level of difficult step in the in

2516
00:56:30,770 --> 00:56:30,780
extra level of difficult step in the in
 

2517
00:56:30,780 --> 00:56:33,020
extra level of difficult step in the in
the real world but from the perspective

2518
00:56:33,020 --> 00:56:33,030
the real world but from the perspective
 

2519
00:56:33,030 --> 00:56:35,870
the real world but from the perspective
of the passenger of the car here I don't

2520
00:56:35,870 --> 00:56:35,880
of the passenger of the car here I don't
 

2521
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:38,600
of the passenger of the car here I don't
think it matters either way whether it's

2522
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:38,610
think it matters either way whether it's
 

2523
00:56:38,610 --> 00:56:41,330
think it matters either way whether it's
yeah it's misbehavior or a targeted

2524
00:56:41,330 --> 00:56:41,340
yeah it's misbehavior or a targeted
 

2525
00:56:41,340 --> 00:56:43,730
yeah it's misbehavior or a targeted
attack okay and also and that's why I

2526
00:56:43,730 --> 00:56:43,740
attack okay and also and that's why I
 

2527
00:56:43,740 --> 00:56:45,680
attack okay and also and that's why I
was also saying earlier like if one

2528
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:45,690
was also saying earlier like if one
 

2529
00:56:45,690 --> 00:56:48,860
was also saying earlier like if one
defense is this multi modal defense and

2530
00:56:48,860 --> 00:56:48,870
defense is this multi modal defense and
 

2531
00:56:48,870 --> 00:56:50,870
defense is this multi modal defense and
more of these consistent checks and so

2532
00:56:50,870 --> 00:56:50,880
more of these consistent checks and so
 

2533
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:52,940
more of these consistent checks and so
on so in the future I think also it's

2534
00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:52,950
on so in the future I think also it's
 

2535
00:56:52,950 --> 00:56:54,760
on so in the future I think also it's
important that for these autonomous

2536
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:54,770
important that for these autonomous
 

2537
00:56:54,770 --> 00:56:57,500
important that for these autonomous
vehicles the right they have lots of

2538
00:56:57,500 --> 00:56:57,510
vehicles the right they have lots of
 

2539
00:56:57,510 --> 00:56:59,360
vehicles the right they have lots of
different sensors and they should be

2540
00:56:59,360 --> 00:56:59,370
different sensors and they should be
 

2541
00:56:59,370 --> 00:57:02,780
different sensors and they should be
combining all these sensory readings to

2542
00:57:02,780 --> 00:57:02,790
combining all these sensory readings to
 

2543
00:57:02,790 --> 00:57:05,870
combining all these sensory readings to
arrive at the decision and the

2544
00:57:05,870 --> 00:57:05,880
arrive at the decision and the
 

2545
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:08,000
arrive at the decision and the
interpretation of the world and so on

2546
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:08,010
interpretation of the world and so on
 

2547
00:57:08,010 --> 00:57:10,580
interpretation of the world and so on
and the more of these sensory inputs

2548
00:57:10,580 --> 00:57:10,590
and the more of these sensory inputs
 

2549
00:57:10,590 --> 00:57:13,490
and the more of these sensory inputs
they use and the better they combine the

2550
00:57:13,490 --> 00:57:13,500
they use and the better they combine the
 

2551
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:15,350
they use and the better they combine the
sensory inputs the heart rate is going

2552
00:57:15,350 --> 00:57:15,360
sensory inputs the heart rate is going
 

2553
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:17,930
sensory inputs the heart rate is going
to be attacked and hence I think that is

2554
00:57:17,930 --> 00:57:17,940
to be attacked and hence I think that is
 

2555
00:57:17,940 --> 00:57:20,390
to be attacked and hence I think that is
a very important direction for us to

2556
00:57:20,390 --> 00:57:20,400
a very important direction for us to
 

2557
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:22,190
a very important direction for us to
move towards so more

2558
00:57:22,190 --> 00:57:22,200
move towards so more
 

2559
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:24,290
move towards so more

2564
00:57:30,859 --> 00:57:30,869
ultrasonic sound even so all of those
 

2565
00:57:30,869 --> 00:57:33,020
ultrasonic sound even so all of those
rights right exactly

2566
00:57:33,020 --> 00:57:33,030
rights right exactly
 

2567
00:57:33,030 --> 00:57:35,660
rights right exactly
so another thing another part of your

2568
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:35,670
so another thing another part of your
 

2569
00:57:35,670 --> 00:57:38,359
so another thing another part of your
work has been in the space of privacy

2570
00:57:38,359 --> 00:57:38,369
work has been in the space of privacy
 

2571
00:57:38,369 --> 00:57:41,950
work has been in the space of privacy
and that too can be seen as a kind of

2572
00:57:41,950 --> 00:57:41,960
and that too can be seen as a kind of
 

2573
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:44,450
and that too can be seen as a kind of
security vulnerability as social

2574
00:57:44,450 --> 00:57:44,460
security vulnerability as social
 

2575
00:57:44,460 --> 00:57:47,060
security vulnerability as social
thinking of data as a thing that should

2576
00:57:47,060 --> 00:57:47,070
thinking of data as a thing that should
 

2577
00:57:47,070 --> 00:57:49,670
thinking of data as a thing that should
be protected and the vulnerabilities to

2578
00:57:49,670 --> 00:57:49,680
be protected and the vulnerabilities to
 

2579
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:53,990
be protected and the vulnerabilities to
data is vulnerability is essentially the

2580
00:57:53,990 --> 00:57:54,000
data is vulnerability is essentially the
 

2581
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,310
data is vulnerability is essentially the
thing that you want to protect is the

2582
00:57:55,310 --> 00:57:55,320
thing that you want to protect is the
 

2583
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:58,370
thing that you want to protect is the
privacy of that data so what do you see

2584
00:57:58,370 --> 00:57:58,380
privacy of that data so what do you see
 

2585
00:57:58,380 --> 00:58:00,079
privacy of that data so what do you see
as the main vulnerabilities in the

2586
00:58:00,079 --> 00:58:00,089
as the main vulnerabilities in the
 

2587
00:58:00,089 --> 00:58:02,240
as the main vulnerabilities in the
privacy of data and how do we protect it

2588
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:02,250
privacy of data and how do we protect it
 

2589
00:58:02,250 --> 00:58:04,430
privacy of data and how do we protect it
right so you see in security we actually

2590
00:58:04,430 --> 00:58:04,440
right so you see in security we actually
 

2591
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:08,000
right so you see in security we actually
talk about essentially two in this case

2592
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:08,010
talk about essentially two in this case
 

2593
00:58:08,010 --> 00:58:10,400
talk about essentially two in this case
two different properties one is

2594
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:10,410
two different properties one is
 

2595
00:58:10,410 --> 00:58:13,670
two different properties one is
integrity and one is confidentiality so

2596
00:58:13,670 --> 00:58:13,680
integrity and one is confidentiality so
 

2597
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:17,319
integrity and one is confidentiality so
what we have been talking earlier is

2598
00:58:17,319 --> 00:58:17,329
what we have been talking earlier is
 

2599
00:58:17,329 --> 00:58:20,870
what we have been talking earlier is
essentially the integrity of the

2600
00:58:20,870 --> 00:58:20,880
essentially the integrity of the
 

2601
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:22,490
essentially the integrity of the
integrity property after the new system

2602
00:58:22,490 --> 00:58:22,500
integrity property after the new system
 

2603
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:24,859
integrity property after the new system
how to make sure that the new system is

2604
00:58:24,859 --> 00:58:24,869
how to make sure that the new system is
 

2605
00:58:24,869 --> 00:58:28,400
how to make sure that the new system is
giving the right prediction for example

2606
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:28,410
giving the right prediction for example
 

2607
00:58:28,410 --> 00:58:31,670
giving the right prediction for example
and privacy centuries on the other side

2608
00:58:31,670 --> 00:58:31,680
and privacy centuries on the other side
 

2609
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:34,400
and privacy centuries on the other side
is about confidentiality of the system

2610
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:34,410
is about confidentiality of the system
 

2611
00:58:34,410 --> 00:58:38,030
is about confidentiality of the system
is how attackers can when the attacker

2612
00:58:38,030 --> 00:58:38,040
is how attackers can when the attacker
 

2613
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:41,809
is how attackers can when the attacker
is compromise the confidentiality of the

2614
00:58:41,809 --> 00:58:41,819
is compromise the confidentiality of the
 

2615
00:58:41,819 --> 00:58:43,640
is compromise the confidentiality of the
system that's when the attacker is still

2616
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:43,650
system that's when the attacker is still
 

2617
00:58:43,650 --> 00:58:46,910
system that's when the attacker is still
sensitive information and right about

2618
00:58:46,910 --> 00:58:46,920
sensitive information and right about
 

2619
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:49,430
sensitive information and right about
individuals and so on it's really clean

2620
00:58:49,430 --> 00:58:49,440
individuals and so on it's really clean
 

2621
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:49,910
individuals and so on it's really clean
does it

2622
00:58:49,910 --> 00:58:49,920
does it
 

2623
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:52,190
does it
those are great terms integrity and

2624
00:58:52,190 --> 00:58:52,200
those are great terms integrity and
 

2625
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:56,630
those are great terms integrity and
confidentiality right so how what are

2626
00:58:56,630 --> 00:58:56,640
confidentiality right so how what are
 

2627
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:58,460
confidentiality right so how what are
the main vulnerabilities to privacy

2628
00:58:58,460 --> 00:58:58,470
the main vulnerabilities to privacy
 

2629
00:58:58,470 --> 00:59:00,559
the main vulnerabilities to privacy
would you say and how do we protect

2630
00:59:00,559 --> 00:59:00,569
would you say and how do we protect
 

2631
00:59:00,569 --> 00:59:02,859
would you say and how do we protect
against it like what what are the main

2632
00:59:02,859 --> 00:59:02,869
against it like what what are the main
 

2633
00:59:02,869 --> 00:59:05,359
against it like what what are the main
spaces and problems that you think about

2634
00:59:05,359 --> 00:59:05,369
spaces and problems that you think about
 

2635
00:59:05,369 --> 00:59:08,170
spaces and problems that you think about
in the context of privacy right so and

2636
00:59:08,170 --> 00:59:08,180
in the context of privacy right so and
 

2637
00:59:08,180 --> 00:59:10,700
in the context of privacy right so and
especially in the machine learning

2638
00:59:10,700 --> 00:59:10,710
especially in the machine learning
 

2639
00:59:10,710 --> 00:59:14,480
especially in the machine learning
setting and so in this case as we know

2640
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:14,490
setting and so in this case as we know
 

2641
00:59:14,490 --> 00:59:17,569
setting and so in this case as we know
that how the process goes is that we

2642
00:59:17,569 --> 00:59:17,579
that how the process goes is that we
 

2643
00:59:17,579 --> 00:59:20,900
that how the process goes is that we
have the training data and then the

2644
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:20,910
have the training data and then the
 

2645
00:59:20,910 --> 00:59:23,630
have the training data and then the
machining system a-train's from the

2646
00:59:23,630 --> 00:59:23,640
machining system a-train's from the
 

2647
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:25,819
machining system a-train's from the
screening data and then buta model and

2648
00:59:25,819 --> 00:59:25,829
screening data and then buta model and
 

2649
00:59:25,829 --> 00:59:28,880
screening data and then buta model and
then they say our inputs are given to

2650
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:28,890
then they say our inputs are given to
 

2651
00:59:28,890 --> 00:59:31,430
then they say our inputs are given to
the model to inference time to try to

2652
00:59:31,430 --> 00:59:31,440
the model to inference time to try to
 

2653
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:34,910
the model to inference time to try to
get prediction and so on so then in this

2654
00:59:34,910 --> 00:59:34,920
get prediction and so on so then in this
 

2655
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:35,990
get prediction and so on so then in this
case the

2656
00:59:35,990 --> 00:59:36,000
case the
 

2657
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,230
case the
privacy concerns that we have is

2658
00:59:38,230 --> 00:59:38,240
privacy concerns that we have is
 

2659
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:42,020
privacy concerns that we have is
typically about privacy of the data in

2660
00:59:42,020 --> 00:59:42,030
typically about privacy of the data in
 

2661
00:59:42,030 --> 00:59:43,790
typically about privacy of the data in
the training data because that's

2662
00:59:43,790 --> 00:59:43,800
the training data because that's
 

2663
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:45,440
the training data because that's
essentially the private information so

2664
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:45,450
essentially the private information so
 

2665
00:59:45,450 --> 00:59:50,170
essentially the private information so
and it's really important because

2666
00:59:50,170 --> 00:59:50,180
and it's really important because
 

2667
00:59:50,180 --> 00:59:53,090
and it's really important because
oftentimes the training data can be very

2668
00:59:53,090 --> 00:59:53,100
oftentimes the training data can be very
 

2669
00:59:53,100 --> 00:59:55,340
oftentimes the training data can be very
sensitive it can be your financial data

2670
00:59:55,340 --> 00:59:55,350
sensitive it can be your financial data
 

2671
00:59:55,350 --> 01:00:00,170
sensitive it can be your financial data
how data are like in our case it's the

2672
01:00:00,170 --> 01:00:00,180
how data are like in our case it's the
 

2673
01:00:00,180 --> 01:00:02,570
how data are like in our case it's the
sensors deployed in real world

2674
01:00:02,570 --> 01:00:02,580
sensors deployed in real world
 

2675
01:00:02,580 --> 01:00:04,850
sensors deployed in real world
environments and so on and all this can

2676
01:00:04,850 --> 01:00:04,860
environments and so on and all this can
 

2677
01:00:04,860 --> 01:00:07,070
environments and so on and all this can
be collecting very sensitive information

2678
01:00:07,070 --> 01:00:07,080
be collecting very sensitive information
 

2679
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:10,850
be collecting very sensitive information
and other sensitive information gets the

2680
01:00:10,850 --> 01:00:10,860
and other sensitive information gets the
 

2681
01:00:10,860 --> 01:00:13,520
and other sensitive information gets the
first into the new system and trains and

2682
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:13,530
first into the new system and trains and
 

2683
01:00:13,530 --> 01:00:16,850
first into the new system and trains and
as we know these neural networks they

2684
01:00:16,850 --> 01:00:16,860
as we know these neural networks they
 

2685
01:00:16,860 --> 01:00:20,270
as we know these neural networks they
can have really high capacity and they

2686
01:00:20,270 --> 01:00:20,280
can have really high capacity and they
 

2687
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:23,570
can have really high capacity and they
actually can remember a lot and hence

2688
01:00:23,570 --> 01:00:23,580
actually can remember a lot and hence
 

2689
01:00:23,580 --> 01:00:26,180
actually can remember a lot and hence
just from the learning the learned model

2690
01:00:26,180 --> 01:00:26,190
just from the learning the learned model
 

2691
01:00:26,190 --> 01:00:29,660
just from the learning the learned model
in the end actually attackers can

2692
01:00:29,660 --> 01:00:29,670
in the end actually attackers can
 

2693
01:00:29,670 --> 01:00:32,410
in the end actually attackers can
potentially infra information about

2694
01:00:32,410 --> 01:00:32,420
potentially infra information about
 

2695
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:37,340
potentially infra information about
their original training data set so the

2696
01:00:37,340 --> 01:00:37,350
their original training data set so the
 

2697
01:00:37,350 --> 01:00:38,810
their original training data set so the
thing you're trying to protect yeah is

2698
01:00:38,810 --> 01:00:38,820
thing you're trying to protect yeah is
 

2699
01:00:38,820 --> 01:00:41,960
thing you're trying to protect yeah is
the confidentiality of the training data

2700
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:41,970
the confidentiality of the training data
 

2701
01:00:41,970 --> 01:00:44,330
the confidentiality of the training data
and so what are the methods for doing

2702
01:00:44,330 --> 01:00:44,340
and so what are the methods for doing
 

2703
01:00:44,340 --> 01:00:45,560
and so what are the methods for doing
that would you say what what are the

2704
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:45,570
that would you say what what are the
 

2705
01:00:45,570 --> 01:00:48,050
that would you say what what are the
different ways that can be done and also

2706
01:00:48,050 --> 01:00:48,060
different ways that can be done and also
 

2707
01:00:48,060 --> 01:00:49,940
different ways that can be done and also
we can talk about essentially how they

2708
01:00:49,940 --> 01:00:49,950
we can talk about essentially how they
 

2709
01:00:49,950 --> 01:00:52,670
we can talk about essentially how they
attackin may try to relay information

2710
01:00:52,670 --> 01:00:52,680
attackin may try to relay information
 

2711
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:55,880
attackin may try to relay information
from the right so so and also there are

2712
01:00:55,880 --> 01:00:55,890
from the right so so and also there are
 

2713
01:00:55,890 --> 01:00:58,670
from the right so so and also there are
different types of attacks so in certain

2714
01:00:58,670 --> 01:00:58,680
different types of attacks so in certain
 

2715
01:00:58,680 --> 01:01:01,310
different types of attacks so in certain
cases again like in white box attacks we

2716
01:01:01,310 --> 01:01:01,320
cases again like in white box attacks we
 

2717
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:03,380
cases again like in white box attacks we
can say that the attacker I should get

2718
01:01:03,380 --> 01:01:03,390
can say that the attacker I should get
 

2719
01:01:03,390 --> 01:01:05,420
can say that the attacker I should get
to see the parameters of the model and

2720
01:01:05,420 --> 01:01:05,430
to see the parameters of the model and
 

2721
01:01:05,430 --> 01:01:08,180
to see the parameters of the model and
then from that the a smile attacker

2722
01:01:08,180 --> 01:01:08,190
then from that the a smile attacker
 

2723
01:01:08,190 --> 01:01:10,250
then from that the a smile attacker
potential you can try to figure out

2724
01:01:10,250 --> 01:01:10,260
potential you can try to figure out
 

2725
01:01:10,260 --> 01:01:13,820
potential you can try to figure out
information about the training data sets

2726
01:01:13,820 --> 01:01:13,830
information about the training data sets
 

2727
01:01:13,830 --> 01:01:15,740
information about the training data sets
they can try to figure out what type of

2728
01:01:15,740 --> 01:01:15,750
they can try to figure out what type of
 

2729
01:01:15,750 --> 01:01:18,140
they can try to figure out what type of
theta has been in the training data sets

2730
01:01:18,140 --> 01:01:18,150
theta has been in the training data sets
 

2731
01:01:18,150 --> 01:01:21,530
theta has been in the training data sets
and sometimes they can tell like whether

2732
01:01:21,530 --> 01:01:21,540
and sometimes they can tell like whether
 

2733
01:01:21,540 --> 01:01:25,280
and sometimes they can tell like whether
a person has been a particular person's

2734
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:25,290
a person has been a particular person's
 

2735
01:01:25,290 --> 01:01:27,590
a person has been a particular person's
data point has been used in the training

2736
01:01:27,590 --> 01:01:27,600
data point has been used in the training
 

2737
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:30,590
data point has been used in the training
data sets so white box meaning you have

2738
01:01:30,590 --> 01:01:30,600
data sets so white box meaning you have
 

2739
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:32,510
data sets so white box meaning you have
access to the parameters are saying your

2740
01:01:32,510 --> 01:01:32,520
access to the parameters are saying your
 

2741
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:35,090
access to the parameters are saying your
network and so that you're saying that

2742
01:01:35,090 --> 01:01:35,100
network and so that you're saying that
 

2743
01:01:35,100 --> 01:01:37,490
network and so that you're saying that
it's some given that information as

2744
01:01:37,490 --> 01:01:37,500
it's some given that information as
 

2745
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:39,650
it's some given that information as
possible to some so I can give you some

2746
01:01:39,650 --> 01:01:39,660
possible to some so I can give you some
 

2747
01:01:39,660 --> 01:01:41,390
possible to some so I can give you some
examples and another type of attack

2748
01:01:41,390 --> 01:01:41,400
examples and another type of attack
 

2749
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:44,750
examples and another type of attack
which is even easier to carry out is now

2750
01:01:44,750 --> 01:01:44,760
which is even easier to carry out is now
 

2751
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:47,960
which is even easier to carry out is now
the web box model is more offer just a

2752
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:47,970
the web box model is more offer just a
 

2753
01:01:47,970 --> 01:01:49,220
the web box model is more offer just a
query model where the

2754
01:01:49,220 --> 01:01:49,230
query model where the
 

2755
01:01:49,230 --> 01:01:51,770
query model where the
hacker only gets to carry the machine in

2756
01:01:51,770 --> 01:01:51,780
hacker only gets to carry the machine in
 

2757
01:01:51,780 --> 01:01:53,450
hacker only gets to carry the machine in
your model and then try to steal

2758
01:01:53,450 --> 01:01:53,460
your model and then try to steal
 

2759
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:55,880
your model and then try to steal
sensitive information in the original

2760
01:01:55,880 --> 01:01:55,890
sensitive information in the original
 

2761
01:01:55,890 --> 01:01:58,490
sensitive information in the original
training data so right so I can give you

2762
01:01:58,490 --> 01:01:58,500
training data so right so I can give you
 

2763
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:02,300
training data so right so I can give you
an example in this case training a

2764
01:02:02,300 --> 01:02:02,310
an example in this case training a
 

2765
01:02:02,310 --> 01:02:05,720
an example in this case training a
language model so in now I work in

2766
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:05,730
language model so in now I work in
 

2767
01:02:05,730 --> 01:02:07,130
language model so in now I work in
collaboration with the researchers from

collaboration with the researchers from
 

2769
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:09,710
collaboration with the researchers from
Google we actually studied the following

2770
01:02:09,710 --> 01:02:09,720
Google we actually studied the following
 

2771
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:12,680
Google we actually studied the following
question so so however the question is

2772
01:02:12,680 --> 01:02:12,690
question so so however the question is
 

2773
01:02:12,690 --> 01:02:15,920
question so so however the question is
as we mentioned the neural networks can

2774
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:15,930
as we mentioned the neural networks can
 

2775
01:02:15,930 --> 01:02:18,170
as we mentioned the neural networks can
have very high capacity and they could

2776
01:02:18,170 --> 01:02:18,180
have very high capacity and they could
 

2777
01:02:18,180 --> 01:02:20,690
have very high capacity and they could
be remembering a lot from the training

2778
01:02:20,690 --> 01:02:20,700
be remembering a lot from the training
 

2779
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:22,550
be remembering a lot from the training
process then the question is can

2780
01:02:22,550 --> 01:02:22,560
process then the question is can
 

2781
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:25,820
process then the question is can
attacker actually exploit this and try

2782
01:02:25,820 --> 01:02:25,830
attacker actually exploit this and try
 

2783
01:02:25,830 --> 01:02:27,890
attacker actually exploit this and try
to actually extract sensitive

2784
01:02:27,890 --> 01:02:27,900
to actually extract sensitive
 

2785
01:02:27,900 --> 01:02:29,630
to actually extract sensitive
information in the original training

2786
01:02:29,630 --> 01:02:29,640
information in the original training
 

2787
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:32,840
information in the original training
dataset through just securing the

2788
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:32,850
dataset through just securing the
 

2789
01:02:32,850 --> 01:02:35,780
dataset through just securing the
learned model without even knowing the

2790
01:02:35,780 --> 01:02:35,790
learned model without even knowing the
 

2791
01:02:35,790 --> 01:02:37,730
learned model without even knowing the
parameters of the model like the details

2792
01:02:37,730 --> 01:02:37,740
parameters of the model like the details
 

2793
01:02:37,740 --> 01:02:40,220
parameters of the model like the details
of the model are the actual model after

2794
01:02:40,220 --> 01:02:40,230
of the model are the actual model after
 

2795
01:02:40,230 --> 01:02:44,900
of the model are the actual model after
model and so on so so that's the that's

2796
01:02:44,900 --> 01:02:44,910
model and so on so so that's the that's
 

2797
01:02:44,910 --> 01:02:46,570
model and so on so so that's the that's
the question we set how to exploit and

2798
01:02:46,570 --> 01:02:46,580
the question we set how to exploit and
 

2799
01:02:46,580 --> 01:02:49,730
the question we set how to exploit and
in one of the case studies we showed the

2800
01:02:49,730 --> 01:02:49,740
in one of the case studies we showed the
 

2801
01:02:49,740 --> 01:02:51,950
in one of the case studies we showed the
following so we trained the language

2802
01:02:51,950 --> 01:02:51,960
following so we trained the language
 

2803
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:55,160
following so we trained the language
model over an email data sets it's

2804
01:02:55,160 --> 01:02:55,170

social security numbers and credit card

2810
01:03:03,770 --> 01:03:03,780
social security numbers and credit card
 

2811
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:06,560
social security numbers and credit card
numbers so we treat the language model

2812
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:06,570
numbers so we treat the language model
 

2813
01:03:06,570 --> 01:03:09,320
numbers so we treat the language model
over the city cells and then we showed

2814
01:03:09,320 --> 01:03:09,330
over the city cells and then we showed
 

2815
01:03:09,330 --> 01:03:12,170
over the city cells and then we showed
that an attacker by devising some new

2816
01:03:12,170 --> 01:03:12,180
that an attacker by devising some new
 

2817
01:03:12,180 --> 01:03:14,960
that an attacker by devising some new
attacks by just occurring the language

2818
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:14,970
attacks by just occurring the language

the model the attacker actually can
 

2823
01:03:21,170 --> 01:03:25,400
the model the attacker actually can
extract the original social security

2824
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:25,410
extract the original social security
 

2825
01:03:25,410 --> 01:03:27,109
extract the original social security
numbers and credit card numbers that

2826
01:03:27,109 --> 01:03:27,119
numbers and credit card numbers that
 

2827
01:03:27,119 --> 01:03:30,830
numbers and credit card numbers that
were in the original training so get the

2828
01:03:30,830 --> 01:03:30,840
were in the original training so get the
 

2829
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:32,420
were in the original training so get the
most sensitive personally identifiable

2830
01:03:32,420 --> 01:03:32,430
most sensitive personally identifiable
 

2831
01:03:32,430 --> 01:03:35,090
most sensitive personally identifiable
information from the dataset I'm just

2832
01:03:35,090 --> 01:03:35,100
information from the dataset I'm just
 

2833
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:44,109
information from the dataset I'm just
worrying it that's why even as we trie

2834
01:03:44,109 --> 01:03:44,119
worrying it that's why even as we trie
 

2835
01:03:44,119 --> 01:03:46,670
worrying it that's why even as we trie
machine mania models we have to be

2836
01:03:46,670 --> 01:03:46,680
machine mania models we have to be
 

2837
01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:49,910
machine mania models we have to be
really careful with the protecting users

2838
01:03:49,910 --> 01:03:49,920
really careful with the protecting users
 

2839
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:52,340
really careful with the protecting users
data promise me so what are the

2840
01:03:52,340 --> 01:03:52,350
data promise me so what are the
 

2841
01:03:52,350 --> 01:03:54,230
data promise me so what are the
mechanisms for protecting is there as

2842
01:03:54,230 --> 01:03:54,240
mechanisms for protecting is there as
 

2843
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:56,150
mechanisms for protecting is there as
their as their hopeful so if there's

2844
01:03:56,150 --> 01:03:56,160
their as their hopeful so if there's
 

2845
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:58,430
their as their hopeful so if there's
been recent work or non-differential

2846
01:03:58,430 --> 01:03:58,440
been recent work or non-differential
 

2847
01:03:58,440 --> 01:04:01,520
been recent work or non-differential
privacy for example that that that

2848
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:01,530
privacy for example that that that
 

2849
01:04:01,530 --> 01:04:02,960
privacy for example that that that
provides some hope but

2850
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:02,970
provides some hope but
 

2851
01:04:02,970 --> 01:04:05,300
provides some hope but
describe some of these that's actually

2852
01:04:05,300 --> 01:04:05,310
describe some of these that's actually
 

2853
01:04:05,310 --> 01:04:07,780
describe some of these that's actually
right so that's also our finding is that

2854
01:04:07,780 --> 01:04:07,790
right so that's also our finding is that
 

2855
01:04:07,790 --> 01:04:11,569
right so that's also our finding is that
by actually we show that in this

2856
01:04:11,569 --> 01:04:11,579
by actually we show that in this
 

2857
01:04:11,579 --> 01:04:13,460
by actually we show that in this
particular case we actually have a good

2858
01:04:13,460 --> 01:04:13,470
particular case we actually have a good
 

2859
01:04:13,470 --> 01:04:15,770
particular case we actually have a good
defense for the Quarian case for the

2860
01:04:15,770 --> 01:04:15,780
defense for the Quarian case for the
 

2861
01:04:15,780 --> 01:04:17,150
defense for the Quarian case for the
coin it's a language model language

2862
01:04:17,150 --> 01:04:17,160
coin it's a language model language
 

2863
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:21,109
coin it's a language model language
model k so instead of just training a

2864
01:04:21,109 --> 01:04:21,119
model k so instead of just training a
 

2865
01:04:21,119 --> 01:04:23,809
model k so instead of just training a
vanilla language model instead if we

2866
01:04:23,809 --> 01:04:23,819
vanilla language model instead if we
 

2867
01:04:23,819 --> 01:04:25,730
vanilla language model instead if we
train a differentially private language

2868
01:04:25,730 --> 01:04:25,740
train a differentially private language
 

2869
01:04:25,740 --> 01:04:28,910
train a differentially private language
model then we can still achieve similar

2870
01:04:28,910 --> 01:04:28,920
model then we can still achieve similar
 

2871
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:32,180
model then we can still achieve similar
utility but at the same time we can

2872
01:04:32,180 --> 01:04:32,190
utility but at the same time we can
 

2873
01:04:32,190 --> 01:04:34,700
utility but at the same time we can
actually significantly enhance the

2874
01:04:34,700 --> 01:04:34,710
actually significantly enhance the
 

2875
01:04:34,710 --> 01:04:37,880
actually significantly enhance the
privacy protection and stay after

2876
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:37,890
privacy protection and stay after
 

2877
01:04:37,890 --> 01:04:41,630
privacy protection and stay after
learned model and our proposed attacks

2878
01:04:41,630 --> 01:04:41,640
learned model and our proposed attacks
 

2879
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:44,800
learned model and our proposed attacks
actually are no longer effective and

2880
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:44,810
actually are no longer effective and
 

2881
01:04:44,810 --> 01:04:47,240
actually are no longer effective and
differential privacy is the mechanism of

2882
01:04:47,240 --> 01:04:47,250
differential privacy is the mechanism of
 

2883
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:50,359
differential privacy is the mechanism of
adding some noise by which you then have

2884
01:04:50,359 --> 01:04:50,369
adding some noise by which you then have
 

2885
01:04:50,369 --> 01:04:52,809
adding some noise by which you then have
some guarantees on the inability to

2886
01:04:52,809 --> 01:04:52,819
some guarantees on the inability to
 

2887
01:04:52,819 --> 01:04:56,150
some guarantees on the inability to
figure out the the person the the

2888
01:04:56,150 --> 01:04:56,160
figure out the the person the the
 

2889
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:58,370
figure out the the person the the
presence of a human of a particular

2890
01:04:58,370 --> 01:04:58,380
presence of a human of a particular
 

2891
01:04:58,380 --> 01:05:00,829
presence of a human of a particular
person in the data set so right so in

2892
01:05:00,829 --> 01:05:00,839
person in the data set so right so in
 

2893
01:05:00,839 --> 01:05:02,120
person in the data set so right so in
this particular case what the

2894
01:05:02,120 --> 01:05:02,130
this particular case what the
 

2895
01:05:02,130 --> 01:05:05,210
this particular case what the
differential privacy mechanism does is

2896
01:05:05,210 --> 01:05:05,220
differential privacy mechanism does is
 

2897
01:05:05,220 --> 01:05:09,710
differential privacy mechanism does is
that it actually as participation in the

2898
01:05:09,710 --> 01:05:09,720
that it actually as participation in the
 

2899
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:12,020
that it actually as participation in the
training process as we know during the

2900
01:05:12,020 --> 01:05:12,030
training process as we know during the
 

2901
01:05:12,030 --> 01:05:13,520
training process as we know during the
training process we are learning the

2902
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:13,530
training process we are learning the
 

2903
01:05:13,530 --> 01:05:17,300
training process we are learning the
model well doing gradient updates the

2904
01:05:17,300 --> 01:05:17,310
model well doing gradient updates the
 

2905
01:05:17,310 --> 01:05:20,290
model well doing gradient updates the
way the updates and so on and

2906
01:05:20,290 --> 01:05:20,300
way the updates and so on and
 

2907
01:05:20,300 --> 01:05:22,160
way the updates and so on and
essentially differential privacy

2908
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:22,170
essentially differential privacy
 

2909
01:05:22,170 --> 01:05:24,819
essentially differential privacy
differentially privates

2910
01:05:24,819 --> 01:05:24,829
differentially privates
 

2911
01:05:24,829 --> 01:05:27,650
differentially privates
machining algorithm in this case we'll

2912
01:05:27,650 --> 01:05:27,660
machining algorithm in this case we'll
 

2913
01:05:27,660 --> 01:05:30,620
machining algorithm in this case we'll
be adding noise and a diverse

2914
01:05:30,620 --> 01:05:30,630
be adding noise and a diverse
 

2915
01:05:30,630 --> 01:05:33,829
be adding noise and a diverse
perturbation during this training to

2916
01:05:33,829 --> 01:05:33,839
perturbation during this training to
 

2917
01:05:33,839 --> 01:05:35,210
perturbation during this training to
some aspect of the training process

2918
01:05:35,210 --> 01:05:35,220
some aspect of the training process
 

2919
01:05:35,220 --> 01:05:39,020
some aspect of the training process
right so then the finely trained ruining

2920
01:05:39,020 --> 01:05:39,030
right so then the finely trained ruining
 

2921
01:05:39,030 --> 01:05:41,510
right so then the finely trained ruining
the learned model is differentially

2922
01:05:41,510 --> 01:05:41,520
the learned model is differentially
 

2923
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:44,720
the learned model is differentially
privates and so I can put can enhance

2924
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:44,730
privates and so I can put can enhance
 

2925
01:05:44,730 --> 01:05:47,510
privates and so I can put can enhance
the privacy protection so okay so that's

2926
01:05:47,510 --> 01:05:47,520
the privacy protection so okay so that's
 

2927
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:50,470
the privacy protection so okay so that's
the attacks and the defense of privacy

2928
01:05:50,470 --> 01:05:50,480
the attacks and the defense of privacy
 

2929
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:53,410
the attacks and the defense of privacy
you also talked about ownership of data

2930
01:05:53,410 --> 01:05:53,420
you also talked about ownership of data
 

2931
01:05:53,420 --> 01:05:55,400
you also talked about ownership of data
so this this is a really interesting

2932
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:55,410
so this this is a really interesting
 

2933
01:05:55,410 --> 01:05:58,160
so this this is a really interesting
idea that we get to use many services

2934
01:05:58,160 --> 01:05:58,170
idea that we get to use many services
 

2935
01:05:58,170 --> 01:06:02,440
idea that we get to use many services
online for seemingly for free by

2936
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:02,450
online for seemingly for free by
 

2937
01:06:02,450 --> 01:06:05,059
online for seemingly for free by
essentially sort of a lot of companies

2938
01:06:05,059 --> 01:06:05,069
essentially sort of a lot of companies
 

2939
01:06:05,069 --> 01:06:06,740
essentially sort of a lot of companies
are funded through advertisement and

2940
01:06:06,740 --> 01:06:06,750
are funded through advertisement and
 

2941
01:06:06,750 --> 01:06:08,900
are funded through advertisement and
what that means is the advertisement

2942
01:06:08,900 --> 01:06:08,910
what that means is the advertisement
 

2943
01:06:08,910 --> 01:06:11,270
what that means is the advertisement
works exceptionally well because the

2944
01:06:11,270 --> 01:06:11,280
works exceptionally well because the
 

2945
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:12,530
works exceptionally well because the
companies are able to access our

2946
01:06:12,530 --> 01:06:12,540
companies are able to access our
 

2947
01:06:12,540 --> 01:06:14,359
companies are able to access our
personal data so they know which

2948
01:06:14,359 --> 01:06:14,369
personal data so they know which
 

2949
01:06:14,369 --> 01:06:16,020
personal data so they know which
advertisement to service

2950
01:06:16,020 --> 01:06:16,030
advertisement to service
 

2951
01:06:16,030 --> 01:06:19,110
advertisement to service
to do targeted advertisements so on so

2952
01:06:19,110 --> 01:06:19,120
to do targeted advertisements so on so
 

2953
01:06:19,120 --> 01:06:22,020
to do targeted advertisements so on so
can you maybe talk about the this you

2954
01:06:22,020 --> 01:06:22,030
can you maybe talk about the this you
 

2955
01:06:22,030 --> 01:06:26,240
can you maybe talk about the this you
have some nice paintings of the future

2956
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:26,250
have some nice paintings of the future
 

2957
01:06:26,250 --> 01:06:29,390
have some nice paintings of the future
philosophically speaking future where

2958
01:06:29,390 --> 01:06:29,400
philosophically speaking future where
 

2959
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:31,350
philosophically speaking future where
people can have a little bit more

2960
01:06:31,350 --> 01:06:31,360
people can have a little bit more
 

2961
01:06:31,360 --> 01:06:33,240
people can have a little bit more
control of their data by owning and

2962
01:06:33,240 --> 01:06:33,250
control of their data by owning and
 

2963
01:06:33,250 --> 01:06:36,540
control of their data by owning and
maybe understanding the value of their

2964
01:06:36,540 --> 01:06:36,550
maybe understanding the value of their
 

2965
01:06:36,550 --> 01:06:39,750
maybe understanding the value of their
data and being able to sort of monetize

2966
01:06:39,750 --> 01:06:39,760
data and being able to sort of monetize
 

2967
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:42,660
data and being able to sort of monetize
it in a more explicit way as opposed to

2968
01:06:42,660 --> 01:06:42,670
it in a more explicit way as opposed to
 

2969
01:06:42,670 --> 01:06:44,490
it in a more explicit way as opposed to
the implicit way that is currently done

2970
01:06:44,490 --> 01:06:44,500
the implicit way that is currently done
 

2971
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:47,070
the implicit way that is currently done
yeah I think this is a fascinating topic

2972
01:06:47,070 --> 01:06:47,080
yeah I think this is a fascinating topic
 

2973
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:51,330
yeah I think this is a fascinating topic
and also a really complex topic right I

2974
01:06:51,330 --> 01:06:51,340
and also a really complex topic right I
 

2975
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:53,430
and also a really complex topic right I
think there are these natural questions

2976
01:06:53,430 --> 01:06:53,440
think there are these natural questions
 

2977
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:59,550
think there are these natural questions
who should be owning the data and and so

2978
01:06:59,550 --> 01:06:59,560
who should be owning the data and and so
 

2979
01:06:59,560 --> 01:07:03,900
who should be owning the data and and so
I can tell one analogy and so for

2980
01:07:03,900 --> 01:07:03,910
I can tell one analogy and so for
 

2981
01:07:03,910 --> 01:07:06,960
I can tell one analogy and so for
example for physical properties like

2982
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:06,970
example for physical properties like
 

2983
01:07:06,970 --> 01:07:11,220
example for physical properties like
your house and so on so really um this

2984
01:07:11,220 --> 01:07:11,230
your house and so on so really um this
 

2985
01:07:11,230 --> 01:07:13,980
your house and so on so really um this
notion of property rights it's not just

2986
01:07:13,980 --> 01:07:13,990
notion of property rights it's not just
 

2987
01:07:13,990 --> 01:07:17,100
notion of property rights it's not just
you know like it's not like from day one

2988
01:07:17,100 --> 01:07:17,110
you know like it's not like from day one
 

2989
01:07:17,110 --> 01:07:19,190
you know like it's not like from day one
we knew that's there should be like this

2990
01:07:19,190 --> 01:07:19,200
we knew that's there should be like this
 

2991
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:21,930
we knew that's there should be like this
clear notion of ownership of properties

2992
01:07:21,930 --> 01:07:21,940
clear notion of ownership of properties
 

2993
01:07:21,940 --> 01:07:25,920
clear notion of ownership of properties
and having enforcement for this and so

2994
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:25,930
and having enforcement for this and so
 

2995
01:07:25,930 --> 01:07:31,230
and having enforcement for this and so
actually people have shown that this

2996
01:07:31,230 --> 01:07:31,240
actually people have shown that this
 

2997
01:07:31,240 --> 01:07:34,080
actually people have shown that this
establishment and enforcement of

2998
01:07:34,080 --> 01:07:34,090
establishment and enforcement of
 

2999
01:07:34,090 --> 01:07:36,870
establishment and enforcement of
property rights has been a main driver

3000
01:07:36,870 --> 01:07:36,880
property rights has been a main driver
 

3001
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:42,390
property rights has been a main driver
for the for the for the economy earlier

3002
01:07:42,390 --> 01:07:42,400
for the for the for the economy earlier
 

3003
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:46,020
for the for the for the economy earlier
and that actually really propelled the

3004
01:07:46,020 --> 01:07:46,030
and that actually really propelled the
 

3005
01:07:46,030 --> 01:07:50,220
and that actually really propelled the
economic growth and even right in the

3006
01:07:50,220 --> 01:07:50,230
economic growth and even right in the
 

3007
01:07:50,230 --> 01:07:52,920
economic growth and even right in the
earlier stage so throughout the history

3008
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:52,930
earlier stage so throughout the history
 

3009
01:07:52,930 --> 01:07:54,690
earlier stage so throughout the history
of the development of the United States

3010
01:07:54,690 --> 01:07:54,700
of the development of the United States
 

3011
01:07:54,700 --> 01:07:57,240
of the development of the United States
there or actually just civilization the

3012
01:07:57,240 --> 01:07:57,250
there or actually just civilization the
 

3013
01:07:57,250 --> 01:07:59,310
there or actually just civilization the
idea of property rights that you can own

3014
01:07:59,310 --> 01:07:59,320
idea of property rights that you can own
 

3015
01:07:59,320 --> 01:08:03,660
idea of property rights that you can own
property enforcement days is you should

3016
01:08:03,660 --> 01:08:03,670
property enforcement days is you should
 

3017
01:08:03,670 --> 01:08:05,610
property enforcement days is you should
know rights like governmental like

3018
01:08:05,610 --> 01:08:05,620
know rights like governmental like
 

3019
01:08:05,620 --> 01:08:08,910
know rights like governmental like
enforcement of this actually has been a

3020
01:08:08,910 --> 01:08:08,920
enforcement of this actually has been a
 

3021
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:12,420
enforcement of this actually has been a
key driver for economic growth and there

3022
01:08:12,420 --> 01:08:12,430
key driver for economic growth and there
 

3023
01:08:12,430 --> 01:08:16,260
key driver for economic growth and there
have been even research proposals saying

3024
01:08:16,260 --> 01:08:16,270
have been even research proposals saying
 

3025
01:08:16,270 --> 01:08:18,120
have been even research proposals saying
that for a lot of the developing

3026
01:08:18,120 --> 01:08:18,130
that for a lot of the developing
 

3027
01:08:18,130 --> 01:08:22,950
that for a lot of the developing
countries and they you know essentially

3028
01:08:22,950 --> 01:08:22,960
countries and they you know essentially
 

3029
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:26,760
countries and they you know essentially
the challenging growth is not actually

3030
01:08:26,760 --> 01:08:26,770
the challenging growth is not actually
 

3031
01:08:26,770 --> 01:08:29,260
the challenging growth is not actually
due to the lack of capital its

3032
01:08:29,260 --> 01:08:29,270
due to the lack of capital its
 

3033
01:08:29,270 --> 01:08:33,160
due to the lack of capital its
more due to the lack of this problem

3034
01:08:33,160 --> 01:08:33,170
more due to the lack of this problem
 

3035
01:08:33,170 --> 01:08:35,530
more due to the lack of this problem
notion property rights and enforcement's

3036
01:08:35,530 --> 01:08:35,540
notion property rights and enforcement's
 

3037
01:08:35,540 --> 01:08:38,670
notion property rights and enforcement's
of property rights interesting so that

3038
01:08:38,670 --> 01:08:38,680
of property rights interesting so that
 

3039
01:08:38,680 --> 01:08:43,090
of property rights interesting so that
the presence of absence of both the the

3040
01:08:43,090 --> 01:08:43,100
the presence of absence of both the the
 

3041
01:08:43,100 --> 01:08:45,190
the presence of absence of both the the
the concept of the property rights and

3042
01:08:45,190 --> 01:08:45,200
the concept of the property rights and
 

3043
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:47,620
the concept of the property rights and
their enforcement has a strong

3044
01:08:47,620 --> 01:08:47,630
their enforcement has a strong
 

3045
01:08:47,630 --> 01:08:51,160
their enforcement has a strong
correlation to economic growth and so

3046
01:08:51,160 --> 01:08:51,170
correlation to economic growth and so
 

3047
01:08:51,170 --> 01:08:53,620
correlation to economic growth and so
you think that that same could be

3048
01:08:53,620 --> 01:08:53,630
you think that that same could be
 

3049
01:08:53,630 --> 01:08:55,450
you think that that same could be
transferred to the idea of property

3050
01:08:55,450 --> 01:08:55,460
transferred to the idea of property
 

3051
01:08:55,460 --> 01:08:57,820
transferred to the idea of property
ownership in case of data ownership I

3052
01:08:57,820 --> 01:08:57,830
ownership in case of data ownership I
 

3053
01:08:57,830 --> 01:09:00,309
ownership in case of data ownership I
think I think its first of all it's a

3054
01:09:00,309 --> 01:09:00,319
think I think its first of all it's a
 

3055
01:09:00,319 --> 01:09:03,190
think I think its first of all it's a
good lesson for us to like to recognize

3056
01:09:03,190 --> 01:09:03,200
good lesson for us to like to recognize
 

3057
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:06,400
good lesson for us to like to recognize
that these rights and the recognition

3058
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:06,410
that these rights and the recognition
 

3059
01:09:06,410 --> 01:09:09,610
that these rights and the recognition
and enforcement of this type of Rights

3060
01:09:09,610 --> 01:09:09,620
and enforcement of this type of Rights
 

3061
01:09:09,620 --> 01:09:12,280
and enforcement of this type of Rights
it's very very important for economic

3062
01:09:12,280 --> 01:09:12,290
it's very very important for economic
 

3063
01:09:12,290 --> 01:09:15,250
it's very very important for economic
growth and then if we look at where we

3064
01:09:15,250 --> 01:09:15,260
growth and then if we look at where we
 

3065
01:09:15,260 --> 01:09:16,720
growth and then if we look at where we
are now and where we are going in the

3066
01:09:16,720 --> 01:09:16,730
are now and where we are going in the
 

3067
01:09:16,730 --> 01:09:19,630
are now and where we are going in the
future and so essentially more and more

3068
01:09:19,630 --> 01:09:19,640
future and so essentially more and more
 

3069
01:09:19,640 --> 01:09:22,210
future and so essentially more and more
as it's actually moving into the digital

3070
01:09:22,210 --> 01:09:22,220
as it's actually moving into the digital
 

3071
01:09:22,220 --> 01:09:25,720
as it's actually moving into the digital
world and also more anymore I would say

3072
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:25,730
world and also more anymore I would say
 

3073
01:09:25,730 --> 01:09:29,530
world and also more anymore I would say
even like information our asset alpha

3074
01:09:29,530 --> 01:09:29,540
even like information our asset alpha
 

3075
01:09:29,540 --> 01:09:32,920
even like information our asset alpha
person is more and more into the real

3076
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:32,930
person is more and more into the real
 

3077
01:09:32,930 --> 01:09:34,510
person is more and more into the real
world the physical necessary the

3078
01:09:34,510 --> 01:09:34,520
world the physical necessary the
 

3079
01:09:34,520 --> 01:09:36,430
world the physical necessary the
teaching the world as well it's the data

3080
01:09:36,430 --> 01:09:36,440
teaching the world as well it's the data
 

3081
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:40,140
teaching the world as well it's the data
that's the presence generators and

3082
01:09:40,140 --> 01:09:40,150
that's the presence generators and
 

3083
01:09:40,150 --> 01:09:43,210
that's the presence generators and
essentially it's like in the past what

3084
01:09:43,210 --> 01:09:43,220
essentially it's like in the past what
 

3085
01:09:43,220 --> 01:09:46,030
essentially it's like in the past what
defines a person you you can say right

3086
01:09:46,030 --> 01:09:46,040
defines a person you you can say right
 

3087
01:09:46,040 --> 01:09:49,720
defines a person you you can say right
like oftentimes besides the inmates like

3088
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:49,730
like oftentimes besides the inmates like
 

3089
01:09:49,730 --> 01:09:53,130
like oftentimes besides the inmates like
capabilities actually it's the physical

3090
01:09:53,130 --> 01:09:53,140
capabilities actually it's the physical
 

3091
01:09:53,140 --> 01:09:56,170
capabilities actually it's the physical
properties oh right that you finds a

3092
01:09:56,170 --> 01:09:56,180
properties oh right that you finds a
 

3093
01:09:56,180 --> 01:09:58,600
properties oh right that you finds a
person but I think more the more people

3094
01:09:58,600 --> 01:09:58,610
person but I think more the more people
 

3095
01:09:58,610 --> 01:10:00,520
person but I think more the more people
start to realize actually what defines a

3096
01:10:00,520 --> 01:10:00,530
start to realize actually what defines a
 

3097
01:10:00,530 --> 01:10:02,800
start to realize actually what defines a
person is more important in the data

3098
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:02,810
person is more important in the data
 

3099
01:10:02,810 --> 01:10:05,320
person is more important in the data
that the person has generated other data

3100
01:10:05,320 --> 01:10:05,330
that the person has generated other data
 

3101
01:10:05,330 --> 01:10:09,400
that the person has generated other data
about the person all the way from your

01:10:09,400 --> 01:10:09,410
about the person all the way from your
 

3103
01:10:09,410 --> 01:10:12,790
about the person all the way from your
political views yar yar music tastes and

3104
01:10:12,790 --> 01:10:12,800
political views yar yar music tastes and
 

3105
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:15,070
political views yar yar music tastes and
right your financial information now a

3106
01:10:15,070 --> 01:10:15,080
right your financial information now a
 

3107
01:10:15,080 --> 01:10:17,710
right your financial information now a
lot of these and your health so more and

3108
01:10:17,710 --> 01:10:17,720
lot of these and your health so more and
 

3109
01:10:17,720 --> 01:10:20,020
lot of these and your health so more and
more of the definition of the person is

3110
01:10:20,020 --> 01:10:20,030
more of the definition of the person is
 

3111
01:10:20,030 --> 01:10:22,210
more of the definition of the person is
actually in the digital world and

3112
01:10:22,210 --> 01:10:22,220
actually in the digital world and
 

3113
01:10:22,220 --> 01:10:23,890
actually in the digital world and
currently for the most part that's owned

3114
01:10:23,890 --> 01:10:23,900
currently for the most part that's owned
 

3115
01:10:23,900 --> 01:10:26,890
currently for the most part that's owned
in place like it's and people don't talk

3116
01:10:26,890 --> 01:10:26,900
in place like it's and people don't talk
 

3117
01:10:26,900 --> 01:10:29,520
in place like it's and people don't talk
about it but kind of it's owned by

3118
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:29,530
about it but kind of it's owned by
 

3119
01:10:29,530 --> 01:10:31,200
about it but kind of it's owned by
[Music]

3120
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:31,210
[Music]
 

3121
01:10:31,210 --> 01:10:34,090
[Music]
Internet companies so it's not owned by

3122
01:10:34,090 --> 01:10:34,100
Internet companies so it's not owned by
 

3123
01:10:34,100 --> 01:10:36,580
Internet companies so it's not owned by
individual there's no clear notion of

3124
01:10:36,580 --> 01:10:36,590
individual there's no clear notion of
 

3125
01:10:36,590 --> 01:10:40,090
individual there's no clear notion of
ownership after such data and also we

3126
01:10:40,090 --> 01:10:40,100
ownership after such data and also we
 

3127
01:10:40,100 --> 01:10:41,800
ownership after such data and also we
you know we talk about privacy and so on

3128
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:41,810
you know we talk about privacy and so on
 

3129
01:10:41,810 --> 01:10:42,580
you know we talk about privacy and so on
but I think

3130
01:10:42,580 --> 01:10:42,590
but I think
 

3131
01:10:42,590 --> 01:10:44,589
but I think
actually clearly identifying the

3132
01:10:44,589 --> 01:10:44,599
actually clearly identifying the
 

3133
01:10:44,599 --> 01:10:46,870
actually clearly identifying the
ownership it's a first step once you

3134
01:10:46,870 --> 01:10:46,880
ownership it's a first step once you
 

3135
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:49,089
ownership it's a first step once you
identify the ownership then you can say

3136
01:10:49,089 --> 01:10:49,099
identify the ownership then you can say
 

3137
01:10:49,099 --> 01:10:51,220
identify the ownership then you can say
who gets to define how that either

3138
01:10:51,220 --> 01:10:51,230
who gets to define how that either
 

3139
01:10:51,230 --> 01:10:53,890
who gets to define how that either

01:11:14,620 --> 01:11:14,630
you can see the recommendation system in
 

3153
01:11:14,630 --> 01:11:17,200
you can see the recommendation system in
some sense we don't call it an ass but a

3154
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:17,210
some sense we don't call it an ass but a
 

3155
01:11:17,210 --> 01:11:18,910
some sense we don't call it an ass but a
recommendation system similar it's

3156
01:11:18,910 --> 01:11:18,920
recommendation system similar it's

01:11:38,189 --> 01:11:38,199
especially in in certain cases where
 

3171
01:11:38,199 --> 01:11:40,660
especially in in certain cases where
people can be manipulated by this

3172
01:11:40,660 --> 01:11:40,670
people can be manipulated by this
 

3173
01:11:40,670 --> 01:11:43,540
people can be manipulated by this
targeted ass that can have really bad

3174
01:11:43,540 --> 01:11:43,550
targeted ass that can have really bad
 

3175
01:11:43,550 --> 01:11:47,589
targeted ass that can have really bad
like a severe consequences so so

3176
01:11:47,589 --> 01:11:47,599
like a severe consequences so so
 

3177
01:11:47,599 --> 01:11:49,270
like a severe consequences so so
essentially uses one that data to be

3178
01:11:49,270 --> 01:11:49,280
essentially uses one that data to be
 

3179
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:52,450
essentially uses one that data to be
used to better serve them and also maybe

3180
01:11:52,450 --> 01:11:52,460
used to better serve them and also maybe
 

3181
01:11:52,460 --> 01:11:55,089
used to better serve them and also maybe
even right get pay for whatever like in

3182
01:11:55,089 --> 01:11:55,099
even right get pay for whatever like in
 

3183
01:11:55,099 --> 01:11:57,070
even right get pay for whatever like in
different settings but the things that's

3184
01:11:57,070 --> 01:11:57,080
different settings but the things that's
 

3185
01:11:57,080 --> 01:11:58,660
different settings but the things that's
the first of all we need to really

3186
01:11:58,660 --> 01:11:58,670
the first of all we need to really
 

3187
01:11:58,670 --> 01:12:02,290
the first of all we need to really
establish like you who needs to decide

3188
01:12:02,290 --> 01:12:02,300
establish like you who needs to decide
 

3189
01:12:02,300 --> 01:12:05,200
establish like you who needs to decide
who can decide how the data should be

3190
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:05,210
who can decide how the data should be
 

3191
01:12:05,210 --> 01:12:08,020
who can decide how the data should be
used and typically that the

3192
01:12:08,020 --> 01:12:08,030
used and typically that the
 

3193
01:12:08,030 --> 01:12:10,359
used and typically that the
establishment and clarification of the

3194
01:12:10,359 --> 01:12:10,369
establishment and clarification of the
 

3195
01:12:10,369 --> 01:12:12,490
establishment and clarification of the
ownership will help this and it's an

3196
01:12:12,490 --> 01:12:12,500
ownership will help this and it's an
 

3197
01:12:12,500 --> 01:12:15,729
ownership will help this and it's an
important first step so if the user is

3198
01:12:15,729 --> 01:12:15,739
important first step so if the user is
 

3199
01:12:15,739 --> 01:12:17,589
important first step so if the user is
the owner then naturally the user gets

3200
01:12:17,589 --> 01:12:17,599
the owner then naturally the user gets
 

3201
01:12:17,599 --> 01:12:19,450
the owner then naturally the user gets
to define how the dinner should be used

3202
01:12:19,450 --> 01:12:19,460
to define how the dinner should be used
 

3203
01:12:19,460 --> 01:12:21,220
to define how the dinner should be used
but if you even say that

3204
01:12:21,220 --> 01:12:21,230
but if you even say that
 

3205
01:12:21,230 --> 01:12:23,379
but if you even say that
wait a minute you say actually now the

3206
01:12:23,379 --> 01:12:23,389
wait a minute you say actually now the
 

3207
01:12:23,389 --> 01:12:25,240
wait a minute you say actually now the
owner of the stator whoever's collecting

3208
01:12:25,240 --> 01:12:25,250
owner of the stator whoever's collecting
 

3209
01:12:25,250 --> 01:12:26,950
owner of the stator whoever's collecting
the data is the owner of the data now of

3210
01:12:26,950 --> 01:12:26,960
the data is the owner of the data now of
 

3211
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:28,390
the data is the owner of the data now of
course they get to use it in a hybrid

3212
01:12:28,390 --> 01:12:28,400
course they get to use it in a hybrid
 

3213
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:31,390
course they get to use it in a hybrid
way they want yeah so to really address

3214
01:12:31,390 --> 01:12:31,400
way they want yeah so to really address
 

3215
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:34,720
way they want yeah so to really address
these complex issues we need to go at

3216
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:34,730
these complex issues we need to go at
 

3217
01:12:34,730 --> 01:12:38,530
these complex issues we need to go at
the root cause so it seems fairly clear

3218
01:12:38,530 --> 01:12:38,540
the root cause so it seems fairly clear
 

3219
01:12:38,540 --> 01:12:40,629
the root cause so it seems fairly clear
that's the first we really need to say

3220
01:12:40,629 --> 01:12:40,639
that's the first we really need to say
 

3221
01:12:40,639 --> 01:12:42,669
that's the first we really need to say
now who is the owner of the data and

3222
01:12:42,669 --> 01:12:42,679
now who is the owner of the data and
 

3223
01:12:42,679 --> 01:12:45,729
now who is the owner of the data and
then the owners can specify how the one

3224
01:12:45,729 --> 01:12:45,739
then the owners can specify how the one
 

3225
01:12:45,739 --> 01:12:47,950
then the owners can specify how the one
that they'd had to be utilized so I said

3226
01:12:47,950 --> 01:12:47,960
that they'd had to be utilized so I said
 

3227
01:12:47,960 --> 01:12:51,280
that they'd had to be utilized so I said
that that's a fascinating does most

3228
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:51,290
that that's a fascinating does most
 

3229
01:12:51,290 --> 01:12:52,839
that that's a fascinating does most
people don't think about that and I

3230
01:12:52,839 --> 01:12:52,849
people don't think about that and I
 

3231
01:12:52,849 --> 01:12:54,250
people don't think about that and I
think that's a fascinating thing to

3232
01:12:54,250 --> 01:12:54,260
think that's a fascinating thing to
 

3233
01:12:54,260 --> 01:12:56,540
think that's a fascinating thing to
think about and probably fight for it

3234
01:12:56,540 --> 01:12:56,550
think about and probably fight for it
 

3235
01:12:56,550 --> 01:12:58,970
think about and probably fight for it
I can only see in the economic growth

3236
01:12:58,970 --> 01:12:58,980
I can only see in the economic growth
 

3237
01:12:58,980 --> 01:13:00,709
I can only see in the economic growth
argument it's probably a really strong

3238
01:13:00,709 --> 01:13:00,719
argument it's probably a really strong
 

3239
01:13:00,719 --> 01:13:02,989
argument it's probably a really strong
one so that's that's the first time I'm

3240
01:13:02,989 --> 01:13:02,999
one so that's that's the first time I'm
 

3241
01:13:02,999 --> 01:13:05,959
one so that's that's the first time I'm
kind of at least thinking about the the

3242
01:13:05,959 --> 01:13:05,969
kind of at least thinking about the the
 

3243
01:13:05,969 --> 01:13:08,390
kind of at least thinking about the the
positive aspect of that ownership being

3244
01:13:08,390 --> 01:13:08,400
positive aspect of that ownership being
 

3245
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:11,359
positive aspect of that ownership being
the long-term growth of the economy so

3246
01:13:11,359 --> 01:13:11,369
the long-term growth of the economy so
 

3247
01:13:11,369 --> 01:13:13,549
the long-term growth of the economy so
good for everybody but sort of one down

3248
01:13:13,549 --> 01:13:13,559
good for everybody but sort of one down
 

3249
01:13:13,559 --> 01:13:16,370
good for everybody but sort of one down
possible downside I could see sort of to

3250
01:13:16,370 --> 01:13:16,380
possible downside I could see sort of to
 

3251
01:13:16,380 --> 01:13:22,879
possible downside I could see sort of to
put on my grumpy old grandpa hat and you

3252
01:13:22,879 --> 01:13:22,889
put on my grumpy old grandpa hat and you
 

3253
01:13:22,889 --> 01:13:24,890
put on my grumpy old grandpa hat and you
know it's really nice for Facebook and

3254
01:13:24,890 --> 01:13:24,900
know it's really nice for Facebook and
 

3255
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:27,520
know it's really nice for Facebook and
YouTube and Twitter to all be free and

3256
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:27,530
YouTube and Twitter to all be free and
 

3257
01:13:27,530 --> 01:13:31,009
YouTube and Twitter to all be free and
if you give control to people or their

3258
01:13:31,009 --> 01:13:31,019
if you give control to people or their
 

3259
01:13:31,019 --> 01:13:32,870
if you give control to people or their
data do you think it's possible they

3260
01:13:32,870 --> 01:13:32,880
data do you think it's possible they
 

3261
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:36,350
data do you think it's possible they
will be they would not want to hand it

3262
01:13:36,350 --> 01:13:36,360
will be they would not want to hand it
 

3263
01:13:36,360 --> 01:13:38,989
will be they would not want to hand it
over quite easily and so a lot of these

3264
01:13:38,989 --> 01:13:38,999
over quite easily and so a lot of these
 

3265
01:13:38,999 --> 01:13:42,229
over quite easily and so a lot of these
companies that rely on mass handover of

3266
01:13:42,229 --> 01:13:42,239
companies that rely on mass handover of
 

3267
01:13:42,239 --> 01:13:44,029
companies that rely on mass handover of
data and then their book therefore

3268
01:13:44,029 --> 01:13:44,039
data and then their book therefore
 

3269
01:13:44,039 --> 01:13:49,029
data and then their book therefore
provide a mass seemingly free service

3270
01:13:49,029 --> 01:13:49,039
provide a mass seemingly free service
 

3271
01:13:49,039 --> 01:13:52,750
provide a mass seemingly free service
would then completely so the the the the

3272
01:13:52,750 --> 01:13:52,760
would then completely so the the the the
 

3273
01:13:52,760 --> 01:13:55,189
would then completely so the the the the
way the internet looks will completely

3274
01:13:55,189 --> 01:13:55,199
way the internet looks will completely
 

3275
01:13:55,199 --> 01:13:57,529
way the internet looks will completely
change because of the ownership of data

3276
01:13:57,529 --> 01:13:57,539
change because of the ownership of data
 

3277
01:13:57,539 --> 01:13:59,390
change because of the ownership of data
and we'll lose a lot of services with

3278
01:13:59,390 --> 01:13:59,400
and we'll lose a lot of services with
 

3279
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:02,689
and we'll lose a lot of services with
value do you worry about that that's a

3280
01:14:02,689 --> 01:14:02,699
value do you worry about that that's a
 

3281
01:14:02,699 --> 01:14:04,879
value do you worry about that that's a
very good question I think that's not

3282
01:14:04,879 --> 01:14:04,889
very good question I think that's not
 

3283
01:14:04,889 --> 01:14:06,739
very good question I think that's not
necessarily the case in a sense that's

3284
01:14:06,739 --> 01:14:06,749
necessarily the case in a sense that's
 

3285
01:14:06,749 --> 01:14:10,310
necessarily the case in a sense that's
yes users can have ownership of their

3286
01:14:10,310 --> 01:14:10,320
yes users can have ownership of their
 

3287
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:12,560
yes users can have ownership of their
data they can maintain control of their

3288
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:12,570
data they can maintain control of their
 

3289
01:14:12,570 --> 01:14:14,629
data they can maintain control of their
data but also then they get to decide

3290
01:14:14,629 --> 01:14:14,639
data but also then they get to decide
 

3291
01:14:14,639 --> 01:14:19,040
data but also then they get to decide
how their data can be used so and that's

3292
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:19,050
how their data can be used so and that's
 

3293
01:14:19,050 --> 01:14:20,330
how their data can be used so and that's
why I mention it like you see in this

3294
01:14:20,330 --> 01:14:20,340
why I mention it like you see in this
 

3295
01:14:20,340 --> 01:14:22,939
why I mention it like you see in this
case if they feel that they enjoy the

3296
01:14:22,939 --> 01:14:22,949
case if they feel that they enjoy the
 

3297
01:14:22,949 --> 01:14:25,009
case if they feel that they enjoy the
benefits of social networks and so on

3298
01:14:25,009 --> 01:14:25,019
benefits of social networks and so on
 

3299
01:14:25,019 --> 01:14:27,950
benefits of social networks and so on
and they are fine with having Facebook

3300
01:14:27,950 --> 01:14:27,960
and they are fine with having Facebook
 

3301
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:30,589
and they are fine with having Facebook
having their data but utilizing the data

3302
01:14:30,589 --> 01:14:30,599
having their data but utilizing the data
 

3303
01:14:30,599 --> 01:14:34,160
having their data but utilizing the data
in certain way that's they agree then

3304
01:14:34,160 --> 01:14:34,170
in certain way that's they agree then
 

3305
01:14:34,170 --> 01:14:36,399
in certain way that's they agree then
they can still enjoy the free services

3306
01:14:36,399 --> 01:14:36,409
they can still enjoy the free services
 

3307
01:14:36,409 --> 01:14:39,680
they can still enjoy the free services
but for others maybe they would prefer

3308
01:14:39,680 --> 01:14:39,690
but for others maybe they would prefer
 

3309
01:14:39,690 --> 01:14:42,529
but for others maybe they would prefer
some kind of private vision and in that

3310
01:14:42,529 --> 01:14:42,539
some kind of private vision and in that
 

3311
01:14:42,539 --> 01:14:44,839
some kind of private vision and in that
case maybe they can even opt in to say

3312
01:14:44,839 --> 01:14:44,849
case maybe they can even opt in to say
 

3313
01:14:44,849 --> 01:14:48,200
case maybe they can even opt in to say
that I want to pay and to have so for

3314
01:14:48,200 --> 01:14:48,210
that I want to pay and to have so for
 

3315
01:14:48,210 --> 01:14:50,600
that I want to pay and to have so for
example it's already fairly standard

3316
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:50,610
example it's already fairly standard
 

3317
01:14:50,610 --> 01:14:53,060
example it's already fairly standard
like you pay for certain subscriptions

3318
01:14:53,060 --> 01:14:53,070
like you pay for certain subscriptions
 

3319
01:14:53,070 --> 01:14:56,509
like you pay for certain subscriptions
so that you don't get to you know be

3320
01:14:56,509 --> 01:14:56,519
so that you don't get to you know be
 

3321
01:14:56,519 --> 01:15:00,049
so that you don't get to you know be
shown as yes yeah right so the users

3322
01:15:00,049 --> 01:15:00,059
shown as yes yeah right so the users
 

3323
01:15:00,059 --> 01:15:02,750
shown as yes yeah right so the users
essentially can have choices and I think

3324
01:15:02,750 --> 01:15:02,760
essentially can have choices and I think
 

3325
01:15:02,760 --> 01:15:05,660
essentially can have choices and I think
we just want to essentially bring out

3326
01:15:05,660 --> 01:15:05,670
we just want to essentially bring out
 

3327
01:15:05,670 --> 01:15:09,020
we just want to essentially bring out
more about who gets to decide

3328
01:15:09,020 --> 01:15:09,030
more about who gets to decide
 

3329
01:15:09,030 --> 01:15:11,209
more about who gets to decide
what to do with that yeah I think it's

3330
01:15:11,209 --> 01:15:11,219
what to do with that yeah I think it's
 

3331
01:15:11,219 --> 01:15:12,620
what to do with that yeah I think it's
an interesting idea because if you pull

3332
01:15:12,620 --> 01:15:12,630
an interesting idea because if you pull
 

3333
01:15:12,630 --> 01:15:16,220
an interesting idea because if you pull
people now you know it seems like I

3334
01:15:16,220 --> 01:15:16,230
people now you know it seems like I
 

3335
01:15:16,230 --> 01:15:18,229
people now you know it seems like I
don't know but subjectively sort of

3336
01:15:18,229 --> 01:15:18,239
don't know but subjectively sort of
 

3337
01:15:18,239 --> 01:15:20,089
don't know but subjectively sort of
anecdotally speaking it seems like a lot

3338
01:15:20,089 --> 01:15:20,099
anecdotally speaking it seems like a lot
 

3339
01:15:20,099 --> 01:15:22,370
anecdotally speaking it seems like a lot
of people don't trust Facebook so that's

3340
01:15:22,370 --> 01:15:22,380
of people don't trust Facebook so that's
 

3341
01:15:22,380 --> 01:15:24,319
of people don't trust Facebook so that's
at least a very popular thing to say

3342
01:15:24,319 --> 01:15:24,329
at least a very popular thing to say
 

3343
01:15:24,329 --> 01:15:26,500
at least a very popular thing to say
that I don't trust Facebook right I

3344
01:15:26,500 --> 01:15:26,510
that I don't trust Facebook right I
 

3345
01:15:26,510 --> 01:15:29,359
that I don't trust Facebook right I
wonder if you give people control of

3346
01:15:29,359 --> 01:15:29,369
wonder if you give people control of
 

3347
01:15:29,369 --> 01:15:31,970
wonder if you give people control of
their data as opposed to sort of

3348
01:15:31,970 --> 01:15:31,980
their data as opposed to sort of
 

3349
01:15:31,980 --> 01:15:33,680
their data as opposed to sort of
signaling to everyone that they don't

3350
01:15:33,680 --> 01:15:33,690
signaling to everyone that they don't
 

3351
01:15:33,690 --> 01:15:35,810
signaling to everyone that they don't
trust Facebook I wonder how they would

3352
01:15:35,810 --> 01:15:35,820
trust Facebook I wonder how they would
 

3353
01:15:35,820 --> 01:15:39,500
trust Facebook I wonder how they would
speak with the actual like would they be

3354
01:15:39,500 --> 01:15:39,510
speak with the actual like would they be
 

3355
01:15:39,510 --> 01:15:42,290
speak with the actual like would they be
willing to pay $10 a month for Facebook

3356
01:15:42,290 --> 01:15:42,300
willing to pay $10 a month for Facebook
 

3357
01:15:42,300 --> 01:15:44,120
willing to pay $10 a month for Facebook
or would they hand over their data

3358
01:15:44,120 --> 01:15:44,130
or would they hand over their data
 

3359
01:15:44,130 --> 01:15:46,520
or would they hand over their data
it'd be interesting to see what fraction

3360
01:15:46,520 --> 01:15:46,530
it'd be interesting to see what fraction
 

3361
01:15:46,530 --> 01:15:49,310
it'd be interesting to see what fraction
of people with would quietly hand over

3362
01:15:49,310 --> 01:15:49,320
of people with would quietly hand over
 

3363
01:15:49,320 --> 01:15:52,010
of people with would quietly hand over
their data to Facebook to make it free

3364
01:15:52,010 --> 01:15:52,020
their data to Facebook to make it free
 

3365
01:15:52,020 --> 01:15:54,500
their data to Facebook to make it free
III don't have a good intuition about

3366
01:15:54,500 --> 01:15:54,510
III don't have a good intuition about
 

3367
01:15:54,510 --> 01:15:57,109
III don't have a good intuition about
that like how many people do you have an

3368
01:15:57,109 --> 01:15:57,119
that like how many people do you have an
 

3369
01:15:57,119 --> 01:15:59,359
that like how many people do you have an
intuition about how many people would

3370
01:15:59,359 --> 01:15:59,369
intuition about how many people would
 

3371
01:15:59,369 --> 01:16:02,299
intuition about how many people would
use their data effectively on the market

3372
01:16:02,299 --> 01:16:02,309
use their data effectively on the market
 

3373
01:16:02,309 --> 01:16:06,709
use their data effectively on the market
on the on the market of the Internet by

3374
01:16:06,709 --> 01:16:06,719
on the on the market of the Internet by
 

3375
01:16:06,719 --> 01:16:10,029
on the on the market of the Internet by
sort of buying services with their data

3376
01:16:10,029 --> 01:16:10,039
sort of buying services with their data
 

3377
01:16:10,039 --> 01:16:12,260
sort of buying services with their data
yeah so that's a very good question I

3378
01:16:12,260 --> 01:16:12,270
yeah so that's a very good question I
 

3379
01:16:12,270 --> 01:16:15,229
yeah so that's a very good question I
think so one thing I also want to

3380
01:16:15,229 --> 01:16:15,239
think so one thing I also want to
 

3381
01:16:15,239 --> 01:16:19,370
think so one thing I also want to
mention is that this right so it seems

3382
01:16:19,370 --> 01:16:19,380
mention is that this right so it seems
 

3383
01:16:19,380 --> 01:16:23,060
mention is that this right so it seems
that especially in press and the

3384
01:16:23,060 --> 01:16:23,070
that especially in press and the
 

3385
01:16:23,070 --> 01:16:26,180
that especially in press and the
conversation has been very much like two

3386
01:16:26,180 --> 01:16:26,190
conversation has been very much like two
 

3387
01:16:26,190 --> 01:16:30,490
conversation has been very much like two
sides fighting against each other um oh

3388
01:16:30,490 --> 01:16:30,500
sides fighting against each other um oh
 

3389
01:16:30,500 --> 01:16:33,290
sides fighting against each other um oh
one hands right yes your skin say that

3390
01:16:33,290 --> 01:16:33,300
one hands right yes your skin say that
 

3391
01:16:33,300 --> 01:16:34,669
one hands right yes your skin say that
right they don't trust Facebook they

3392
01:16:34,669 --> 01:16:34,679
right they don't trust Facebook they
 

3393
01:16:34,679 --> 01:16:37,939
right they don't trust Facebook they
don't are there is DB Facebook yeah yeah

3394
01:16:37,939 --> 01:16:37,949
don't are there is DB Facebook yeah yeah
 

3395
01:16:37,949 --> 01:16:39,490
don't are there is DB Facebook yeah yeah
exactly

3396
01:16:39,490 --> 01:16:39,500
exactly
 

3397
01:16:39,500 --> 01:16:43,640
exactly
on the other hand and right of course

3398
01:16:43,640 --> 01:16:43,650
on the other hand and right of course
 

3399
01:16:43,650 --> 01:16:48,109
on the other hand and right of course
and right the other side they also feel

3400
01:16:48,109 --> 01:16:48,119
and right the other side they also feel
 

3401
01:16:48,119 --> 01:16:49,370
and right the other side they also feel
oh they are providing a lot of services

3402
01:16:49,370 --> 01:16:49,380
oh they are providing a lot of services
 

3403
01:16:49,380 --> 01:16:51,859
oh they are providing a lot of services
to users and users are getting it all

3404
01:16:51,859 --> 01:16:51,869
to users and users are getting it all
 

3405
01:16:51,869 --> 01:16:56,990
to users and users are getting it all
for free so I think actually you know I

3406
01:16:56,990 --> 01:16:57,000
for free so I think actually you know I
 

3407
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:00,589
for free so I think actually you know I
talked a lot to like different companies

3408
01:17:00,589 --> 01:17:00,599
talked a lot to like different companies
 

3409
01:17:00,599 --> 01:17:02,390
talked a lot to like different companies
and also like a physically ample size

3410
01:17:02,390 --> 01:17:02,400
and also like a physically ample size
 

3411
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:07,819
and also like a physically ample size
and so one thing I hope also like this

3412
01:17:07,819 --> 01:17:07,829
and so one thing I hope also like this
 

3413
01:17:07,829 --> 01:17:09,859
and so one thing I hope also like this
my hope for this year also is that and

3414
01:17:09,859 --> 01:17:09,869
my hope for this year also is that and
 

3415
01:17:09,869 --> 01:17:13,399
my hope for this year also is that and
we want to establish a more constructive

3416
01:17:13,399 --> 01:17:13,409
we want to establish a more constructive
 

3417
01:17:13,409 --> 01:17:17,390
we want to establish a more constructive
dialogue and that happen and to help

3418
01:17:17,390 --> 01:17:17,400
dialogue and that happen and to help
 

3419
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:19,850
dialogue and that happen and to help
people to understand that the problem is

3420
01:17:19,850 --> 01:17:19,860
people to understand that the problem is
 

3421
01:17:19,860 --> 01:17:21,800
people to understand that the problem is
much more nuanced

3422
01:17:21,800 --> 01:17:21,810
much more nuanced
 

3423
01:17:21,810 --> 01:17:25,750
much more nuanced
then just and this to size fighting

3424
01:17:25,750 --> 01:17:25,760
then just and this to size fighting
 

3425
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:28,850
then just and this to size fighting
because naturally there's a tension

3426
01:17:28,850 --> 01:17:28,860
because naturally there's a tension
 

3427
01:17:28,860 --> 01:17:32,150
because naturally there's a tension
between the two sides between your

3428
01:17:32,150 --> 01:17:32,160
between the two sides between your
 

3429
01:17:32,160 --> 01:17:35,210
between the two sides between your
Twitter and privacy so if you want to

3430
01:17:35,210 --> 01:17:35,220
Twitter and privacy so if you want to
 

3431
01:17:35,220 --> 01:17:37,660
Twitter and privacy so if you want to
get more utility essentially like the

3432
01:17:37,660 --> 01:17:37,670
get more utility essentially like the
 

3433
01:17:37,670 --> 01:17:40,400
get more utility essentially like the
recommendation system example I gave

3434
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:40,410
recommendation system example I gave
 

3435
01:17:40,410 --> 01:17:42,860
recommendation system example I gave
earlier if you want someone to give you

3436
01:17:42,860 --> 01:17:42,870
earlier if you want someone to give you
 

3437
01:17:42,870 --> 01:17:44,120
earlier if you want someone to give you
good recommendation

3438
01:17:44,120 --> 01:17:44,130
good recommendation
 

3439
01:17:44,130 --> 01:17:46,160
good recommendation
essentially whatever the system is the

3440
01:17:46,160 --> 01:17:46,170
essentially whatever the system is the
 

3441
01:17:46,170 --> 01:17:48,170
essentially whatever the system is the
system is going to need to know your

3442
01:17:48,170 --> 01:17:48,180
system is going to need to know your
 

3443
01:17:48,180 --> 01:17:51,970
system is going to need to know your
data to give you a good recommendation

3444
01:17:51,970 --> 01:17:51,980
data to give you a good recommendation
 

3445
01:17:51,980 --> 01:17:54,710
data to give you a good recommendation
but also of course at the same time we

3446
01:17:54,710 --> 01:17:54,720
but also of course at the same time we
 

3447
01:17:54,720 --> 01:17:56,630
but also of course at the same time we
want to ensure that however that data is

3448
01:17:56,630 --> 01:17:56,640
want to ensure that however that data is
 

3449
01:17:56,640 --> 01:17:58,730
want to ensure that however that data is
being handled it's done in the privacy

3450
01:17:58,730 --> 01:17:58,740
being handled it's done in the privacy
 

3451
01:17:58,740 --> 01:18:01,910
being handled it's done in the privacy
preserving way and so that that for

3452
01:18:01,910 --> 01:18:01,920
preserving way and so that that for
 

3453
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:03,140
preserving way and so that that for
example that recommendation system

3454
01:18:03,140 --> 01:18:03,150
example that recommendation system
 

3455
01:18:03,150 --> 01:18:05,450
example that recommendation system
doesn't just go around and say we are

3456
01:18:05,450 --> 01:18:05,460
doesn't just go around and say we are
 

3457
01:18:05,460 --> 01:18:08,600
doesn't just go around and say we are
they here and then cause all the you

3458
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:08,610
they here and then cause all the you
 

3459
01:18:08,610 --> 01:18:10,880
they here and then cause all the you
know cause a lot of bad consequences and

3460
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:10,890
know cause a lot of bad consequences and
 

3461
01:18:10,890 --> 01:18:14,810
know cause a lot of bad consequences and
so on so you want that dialog to be a

3462
01:18:14,810 --> 01:18:14,820
so on so you want that dialog to be a
 

3463
01:18:14,820 --> 01:18:16,790
so on so you want that dialog to be a
little bit more in the open a little

3464
01:18:16,790 --> 01:18:16,800
little bit more in the open a little
 

3465
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:20,120
little bit more in the open a little
more more nuanced and maybe adding

3466
01:18:20,120 --> 01:18:20,130
more more nuanced and maybe adding
 

3467
01:18:20,130 --> 01:18:21,980
more more nuanced and maybe adding
control to the data ownership to the

3468
01:18:21,980 --> 01:18:21,990
control to the data ownership to the
 

3469
01:18:21,990 --> 01:18:25,490
control to the data ownership to the
data will allow so as opposed to this

3470
01:18:25,490 --> 01:18:25,500
data will allow so as opposed to this
 

3471
01:18:25,500 --> 01:18:27,290
data will allow so as opposed to this
happening in the background allowed to

3472
01:18:27,290 --> 01:18:27,300
happening in the background allowed to
 

3473
01:18:27,300 --> 01:18:29,120
happening in the background allowed to
bring it to the forefront and actually

3474
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:29,130
bring it to the forefront and actually
 

3475
01:18:29,130 --> 01:18:33,170
bring it to the forefront and actually
have dialogues in like more nuanced real

3476
01:18:33,170 --> 01:18:33,180
have dialogues in like more nuanced real
 

3477
01:18:33,180 --> 01:18:36,110
have dialogues in like more nuanced real
dialogues about how we trade our data

3478
01:18:36,110 --> 01:18:36,120
dialogues about how we trade our data
 

3479
01:18:36,120 --> 01:18:38,570
dialogues about how we trade our data
for the services that's the whole rights

3480
01:18:38,570 --> 01:18:38,580
for the services that's the whole rights
 

3481
01:18:38,580 --> 01:18:42,050
for the services that's the whole rights
right yes at high level so essentially

3482
01:18:42,050 --> 01:18:42,060
right yes at high level so essentially
 

3483
01:18:42,060 --> 01:18:43,940
right yes at high level so essentially
also knowing that there are technical

3484
01:18:43,940 --> 01:18:43,950
also knowing that there are technical
 

3485
01:18:43,950 --> 01:18:49,160
also knowing that there are technical
challenges and in in addressing the

3486
01:18:49,160 --> 01:18:49,170
challenges and in in addressing the
 

3487
01:18:49,170 --> 01:18:51,740
challenges and in in addressing the
issue to like you basically you can't

3488
01:18:51,740 --> 01:18:51,750
issue to like you basically you can't
 

3489
01:18:51,750 --> 01:18:54,620
issue to like you basically you can't
have just like the example that I gave

3490
01:18:54,620 --> 01:18:54,630
have just like the example that I gave
 

3491
01:18:54,630 --> 01:18:56,780
have just like the example that I gave
earlier it is really difficult to

3492
01:18:56,780 --> 01:18:56,790
earlier it is really difficult to
 

3493
01:18:56,790 --> 01:18:59,150
earlier it is really difficult to
balance the two between utility and

3494
01:18:59,150 --> 01:18:59,160
balance the two between utility and
 

3495
01:18:59,160 --> 01:19:02,180
balance the two between utility and
privacy and and that's also a lot of

3496
01:19:02,180 --> 01:19:02,190
privacy and and that's also a lot of
 

3497
01:19:02,190 --> 01:19:05,420
privacy and and that's also a lot of
things that I work on my group Roxanne

3498
01:19:05,420 --> 01:19:05,430
things that I work on my group Roxanne
 

3499
01:19:05,430 --> 01:19:09,440
things that I work on my group Roxanne
as well as to actually develop these

3500
01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:09,450
as well as to actually develop these
 

3501
01:19:09,450 --> 01:19:11,240
as well as to actually develop these
technologies that are needed to

3502
01:19:11,240 --> 01:19:11,250
technologies that are needed to
 

3503
01:19:11,250 --> 01:19:14,290
technologies that are needed to
essentially help this balance better

3504
01:19:14,290 --> 01:19:14,300
essentially help this balance better
 

3505
01:19:14,300 --> 01:19:16,550
essentially help this balance better
essentially to help data to be utilized

3506
01:19:16,550 --> 01:19:16,560
essentially to help data to be utilized
 

3507
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:18,560
essentially to help data to be utilized
in the privacy preserving and

3508
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:18,570
in the privacy preserving and
 

3509
01:19:18,570 --> 01:19:21,080
in the privacy preserving and
responsible way and so we essentially

3510
01:19:21,080 --> 01:19:21,090
responsible way and so we essentially
 

3511
01:19:21,090 --> 01:19:23,330
responsible way and so we essentially
need people to understand the challenges

3512
01:19:23,330 --> 01:19:23,340
need people to understand the challenges
 

3513
01:19:23,340 --> 01:19:26,480
need people to understand the challenges
and also at the same time and to provide

3514
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:26,490
and also at the same time and to provide
 

3515
01:19:26,490 --> 01:19:29,960
and also at the same time and to provide
the technical abilities and also

3516
01:19:29,960 --> 01:19:29,970
the technical abilities and also
 

3517
01:19:29,970 --> 01:19:32,540
the technical abilities and also
regulatory frameworks to help the two

3518
01:19:32,540 --> 01:19:32,550
regulatory frameworks to help the two
 

3519
01:19:32,550 --> 01:19:34,310
regulatory frameworks to help the two
sites will be more in the women

3520
01:19:34,310 --> 01:19:34,320
sites will be more in the women
 

3521
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:35,520
sites will be more in the women
situation instead of

3522
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:35,530
situation instead of
 

3523
01:19:35,530 --> 01:19:38,939
situation instead of
I fight yeah the fighting the fighting

cool thing that the that's created and
it shouldn't be monolithically fought

3542
01:20:03,779 --> 01:20:03,789
it shouldn't be monolithically fought
 

3543
01:20:03,789 --> 01:20:06,209
it shouldn't be monolithically fought
against like Facebook as evil or so on

for example identity you're like
 

3557
01:20:22,020 --> 01:20:25,350
for example identity you're like
allowing people to be themselves like

3558
01:20:25,350 --> 01:20:25,360
allowing people to be themselves like
 

3559
01:20:25,360 --> 01:20:28,140
allowing people to be themselves like
their real selves in in the digital

3560
01:20:28,140 --> 01:20:28,150
their real selves in in the digital
 

3561
01:20:28,150 --> 01:20:30,540
their real selves in in the digital
space by using a real name and their

3562
01:20:30,540 --> 01:20:30,550
space by using a real name and their
 

3563
01:20:30,550 --> 01:20:32,790
space by using a real name and their
real picture that step was like the

3564
01:20:32,790 --> 01:20:32,800
real picture that step was like the
 

3565
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:34,500
real picture that step was like the
first step from the real world to the

01:20:34,500 --> 01:20:34,510
first step from the real world to the
 

3567
01:20:34,510 --> 01:20:37,109
first step from the real world to the
digital world that was a huge step that

3568
01:20:37,109 --> 01:20:37,119
digital world that was a huge step that
 

3569
01:20:37,119 --> 01:20:39,240
digital world that was a huge step that
perhaps will define the 21st century in

3570
01:20:39,240 --> 01:20:39,250
perhaps will define the 21st century in
 

3571
01:20:39,250 --> 01:20:41,939
perhaps will define the 21st century in
us creating a digital identity there's a

3572
01:20:41,939 --> 01:20:41,949
us creating a digital identity there's a
 

3573
01:20:41,949 --> 01:20:43,680
us creating a digital identity there's a
lot of interesting possibilities there

3574
01:20:43,680 --> 01:20:43,690
lot of interesting possibilities there
 

3575
01:20:43,690 --> 01:20:46,350
lot of interesting possibilities there
that are positive of course some things

3576
01:20:46,350 --> 01:20:46,360
that are positive of course some things
 

3577
01:20:46,360 --> 01:20:49,049
that are positive of course some things
are negative and having a good dialogue

3578
01:20:49,049 --> 01:20:49,059
are negative and having a good dialogue

that people like you're at the center

3582
01:20:51,990 --> 01:20:52,000
that people like you're at the center
 

3583
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
that people like you're at the center
that's how access is it's awesome I

3584
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:54,010
that's how access is it's awesome I
 

3585
01:20:54,010 --> 01:20:58,439
that's how access is it's awesome I
think it also and I also can understand

think it also and I also can understand
 

3587
01:20:58,449 --> 01:21:00,839
think it also and I also can understand
I think actually in the past especially

3588
01:21:00,839 --> 01:21:00,849
I think actually in the past especially
 

3589
01:21:00,849 --> 01:21:04,919
I think actually in the past especially
in the past couple years and this rising

3590
01:21:04,919 --> 01:21:04,929
in the past couple years and this rising
 

3591
01:21:04,929 --> 01:21:08,040
in the past couple years and this rising
awareness has been helpful like users

3592
01:21:08,040 --> 01:21:08,050
awareness has been helpful like users
 

3593
01:21:08,050 --> 01:21:10,379
awareness has been helpful like users
are also more and more recognizing that

3594
01:21:10,379 --> 01:21:10,389
are also more and more recognizing that
 

3595
01:21:10,389 --> 01:21:11,850
are also more and more recognizing that
privacy is important to them

3596
01:21:11,850 --> 01:21:11,860
privacy is important to them
 

3597
01:21:11,860 --> 01:21:14,850
privacy is important to them
they shoes may be right there should be

3598
01:21:14,850 --> 01:21:14,860
they shoes may be right there should be
 

3599
01:21:14,860 --> 01:21:16,830
they shoes may be right there should be
owners after data I think the Stephanus

3600
01:21:16,830 --> 01:21:16,840
owners after data I think the Stephanus
 

3601
01:21:16,840 --> 01:21:20,459
owners after data I think the Stephanus
is very helpful and I think also this

3602
01:21:20,459 --> 01:21:20,469
is very helpful and I think also this
 

3603
01:21:20,469 --> 01:21:24,540
is very helpful and I think also this
type of voice also and together with the

3604
01:21:24,540 --> 01:21:24,550
type of voice also and together with the
 

3605
01:21:24,550 --> 01:21:27,750
type of voice also and together with the
regulatory framework and so on also help

3606
01:21:27,750 --> 01:21:27,760
regulatory framework and so on also help
 

3607
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:31,379
regulatory framework and so on also help
the companies to essentially put this

3608
01:21:31,379 --> 01:21:31,389
the companies to essentially put this
 

3609
01:21:31,389 --> 01:21:34,200
the companies to essentially put this
type of issues at a higher priority and

3610
01:21:34,200 --> 01:21:34,210
type of issues at a higher priority and
 

3611
01:21:34,210 --> 01:21:38,279
type of issues at a higher priority and
knowing that right also it is their

3612
01:21:38,279 --> 01:21:38,289
knowing that right also it is their
 

3613
01:21:38,289 --> 01:21:40,979
knowing that right also it is their
responsibility to to ensure that users

3614
01:21:40,979 --> 01:21:40,989
responsibility to to ensure that users
 

3615
01:21:40,989 --> 01:21:43,919
responsibility to to ensure that users
are well protected and so I think it

3616
01:21:43,919 --> 01:21:43,929
are well protected and so I think it
 

3617
01:21:43,929 --> 01:21:46,830
are well protected and so I think it
definitely the raising voice is super

3618
01:21:46,830 --> 01:21:46,840
definitely the raising voice is super
 

3619
01:21:46,840 --> 01:21:49,169
definitely the raising voice is super
helpful and I think that I should

3620
01:21:49,169 --> 01:21:49,179
helpful and I think that I should
 

3621
01:21:49,179 --> 01:21:51,929
helpful and I think that I should
really has brought the issue of data

3622
01:21:51,929 --> 01:21:51,939
really has brought the issue of data
 

3623
01:21:51,939 --> 01:21:55,259
really has brought the issue of data
privacy and even this consideration of

3624
01:21:55,259 --> 01:21:55,269
privacy and even this consideration of
 

3625
01:21:55,269 --> 01:21:58,620
privacy and even this consideration of
the ownership to the forefront to really

3626
01:21:58,620 --> 01:21:58,630
the ownership to the forefront to really
 

3627
01:21:58,630 --> 01:22:02,009
the ownership to the forefront to really
much by the community and I think more

3628
01:22:02,009 --> 01:22:02,019
much by the community and I think more
 

3629
01:22:02,019 --> 01:22:04,199
much by the community and I think more
of this voice is needed but I think it's

3630
01:22:04,199 --> 01:22:04,209
of this voice is needed but I think it's
 

3631
01:22:04,209 --> 01:22:05,910
of this voice is needed but I think it's
just that we want to have a more

3632
01:22:05,910 --> 01:22:05,920
just that we want to have a more
 

3633
01:22:05,920 --> 01:22:09,479
just that we want to have a more
constructive dialogue to bring the both

3634
01:22:09,479 --> 01:22:09,489
constructive dialogue to bring the both
 

3635
01:22:09,489 --> 01:22:11,399
constructive dialogue to bring the both
sides together to figure out a

3636
01:22:11,399 --> 01:22:11,409
sides together to figure out a
 

3637
01:22:11,409 --> 01:22:14,699
sides together to figure out a
constructive solution so another

3638
01:22:14,699 --> 01:22:14,709
constructive solution so another
 

3639
01:22:14,709 --> 01:22:16,140
constructive solution so another
interesting space where security is

3640
01:22:16,140 --> 01:22:16,150
interesting space where security is
 

3641
01:22:16,150 --> 01:22:19,040
interesting space where security is
really important is in in the space of

3642
01:22:19,040 --> 01:22:19,050
really important is in in the space of
 

3643
01:22:19,050 --> 01:22:21,600
really important is in in the space of
any kinds of transactions but it could

3644
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:21,610
any kinds of transactions but it could
 

3645
01:22:21,610 --> 01:22:23,790
any kinds of transactions but it could
be also digital currency so can you

3646
01:22:23,790 --> 01:22:23,800
be also digital currency so can you
 

3647
01:22:23,800 --> 01:22:26,899
be also digital currency so can you
maybe talk a little bit about blockchain

3648
01:22:26,899 --> 01:22:26,909
maybe talk a little bit about blockchain
 

3649
01:22:26,909 --> 01:22:30,270
maybe talk a little bit about blockchain
and can you tell me what is a blockchain

3650
01:22:30,270 --> 01:22:30,280
and can you tell me what is a blockchain
 

3651
01:22:30,280 --> 01:22:34,439
and can you tell me what is a blockchain
I think the brought to you where it

3652
01:22:34,439 --> 01:22:34,449
I think the brought to you where it
 

3653
01:22:34,449 --> 01:22:38,370
I think the brought to you where it
itself is activated overload is in

3654
01:22:38,370 --> 01:22:38,380
itself is activated overload is in
 

3655
01:22:38,380 --> 01:22:41,370
itself is activated overload is in
general it's like AI yes

3656
01:22:41,370 --> 01:22:41,380
general it's like AI yes
 

3657
01:22:41,380 --> 01:22:43,439
general it's like AI yes
so in general I talk about our team we

3658
01:22:43,439 --> 01:22:43,449
so in general I talk about our team we
 

3659
01:22:43,449 --> 01:22:46,319
so in general I talk about our team we
refer to this distributed IJ in a

3660
01:22:46,319 --> 01:22:46,329
refer to this distributed IJ in a
 

3661
01:22:46,329 --> 01:22:48,959
refer to this distributed IJ in a
decentralized fashion so essentially you

3662
01:22:48,959 --> 01:22:48,969
decentralized fashion so essentially you
 

3663
01:22:48,969 --> 01:22:53,759
decentralized fashion so essentially you
have in a community of nose that come

3664
01:22:53,759 --> 01:22:53,769
have in a community of nose that come
 

3665
01:22:53,769 --> 01:22:57,359
have in a community of nose that come
together and even though each one may

3666
01:22:57,359 --> 01:22:57,369
together and even though each one may
 

3667
01:22:57,369 --> 01:23:01,199
together and even though each one may
not be trusted and otherwise certain

3668
01:23:01,199 --> 01:23:01,209
not be trusted and otherwise certain
 

3669
01:23:01,209 --> 01:23:05,580
not be trusted and otherwise certain
thresholds of the set of nodes and he

3670
01:23:05,580 --> 01:23:05,590
thresholds of the set of nodes and he
 

3671
01:23:05,590 --> 01:23:09,810
thresholds of the set of nodes and he
behaves properly then and the system can

3672
01:23:09,810 --> 01:23:09,820
behaves properly then and the system can
 

3673
01:23:09,820 --> 01:23:11,790
behaves properly then and the system can
essentially achieve certain properties

3674
01:23:11,790 --> 01:23:11,800
essentially achieve certain properties
 

3675
01:23:11,800 --> 01:23:14,939
essentially achieve certain properties
for example in the distributed I just I

3676
01:23:14,939 --> 01:23:14,949
for example in the distributed I just I
 

3677
01:23:14,949 --> 01:23:16,949
for example in the distributed I just I
think you have you can maintain a

3678
01:23:16,949 --> 01:23:16,959
think you have you can maintain a
 

3679
01:23:16,959 --> 01:23:22,709
think you have you can maintain a
mutable log and you can ensure that for

3680
01:23:22,709 --> 01:23:22,719
mutable log and you can ensure that for
 

3681
01:23:22,719 --> 01:23:24,629
mutable log and you can ensure that for
some of the transactions actually I'll

3682
01:23:24,629 --> 01:23:24,639
some of the transactions actually I'll
 

3683
01:23:24,639 --> 01:23:26,669
some of the transactions actually I'll
create a pound and then it's immutable

3684
01:23:26,669 --> 01:23:26,679
create a pound and then it's immutable
 

3685
01:23:26,679 --> 01:23:29,189
create a pound and then it's immutable
and so on so first of all what's the

3686
01:23:29,189 --> 01:23:29,199
and so on so first of all what's the
 

3687
01:23:29,199 --> 01:23:31,469
and so on so first of all what's the
ledger so it's a it's like a database

3688
01:23:31,469 --> 01:23:31,479
ledger so it's a it's like a database
 

3689
01:23:31,479 --> 01:23:34,049
ledger so it's a it's like a database
it's like a data entry and so

3690
01:23:34,049 --> 01:23:34,059
it's like a data entry and so
 

3691
01:23:34,059 --> 01:23:35,669
it's like a data entry and so
distributed ledger is something that's

3692
01:23:35,669 --> 01:23:35,679
distributed ledger is something that's
 

3693
01:23:35,679 --> 01:23:39,419
distributed ledger is something that's
maintained across or is synchronized

3694
01:23:39,419 --> 01:23:39,429
maintained across or is synchronized
 

3695
01:23:39,429 --> 01:23:41,549
maintained across or is synchronized
across multiple sources multiple nodes

3696
01:23:41,549 --> 01:23:41,559
across multiple sources multiple nodes
 

3697
01:23:41,559 --> 01:23:44,699
across multiple sources multiple nodes
multiple notes yes and so where is this

3698
01:23:44,699 --> 01:23:44,709
multiple notes yes and so where is this
 

3699
01:23:44,709 --> 01:23:49,080
multiple notes yes and so where is this
idea now how do you keep okay so it's

3700
01:23:49,080 --> 01:23:49,090
idea now how do you keep okay so it's
 

3701
01:23:49,090 --> 01:23:53,779
idea now how do you keep okay so it's
important ledger a database to keep that

3702
01:23:53,779 --> 01:23:53,789
important ledger a database to keep that
 

3703
01:23:53,789 --> 01:23:56,459
important ledger a database to keep that
to make sure so what are the kinds of

3704
01:23:56,459 --> 01:23:56,469
to make sure so what are the kinds of
 

3705
01:23:56,469 --> 01:23:59,939
to make sure so what are the kinds of
security vulnerabilities that you're

3706
01:23:59,939 --> 01:23:59,949
security vulnerabilities that you're
 

3707
01:23:59,949 --> 01:24:02,250
security vulnerabilities that you're
trying to protect against in the context

3708
01:24:02,250 --> 01:24:02,260
trying to protect against in the context
 

3709
01:24:02,260 --> 01:24:02,820
trying to protect against in the context
of this

3710
01:24:02,820 --> 01:24:02,830
of this
 

3711
01:24:02,830 --> 01:24:05,040
of this
the distributed ledger so in this case

3712
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:05,050
the distributed ledger so in this case
 

3713
01:24:05,050 --> 01:24:07,470
the distributed ledger so in this case
for example you don't want to some

3714
01:24:07,470 --> 01:24:07,480
for example you don't want to some
 

3715
01:24:07,480 --> 01:24:10,620
for example you don't want to some
malicious nose to be able to change the

3716
01:24:10,620 --> 01:24:10,630
malicious nose to be able to change the
 

3717
01:24:10,630 --> 01:24:13,980
malicious nose to be able to change the
transaction logs and in certain cases

3718
01:24:13,980 --> 01:24:13,990
transaction logs and in certain cases
 

3719
01:24:13,990 --> 01:24:17,220
transaction logs and in certain cases
account double spending like your also

3720
01:24:17,220 --> 01:24:17,230
account double spending like your also
 

3721
01:24:17,230 --> 01:24:19,230
account double spending like your also
calls you can also cause different views

3722
01:24:19,230 --> 01:24:19,240
calls you can also cause different views
 

3723
01:24:19,240 --> 01:24:22,470
calls you can also cause different views
in different parts of the network and so

3724
01:24:22,470 --> 01:24:22,480
in different parts of the network and so
 

3725
01:24:22,480 --> 01:24:24,570
in different parts of the network and so
on so the ledger has to represent if

3726
01:24:24,570 --> 01:24:24,580
on so the ledger has to represent if
 

3727
01:24:24,580 --> 01:24:26,370
on so the ledger has to represent if
you're capturing like financial

3728
01:24:26,370 --> 01:24:26,380
you're capturing like financial
 

3729
01:24:26,380 --> 01:24:28,830
you're capturing like financial
transactions has to represent the exact

3730
01:24:28,830 --> 01:24:28,840
transactions has to represent the exact
 

3731
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:31,350
transactions has to represent the exact
timing and the exact occurrence and no

3732
01:24:31,350 --> 01:24:31,360
timing and the exact occurrence and no
 

3733
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:33,780
timing and the exact occurrence and no
duplicates all that kind of stuff has to

3734
01:24:33,780 --> 01:24:33,790
duplicates all that kind of stuff has to
 

3735
01:24:33,790 --> 01:24:37,320
duplicates all that kind of stuff has to
be represent what actually happened okay

3736
01:24:37,320 --> 01:24:37,330
be represent what actually happened okay
 

3737
01:24:37,330 --> 01:24:40,950
be represent what actually happened okay
so what are your thoughts on the

3738
01:24:40,950 --> 01:24:40,960
so what are your thoughts on the
 

3739
01:24:40,960 --> 01:24:43,740
so what are your thoughts on the
security and privacy of digital currency

3740
01:24:43,740 --> 01:24:43,750
security and privacy of digital currency
 

3741
01:24:43,750 --> 01:24:46,050
security and privacy of digital currency
I can't tell you how many people write

3742
01:24:46,050 --> 01:24:46,060
I can't tell you how many people write
 

3743
01:24:46,060 --> 01:24:49,650
I can't tell you how many people write
to me to interview various people in the

3744
01:24:49,650 --> 01:24:49,660
to me to interview various people in the
 

3745
01:24:49,660 --> 01:24:52,200
to me to interview various people in the
digital currency space there seems to be

3746
01:24:52,200 --> 01:24:52,210
digital currency space there seems to be
 

3747
01:24:52,210 --> 01:24:55,500
digital currency space there seems to be
a lot of excitement there and it seems

3748
01:24:55,500 --> 01:24:55,510
a lot of excitement there and it seems
 

3749
01:24:55,510 --> 01:24:58,350
a lot of excitement there and it seems
to be some of it to me from an

3750
01:24:58,350 --> 01:24:58,360
to be some of it to me from an
 

3751
01:24:58,360 --> 01:25:00,420
to be some of it to me from an
outsider's perspective seems like dark

3752
01:25:00,420 --> 01:25:00,430
outsider's perspective seems like dark
 

3753
01:25:00,430 --> 01:25:01,140
outsider's perspective seems like dark
magic

3754
01:25:01,140 --> 01:25:01,150
magic
 

3755
01:25:01,150 --> 01:25:07,170
magic
I don't know how secure I think the the

3756
01:25:07,170 --> 01:25:07,180
I don't know how secure I think the the
 

3757
01:25:07,180 --> 01:25:08,940
I don't know how secure I think the the
foundation from my perspective of

3758
01:25:08,940 --> 01:25:08,950
foundation from my perspective of
 

3759
01:25:08,950 --> 01:25:12,090
foundation from my perspective of
digital currencies that is you can't

3760
01:25:12,090 --> 01:25:12,100
digital currencies that is you can't
 

3761
01:25:12,100 --> 01:25:14,220
digital currencies that is you can't
trust anyone so you have to create a

3762
01:25:14,220 --> 01:25:14,230
trust anyone so you have to create a
 

3763
01:25:14,230 --> 01:25:17,250
trust anyone so you have to create a
really secure system so can you maybe

3764
01:25:17,250 --> 01:25:17,260
really secure system so can you maybe
 

3765
01:25:17,260 --> 01:25:20,550
really secure system so can you maybe
speak about how well your thoughts in

3766
01:25:20,550 --> 01:25:20,560
speak about how well your thoughts in
 

3767
01:25:20,560 --> 01:25:22,170
speak about how well your thoughts in
general about digital currency is and

3768
01:25:22,170 --> 01:25:22,180
general about digital currency is and
 

3769
01:25:22,180 --> 01:25:24,620
general about digital currency is and
how you how it can possibly create

3770
01:25:24,620 --> 01:25:24,630
how you how it can possibly create
 

3771
01:25:24,630 --> 01:25:28,440
how you how it can possibly create
financial transactions and financial

3772
01:25:28,440 --> 01:25:28,450
financial transactions and financial
 

3773
01:25:28,450 --> 01:25:31,080
financial transactions and financial
stores of money in the digital space

3774
01:25:31,080 --> 01:25:31,090
stores of money in the digital space
 

3775
01:25:31,090 --> 01:25:36,270
stores of money in the digital space
so you as security and privacy and so so

3776
01:25:36,270 --> 01:25:36,280
so you as security and privacy and so so
 

3777
01:25:36,280 --> 01:25:38,070
so you as security and privacy and so so
again as I mentioned earlier in security

3778
01:25:38,070 --> 01:25:38,080
again as I mentioned earlier in security
 

3779
01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:39,360
again as I mentioned earlier in security
we actually talk about two main

3780
01:25:39,360 --> 01:25:39,370
we actually talk about two main
 

3781
01:25:39,370 --> 01:25:44,280
we actually talk about two main
properties and the integrity and

3782
01:25:44,280 --> 01:25:44,290
properties and the integrity and
 

3783
01:25:44,290 --> 01:25:46,350
properties and the integrity and
confidentiality and so there's another

3784
01:25:46,350 --> 01:25:46,360
confidentiality and so there's another
 

3785
01:25:46,360 --> 01:25:49,620
confidentiality and so there's another
one for availability you want the system

3786
01:25:49,620 --> 01:25:49,630
one for availability you want the system
 

3787
01:25:49,630 --> 01:25:52,110
one for availability you want the system
to be available but here for the

3788
01:25:52,110 --> 01:25:52,120
to be available but here for the
 

3789
01:25:52,120 --> 01:25:54,050
to be available but here for the
question you ask let's just focus on

3790
01:25:54,050 --> 01:25:54,060
question you ask let's just focus on
 

3791
01:25:54,060 --> 01:25:58,050
question you ask let's just focus on
integrity and confidentiality yes so so

3792
01:25:58,050 --> 01:25:58,060
integrity and confidentiality yes so so
 

3793
01:25:58,060 --> 01:26:00,090
integrity and confidentiality yes so so

3794
01:26:00,090 --> 01:26:00,100
for integrity of this distribution
 

3795
01:26:00,100 --> 01:26:02,340
for integrity of this distribution
essentially as we discussed we want to

3796
01:26:02,340 --> 01:26:02,350
essentially as we discussed we want to
 

3797
01:26:02,350 --> 01:26:05,840
essentially as we discussed we want to
ensure that's the different nose and

3798
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:05,850
ensure that's the different nose and
 

3799
01:26:05,850 --> 01:26:08,220
ensure that's the different nose and
right so they have this consistent video

3800
01:26:08,220 --> 01:26:08,230
right so they have this consistent video
 

3801
01:26:08,230 --> 01:26:11,460
right so they have this consistent video
usually it's down through we call a

3802
01:26:11,460 --> 01:26:11,470
usually it's down through we call a
 

3803
01:26:11,470 --> 01:26:14,250
usually it's down through we call a
consensus protocol and that's the

3804
01:26:14,250 --> 01:26:14,260
consensus protocol and that's the
 

3805
01:26:14,260 --> 01:26:15,550
consensus protocol and that's the
establish

3806
01:26:15,550 --> 01:26:15,560

share the view on this leche and that

3808
01:26:19,200 --> 01:26:19,210
share the view on this leche and that
 

3809
01:26:19,210 --> 01:26:22,000
share the view on this leche and that
you cannot go back and change this

3810
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:22,010
you cannot go back and change this
 

3811
01:26:22,010 --> 01:26:26,950
you cannot go back and change this
immutable and so on so so in this case

3812
01:26:26,950 --> 01:26:26,960
immutable and so on so so in this case
 

3813
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:29,710
immutable and so on so so in this case
then the security often refers to this

3814
01:26:29,710 --> 01:26:29,720
then the security often refers to this
 

3815
01:26:29,720 --> 01:26:33,220
then the security often refers to this
integrity property and essentially

3816
01:26:33,220 --> 01:26:33,230
integrity property and essentially
 

3817
01:26:33,230 --> 01:26:35,410
integrity property and essentially
you're asking the question how much work

3818
01:26:35,410 --> 01:26:35,420
you're asking the question how much work
 

3819
01:26:35,420 --> 01:26:39,100
you're asking the question how much work
how how can you attack the system so

3820
01:26:39,100 --> 01:26:39,110
how how can you attack the system so
 

3821
01:26:39,110 --> 01:26:45,160
how how can you attack the system so
that the attacker can change the lock

3822
01:26:45,160 --> 01:26:45,170
that the attacker can change the lock
 

3823
01:26:45,170 --> 01:26:47,500
that the attacker can change the lock
for example right how hard is it to make

3824
01:26:47,500 --> 01:26:47,510
for example right how hard is it to make
 

3825
01:26:47,510 --> 01:26:49,780
for example right how hard is it to make
an attack like that yes right and then

3826
01:26:49,780 --> 01:26:49,790
an attack like that yes right and then
 

3827
01:26:49,790 --> 01:26:52,860
an attack like that yes right and then
that very much depends on the the

3828
01:26:52,860 --> 01:26:52,870
that very much depends on the the
 

3829
01:26:52,870 --> 01:26:55,450
that very much depends on the the
consensus mechanism the how the system

3830
01:26:55,450 --> 01:26:55,460
consensus mechanism the how the system
 

3831
01:26:55,460 --> 01:26:57,970
consensus mechanism the how the system
is built and now that so there are

3832
01:26:57,970 --> 01:26:57,980
is built and now that so there are
 

3833
01:26:57,980 --> 01:27:00,780
is built and now that so there are
different ways to build these

3834
01:27:00,780 --> 01:27:00,790
different ways to build these
 

3835
01:27:00,790 --> 01:27:03,850
different ways to build these
decentralized systems and people may

3836
01:27:03,850 --> 01:27:03,860
decentralized systems and people may
 

3837
01:27:03,860 --> 01:27:05,800
decentralized systems and people may
have heard about the term Scout like

3838
01:27:05,800 --> 01:27:05,810
have heard about the term Scout like
 

3839
01:27:05,810 --> 01:27:07,990
have heard about the term Scout like
proof-of-work you prefer take you this

3840
01:27:07,990 --> 01:27:08,000
proof-of-work you prefer take you this
 

3841
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,570
proof-of-work you prefer take you this
different mechanisms and really depends

3842
01:27:10,570 --> 01:27:10,580
different mechanisms and really depends
 

3843
01:27:10,580 --> 01:27:14,560
different mechanisms and really depends
on how how the system has been built and

3844
01:27:14,560 --> 01:27:14,570
on how how the system has been built and
 

3845
01:27:14,570 --> 01:27:18,370
on how how the system has been built and
also how much resources how much work

3846
01:27:18,370 --> 01:27:18,380
also how much resources how much work
 

3847
01:27:18,380 --> 01:27:22,260
also how much resources how much work
has gone into the network to actually

3848
01:27:22,260 --> 01:27:22,270
has gone into the network to actually
 

3849
01:27:22,270 --> 01:27:25,720
has gone into the network to actually
say how secure it is so for example if

3850
01:27:25,720 --> 01:27:25,730
say how secure it is so for example if
 

3851
01:27:25,730 --> 01:27:27,910
say how secure it is so for example if
you talk about like in the coins for

3852
01:27:27,910 --> 01:27:27,920
you talk about like in the coins for
 

3853
01:27:27,920 --> 01:27:30,340
you talk about like in the coins for
what system is so much electricity it

3854
01:27:30,340 --> 01:27:30,350
what system is so much electricity it
 

3855
01:27:30,350 --> 01:27:31,600
what system is so much electricity it
has been burnt

3856
01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:31,610
has been burnt
 

3857
01:27:31,610 --> 01:27:33,610
has been burnt
so there's differences there's

3858
01:27:33,610 --> 01:27:33,620
so there's differences there's
 

3859
01:27:33,620 --> 01:27:35,170
so there's differences there's
differences in the different mechanisms

3860
01:27:35,170 --> 01:27:35,180
differences in the different mechanisms
 

3861
01:27:35,180 --> 01:27:37,180
differences in the different mechanisms
and the implementations of a distributed

3862
01:27:37,180 --> 01:27:37,190
and the implementations of a distributed
 

3863
01:27:37,190 --> 01:27:40,030
and the implementations of a distributed
ledger used for digital currency also

3864
01:27:40,030 --> 01:27:40,040
ledger used for digital currency also
 

3865
01:27:40,040 --> 01:27:42,700
ledger used for digital currency also
there's Bitcoin is a whatever there's so

3866
01:27:42,700 --> 01:27:42,710
there's Bitcoin is a whatever there's so
 

3867
01:27:42,710 --> 01:27:44,070
there's Bitcoin is a whatever there's so
many of them and there's underlying

3868
01:27:44,070 --> 01:27:44,080
many of them and there's underlying
 

3869
01:27:44,080 --> 01:27:46,330
many of them and there's underlying
different mechanisms and there's

3870
01:27:46,330 --> 01:27:46,340
different mechanisms and there's
 

3871
01:27:46,340 --> 01:27:49,510
different mechanisms and there's
arguments I suppose about which is more

3872
01:27:49,510 --> 01:27:49,520
arguments I suppose about which is more
 

3873
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:52,060
arguments I suppose about which is more
effective which is more secure which is

3874
01:27:52,060 --> 01:27:52,070
effective which is more secure which is
 

3875
01:27:52,070 --> 01:27:57,130
effective which is more secure which is
more what amount of resources needed to

3876
01:27:57,130 --> 01:27:57,140
more what amount of resources needed to
 

3877
01:27:57,140 --> 01:28:00,430
more what amount of resources needed to
be able to attack the system like for

3878
01:28:00,430 --> 01:28:00,440
be able to attack the system like for
 

3879
01:28:00,440 --> 01:28:02,980
be able to attack the system like for
example what percentage of the nose do

3880
01:28:02,980 --> 01:28:02,990
example what percentage of the nose do
 

3881
01:28:02,990 --> 01:28:06,280
example what percentage of the nose do
you need to control our compromise in

3882
01:28:06,280 --> 01:28:06,290
you need to control our compromise in
 

3883
01:28:06,290 --> 01:28:10,090
you need to control our compromise in
order to write to change the log and

3884
01:28:10,090 --> 01:28:10,100
order to write to change the log and
 

3885
01:28:10,100 --> 01:28:12,580
order to write to change the log and
those are things do you do you have a

3886
01:28:12,580 --> 01:28:12,590
those are things do you do you have a
 

3887
01:28:12,590 --> 01:28:13,780
those are things do you do you have a
sense if those are things that can be

3888
01:28:13,780 --> 01:28:13,790
sense if those are things that can be
 

3889
01:28:13,790 --> 01:28:16,630
sense if those are things that can be
shown theoretically through the design

3890
01:28:16,630 --> 01:28:16,640
shown theoretically through the design
 

3891
01:28:16,640 --> 01:28:18,400
shown theoretically through the design
of the mechanisms or does it have to be

3892
01:28:18,400 --> 01:28:18,410
of the mechanisms or does it have to be
 

3893
01:28:18,410 --> 01:28:20,650
of the mechanisms or does it have to be
shown empirically by having a large

3894
01:28:20,650 --> 01:28:20,660
shown empirically by having a large
 

3895
01:28:20,660 --> 01:28:23,920
shown empirically by having a large
number of users using the currency I see

3896
01:28:23,920 --> 01:28:23,930
number of users using the currency I see
 

3897
01:28:23,930 --> 01:28:25,870
number of users using the currency I see
so in general for each consensus

3898
01:28:25,870 --> 01:28:25,880
so in general for each consensus
 

3899
01:28:25,880 --> 01:28:29,229
so in general for each consensus
mechanism you can actually show

3900
01:28:29,229 --> 01:28:29,239
mechanism you can actually show
 

3901
01:28:29,239 --> 01:28:32,529
mechanism you can actually show
theoretically what is needed to be able

3902
01:28:32,529 --> 01:28:32,539
theoretically what is needed to be able
 

3903
01:28:32,539 --> 01:28:35,379
theoretically what is needed to be able
to attack the system of course there are

3904
01:28:35,379 --> 01:28:35,389
to attack the system of course there are
 

3905
01:28:35,389 --> 01:28:37,629
to attack the system of course there are
there can be different types of attacks

3906
01:28:37,629 --> 01:28:37,639
there can be different types of attacks
 

3907
01:28:37,639 --> 01:28:40,689
there can be different types of attacks
as weepy and discuss at the beginning

3908
01:28:40,689 --> 01:28:40,699
as weepy and discuss at the beginning
 

3909
01:28:40,699 --> 01:28:46,140
as weepy and discuss at the beginning
and so that and it's difficult to gave

3910
01:28:46,140 --> 01:28:46,150
and so that and it's difficult to gave
 

3911
01:28:46,150 --> 01:28:50,200
and so that and it's difficult to gave
like you know a complete estimate like

3912
01:28:50,200 --> 01:28:50,210
like you know a complete estimate like
 

3913
01:28:50,210 --> 01:28:53,649
like you know a complete estimate like
really how much is needed to compromise

3914
01:28:53,649 --> 01:28:53,659
really how much is needed to compromise
 

3915
01:28:53,659 --> 01:28:57,100
really how much is needed to compromise
the system but in general right so there

3916
01:28:57,100 --> 01:28:57,110
the system but in general right so there
 

3917
01:28:57,110 --> 01:28:58,600
the system but in general right so there
are ways to say what percentage of the

3918
01:28:58,600 --> 01:28:58,610
are ways to say what percentage of the
 

3919
01:28:58,610 --> 01:29:02,250
are ways to say what percentage of the
knows you need to compromise and so on

3920
01:29:02,250 --> 01:29:02,260
knows you need to compromise and so on
 

3921
01:29:02,260 --> 01:29:05,910
knows you need to compromise and so on
so we talked about integrity so on the

3922
01:29:05,910 --> 01:29:05,920
so we talked about integrity so on the
 

3923
01:29:05,920 --> 01:29:08,589
so we talked about integrity so on the
security side and then you also

3924
01:29:08,589 --> 01:29:08,599
security side and then you also
 

3925
01:29:08,599 --> 01:29:11,350
security side and then you also
mentioned can the privacy or the

3926
01:29:11,350 --> 01:29:11,360
mentioned can the privacy or the
 

3927
01:29:11,360 --> 01:29:14,709
mentioned can the privacy or the
confidentiality side does it have some

3928
01:29:14,709 --> 01:29:14,719
confidentiality side does it have some
 

3929
01:29:14,719 --> 01:29:17,109
confidentiality side does it have some
of does it have some of the same

3930
01:29:17,109 --> 01:29:17,119
of does it have some of the same
 

3931
01:29:17,119 --> 01:29:18,729
of does it have some of the same
problems and therefore some of the same

3932
01:29:18,729 --> 01:29:18,739
problems and therefore some of the same
 

3933
01:29:18,739 --> 01:29:20,680
problems and therefore some of the same
solutions that you talked about and the

3934
01:29:20,680 --> 01:29:20,690
solutions that you talked about and the
 

3935
01:29:20,690 --> 01:29:22,089
solutions that you talked about and the
machine learning side with differential

3936
01:29:22,089 --> 01:29:22,099
machine learning side with differential
 

3937
01:29:22,099 --> 01:29:25,479
machine learning side with differential
privacy and so on yeah so actually in

3938
01:29:25,479 --> 01:29:25,489
privacy and so on yeah so actually in
 

3939
01:29:25,489 --> 01:29:29,910
privacy and so on yeah so actually in
general on the public ledger in this

3940
01:29:29,910 --> 01:29:29,920
general on the public ledger in this
 

3941
01:29:29,920 --> 01:29:32,850
general on the public ledger in this
public decentralized systems and

3942
01:29:32,850 --> 01:29:32,860
public decentralized systems and
 

3943
01:29:32,860 --> 01:29:35,709
public decentralized systems and
actually nothing is private so all the

3944
01:29:35,709 --> 01:29:35,719
actually nothing is private so all the
 

3945
01:29:35,719 --> 01:29:38,069
actually nothing is private so all the

transactions posters on the library
 

3947
01:29:38,079 --> 01:29:41,200
transactions posters on the library
anybody can see so in that sense there

3948
01:29:41,200 --> 01:29:41,210
anybody can see so in that sense there
 

3949
01:29:41,210 --> 01:29:44,680
anybody can see so in that sense there
is no confidentiality and so usually all

3950
01:29:44,680 --> 01:29:44,690
is no confidentiality and so usually all
 

3951
01:29:44,690 --> 01:29:48,549
is no confidentiality and so usually all
you can do is then there are the

3952
01:29:48,549 --> 01:29:48,559
you can do is then there are the
 

3953
01:29:48,559 --> 01:29:50,950
you can do is then there are the
mechanisms that you can built in to

3954
01:29:50,950 --> 01:29:50,960
mechanisms that you can built in to
 

3955
01:29:50,960 --> 01:29:54,310
mechanisms that you can built in to
enable confidentiality are privacy of

3956
01:29:54,310 --> 01:29:54,320
enable confidentiality are privacy of
 

3957
01:29:54,320 --> 01:29:56,319
enable confidentiality are privacy of
the transactions and the data and so on

3958
01:29:56,319 --> 01:29:56,329
the transactions and the data and so on
 

3959
01:29:56,329 --> 01:29:59,310
the transactions and the data and so on
that's also some of the work and that's

3960
01:29:59,310 --> 01:29:59,320
that's also some of the work and that's
 

3961
01:29:59,320 --> 01:30:02,799
that's also some of the work and that's
both my group and also my startup and

3962
01:30:02,799 --> 01:30:02,809
both my group and also my startup and
 

3963
01:30:02,809 --> 01:30:05,620
both my group and also my startup and
does as well what's the name you start o

3964
01:30:05,620 --> 01:30:05,630
does as well what's the name you start o
 

3965
01:30:05,630 --> 01:30:08,529
does as well what's the name you start o
Asus labs Oasis labs and so the

3966
01:30:08,529 --> 01:30:08,539
Asus labs Oasis labs and so the
 

3967
01:30:08,539 --> 01:30:13,060
Asus labs Oasis labs and so the
confidentiality aspect there is even

3968
01:30:13,060 --> 01:30:13,070
confidentiality aspect there is even
 

3969
01:30:13,070 --> 01:30:15,640
confidentiality aspect there is even
though the transactions are public you

3970
01:30:15,640 --> 01:30:15,650
though the transactions are public you
 

3971
01:30:15,650 --> 01:30:18,370
though the transactions are public you
want to keep some aspect confidential of

3972
01:30:18,370 --> 01:30:18,380
want to keep some aspect confidential of
 

3973
01:30:18,380 --> 01:30:20,410
want to keep some aspect confidential of
the identity of the people involved in

3974
01:30:20,410 --> 01:30:20,420
the identity of the people involved in
 

3975
01:30:20,420 --> 01:30:23,080
the identity of the people involved in
the transactions or what what is their

3976
01:30:23,080 --> 01:30:23,090
the transactions or what what is their
 

3977
01:30:23,090 --> 01:30:24,640
the transactions or what what is their
hope to keep confidential in this

3978
01:30:24,640 --> 01:30:24,650
hope to keep confidential in this
 

3979
01:30:24,650 --> 01:30:26,890
hope to keep confidential in this
context so in this case for example you

3980
01:30:26,890 --> 01:30:26,900
context so in this case for example you
 

3981
01:30:26,900 --> 01:30:29,770
context so in this case for example you
want to your nipple like private

3982
01:30:29,770 --> 01:30:29,780
want to your nipple like private
 

3983
01:30:29,780 --> 01:30:33,609
want to your nipple like private
confidential transactions even so so

3984
01:30:33,609 --> 01:30:33,619
confidential transactions even so so
 

3985
01:30:33,619 --> 01:30:35,680
confidential transactions even so so
there are different and essentially

3986
01:30:35,680 --> 01:30:35,690
there are different and essentially
 

3987
01:30:35,690 --> 01:30:38,520
there are different and essentially
types of data that you want to keep

3988
01:30:38,520 --> 01:30:38,530
types of data that you want to keep
 

3989
01:30:38,530 --> 01:30:41,620
types of data that you want to keep
private are confidential and you can

3990
01:30:41,620 --> 01:30:41,630
private are confidential and you can
 

3991
01:30:41,630 --> 01:30:43,180
private are confidential and you can
utilize different technologies

3992
01:30:43,180 --> 01:30:43,190
utilize different technologies
 

3993
01:30:43,190 --> 01:30:46,750
utilize different technologies
including your knowledge proofs and also

3994
01:30:46,750 --> 01:30:46,760
including your knowledge proofs and also
 

3995
01:30:46,760 --> 01:30:51,160
including your knowledge proofs and also
secure computing and techniques and to

3996
01:30:51,160 --> 01:30:51,170
secure computing and techniques and to
 

3997
01:30:51,170 --> 01:30:55,360
secure computing and techniques and to
hide the right who is making the

3998
01:30:55,360 --> 01:30:55,370
hide the right who is making the
 

3999
01:30:55,370 --> 01:30:57,400
hide the right who is making the
transactions to whom and the transaction

4000
01:30:57,400 --> 01:30:57,410
transactions to whom and the transaction
 

4001
01:30:57,410 --> 01:31:00,010
transactions to whom and the transaction
amount and in our case also we can

4002
01:31:00,010 --> 01:31:00,020
amount and in our case also we can
 

4003
01:31:00,020 --> 01:31:02,560
amount and in our case also we can
enable like confidential smart contracts

4004
01:31:02,560 --> 01:31:02,570
enable like confidential smart contracts
 

4005
01:31:02,570 --> 01:31:05,860
enable like confidential smart contracts
and so that's you don't know the data

4006
01:31:05,860 --> 01:31:05,870
and so that's you don't know the data
 

4007
01:31:05,870 --> 01:31:08,380
and so that's you don't know the data
and the execution of the smart contract

4008
01:31:08,380 --> 01:31:08,390
and the execution of the smart contract
 

4009
01:31:08,390 --> 01:31:12,400
and the execution of the smart contract
and so on and we actually are combining

4010
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:12,410
and so on and we actually are combining
 

4011
01:31:12,410 --> 01:31:15,100
and so on and we actually are combining
these different technologies and to

4012
01:31:15,100 --> 01:31:15,110
these different technologies and to
 

4013
01:31:15,110 --> 01:31:17,950
these different technologies and to
going back to the earlier discussion we

4014
01:31:17,950 --> 01:31:17,960
going back to the earlier discussion we
 

4015
01:31:17,960 --> 01:31:24,120
going back to the earlier discussion we
had enabling like ownership of data and

4016
01:31:24,120 --> 01:31:24,130
had enabling like ownership of data and
 

4017
01:31:24,130 --> 01:31:28,030
had enabling like ownership of data and
privacy of data and so on so so at Oasis

4018
01:31:28,030 --> 01:31:28,040
privacy of data and so on so so at Oasis
 

4019
01:31:28,040 --> 01:31:30,010
privacy of data and so on so so at Oasis
labs we're actually building what we

4020
01:31:30,010 --> 01:31:30,020
labs we're actually building what we
 

4021
01:31:30,020 --> 01:31:32,230
labs we're actually building what we
call a platform for responsible data

4022
01:31:32,230 --> 01:31:32,240
call a platform for responsible data
 

4023
01:31:32,240 --> 01:31:34,540
call a platform for responsible data
economy to actually combine these

4024
01:31:34,540 --> 01:31:34,550
economy to actually combine these
 

4025
01:31:34,550 --> 01:31:37,600
economy to actually combine these
different technologies together and to

4026
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:37,610
different technologies together and to
 

4027
01:31:37,610 --> 01:31:40,680
different technologies together and to
enable secure and privacy-preserving

4028
01:31:40,680 --> 01:31:40,690
enable secure and privacy-preserving
 

4029
01:31:40,690 --> 01:31:46,090
enable secure and privacy-preserving
computation and also using the library

4030
01:31:46,090 --> 01:31:46,100
computation and also using the library
 

4031
01:31:46,100 --> 01:31:49,990
computation and also using the library
to help provide immutable log of users

4032
01:31:49,990 --> 01:31:50,000
to help provide immutable log of users
 

4033
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,840
to help provide immutable log of users
ownership to their data and the policies

4034
01:31:52,840 --> 01:31:52,850
ownership to their data and the policies
 

4035
01:31:52,850 --> 01:31:55,630
ownership to their data and the policies
they want the data to adhere to the

4036
01:31:55,630 --> 01:31:55,640
they want the data to adhere to the
 

4037
01:31:55,640 --> 01:31:57,910
they want the data to adhere to the
usage of the data to adhere to and also

4038
01:31:57,910 --> 01:31:57,920
usage of the data to adhere to and also
 

4039
01:31:57,920 --> 01:32:00,640
usage of the data to adhere to and also
how that it has been utilized so all

4040
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:00,650
how that it has been utilized so all
 

4041
01:32:00,650 --> 01:32:03,580
how that it has been utilized so all
this together can build we can a

4042
01:32:03,580 --> 01:32:03,590
this together can build we can a
 

4043
01:32:03,590 --> 01:32:07,000
this together can build we can a
distributed secure computing fabric that

4044
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:07,010
distributed secure computing fabric that
 

4045
01:32:07,010 --> 01:32:10,030
distributed secure computing fabric that
helps to enable a more responsible data

4046
01:32:10,030 --> 01:32:10,040
helps to enable a more responsible data
 

4047
01:32:10,040 --> 01:32:12,910
helps to enable a more responsible data
economy other things together yeah wow

4048
01:32:12,910 --> 01:32:12,920
economy other things together yeah wow
 

4049

those eloquent okay you're involved in

4050
01:32:16,630 --> 01:32:16,640
those eloquent okay you're involved in
 

4051
01:32:16,640 --> 01:32:18,790
those eloquent okay you're involved in
so much amazing work that we'll never be

4052
01:32:18,790 --> 01:32:18,800
so much amazing work that we'll never be
 

4053
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:20,590
so much amazing work that we'll never be
able to get to but I have to ask at

4054
01:32:20,590 --> 01:32:20,600
able to get to but I have to ask at
 

4055
01:32:20,600 --> 01:32:23,290
able to get to but I have to ask at
least briefly about program synthesis

4056
01:32:23,290 --> 01:32:23,300
least briefly about program synthesis
 

4057
01:32:23,300 --> 01:32:26,220
least briefly about program synthesis
which at least in a philosophical sense

4058
01:32:26,220 --> 01:32:26,230
which at least in a philosophical sense
 

4059
01:32:26,230 --> 01:32:29,770
which at least in a philosophical sense
captures much of the dreams of what's

4060
01:32:29,770 --> 01:32:29,780
captures much of the dreams of what's
 

4061
01:32:29,780 --> 01:32:32,020
captures much of the dreams of what's
possible in computer science and the

4062
01:32:32,020 --> 01:32:32,030
possible in computer science and the
 

4063
01:32:32,030 --> 01:32:35,440
possible in computer science and the
artificial intelligence first let me ask

4064
01:32:35,440 --> 01:32:35,450
artificial intelligence first let me ask
 

4065
01:32:35,450 --> 01:32:38,470
artificial intelligence first let me ask
what is program synthesis and can ural

4066
01:32:38,470 --> 01:32:38,480
what is program synthesis and can ural
 

4067
01:32:38,480 --> 01:32:40,900
what is program synthesis and can ural
networks be used to learn programs from

4068
01:32:40,900 --> 01:32:40,910
networks be used to learn programs from
 

4069
01:32:40,910 --> 01:32:44,290
networks be used to learn programs from
data so can this be learned some aspect

4070
01:32:44,290 --> 01:32:44,300
data so can this be learned some aspect
 

4071
01:32:44,300 --> 01:32:47,200
data so can this be learned some aspect
of this synthesis can it be learned so

4072
01:32:47,200 --> 01:32:47,210
of this synthesis can it be learned so
 

4073
01:32:47,210 --> 01:32:48,910
of this synthesis can it be learned so
program synthesis is about teaching

4074
01:32:48,910 --> 01:32:48,920
program synthesis is about teaching
 

4075
01:32:48,920 --> 01:32:53,650
program synthesis is about teaching
computers to write code to program and I

4076
01:32:53,650 --> 01:32:53,660
computers to write code to program and I
 

4077
01:32:53,660 --> 01:32:56,950
computers to write code to program and I
think it has one of our ultimate

4078
01:32:56,950 --> 01:32:56,960
think it has one of our ultimate
 

4079
01:32:56,960 --> 01:33:02,700
think it has one of our ultimate
dreams or goals and you know I think

4080
01:33:02,700 --> 01:33:02,710
dreams or goals and you know I think
 

4081
01:33:02,710 --> 01:33:04,930
dreams or goals and you know I think
Andreessen talked about software eating

4082
01:33:04,930 --> 01:33:04,940
Andreessen talked about software eating
 

4083
01:33:04,940 --> 01:33:08,200
Andreessen talked about software eating
the world so I say once we teach

4084
01:33:08,200 --> 01:33:08,210
the world so I say once we teach
 

4085
01:33:08,210 --> 01:33:10,750
the world so I say once we teach
computers to write software

4086
01:33:10,750 --> 01:33:10,760
computers to write software
 

4087
01:33:10,760 --> 01:33:13,479
computers to write software
I had to write programs then I guess

4088
01:33:13,479 --> 01:33:13,489
I had to write programs then I guess
 

4089
01:33:13,489 --> 01:33:19,660
I had to write programs then I guess
computers yeah exactly so yeah and also

4090
01:33:19,660 --> 01:33:19,670
computers yeah exactly so yeah and also
 

4091
01:33:19,670 --> 01:33:21,250
computers yeah exactly so yeah and also
for me actually

4092
01:33:21,250 --> 01:33:21,260
for me actually
 

4093
01:33:21,260 --> 01:33:26,680
for me actually
um when I you know shifted from security

4094
01:33:26,680 --> 01:33:26,690
um when I you know shifted from security
 

4095
01:33:26,690 --> 01:33:30,220
um when I you know shifted from security

01:33:47,560 --> 01:33:47,570
the security side there's a you know
 

4111
01:33:47,570 --> 01:33:49,450
the security side there's a you know
you're looking for holes and programs so

4112
01:33:49,450 --> 01:33:49,460
you're looking for holes and programs so
 

4113
01:33:49,460 --> 01:33:52,090
you're looking for holes and programs so
as at least see small connection but why

4114
01:33:52,090 --> 01:33:52,100
as at least see small connection but why
 

4115
01:33:52,100 --> 01:33:54,490
as at least see small connection but why
what was your interest for program

4116
01:33:54,490 --> 01:33:54,500
what was your interest for program
 

4117
01:33:54,500 --> 01:33:56,979
what was your interest for program
synthesis as because it's such a

4118
01:33:56,979 --> 01:33:56,989
synthesis as because it's such a
 

4119
01:33:56,989 --> 01:33:58,959
synthesis as because it's such a
fascinating such a big such a hard

4120
01:33:58,959 --> 01:33:58,969
fascinating such a big such a hard
 

4121
01:33:58,969 --> 01:34:01,930
fascinating such a big such a hard
problem in the general case why program

4122
01:34:01,930 --> 01:34:01,940
problem in the general case why program
 

4123
01:34:01,940 --> 01:34:04,270
problem in the general case why program
synthesis so the reason for that is

4124
01:34:04,270 --> 01:34:04,280
synthesis so the reason for that is
 

4125
01:34:04,280 --> 01:34:07,050
synthesis so the reason for that is
actually when I shifted my focus from

4126
01:34:07,050 --> 01:34:07,060
actually when I shifted my focus from
 

4127
01:34:07,060 --> 01:34:12,240
actually when I shifted my focus from
security into AI machine learning and

4128
01:34:12,240 --> 01:34:12,250
security into AI machine learning and
 

4129
01:34:12,250 --> 01:34:14,620
security into AI machine learning and
actually one of my main motivation at

4130
01:34:14,620 --> 01:34:14,630
actually one of my main motivation at
 

4131
01:34:14,630 --> 01:34:17,979
actually one of my main motivation at
the time and is that even though I have

4132
01:34:17,979 --> 01:34:17,989
the time and is that even though I have
 

4133
01:34:17,989 --> 01:34:19,510
the time and is that even though I have
been doing a lot of working security and

4134
01:34:19,510 --> 01:34:19,520
been doing a lot of working security and
 

4135
01:34:19,520 --> 01:34:21,070
been doing a lot of working security and
privacy but I have always been

4136
01:34:21,070 --> 01:34:21,080
privacy but I have always been
 

4137
01:34:21,080 --> 01:34:25,270
privacy but I have always been
fascinated about beauty intelligent

4138
01:34:25,270 --> 01:34:25,280
fascinated about beauty intelligent
 

4139
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:28,810
fascinated about beauty intelligent
machines and that was really my main

4140
01:34:28,810 --> 01:34:28,820
machines and that was really my main
 

4141
01:34:28,820 --> 01:34:31,690
machines and that was really my main
motivation to spend more time in AI am a

4142
01:34:31,690 --> 01:34:31,700
motivation to spend more time in AI am a
 

4143
01:34:31,700 --> 01:34:34,930
motivation to spend more time in AI am a
Shalini is as I really want to figure

4144
01:34:34,930 --> 01:34:34,940
Shalini is as I really want to figure
 

4145
01:34:34,940 --> 01:34:36,729
Shalini is as I really want to figure
out how we can build intelligent

4146
01:34:36,729 --> 01:34:36,739
out how we can build intelligent
 

4147
01:34:36,739 --> 01:34:42,160
out how we can build intelligent
machines and to help us towards that

4148
01:34:42,160 --> 01:34:42,170
machines and to help us towards that
 

4149
01:34:42,170 --> 01:34:45,100
machines and to help us towards that
goal program synthesis is really one

4150
01:34:45,100 --> 01:34:45,110
goal program synthesis is really one
 

4151
01:34:45,110 --> 01:34:48,280
goal program synthesis is really one
enough I would say the best domain to

4152
01:34:48,280 --> 01:34:48,290
enough I would say the best domain to
 

4153
01:34:48,290 --> 01:34:50,680
enough I would say the best domain to
work on I actually call it's like

4154
01:34:50,680 --> 01:34:50,690
work on I actually call it's like
 

4155
01:34:50,690 --> 01:34:52,900
work on I actually call it's like
programming synthesis it's like the

4156
01:34:52,900 --> 01:34:52,910
programming synthesis it's like the
 

4157
01:34:52,910 --> 01:34:56,470
programming synthesis it's like the
perfect playground for building

4158
01:34:56,470 --> 01:34:56,480
perfect playground for building
 

4159
01:34:56,480 --> 01:34:57,910
perfect playground for building
intelligent machines therefore

4160
01:34:57,910 --> 01:34:57,920
intelligent machines therefore
 

4161
01:34:57,920 --> 01:35:00,479
intelligent machines therefore
artificial general intelligence yeah um

4162
01:35:00,479 --> 01:35:00,489
artificial general intelligence yeah um
 

4163
01:35:00,489 --> 01:35:03,610
artificial general intelligence yeah um
well it's also in that sense not just a

4164
01:35:03,610 --> 01:35:03,620
well it's also in that sense not just a
 

4165
01:35:03,620 --> 01:35:05,440
well it's also in that sense not just a
playground I guess it's it's the

4166
01:35:05,440 --> 01:35:05,450
playground I guess it's it's the
 

4167
01:35:05,450 --> 01:35:06,940
playground I guess it's it's the
ultimate test of intelligence because

4168
01:35:06,940 --> 01:35:06,950
ultimate test of intelligence because
 

4169
01:35:06,950 --> 01:35:10,330
ultimate test of intelligence because
yes I think I think

4170
01:35:10,330 --> 01:35:10,340
yes I think I think
 

4171
01:35:10,340 --> 01:35:13,350
yes I think I think
you can generate so neural networks can

4172
01:35:13,350 --> 01:35:13,360
you can generate so neural networks can
 

4173
01:35:13,360 --> 01:35:16,149
you can generate so neural networks can
learn good functions and they can help

4174
01:35:16,149 --> 01:35:16,159
learn good functions and they can help
 

4175
01:35:16,159 --> 01:35:19,390
learn good functions and they can help
y'all in classification tasks but to be

4176
01:35:19,390 --> 01:35:19,400
y'all in classification tasks but to be
 

4177
01:35:19,400 --> 01:35:21,879
y'all in classification tasks but to be
able to write programs right that's

4178
01:35:21,879 --> 01:35:21,889
able to write programs right that's
 

4179
01:35:21,889 --> 01:35:24,729
able to write programs right that's
that's the epitome from the machine side

4180
01:35:24,729 --> 01:35:24,739
that's the epitome from the machine side
 

4181
01:35:24,739 --> 01:35:26,260
that's the epitome from the machine side
that's the same as passing the Turing

4182
01:35:26,260 --> 01:35:26,270
that's the same as passing the Turing
 

4183
01:35:26,270 --> 01:35:28,600
that's the same as passing the Turing
test and natural language but with

4184
01:35:28,600 --> 01:35:28,610
test and natural language but with
 

4185
01:35:28,610 --> 01:35:30,189
test and natural language but with
programs it's able to express

4186
01:35:30,189 --> 01:35:30,199
programs it's able to express
 

4187
01:35:30,199 --> 01:35:32,859
programs it's able to express
complicated ideas to reason through

4188
01:35:32,859 --> 01:35:32,869
complicated ideas to reason through
 

4189
01:35:32,869 --> 01:35:36,970
complicated ideas to reason through
ideas and yeah and boil them down to

4190
01:35:36,970 --> 01:35:36,980
ideas and yeah and boil them down to
 

4191
01:35:36,980 --> 01:35:39,700
ideas and yeah and boil them down to
algorithms yes exactly is that credible

4192
01:35:39,700 --> 01:35:39,710
algorithms yes exactly is that credible
 

4193
01:35:39,710 --> 01:35:42,879
algorithms yes exactly is that credible
so can this be learned how far are we

4194
01:35:42,879 --> 01:35:42,889
so can this be learned how far are we
 

4195
01:35:42,889 --> 01:35:45,430
so can this be learned how far are we
is there hope what are the open

4196
01:35:45,430 --> 01:35:45,440
is there hope what are the open
 

4197
01:35:45,440 --> 01:35:49,060
is there hope what are the open
challenges questions and we're still at

4198
01:35:49,060 --> 01:35:49,070
challenges questions and we're still at
 

4199
01:35:49,070 --> 01:35:52,180
challenges questions and we're still at
an early stage but already I think you

4200
01:35:52,180 --> 01:35:52,190
an early stage but already I think you
 

4201
01:35:52,190 --> 01:35:56,500
an early stage but already I think you
we have seen a lot of progress I mean

4202
01:35:56,500 --> 01:35:56,510
we have seen a lot of progress I mean
 

4203
01:35:56,510 --> 01:35:58,870
we have seen a lot of progress I mean
definitely we have you know existence

4204
01:35:58,870 --> 01:35:58,880
definitely we have you know existence
 

4205
01:35:58,880 --> 01:36:01,240
definitely we have you know existence
proof just like the humans can write

4206
01:36:01,240 --> 01:36:01,250
proof just like the humans can write
 

4207
01:36:01,250 --> 01:36:03,100
proof just like the humans can write
programs so there's no reason why

4208
01:36:03,100 --> 01:36:03,110
programs so there's no reason why
 

4209
01:36:03,110 --> 01:36:06,280
programs so there's no reason why
computers cannot write programs and so I

4210
01:36:06,280 --> 01:36:06,290
computers cannot write programs and so I
 

4211
01:36:06,290 --> 01:36:08,229
computers cannot write programs and so I
think that's definitely an achievable

4212
01:36:08,229 --> 01:36:08,239
think that's definitely an achievable
 

4213
01:36:08,239 --> 01:36:10,810
think that's definitely an achievable
goal it's just how long it takes and

4214
01:36:10,810 --> 01:36:10,820
goal it's just how long it takes and
 

4215
01:36:10,820 --> 01:36:17,020
goal it's just how long it takes and
then and even today we actually have you

4216
01:36:17,020 --> 01:36:17,030
then and even today we actually have you
 

4217
01:36:17,030 --> 01:36:19,419
then and even today we actually have you
know the program synthesis community

4218
01:36:19,419 --> 01:36:19,429
know the program synthesis community
 

4219
01:36:19,429 --> 01:36:22,000
know the program synthesis community
especially the program synthesis by

4220
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:22,010
especially the program synthesis by
 

4221
01:36:22,010 --> 01:36:24,040
especially the program synthesis by
learning our way College neural program

4222
01:36:24,040 --> 01:36:24,050
learning our way College neural program
 

4223
01:36:24,050 --> 01:36:26,160
learning our way College neural program
synthesis community is still very small

4224
01:36:26,160 --> 01:36:26,170
synthesis community is still very small
 

4225
01:36:26,170 --> 01:36:28,570
synthesis community is still very small
but the community has been growing and

4226
01:36:28,570 --> 01:36:28,580
but the community has been growing and
 

4227
01:36:28,580 --> 01:36:32,530
but the community has been growing and
we have seen a lot of progress and in

4228
01:36:32,530 --> 01:36:32,540
we have seen a lot of progress and in
 

4229
01:36:32,540 --> 01:36:36,070
we have seen a lot of progress and in
limited domains I think actually program

4230
01:36:36,070 --> 01:36:36,080
limited domains I think actually program
 

4231
01:36:36,080 --> 01:36:39,220
limited domains I think actually program
synthesis is ripe for real-world

4232
01:36:39,220 --> 01:36:39,230
synthesis is ripe for real-world
 

4233
01:36:39,230 --> 01:36:42,189
synthesis is ripe for real-world
applications so actually was kind of

4234
01:36:42,189 --> 01:36:42,199
applications so actually was kind of
 

4235
01:36:42,199 --> 01:36:46,689
applications so actually was kind of
amazing I was at giving a talk it's also

4236
01:36:46,689 --> 01:36:46,699
amazing I was at giving a talk it's also
 

4237
01:36:46,699 --> 01:36:49,600
amazing I was at giving a talk it's also
here it's a rework we worked you

4238
01:36:49,600 --> 01:36:49,610
here it's a rework we worked you
 

4239
01:36:49,610 --> 01:36:51,490
here it's a rework we worked you
planning something actually so I give

4240
01:36:51,490 --> 01:36:51,500
planning something actually so I give
 

4241
01:36:51,500 --> 01:36:53,830
planning something actually so I give
another talk at the previously rework

4242
01:36:53,830 --> 01:36:53,840
another talk at the previously rework
 

4243
01:36:53,840 --> 01:36:56,200
another talk at the previously rework
conference in deep reinforcement

4244
01:36:56,200 --> 01:36:56,210
conference in deep reinforcement
 

4245
01:36:56,210 --> 01:37:00,129
conference in deep reinforcement
learning and then I actually met someone

4246
01:37:00,129 --> 01:37:00,139
learning and then I actually met someone
 

4247
01:37:00,139 --> 01:37:03,609
learning and then I actually met someone
from a startup and the CEO of the

4248
01:37:03,609 --> 01:37:03,619
from a startup and the CEO of the
 

4249
01:37:03,619 --> 01:37:05,859
from a startup and the CEO of the
startup and when he saw my name he

4250
01:37:05,859 --> 01:37:05,869
startup and when he saw my name he
 

4251
01:37:05,869 --> 01:37:09,160
startup and when he saw my name he
recognized and he actually said one of

4252
01:37:09,160 --> 01:37:09,170
recognized and he actually said one of
 

4253
01:37:09,170 --> 01:37:13,510
recognized and he actually said one of
our papers actually had they have put

4254
01:37:13,510 --> 01:37:13,520
our papers actually had they have put
 

4255
01:37:13,520 --> 01:37:19,350
our papers actually had they have put
the had actually become a key products

4256
01:37:19,350 --> 01:37:19,360
the had actually become a key products
 

4257
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:22,990
the had actually become a key products
and that was program synthesis in that

4258
01:37:22,990 --> 01:37:23,000
and that was program synthesis in that
 

4259
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:24,160
and that was program synthesis in that
particular case it was

4260
01:37:24,160 --> 01:37:24,170
particular case it was
 

4261
01:37:24,170 --> 01:37:28,450
particular case it was

Cory's oh wow that that direction

4266
01:37:34,510 --> 01:37:34,520
Cory's oh wow that that direction
 

4267
01:37:34,520 --> 01:37:38,740
Cory's oh wow that that direction
okay right so yeah so you program since

4268
01:37:38,740 --> 01:37:38,750
okay right so yeah so you program since
 

4269
01:37:38,750 --> 01:37:40,990
okay right so yeah so you program since
this is in limited domains in well

4270
01:37:40,990 --> 01:37:41,000
this is in limited domains in well
 

4271
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:43,960
this is in limited domains in well
specified domains actually already we

4272
01:37:43,960 --> 01:37:43,970
specified domains actually already we
 

4273
01:37:43,970 --> 01:37:48,910
specified domains actually already we
can see really great great progress and

4274
01:37:48,910 --> 01:37:48,920
can see really great great progress and
 

4275
01:37:48,920 --> 01:37:52,300
can see really great great progress and
applicability in the real roads so

4276
01:37:52,300 --> 01:37:52,310
applicability in the real roads so
 

4277
01:37:52,310 --> 01:37:54,970
applicability in the real roads so
domains like as an example you said

4278
01:37:54,970 --> 01:37:54,980
domains like as an example you said
 

4279
01:37:54,980 --> 01:37:56,740
domains like as an example you said
natural language being able to express

4280
01:37:56,740 --> 01:37:56,750
natural language being able to express
 

4281
01:37:56,750 --> 01:37:59,470
natural language being able to express
something to just normal language and it

4282
01:37:59,470 --> 01:37:59,480
something to just normal language and it
 

4283
01:37:59,480 --> 01:38:01,900
something to just normal language and it
converts it into a database sequel SQL

4284
01:38:01,900 --> 01:38:01,910
converts it into a database sequel SQL
 

4285
01:38:01,910 --> 01:38:06,580
converts it into a database sequel SQL
query right and that's how how solve the

4286
01:38:06,580 --> 01:38:06,590
query right and that's how how solve the
 

4287
01:38:06,590 --> 01:38:08,380
query right and that's how how solve the
problem is that because that seems like

4288
01:38:08,380 --> 01:38:08,390
problem is that because that seems like
 

4289
01:38:08,390 --> 01:38:11,200
problem is that because that seems like
a really hard problem okay eliminate

4290
01:38:11,200 --> 01:38:11,210
a really hard problem okay eliminate
 

4291
01:38:11,210 --> 01:38:14,310
a really hard problem okay eliminate
domains actually it can work pretty well

4292
01:38:14,310 --> 01:38:14,320
domains actually it can work pretty well
 

4293
01:38:14,320 --> 01:38:16,810
domains actually it can work pretty well
and now this is also a very active

4294
01:38:16,810 --> 01:38:16,820
and now this is also a very active
 

4295
01:38:16,820 --> 01:38:19,780
and now this is also a very active
domain after research at the time I

4296
01:38:19,780 --> 01:38:19,790
domain after research at the time I
 

4297
01:38:19,790 --> 01:38:21,190
domain after research at the time I
think one he saw our paper at the time

4298
01:38:21,190 --> 01:38:21,200
think one he saw our paper at the time
 

4299
01:38:21,200 --> 01:38:25,030
think one he saw our paper at the time
we were the state of the Arts yeah and

4300
01:38:25,030 --> 01:38:25,040
we were the state of the Arts yeah and
 

4301
01:38:25,040 --> 01:38:26,860
we were the state of the Arts yeah and
that task and since then actually now

4302
01:38:26,860 --> 01:38:26,870
that task and since then actually now
 

4303
01:38:26,870 --> 01:38:30,420
that task and since then actually now
there has been more work and with even

4304
01:38:30,420 --> 01:38:30,430
there has been more work and with even
 

4305
01:38:30,430 --> 01:38:37,360
there has been more work and with even
more sophisticated assets and so but I I

4306
01:38:37,360 --> 01:38:37,370
more sophisticated assets and so but I I
 

4307
01:38:37,370 --> 01:38:38,950
more sophisticated assets and so but I I
think I wouldn't be surprised that's

4308
01:38:38,950 --> 01:38:38,960
think I wouldn't be surprised that's
 

4309
01:38:38,960 --> 01:38:41,410
think I wouldn't be surprised that's
more of this type of technology really

4310
01:38:41,410 --> 01:38:41,420
more of this type of technology really
 

4311
01:38:41,420 --> 01:38:43,360
more of this type of technology really
getting to the real worlds that's

4312
01:38:43,360 --> 01:38:43,370
getting to the real worlds that's
 

4313
01:38:43,370 --> 01:38:45,640
getting to the real worlds that's
exciting in the near term being able to

4314
01:38:45,640 --> 01:38:45,650
exciting in the near term being able to
 

4315
01:38:45,650 --> 01:38:49,270
exciting in the near term being able to
learn in the space of programs is super

4316
01:38:49,270 --> 01:38:49,280
learn in the space of programs is super
 

4317
01:38:49,280 --> 01:38:52,210
learn in the space of programs is super
exciting I still yeah I'm still

4318
01:38:52,210 --> 01:38:52,220
exciting I still yeah I'm still
 

4319
01:38:52,220 --> 01:38:54,070
exciting I still yeah I'm still
skeptical because I think it's a really

4320
01:38:54,070 --> 01:38:54,080
skeptical because I think it's a really
 

4321
01:38:54,080 --> 01:38:57,190
skeptical because I think it's a really
hard problem progress and also I think

4322
01:38:57,190 --> 01:38:57,200
hard problem progress and also I think
 

4323
01:38:57,200 --> 01:38:59,620
hard problem progress and also I think
in terms of the your ass about open

4324
01:38:59,620 --> 01:38:59,630
in terms of the your ass about open
 

4325
01:38:59,630 --> 01:39:03,100
in terms of the your ass about open
challenges I think the domain is full of

4326
01:39:03,100 --> 01:39:03,110
challenges I think the domain is full of
 

4327
01:39:03,110 --> 01:39:06,160
challenges I think the domain is full of
challenges and in particular also we

4328
01:39:06,160 --> 01:39:06,170
challenges and in particular also we
 

4329
01:39:06,170 --> 01:39:07,690
challenges and in particular also we
want to see how we should measure the

4330
01:39:07,690 --> 01:39:07,700
want to see how we should measure the
 

4331
01:39:07,700 --> 01:39:11,170
want to see how we should measure the
progress in the space and I would say

4332
01:39:11,170 --> 01:39:11,180
progress in the space and I would say
 

4333
01:39:11,180 --> 01:39:16,870
progress in the space and I would say
mainly three main I'll say metrics so

4334
01:39:16,870 --> 01:39:16,880
mainly three main I'll say metrics so
 

4335
01:39:16,880 --> 01:39:18,760
mainly three main I'll say metrics so
one is a complexity of the program that

4336
01:39:18,760 --> 01:39:18,770
one is a complexity of the program that
 

4337
01:39:18,770 --> 01:39:20,800
one is a complexity of the program that
we can synthesize and that will actually

4338
01:39:20,800 --> 01:39:20,810
we can synthesize and that will actually
 

4339
01:39:20,810 --> 01:39:23,800
we can synthesize and that will actually
have clear measures and just look at you

4340
01:39:23,800 --> 01:39:23,810
have clear measures and just look at you
 

4341
01:39:23,810 --> 01:39:26,710
have clear measures and just look at you
know the past publications and even like

4342
01:39:26,710 --> 01:39:26,720
know the past publications and even like
 

4343
01:39:26,720 --> 01:39:29,250
know the past publications and even like
for example I was at the recent Europe's

4344
01:39:29,250 --> 01:39:29,260
for example I was at the recent Europe's
 

4345
01:39:29,260 --> 01:39:31,890
for example I was at the recent Europe's
conference now there is actually very

4346
01:39:31,890 --> 01:39:31,900
conference now there is actually very
 

4347
01:39:31,900 --> 01:39:34,480
conference now there is actually very
sizable like session dedicated to

4348
01:39:34,480 --> 01:39:34,490
sizable like session dedicated to
 

4349
01:39:34,490 --> 01:39:36,280
sizable like session dedicated to
program since this is vicious or even

4350
01:39:36,280 --> 01:39:36,290
program since this is vicious or even
 

4351
01:39:36,290 --> 01:39:37,930
program since this is vicious or even
neural progress today

4352
01:39:37,930 --> 01:39:37,940
neural progress today
 

4353
01:39:37,940 --> 01:39:40,660
neural progress today
which is great and and we continue to

4354
01:39:40,660 --> 01:39:40,670
which is great and and we continue to
 

4355
01:39:40,670 --> 01:39:47,140
which is great and and we continue to
see the increase like I think they were

4356
01:39:47,140 --> 01:39:47,150
see the increase like I think they were
 

4357
01:39:47,150 --> 01:39:54,820
see the increase like I think they were
sizable it's five people and they will

4358
01:39:54,820 --> 01:39:54,830
sizable it's five people and they will
 

4359
01:39:54,830 --> 01:39:58,170
sizable it's five people and they will
all win touring awards one day like it

4360
01:39:58,170 --> 01:39:58,180
all win touring awards one day like it
 

4361
01:39:58,180 --> 01:40:03,729
all win touring awards one day like it
so we can see increase in the complexity

4362
01:40:03,729 --> 01:40:03,739
so we can see increase in the complexity
 

4363
01:40:03,739 --> 01:40:08,709
so we can see increase in the complexity
of the program is that these synthesized

4364
01:40:08,709 --> 01:40:08,719
of the program is that these synthesized
 

4365
01:40:08,719 --> 01:40:11,590
of the program is that these synthesized
sorry - is it the complexity of the

4366
01:40:11,590 --> 01:40:11,600
sorry - is it the complexity of the
 

4367
01:40:11,600 --> 01:40:13,420
sorry - is it the complexity of the
actual text of the program or the

4368
01:40:13,420 --> 01:40:13,430
actual text of the program or the
 

4369
01:40:13,430 --> 01:40:16,120
actual text of the program or the
running time complexity which complexity

4370
01:40:16,120 --> 01:40:16,130
running time complexity which complexity
 

4371
01:40:16,130 --> 01:40:20,920
running time complexity which complexity
over how complexity after task to be

4372
01:40:20,920 --> 01:40:20,930
over how complexity after task to be
 

4373
01:40:20,930 --> 01:40:22,689
over how complexity after task to be
synthesized and the complexes are after

4374
01:40:22,689 --> 01:40:22,699
synthesized and the complexes are after
 

4375
01:40:22,699 --> 01:40:24,610
synthesized and the complexes are after
the actual synthesize the programs so

4376
01:40:24,610 --> 01:40:24,620
the actual synthesize the programs so
 

4377
01:40:24,620 --> 01:40:27,280
the actual synthesize the programs so
you so the lines of code even for

4378
01:40:27,280 --> 01:40:27,290
you so the lines of code even for
 

4379
01:40:27,290 --> 01:40:30,090
you so the lines of code even for
example okay I got you but it's not the

4380
01:40:30,090 --> 01:40:30,100
example okay I got you but it's not the
 

4381
01:40:30,100 --> 01:40:33,340
example okay I got you but it's not the
theoretical upper bound of the running

4382
01:40:33,340 --> 01:40:33,350
theoretical upper bound of the running
 

4383
01:40:33,350 --> 01:40:37,360
theoretical upper bound of the running
time of the day and you can see the

4384
01:40:37,360 --> 01:40:37,370
time of the day and you can see the
 

4385
01:40:37,370 --> 01:40:40,090
time of the day and you can see the
complexity in decreasing already oh no

4386
01:40:40,090 --> 01:40:40,100
complexity in decreasing already oh no
 

4387
01:40:40,100 --> 01:40:41,650
complexity in decreasing already oh no
meaning we want to be able to synthesize

4388
01:40:41,650 --> 01:40:41,660
meaning we want to be able to synthesize
 

4389
01:40:41,660 --> 01:40:43,930
meaning we want to be able to synthesize
monomer complex programs bigger and

4390
01:40:43,930 --> 01:40:43,940
monomer complex programs bigger and
 

4391
01:40:43,940 --> 01:40:46,920
monomer complex programs bigger and
bigger programs so we want to see that's

4392
01:40:46,920 --> 01:40:46,930
bigger programs so we want to see that's
 

4393
01:40:46,930 --> 01:40:50,740
bigger programs so we want to see that's
we want to increase I have to think

4394
01:40:50,740 --> 01:40:50,750
we want to increase I have to think
 

4395
01:40:50,750 --> 01:40:52,990
we want to increase I have to think
through because I thought of complexity

4396
01:40:52,990 --> 01:40:53,000
through because I thought of complexity
 

4397
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:54,490
through because I thought of complexity
is you want to be able to accomplish the

4398
01:40:54,490 --> 01:40:54,500
is you want to be able to accomplish the
 

4399
01:40:54,500 --> 01:40:56,530
is you want to be able to accomplish the
same task with a simpler and simpler

4400
01:40:56,530 --> 01:40:56,540
same task with a simpler and simpler
 

4401
01:40:56,540 --> 01:40:58,600
same task with a simpler and simpler
program no we are not doing that okay

4402
01:40:58,600 --> 01:40:58,610
program no we are not doing that okay
 

4403
01:40:58,610 --> 01:41:01,660
program no we are not doing that okay
it's more it's more about how complex a

4404
01:41:01,660 --> 01:41:01,670
it's more it's more about how complex a
 

4405
01:41:01,670 --> 01:41:05,500
it's more it's more about how complex a
task right we can see the exotic being

4406
01:41:05,500 --> 01:41:05,510
task right we can see the exotic being
 

4407
01:41:05,510 --> 01:41:08,590
task right we can see the exotic being
able to synthesize programs learn them

4408
01:41:08,590 --> 01:41:08,600
able to synthesize programs learn them
 

4409
01:41:08,600 --> 01:41:10,390
able to synthesize programs learn them
for more and more difficult right so for

4410
01:41:10,390 --> 01:41:10,400
for more and more difficult right so for
 

4411
01:41:10,400 --> 01:41:12,820
for more and more difficult right so for
example initially our first working

4412
01:41:12,820 --> 01:41:12,830
example initially our first working
 

4413
01:41:12,830 --> 01:41:15,250
example initially our first working
program synthesis synthesis was to

01:41:27,680 --> 01:41:29,380
should take so that program is a super
simple you just Andy identify the

4426
01:41:29,380 --> 01:41:29,390
simple you just Andy identify the
 

4427
01:41:29,390 --> 01:41:31,360
simple you just Andy identify the
trigger conditions and the action yeah

4428
01:41:31,360 --> 01:41:31,370
trigger conditions and the action yeah
 

4429
01:41:31,370 --> 01:41:32,950
trigger conditions and the action yeah
and then later on with the secret

4430
01:41:32,950 --> 01:41:32,960
and then later on with the secret
 

4431
01:41:32,960 --> 01:41:34,600
and then later on with the secret
queries that gets more complex and then

4432
01:41:34,600 --> 01:41:34,610
queries that gets more complex and then
 

4433
01:41:34,610 --> 01:41:37,540
queries that gets more complex and then
also we started to synthesize programs

4434
01:41:37,540 --> 01:41:37,550
also we started to synthesize programs
 

4435
01:41:37,550 --> 01:41:42,100
also we started to synthesize programs
with loops and know anything could

4436
01:41:42,100 --> 01:41:42,110
with loops and know anything could
 

4437
01:41:42,110 --> 01:41:45,630
with loops and know anything could
synthesize recursion it's all over

4438
01:41:45,630 --> 01:41:45,640
synthesize recursion it's all over
 

4439
01:41:45,640 --> 01:41:48,729
synthesize recursion it's all over
actually yeah 1fi works actually it's

4440
01:41:48,729 --> 01:41:48,739
actually yeah 1fi works actually it's
 

4441
01:41:48,739 --> 01:41:52,450
actually yeah 1fi works actually it's
already rechristen you're

4442
01:41:52,450 --> 01:41:52,460
already rechristen you're
 

4443
01:41:52,460 --> 01:41:57,070
already rechristen you're
complexity and the other one is

4444
01:41:57,070 --> 01:41:57,080

 

4445
01:41:57,080 --> 01:42:01,250

generalization like one-way training I

4446
01:42:01,250 --> 01:42:01,260
generalization like one-way training I
 

4447
01:42:01,260 --> 01:42:04,580
generalization like one-way training I
want to learn programming synthesizer in

4448
01:42:04,580 --> 01:42:04,590
want to learn programming synthesizer in
 

4449
01:42:04,590 --> 01:42:06,170
want to learn programming synthesizer in
this case and neural programs to

4450
01:42:06,170 --> 01:42:06,180
this case and neural programs to
 

4451
01:42:06,180 --> 01:42:08,930
this case and neural programs to
synthesize programs then you wanted to

4452
01:42:08,930 --> 01:42:08,940
synthesize programs then you wanted to
 

4453
01:42:08,940 --> 01:42:12,080
synthesize programs then you wanted to
generalize so for a large number of

4454
01:42:12,080 --> 01:42:12,090
generalize so for a large number of
 

4455
01:42:12,090 --> 01:42:15,680
generalize so for a large number of
inputs to be able to write generalize to

4456
01:42:15,680 --> 01:42:15,690
inputs to be able to write generalize to
 

4457
01:42:15,690 --> 01:42:20,030
inputs to be able to write generalize to
previously and C inputs got it and so so

4458
01:42:20,030 --> 01:42:20,040
previously and C inputs got it and so so
 

4459
01:42:20,040 --> 01:42:21,700
previously and C inputs got it and so so
someone for the work who waited earlier

4460
01:42:21,700 --> 01:42:21,710
someone for the work who waited earlier
 

4461
01:42:21,710 --> 01:42:26,480
someone for the work who waited earlier
learning recursive new programs actually

4462
01:42:26,480 --> 01:42:26,490
learning recursive new programs actually
 

4463
01:42:26,490 --> 01:42:29,960
learning recursive new programs actually
showed that recursion actually is

4464
01:42:29,960 --> 01:42:29,970
showed that recursion actually is
 

4465
01:42:29,970 --> 01:42:34,190
showed that recursion actually is
important and to learn and if you have

4466
01:42:34,190 --> 01:42:34,200
important and to learn and if you have
 

4467
01:42:34,200 --> 01:42:37,130
important and to learn and if you have
recursion then for certain and set of

4468
01:42:37,130 --> 01:42:37,140
recursion then for certain and set of
 

4469
01:42:37,140 --> 01:42:39,020
recursion then for certain and set of
tasks we can actually show that you can

4470
01:42:39,020 --> 01:42:39,030
tasks we can actually show that you can
 

4471
01:42:39,030 --> 01:42:41,260
tasks we can actually show that you can
actually have perfect generalization and

4472
01:42:41,260 --> 01:42:41,270
actually have perfect generalization and
 

4473
01:42:41,270 --> 01:42:43,790
actually have perfect generalization and
so right so that one the best paper

4474
01:42:43,790 --> 01:42:43,800
so right so that one the best paper
 

4475
01:42:43,800 --> 01:42:46,640
so right so that one the best paper
Awards that I clear earlier and so

4476
01:42:46,640 --> 01:42:46,650
Awards that I clear earlier and so
 

4477
01:42:46,650 --> 01:42:50,060
Awards that I clear earlier and so
that's one example of we want to learn

4478
01:42:50,060 --> 01:42:50,070
that's one example of we want to learn
 

4479
01:42:50,070 --> 01:42:52,280
that's one example of we want to learn
these you know programs that can

4480
01:42:52,280 --> 01:42:52,290
these you know programs that can
 

4481
01:42:52,290 --> 01:42:54,950
these you know programs that can
generalize better but that works for a

4482
01:42:54,950 --> 01:42:54,960
generalize better but that works for a
 

4483
01:42:54,960 --> 01:42:57,380
generalize better but that works for a
certain task with certain domains and

4484
01:42:57,380 --> 01:42:57,390
certain task with certain domains and
 

4485
01:42:57,390 --> 01:43:01,160
certain task with certain domains and
there is question how we can essentially

4486
01:43:01,160 --> 01:43:01,170
there is question how we can essentially
 

4487
01:43:01,170 --> 01:43:04,850
there is question how we can essentially
develop more techniques that can and

4488
01:43:04,850 --> 01:43:04,860
develop more techniques that can and
 

4489
01:43:04,860 --> 01:43:08,020
develop more techniques that can and
have generalization for wider set of

4490
01:43:08,020 --> 01:43:08,030
have generalization for wider set of
 

4491
01:43:08,030 --> 01:43:11,270
have generalization for wider set of
domains and so on so that's another area

4492
01:43:11,270 --> 01:43:11,280
domains and so on so that's another area
 

4493
01:43:11,280 --> 01:43:13,550
domains and so on so that's another area
and then and then the the third

4494
01:43:13,550 --> 01:43:13,560
and then and then the the third
 

4495
01:43:13,560 --> 01:43:16,760
and then and then the the third
challenge I think will it's not just for

4496
01:43:16,760 --> 01:43:16,770
challenge I think will it's not just for
 

4497
01:43:16,770 --> 01:43:18,350
challenge I think will it's not just for
programming synthesis is also cutting

4498
01:43:18,350 --> 01:43:18,360
programming synthesis is also cutting
 

4499
01:43:18,360 --> 01:43:22,700
programming synthesis is also cutting
across other fields in machine learning

4500
01:43:22,700 --> 01:43:22,710
across other fields in machine learning
 

4501
01:43:22,710 --> 01:43:24,620
across other fields in machine learning
and also including like deep

4502
01:43:24,620 --> 01:43:24,630
and also including like deep
 

4503
01:43:24,630 --> 01:43:29,560
and also including like deep
reinforcement and in particular is that

4504
01:43:29,560 --> 01:43:29,570

 

4505
01:43:29,570 --> 01:43:32,870

this adaptation is that we want to be

4506
01:43:32,870 --> 01:43:32,880
this adaptation is that we want to be
 

4507
01:43:32,880 --> 01:43:38,750
this adaptation is that we want to be
able to learn from the past and tasks

4508
01:43:38,750 --> 01:43:38,760
able to learn from the past and tasks
 

4509
01:43:38,760 --> 01:43:40,880
able to learn from the past and tasks
and training and so on to be able to

4510
01:43:40,880 --> 01:43:40,890
and training and so on to be able to
 

4511
01:43:40,890 --> 01:43:43,100
and training and so on to be able to
solve new tasks so for example in

4512
01:43:43,100 --> 01:43:43,110
solve new tasks so for example in
 

4513
01:43:43,110 --> 01:43:46,370
solve new tasks so for example in
program synthesis today we still are

4514
01:43:46,370 --> 01:43:46,380
program synthesis today we still are
 

4515
01:43:46,380 --> 01:43:48,950
program synthesis today we still are
working in the setting way given a

4516
01:43:48,950 --> 01:43:48,960
working in the setting way given a
 

4517
01:43:48,960 --> 01:43:53,480
working in the setting way given a
particular task we change the right

4518
01:43:53,480 --> 01:43:53,490
particular task we change the right
 

4519
01:43:53,490 --> 01:43:56,800
particular task we change the right
model and to solve this particular task

4520
01:43:56,800 --> 01:43:56,810
model and to solve this particular task
 

4521
01:43:56,810 --> 01:44:00,200
model and to solve this particular task
but that's not how humans work like the

4522
01:44:00,200 --> 01:44:00,210
but that's not how humans work like the
 

4523
01:44:00,210 --> 01:44:03,600
but that's not how humans work like the
whole point is we train a human than

4524
01:44:03,600 --> 01:44:03,610
whole point is we train a human than
 

4525
01:44:03,610 --> 01:44:07,410
whole point is we train a human than
you can then program to south new tasks

4526
01:44:07,410 --> 01:44:07,420
you can then program to south new tasks
 

4527
01:44:07,420 --> 01:44:10,590
you can then program to south new tasks
right exactly and just like we don't

4528
01:44:10,590 --> 01:44:10,600
right exactly and just like we don't
 

4529
01:44:10,600 --> 01:44:12,240
right exactly and just like we don't
want to just change agent to play a

4530
01:44:12,240 --> 01:44:12,250
want to just change agent to play a
 

4531
01:44:12,250 --> 01:44:14,370
want to just change agent to play a
particular game

4532
01:44:14,370 --> 01:44:14,380
particular game
 

4533
01:44:14,380 --> 01:44:19,500
particular game
hey it's Atari ice ago whatever we want

4534
01:44:19,500 --> 01:44:19,510
hey it's Atari ice ago whatever we want
 

4535
01:44:19,510 --> 01:44:23,030
hey it's Atari ice ago whatever we want
to train these agents that can and

4536
01:44:23,030 --> 01:44:23,040
to train these agents that can and
 

4537
01:44:23,040 --> 01:44:25,320
to train these agents that can and
essentially extract knowledge from the

4538
01:44:25,320 --> 01:44:25,330
essentially extract knowledge from the
 

4539
01:44:25,330 --> 01:44:28,160
essentially extract knowledge from the
past learning experience to be able to

4540
01:44:28,160 --> 01:44:28,170
past learning experience to be able to
 

4541
01:44:28,170 --> 01:44:31,020
past learning experience to be able to
adapt to new new tasks and solve new

4542
01:44:31,020 --> 01:44:31,030
adapt to new new tasks and solve new
 

4543
01:44:31,030 --> 01:44:32,640
adapt to new new tasks and solve new
tasks and I think this is particularly

4544
01:44:32,640 --> 01:44:32,650
tasks and I think this is particularly
 

4545
01:44:32,650 --> 01:44:34,890
tasks and I think this is particularly
important for program synthesis yeah

4546
01:44:34,890 --> 01:44:34,900
important for program synthesis yeah
 

4547
01:44:34,900 --> 01:44:36,240
important for program synthesis yeah
that's the whole point that's the whole

4548
01:44:36,240 --> 01:44:36,250
that's the whole point that's the whole
 

4549
01:44:36,250 --> 01:44:38,820
that's the whole point that's the whole
dream of progress this is your learning

4550
01:44:38,820 --> 01:44:38,830
dream of progress this is your learning
 

4551
01:44:38,830 --> 01:44:41,640
dream of progress this is your learning
a tool that can solve new problems right

4552
01:44:41,640 --> 01:44:41,650
a tool that can solve new problems right
 

4553
01:44:41,650 --> 01:44:44,520
a tool that can solve new problems right
exactly and I think that's a particular

4554
01:44:44,520 --> 01:44:44,530
exactly and I think that's a particular
 

4555
01:44:44,530 --> 01:44:48,960
exactly and I think that's a particular
main that as a community we need to put

4556
01:44:48,960 --> 01:44:48,970
main that as a community we need to put
 

4557
01:44:48,970 --> 01:44:51,780
main that as a community we need to put
more emphasis on and I hope that we can

4558
01:44:51,780 --> 01:44:51,790
more emphasis on and I hope that we can
 

4559
01:44:51,790 --> 01:44:53,780
more emphasis on and I hope that we can
make more progress today as well

4560
01:44:53,780 --> 01:44:53,790
make more progress today as well
 

4561
01:44:53,790 --> 01:44:56,520
make more progress today as well
awesome I think there's a lot more to

01:44:56,520 --> 01:44:56,530
awesome I think there's a lot more to
 

4563
01:44:56,530 --> 01:44:59,340
awesome I think there's a lot more to
talk about but let me ask that you also

4564
01:44:59,340 --> 01:44:59,350
talk about but let me ask that you also
 

4565
01:44:59,350 --> 01:45:02,940
talk about but let me ask that you also
had a very interesting and we talked

4566
01:45:02,940 --> 01:45:02,950
had a very interesting and we talked
 

4567
01:45:02,950 --> 01:45:05,490
had a very interesting and we talked
about rich representations he had a rich

01:45:05,490 --> 01:45:05,500
about rich representations he had a rich

01:45:21,820 --> 01:45:25,410
and the United States are there in your
eyes interesting differences between the

4584
01:45:25,410 --> 01:45:25,420
eyes interesting differences between the
 

4585
01:45:25,420 --> 01:45:29,580
eyes interesting differences between the
two cultures from the silly romantic

4586
01:45:29,580 --> 01:45:29,590
two cultures from the silly romantic
 

4587
01:45:29,590 --> 01:45:32,430
two cultures from the silly romantic
notion of the spirit of the people to

4588
01:45:32,430 --> 01:45:32,440
notion of the spirit of the people to
 

4589
01:45:32,440 --> 01:45:33,960
notion of the spirit of the people to
the more practical notion of how

4590
01:45:33,960 --> 01:45:33,970
the more practical notion of how
 

4591
01:45:33,970 --> 01:45:37,140
the more practical notion of how
research is conducted that you find

4592
01:45:37,140 --> 01:45:37,150
research is conducted that you find
 

4593
01:45:37,150 --> 01:45:39,090
research is conducted that you find
interesting or useful in your own work

4594
01:45:39,090 --> 01:45:39,100
interesting or useful in your own work
 

4595
01:45:39,100 --> 01:45:42,630
interesting or useful in your own work
of having experienced both that's a good

4596
01:45:42,630 --> 01:45:42,640
of having experienced both that's a good
 

4597
01:45:42,640 --> 01:45:48,660
of having experienced both that's a good
question I think so I I started in China

4598
01:45:48,660 --> 01:45:48,670
question I think so I I started in China
 

4599
01:45:48,670 --> 01:45:52,140
question I think so I I started in China
for my undergraduate and that was more

4600
01:45:52,140 --> 01:45:52,150
for my undergraduate and that was more
 

4601
01:45:52,150 --> 01:45:55,380
for my undergraduate and that was more
than 20 years ago there's been a long

4602
01:45:55,380 --> 01:45:55,390
than 20 years ago there's been a long
 

4603
01:45:55,390 --> 01:45:57,030
than 20 years ago there's been a long
time

4604
01:45:57,030 --> 01:45:57,040
time
 

4605
01:45:57,040 --> 01:46:01,980
time
is there echoes of that time I think

4606
01:46:01,980 --> 01:46:01,990
is there echoes of that time I think
 

4607
01:46:01,990 --> 01:46:05,160
is there echoes of that time I think
even more so maybe something that's even

4608
01:46:05,160 --> 01:46:05,170
even more so maybe something that's even
 

4609
01:46:05,170 --> 01:46:08,490
even more so maybe something that's even
be more different for my experience and

4610
01:46:08,490 --> 01:46:08,500
be more different for my experience and
 

4611
01:46:08,500 --> 01:46:12,240
be more different for my experience and
a lot of computer science researchers

4612
01:46:12,240 --> 01:46:12,250
a lot of computer science researchers
 

4613
01:46:12,250 --> 01:46:14,580
a lot of computer science researchers
and practitioners is that so for my

4614
01:46:14,580 --> 01:46:14,590
and practitioners is that so for my
 

4615
01:46:14,590 --> 01:46:17,240
and practitioners is that so for my
undergraduate studies physics

4616
01:46:17,240 --> 01:46:17,250
undergraduate studies physics
 

4617
01:46:17,250 --> 01:46:18,919
undergraduate studies physics
very nice and then I switch to a

4618
01:46:18,919 --> 01:46:18,929
very nice and then I switch to a
 

4619
01:46:18,929 --> 01:46:22,250
very nice and then I switch to a
computer science in graduate school what

4620
01:46:22,250 --> 01:46:22,260
computer science in graduate school what
 

4621
01:46:22,260 --> 01:46:27,140
computer science in graduate school what
happened was there was there is there

4622
01:46:27,140 --> 01:46:27,150
happened was there was there is there
 

4623
01:46:27,150 --> 01:46:29,510
happened was there was there is there
another possible universe where you

4624
01:46:29,510 --> 01:46:29,520
another possible universe where you
 

4625
01:46:29,520 --> 01:46:31,520
another possible universe where you
could have become a theoretical

4626
01:46:31,520 --> 01:46:31,530
could have become a theoretical
 

4627
01:46:31,530 --> 01:46:33,260
could have become a theoretical
physicist at Caltech or something like

4628
01:46:33,260 --> 01:46:33,270
physicist at Caltech or something like
 

4629
01:46:33,270 --> 01:46:37,209
physicist at Caltech or something like
that that's very possible some of my and

4630
01:46:37,209 --> 01:46:37,219
that that's very possible some of my and
 

4631
01:46:37,219 --> 01:46:40,010
that that's very possible some of my and
undergrad classmates then the later

4632
01:46:40,010 --> 01:46:40,020
undergrad classmates then the later
 

4633
01:46:40,020 --> 01:46:43,280
undergrad classmates then the later
studies physics account there 15 physics

4634
01:46:43,280 --> 01:46:43,290
studies physics account there 15 physics
 

4635
01:46:43,290 --> 01:46:47,140
studies physics account there 15 physics
from these schools from yeah from tough

4636
01:46:47,140 --> 01:46:47,150
from these schools from yeah from tough
 

4637
01:46:47,150 --> 01:46:50,870
from these schools from yeah from tough
physics programs so so you you switch to

4638
01:46:50,870 --> 01:46:50,880
physics programs so so you you switch to
 

4639
01:46:50,880 --> 01:46:53,600
physics programs so so you you switch to
I mean in that from that experience to

4640
01:46:53,600 --> 01:46:53,610
I mean in that from that experience to
 

4641
01:46:53,610 --> 01:46:56,180
I mean in that from that experience to
doing physics in your bachelor's how

4642
01:46:56,180 --> 01:46:56,190
doing physics in your bachelor's how
 

4643
01:46:56,190 --> 01:46:58,010
doing physics in your bachelor's how
what means you decide to switch to

4644
01:46:58,010 --> 01:46:58,020
what means you decide to switch to
 

4645
01:46:58,020 --> 01:47:00,680
what means you decide to switch to
computer science and computer science

4646
01:47:00,680 --> 01:47:00,690
computer science and computer science
 

4647
01:47:00,690 --> 01:47:03,860
computer science and computer science
had arguably the best university one of

4648
01:47:03,860 --> 01:47:03,870
had arguably the best university one of
 

4649
01:47:03,870 --> 01:47:05,120
had arguably the best university one of
the best universities in the world for

4650
01:47:05,120 --> 01:47:05,130
the best universities in the world for
 

4651
01:47:05,130 --> 01:47:06,530
the best universities in the world for
computer science and with Carnegie

4652
01:47:06,530 --> 01:47:06,540
computer science and with Carnegie
 

4653
01:47:06,540 --> 01:47:08,930
computer science and with Carnegie
Mellon especially for the grad school

4654
01:47:08,930 --> 01:47:08,940
Mellon especially for the grad school
 

4655
01:47:08,940 --> 01:47:12,229
Mellon especially for the grad school
and and so on so what ii only 10 mighty

4656
01:47:12,229 --> 01:47:12,239
and and so on so what ii only 10 mighty
 

4657
01:47:12,239 --> 01:47:16,189
and and so on so what ii only 10 mighty
just kidding okay

4658
01:47:16,189 --> 01:47:16,199

 

4659
01:47:16,199 --> 01:47:18,650

I had Authority and know what what was

4660
01:47:18,650 --> 01:47:18,660
I had Authority and know what what was
 

4661
01:47:18,660 --> 01:47:21,320
I had Authority and know what what was
the choice like and what was the move to

4662
01:47:21,320 --> 01:47:21,330
the choice like and what was the move to
 

4663
01:47:21,330 --> 01:47:22,910
the choice like and what was the move to
the United States like what was that

4664
01:47:22,910 --> 01:47:22,920
the United States like what was that
 

4665
01:47:22,920 --> 01:47:25,669
the United States like what was that
whole transition and if you remember if

4666
01:47:25,669 --> 01:47:25,679
whole transition and if you remember if
 

4667
01:47:25,679 --> 01:47:27,650
whole transition and if you remember if
there's still echoes of some of the

4668
01:47:27,650 --> 01:47:27,660
there's still echoes of some of the
 

4669
01:47:27,660 --> 01:47:30,110
there's still echoes of some of the
spirit of the people of China in you in

4670
01:47:30,110 --> 01:47:30,120
spirit of the people of China in you in
 

4671
01:47:30,120 --> 01:47:38,200
spirit of the people of China in you in
New York it's like three questions so

4672
01:47:38,200 --> 01:47:38,210
New York it's like three questions so
 

4673
01:47:38,210 --> 01:47:40,790
New York it's like three questions so
yes I guess okay the first transition

4674
01:47:40,790 --> 01:47:40,800
yes I guess okay the first transition
 

4675
01:47:40,800 --> 01:47:43,400
yes I guess okay the first transition
from physics to computer science yes so

4676
01:47:43,400 --> 01:47:43,410
from physics to computer science yes so
 

4677
01:47:43,410 --> 01:47:45,380
from physics to computer science yes so
when I first came to the United States I

4678
01:47:45,380 --> 01:47:45,390
when I first came to the United States I
 

4679
01:47:45,390 --> 01:47:47,570
when I first came to the United States I
was actually in the physics ph.d program

4680
01:47:47,570 --> 01:47:47,580
was actually in the physics ph.d program
 

4681
01:47:47,580 --> 01:47:50,209
was actually in the physics ph.d program
at Cornell yeah I was there for one year

4682
01:47:50,209 --> 01:47:50,219
at Cornell yeah I was there for one year
 

4683
01:47:50,219 --> 01:47:51,709
at Cornell yeah I was there for one year
and then I switched to computer science

4684
01:47:51,709 --> 01:47:51,719
and then I switched to computer science
 

4685
01:47:51,719 --> 01:47:54,500
and then I switched to computer science
and I was seeing the PC program at kind

4686
01:47:54,500 --> 01:47:54,510
and I was seeing the PC program at kind
 

4687
01:47:54,510 --> 01:47:57,650
and I was seeing the PC program at kind
of give a loan and so okay so the

4688
01:47:57,650 --> 01:47:57,660
of give a loan and so okay so the
 

4689
01:47:57,660 --> 01:47:59,780
of give a loan and so okay so the
reasons for switching so one thing so

4690
01:47:59,780 --> 01:47:59,790
reasons for switching so one thing so
 

4691
01:47:59,790 --> 01:48:02,540
reasons for switching so one thing so
that's why I also mentions that about

4692
01:48:02,540 --> 01:48:02,550
that's why I also mentions that about
 

4693
01:48:02,550 --> 01:48:04,490
that's why I also mentions that about
this difference in backgrounds about

4694
01:48:04,490 --> 01:48:04,500
this difference in backgrounds about
 

4695
01:48:04,500 --> 01:48:07,280
this difference in backgrounds about
having studied physics yes first in my

4696
01:48:07,280 --> 01:48:07,290
having studied physics yes first in my
 

4697
01:48:07,290 --> 01:48:08,780
having studied physics yes first in my
undergrad um

4698
01:48:08,780 --> 01:48:08,790
undergrad um
 

4699
01:48:08,790 --> 01:48:13,939
undergrad um
actually really I really did enjoy my

4700
01:48:13,939 --> 01:48:13,949
actually really I really did enjoy my
 

4701
01:48:13,949 --> 01:48:18,680
actually really I really did enjoy my
undergrads time and education in physics

4702
01:48:18,680 --> 01:48:18,690
undergrads time and education in physics
 

4703
01:48:18,690 --> 01:48:20,450
undergrads time and education in physics
I think that actually really helped me

4704
01:48:20,450 --> 01:48:20,460
I think that actually really helped me
 

4705
01:48:20,460 --> 01:48:24,100
I think that actually really helped me
in my future work in computer science

4706
01:48:24,100 --> 01:48:24,110
in my future work in computer science
 

4707
01:48:24,110 --> 01:48:26,570
in my future work in computer science
actually even for machine learning a lot

4708
01:48:26,570 --> 01:48:26,580
actually even for machine learning a lot
 

4709
01:48:26,580 --> 01:48:28,850
actually even for machine learning a lot
of machine learning stuff the the core

4710
01:48:28,850 --> 01:48:28,860
of machine learning stuff the the core
 

4711
01:48:28,860 --> 01:48:33,740
of machine learning stuff the the core
machining methods many of the magic

4712
01:48:33,740 --> 01:48:33,750

 

4713
01:48:33,750 --> 01:48:38,340

for honest most most of everything came

4714
01:48:38,340 --> 01:48:38,350
for honest most most of everything came
 

4715
01:48:38,350 --> 01:48:46,590
for honest most most of everything came
from physics I was I think I was really

4716
01:48:46,590 --> 01:48:46,600
from physics I was I think I was really
 

4717
01:48:46,600 --> 01:48:49,740
from physics I was I think I was really
attracted to physics and it was it's

4718
01:48:49,740 --> 01:48:49,750
attracted to physics and it was it's
 

4719
01:48:49,750 --> 01:48:53,910
attracted to physics and it was it's
really beautiful and educated physics is

4720
01:48:53,910 --> 01:48:53,920
really beautiful and educated physics is
 

4721
01:48:53,920 --> 01:48:58,580
really beautiful and educated physics is
the language of nature and I actually

4722
01:48:58,580 --> 01:48:58,590
the language of nature and I actually
 

4723
01:48:58,590 --> 01:49:03,690
the language of nature and I actually
really remember like one moment in my

4724
01:49:03,690 --> 01:49:03,700
really remember like one moment in my
 

4725
01:49:03,700 --> 01:49:06,090
really remember like one moment in my
undergrads like I did my undergrad in

4726
01:49:06,090 --> 01:49:06,100
undergrads like I did my undergrad in
 

4727
01:49:06,100 --> 01:49:09,180
undergrads like I did my undergrad in
Chinua and I used to study in the

4728
01:49:09,180 --> 01:49:09,190
Chinua and I used to study in the
 

4729
01:49:09,190 --> 01:49:13,860
Chinua and I used to study in the
library and I clearly remember like one

4730
01:49:13,860 --> 01:49:13,870
library and I clearly remember like one
 

4731
01:49:13,870 --> 01:49:18,390
library and I clearly remember like one
day I was sitting in a library and I and

4732
01:49:18,390 --> 01:49:18,400
day I was sitting in a library and I and
 

4733
01:49:18,400 --> 01:49:21,180
day I was sitting in a library and I and
I was like writing my notes and so on

4734
01:49:21,180 --> 01:49:21,190
I was like writing my notes and so on
 

4735
01:49:21,190 --> 01:49:23,880
I was like writing my notes and so on
and I got so excited that I realized

4736
01:49:23,880 --> 01:49:23,890
and I got so excited that I realized
 

4737
01:49:23,890 --> 01:49:27,050
and I got so excited that I realized
that if you just from a few simple

4738
01:49:27,050 --> 01:49:27,060
that if you just from a few simple
 

4739
01:49:27,060 --> 01:49:31,380
that if you just from a few simple
axioms a few simple laws I can derive so

4740
01:49:31,380 --> 01:49:31,390
axioms a few simple laws I can derive so
 

4741
01:49:31,390 --> 01:49:33,360
axioms a few simple laws I can derive so
much it's almost like I can't derive the

4742
01:49:33,360 --> 01:49:33,370
much it's almost like I can't derive the
 

4743
01:49:33,370 --> 01:49:35,280
much it's almost like I can't derive the
rest of the world yeah there's the

4744
01:49:35,280 --> 01:49:35,290
rest of the world yeah there's the
 

4745
01:49:35,290 --> 01:49:37,620
rest of the world yeah there's the
universe yes yes so that was like

4746
01:49:37,620 --> 01:49:37,630
universe yes yes so that was like
 

4747
01:49:37,630 --> 01:49:41,520
universe yes yes so that was like
amazing do you think you have you ever

4748
01:49:41,520 --> 01:49:41,530
amazing do you think you have you ever
 

4749
01:49:41,530 --> 01:49:43,260
amazing do you think you have you ever
seen or do you think you can rediscover

4750
01:49:43,260 --> 01:49:43,270
seen or do you think you can rediscover
 

4751
01:49:43,270 --> 01:49:45,030
seen or do you think you can rediscover
that kind of power and beauty and

4752
01:49:45,030 --> 01:49:45,040
that kind of power and beauty and
 

4753
01:49:45,040 --> 01:49:47,300
that kind of power and beauty and
computer science in the world that yes

4754
01:49:47,300 --> 01:49:47,310
computer science in the world that yes
 

4755
01:49:47,310 --> 01:49:50,280
computer science in the world that yes
that's very interesting so that gets to

4756
01:49:50,280 --> 01:49:50,290
that's very interesting so that gets to
 

4757
01:49:50,290 --> 01:49:52,110
that's very interesting so that gets to
you know the transition from physics to

4758
01:49:52,110 --> 01:49:52,120
you know the transition from physics to
 

4759
01:49:52,120 --> 01:49:55,140
you know the transition from physics to
Versailles and it's a it's quite

4760
01:49:55,140 --> 01:49:55,150
Versailles and it's a it's quite
 

4761
01:49:55,150 --> 01:49:59,820
Versailles and it's a it's quite
different for and for physics in in

4762
01:49:59,820 --> 01:49:59,830
different for and for physics in in
 

4763
01:49:59,830 --> 01:50:03,300
different for and for physics in in
Cresco actually things changed so one is

4764
01:50:03,300 --> 01:50:03,310
Cresco actually things changed so one is
 

4765
01:50:03,310 --> 01:50:06,900
Cresco actually things changed so one is
I started to realize that when I started

4766
01:50:06,900 --> 01:50:06,910
I started to realize that when I started
 

4767
01:50:06,910 --> 01:50:09,750
I started to realize that when I started
doing research in physics at the time I

4768
01:50:09,750 --> 01:50:09,760
doing research in physics at the time I
 

4769
01:50:09,760 --> 01:50:12,240
doing research in physics at the time I
was doing theoretical physics and a lot

4770
01:50:12,240 --> 01:50:12,250
was doing theoretical physics and a lot
 

4771
01:50:12,250 --> 01:50:15,330
was doing theoretical physics and a lot
of its the you still have the beauty

4772
01:50:15,330 --> 01:50:15,340
of its the you still have the beauty
 

4773
01:50:15,340 --> 01:50:17,310
of its the you still have the beauty
base very different so I have to

4774
01:50:17,310 --> 01:50:17,320
base very different so I have to
 

4775
01:50:17,320 --> 01:50:19,110
base very different so I have to
actually do a lot of simulation so

4776
01:50:19,110 --> 01:50:19,120
actually do a lot of simulation so
 

4777
01:50:19,120 --> 01:50:21,390
actually do a lot of simulation so
essentially I was actually writing in

4778
01:50:21,390 --> 01:50:21,400
essentially I was actually writing in
 

4779
01:50:21,400 --> 01:50:24,380
essentially I was actually writing in
some in some cases writing a fortune

4780
01:50:24,380 --> 01:50:24,390
some in some cases writing a fortune
 

4781
01:50:24,390 --> 01:50:30,930
some in some cases writing a fortune
Harold fortune yes to actually write do

4782
01:50:30,930 --> 01:50:30,940
Harold fortune yes to actually write do
 

4783
01:50:30,940 --> 01:50:33,420
Harold fortune yes to actually write do
like do simulations and so on that was

4784
01:50:33,420 --> 01:50:33,430
like do simulations and so on that was
 

4785
01:50:33,430 --> 01:50:39,270
like do simulations and so on that was
not not exact I

4786
01:50:39,270 --> 01:50:39,280

 

4787
01:50:39,280 --> 01:50:43,180

I enjoy it's doing

4788
01:50:43,180 --> 01:50:43,190
I enjoy it's doing
 

4789
01:50:43,190 --> 01:50:46,959
I enjoy it's doing
and also at the time from talking with

4790
01:50:46,959 --> 01:50:46,969
and also at the time from talking with
 

4791
01:50:46,969 --> 01:50:51,040
and also at the time from talking with
the senior you know students in the

4792
01:50:51,040 --> 01:50:51,050
the senior you know students in the
 

4793
01:50:51,050 --> 01:50:54,100
the senior you know students in the
program I realized many of the students

4794
01:50:54,100 --> 01:50:54,110
program I realized many of the students
 

4795
01:50:54,110 --> 01:50:55,990
program I realized many of the students
actually were going off to work Wall

4796
01:50:55,990 --> 01:50:56,000
actually were going off to work Wall
 

4797
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:59,709
actually were going off to work Wall
Street and and so on and so and I've

4798
01:50:59,709 --> 01:50:59,719
Street and and so on and so and I've
 

4799
01:50:59,719 --> 01:51:01,630
Street and and so on and so and I've
always been interested in computer

4800
01:51:01,630 --> 01:51:01,640
always been interested in computer
 

4801
01:51:01,640 --> 01:51:05,500
always been interested in computer
science and actually essentially taught

4802
01:51:05,500 --> 01:51:05,510
science and actually essentially taught
 

4803
01:51:05,510 --> 01:51:09,090
science and actually essentially taught
myself the C programming program right

4804
01:51:09,090 --> 01:51:09,100
myself the C programming program right
 

4805
01:51:09,100 --> 01:51:14,340
myself the C programming program right
when in college and college somewhere

4806
01:51:14,340 --> 01:51:14,350
when in college and college somewhere
 

4807
01:51:14,350 --> 01:51:19,350
when in college and college somewhere
for fun learning to do C programming you

4808
01:51:19,350 --> 01:51:19,360
for fun learning to do C programming you
 

4809
01:51:19,360 --> 01:51:23,950
for fun learning to do C programming you
know in physics at the time I think now

4810
01:51:23,950 --> 01:51:23,960
know in physics at the time I think now
 

4811
01:51:23,960 --> 01:51:25,930
know in physics at the time I think now
the programming profit has changed but

4812
01:51:25,930 --> 01:51:25,940
the programming profit has changed but
 

4813
01:51:25,940 --> 01:51:29,620
the programming profit has changed but
at the time really the only class we had

4814
01:51:29,620 --> 01:51:29,630
at the time really the only class we had
 

4815
01:51:29,630 --> 01:51:34,320
at the time really the only class we had
in in Hoosick amir science education was

4816
01:51:34,320 --> 01:51:34,330
in in Hoosick amir science education was
 

4817
01:51:34,330 --> 01:51:37,209
in in Hoosick amir science education was
introduction to africa to computer

4818
01:51:37,209 --> 01:51:37,219
introduction to africa to computer
 

4819
01:51:37,219 --> 01:51:39,970
introduction to africa to computer

4820
01:51:39,970 --> 01:51:39,980
science or computing and fortune 77
 

4821
01:51:39,980 --> 01:51:41,350
science or computing and fortune 77
there's a lot of people that still use

4822
01:51:41,350 --> 01:51:41,360
there's a lot of people that still use
 

4823
01:51:41,360 --> 01:51:44,920
there's a lot of people that still use
Fortran I'm actually if you're a

4824
01:51:44,920 --> 01:51:44,930
Fortran I'm actually if you're a
 

4825
01:51:44,930 --> 01:51:47,550
Fortran I'm actually if you're a
programmer out there I'm looking for an

4826
01:51:47,550 --> 01:51:47,560
programmer out there I'm looking for an
 

4827
01:51:47,560 --> 01:51:49,870
programmer out there I'm looking for an
expert to talk to about Fortran they

4828
01:51:49,870 --> 01:51:49,880
expert to talk to about Fortran they
 

4829
01:51:49,880 --> 01:51:52,090
expert to talk to about Fortran they
seem to there's not many but there's

4830
01:51:52,090 --> 01:51:52,100
seem to there's not many but there's
 

4831
01:51:52,100 --> 01:51:53,380
seem to there's not many but there's
still a lot of people to still use

4832
01:51:53,380 --> 01:51:53,390
still a lot of people to still use
 

4833
01:51:53,390 --> 01:51:54,820
still a lot of people to still use
Fortran and still a lot of people these

4834
01:51:54,820 --> 01:51:54,830
Fortran and still a lot of people these
 

4835
01:51:54,830 --> 01:52:00,040
Fortran and still a lot of people these
cobalt I realized

4836
01:52:00,040 --> 01:52:00,050
cobalt I realized
 

4837
01:52:00,050 --> 01:52:02,170
cobalt I realized
instead of just doing programming for

4838
01:52:02,170 --> 01:52:02,180
instead of just doing programming for
 

4839
01:52:02,180 --> 01:52:04,689
instead of just doing programming for
doing simulations and so on that I may

4840
01:52:04,689 --> 01:52:04,699
doing simulations and so on that I may
 

4841
01:52:04,699 --> 01:52:06,970
doing simulations and so on that I may
as well just change to computer science

4842
01:52:06,970 --> 01:52:06,980
as well just change to computer science
 

4843
01:52:06,980 --> 01:52:08,860
as well just change to computer science
and also one thing I really like and

4844
01:52:08,860 --> 01:52:08,870
and also one thing I really like and
 

4845
01:52:08,870 --> 01:52:11,140
and also one thing I really like and
that's a key difference between the two

4846
01:52:11,140 --> 01:52:11,150
that's a key difference between the two
 

4847
01:52:11,150 --> 01:52:14,050
that's a key difference between the two
as in computer science is so much easier

4848
01:52:14,050 --> 01:52:14,060
as in computer science is so much easier
 

4849
01:52:14,060 --> 01:52:16,780
as in computer science is so much easier
to realize your ideas if you have idea

4850
01:52:16,780 --> 01:52:16,790
to realize your ideas if you have idea
 

4851
01:52:16,790 --> 01:52:19,240
to realize your ideas if you have idea
you're writing it up you're cut it up

4852
01:52:19,240 --> 01:52:19,250
you're writing it up you're cut it up
 

4853
01:52:19,250 --> 01:52:26,380
you're writing it up you're cut it up
and then you can see it's actually bring

4854
01:52:26,380 --> 01:52:26,390
and then you can see it's actually bring
 

4855
01:52:26,390 --> 01:52:27,820
and then you can see it's actually bring
it to life quickly it's your life

4856
01:52:27,820 --> 01:52:27,830
it to life quickly it's your life
 

4857
01:52:27,830 --> 01:52:30,160
it to life quickly it's your life
wasting physics if you how good theory

4858
01:52:30,160 --> 01:52:30,170
wasting physics if you how good theory
 

4859
01:52:30,170 --> 01:52:32,500
wasting physics if you how good theory
you you have to wait for the

4860
01:52:32,500 --> 01:52:32,510
you you have to wait for the
 

4861
01:52:32,510 --> 01:52:34,330
you you have to wait for the
experimentalist to do the experiments

4862
01:52:34,330 --> 01:52:34,340
experimentalist to do the experiments
 

4863
01:52:34,340 --> 01:52:36,340
experimentalist to do the experiments
and to confirm the theory and things

4864
01:52:36,340 --> 01:52:36,350
and to confirm the theory and things
 

4865
01:52:36,350 --> 01:52:39,310
and to confirm the theory and things
just take so much longer and and also

4866
01:52:39,310 --> 01:52:39,320
just take so much longer and and also
 

4867
01:52:39,320 --> 01:52:41,820
just take so much longer and and also
the reason I in physics I decided to do

4868
01:52:41,820 --> 01:52:41,830
the reason I in physics I decided to do
 

4869
01:52:41,830 --> 01:52:44,260
the reason I in physics I decided to do
theoretical physics it was because I had

4870
01:52:44,260 --> 01:52:44,270
theoretical physics it was because I had
 

4871
01:52:44,270 --> 01:52:47,500
theoretical physics it was because I had
my experience with experimental physics

4872
01:52:47,500 --> 01:52:47,510
my experience with experimental physics
 

4873
01:52:47,510 --> 01:52:51,870
my experience with experimental physics
first you have to fix the equipment

4874
01:52:51,870 --> 01:52:51,880

 

4875
01:52:51,880 --> 01:52:56,390

fixing the equipment first so

4876
01:52:56,390 --> 01:52:56,400
fixing the equipment first so
 

4877
01:52:56,400 --> 01:52:57,979
fixing the equipment first so
offensive equipment so there's a lot of

4878
01:52:57,979 --> 01:52:57,989
offensive equipment so there's a lot of
 

4879
01:52:57,989 --> 01:52:59,689
offensive equipment so there's a lot of
it yeah he's have to collaborate with a

4880
01:52:59,689 --> 01:52:59,699
it yeah he's have to collaborate with a
 

4881
01:52:59,699 --> 01:53:03,709
it yeah he's have to collaborate with a
lot of people takes a long time yes

4882
01:53:03,709 --> 01:53:03,719
lot of people takes a long time yes
 

4883
01:53:03,719 --> 01:53:05,990
lot of people takes a long time yes
messy so I decided to switch to computer

4884
01:53:05,990 --> 01:53:06,000
messy so I decided to switch to computer
 

4885
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,689
messy so I decided to switch to computer
science and the one thing I think maybe

4886
01:53:08,689 --> 01:53:08,699
science and the one thing I think maybe
 

4887
01:53:08,699 --> 01:53:10,280
science and the one thing I think maybe
people have realized is that for people

4888
01:53:10,280 --> 01:53:10,290
people have realized is that for people
 

4889
01:53:10,290 --> 01:53:12,169
people have realized is that for people
who study physics actually it's very

4890
01:53:12,169 --> 01:53:12,179
who study physics actually it's very
 

4891
01:53:12,179 --> 01:53:15,470
who study physics actually it's very
easy for physicists to change to do

4892
01:53:15,470 --> 01:53:15,480
easy for physicists to change to do
 

4893
01:53:15,480 --> 01:53:17,479
easy for physicists to change to do
something else yes I think physics

4894
01:53:17,479 --> 01:53:17,489
something else yes I think physics
 

4895
01:53:17,489 --> 01:53:21,620
something else yes I think physics
provides a really good training and yeah

4896
01:53:21,620 --> 01:53:21,630
provides a really good training and yeah
 

4897
01:53:21,630 --> 01:53:23,750
provides a really good training and yeah
so actually it was very easy to switch

4898
01:53:23,750 --> 01:53:23,760
so actually it was very easy to switch
 

4899
01:53:23,760 --> 01:53:27,560
so actually it was very easy to switch
to computer science but one thing going

4900
01:53:27,560 --> 01:53:27,570
to computer science but one thing going
 

4901
01:53:27,570 --> 01:53:30,169
to computer science but one thing going
back to your earlier question so one

4902
01:53:30,169 --> 01:53:30,179
back to your earlier question so one
 

4903
01:53:30,179 --> 01:53:33,350
back to your earlier question so one
thing I should you realize so there is a

4904
01:53:33,350 --> 01:53:33,360
thing I should you realize so there is a
 

4905
01:53:33,360 --> 01:53:35,060
thing I should you realize so there is a
big difference between commune sense and

4906
01:53:35,060 --> 01:53:35,070
big difference between commune sense and
 

4907
01:53:35,070 --> 01:53:37,669
big difference between commune sense and
physics away physics you can derive the

4908
01:53:37,669 --> 01:53:37,679
physics away physics you can derive the
 

4909
01:53:37,679 --> 01:53:40,070
physics away physics you can derive the
the whole universe from just a few

4910
01:53:40,070 --> 01:53:40,080
the whole universe from just a few
 

4911
01:53:40,080 --> 01:53:42,680
the whole universe from just a few
simple laws and computer science given

4912
01:53:42,680 --> 01:53:42,690
simple laws and computer science given
 

4913
01:53:42,690 --> 01:53:45,470
simple laws and computer science given
that a lot of it is defined by humans

4914
01:53:45,470 --> 01:53:45,480
that a lot of it is defined by humans
 

4915
01:53:45,480 --> 01:53:48,220
that a lot of it is defined by humans
the systems that you find by humans and

4916
01:53:48,220 --> 01:53:48,230
the systems that you find by humans and
 

4917
01:53:48,230 --> 01:53:53,419
the systems that you find by humans and
and artificial I can essentially create

4918
01:53:53,419 --> 01:53:53,429
and artificial I can essentially create
 

4919
01:53:53,429 --> 01:53:55,520
and artificial I can essentially create
a lot of these artifacts and so on and

4920
01:53:55,520 --> 01:53:55,530
a lot of these artifacts and so on and
 

4921
01:53:55,530 --> 01:53:58,610
a lot of these artifacts and so on and
it's it's not quite the same

4922
01:53:58,610 --> 01:53:58,620
it's it's not quite the same
 

4923
01:53:58,620 --> 01:54:00,890
it's it's not quite the same
you don't derive the computer systems

4924
01:54:00,890 --> 01:54:00,900
you don't derive the computer systems
 

4925
01:54:00,900 --> 01:54:03,950
you don't derive the computer systems
with just a few simple laws you actually

4926
01:54:03,950 --> 01:54:03,960
with just a few simple laws you actually
 

4927
01:54:03,960 --> 01:54:07,580
with just a few simple laws you actually
have to see there's historical reasons

4928
01:54:07,580 --> 01:54:07,590
have to see there's historical reasons
 

4929
01:54:07,590 --> 01:54:10,189
have to see there's historical reasons
why our system is builds and designs one

4930
01:54:10,189 --> 01:54:10,199
why our system is builds and designs one
 

4931
01:54:10,199 --> 01:54:13,729
why our system is builds and designs one
way versus the a day there's a lot more

4932
01:54:13,729 --> 01:54:13,739
way versus the a day there's a lot more
 

4933
01:54:13,739 --> 01:54:17,060
way versus the a day there's a lot more
complexity or less elegant simplicity of

4934
01:54:17,060 --> 01:54:17,070
complexity or less elegant simplicity of
 

4935
01:54:17,070 --> 01:54:19,610
complexity or less elegant simplicity of
e equals mc-squared that kind of reduces

4936
01:54:19,610 --> 01:54:19,620
e equals mc-squared that kind of reduces
 

4937
01:54:19,620 --> 01:54:21,640

fundamental equations but what about the

4940
01:54:24,169 --> 01:54:24,179
fundamental equations but what about the
 

4941
01:54:24,179 --> 01:54:27,410
fundamental equations but what about the
move from China to the United States is

4942
01:54:27,410 --> 01:54:27,420
move from China to the United States is
 

4943
01:54:27,420 --> 01:54:31,130
move from China to the United States is
there anything that still stays in you

4944
01:54:31,130 --> 01:54:31,140
there anything that still stays in you
 

4945
01:54:31,140 --> 01:54:34,160
there anything that still stays in you
that's contributes to your work the fact

4946
01:54:34,160 --> 01:54:34,170
that's contributes to your work the fact
 

4947
01:54:34,170 --> 01:54:37,040
that's contributes to your work the fact
that you grew up in another culture so

4948
01:54:37,040 --> 01:54:37,050
that you grew up in another culture so
 

4949
01:54:37,050 --> 01:54:39,050
that you grew up in another culture so
yes I think especially back then it's

4950
01:54:39,050 --> 01:54:39,060
yes I think especially back then it's
 

4951
01:54:39,060 --> 01:54:42,220
yes I think especially back then it's
very different from now so you know now

4952
01:54:42,220 --> 01:54:42,230
very different from now so you know now
 

4953
01:54:42,230 --> 01:54:46,880
very different from now so you know now
they actually I see these students

4954
01:54:46,880 --> 01:54:46,890
they actually I see these students
 

4955
01:54:46,890 --> 01:54:49,280
they actually I see these students
coming from China and even an aggressor

4956
01:54:49,280 --> 01:54:49,290
coming from China and even an aggressor
 

4957
01:54:49,290 --> 01:54:51,620
coming from China and even an aggressor
actually they speak fluent English it

4958
01:54:51,620 --> 01:54:51,630
actually they speak fluent English it
 

4959
01:54:51,630 --> 01:54:55,790
actually they speak fluent English it
was just you know like amazing and they

4960
01:54:55,790 --> 01:54:55,800
was just you know like amazing and they
 

4961
01:54:55,800 --> 01:54:57,919
was just you know like amazing and they
have already understood so much of the

4962
01:54:57,919 --> 01:54:57,929
have already understood so much of the
 

4963
01:54:57,929 --> 01:55:03,050
have already understood so much of the
culture in the US and so on and it was

4964
01:55:03,050 --> 01:55:03,060
culture in the US and so on and it was
 

4965
01:55:03,060 --> 01:55:05,479
culture in the US and so on and it was
to you was all foreign it was it was a

4966
01:55:05,479 --> 01:55:05,489
to you was all foreign it was it was a
 

4967
01:55:05,489 --> 01:55:08,720
to you was all foreign it was it was a
very different time at a time actually

4968
01:55:08,720 --> 01:55:08,730
very different time at a time actually
 

4969
01:55:08,730 --> 01:55:12,410
very different time at a time actually
even we didn't even have access to email

4970
01:55:12,410 --> 01:55:12,420
even we didn't even have access to email
 

4971
01:55:12,420 --> 01:55:15,020
even we didn't even have access to email
right not to mention about the wealth

4972
01:55:15,020 --> 01:55:15,030
right not to mention about the wealth
 

4973
01:55:15,030 --> 01:55:18,110
right not to mention about the wealth
yeah I remember I had to go to you know

4974
01:55:18,110 --> 01:55:18,120
yeah I remember I had to go to you know
 

4975
01:55:18,120 --> 01:55:21,380
yeah I remember I had to go to you know
specific like you know privileged

4976
01:55:21,380 --> 01:55:21,390
specific like you know privileged
 

4977
01:55:21,390 --> 01:55:30,950
specific like you know privileged
several rooms too much knowledge about

4978
01:55:30,950 --> 01:55:30,960
several rooms too much knowledge about
 

4979
01:55:30,960 --> 01:55:33,590
several rooms too much knowledge about
the Western world and actually at the

4980
01:55:33,590 --> 01:55:33,600
the Western world and actually at the
 

4981
01:55:33,600 --> 01:55:36,710
the Western world and actually at the
time I didn't know actually the the in

4982
01:55:36,710 --> 01:55:36,720
time I didn't know actually the the in
 

4983
01:55:36,720 --> 01:55:38,540
time I didn't know actually the the in
the US the West Coast weather is so much

4984
01:55:38,540 --> 01:55:38,550
the US the West Coast weather is so much
 

4985
01:55:38,550 --> 01:55:43,670
the US the West Coast weather is so much
better than the yeah things like that

4986
01:55:43,670 --> 01:55:43,680
better than the yeah things like that
 

4987
01:55:43,680 --> 01:55:48,860
better than the yeah things like that
actually it's very it's very yeah but

4988
01:55:48,860 --> 01:55:48,870
actually it's very it's very yeah but
 

4989
01:55:48,870 --> 01:55:51,140
actually it's very it's very yeah but
now it's so different at the time I I

4990
01:55:51,140 --> 01:55:51,150
now it's so different at the time I I
 

4991
01:55:51,150 --> 01:55:52,790
now it's so different at the time I I
would say there's also a bigger culture

4992
01:55:52,790 --> 01:55:52,800
would say there's also a bigger culture
 

4993
01:55:52,800 --> 01:55:57,080
would say there's also a bigger culture
difference because there's so much less

4994
01:55:57,080 --> 01:55:57,090
difference because there's so much less
 

4995
01:55:57,090 --> 01:55:59,479
difference because there's so much less
opportunity for shared information so

4996
01:55:59,479 --> 01:55:59,489
opportunity for shared information so
 

4997
01:55:59,489 --> 01:56:01,790
opportunity for shared information so
it's such a different right I meant

4998
01:56:01,790 --> 01:56:01,800
it's such a different right I meant
 

4999
01:56:01,800 --> 01:56:02,210
it's such a different right I meant

let me ask me be a sensor question I'm

5002
01:56:04,610 --> 01:56:04,620
let me ask me be a sensor question I'm
 

5003
01:56:04,620 --> 01:56:07,040
let me ask me be a sensor question I'm
not sure but I think you're not in

5004
01:56:07,040 --> 01:56:07,050
not sure but I think you're not in
 

5005
01:56:07,050 --> 01:56:10,300
not sure but I think you're not in
similar positions is I've been here for

5006
01:56:10,300 --> 01:56:10,310
similar positions is I've been here for
 

5007
01:56:10,310 --> 01:56:14,060
similar positions is I've been here for
already 20 years as well and looking at

5008
01:56:14,060 --> 01:56:14,070
already 20 years as well and looking at
 

5009
01:56:14,070 --> 01:56:15,590
already 20 years as well and looking at
Russia from our perspective and you

5010
01:56:15,590 --> 01:56:15,600
Russia from our perspective and you
 

5011
01:56:15,600 --> 01:56:18,080
Russia from our perspective and you
looking at China in some ways it's a

5012
01:56:18,080 --> 01:56:18,090
looking at China in some ways it's a
 

5013
01:56:18,090 --> 01:56:20,180
looking at China in some ways it's a
very distant place because it's changed

5014
01:56:20,180 --> 01:56:20,190
very distant place because it's changed
 

5015
01:56:20,190 --> 01:56:22,460
very distant place because it's changed
a lot but in some ways you still have

5016
01:56:22,460 --> 01:56:22,470
a lot but in some ways you still have
 

5017
01:56:22,470 --> 01:56:24,080
a lot but in some ways you still have
echoes you have still have knowledge of

5018
01:56:24,080 --> 01:56:24,090
echoes you have still have knowledge of
 

5019
01:56:24,090 --> 01:56:26,540
echoes you have still have knowledge of
that place the question is you know

5020
01:56:26,540 --> 01:56:26,550
that place the question is you know
 

5021
01:56:26,550 --> 01:56:28,070
that place the question is you know
China is doing a lot of incredible work

5022
01:56:28,070 --> 01:56:28,080
China is doing a lot of incredible work
 

5023
01:56:28,080 --> 01:56:32,479
China is doing a lot of incredible work
in AI do you see please tell me there's

5024
01:56:32,479 --> 01:56:32,489
in AI do you see please tell me there's
 

5025
01:56:32,489 --> 01:56:34,370
in AI do you see please tell me there's
an optimistic picture you see where the

5026
01:56:34,370 --> 01:56:34,380
an optimistic picture you see where the
 

5027
01:56:34,380 --> 01:56:37,010
an optimistic picture you see where the
United States and China can collaborate

5028
01:56:37,010 --> 01:56:37,020
United States and China can collaborate
 

5029
01:56:37,020 --> 01:56:38,479
United States and China can collaborate
and sort of grow together in the

5030
01:56:38,479 --> 01:56:38,489
and sort of grow together in the
 

5031
01:56:38,489 --> 01:56:41,330
and sort of grow together in the
development of AI towards you know

5032
01:56:41,330 --> 01:56:41,340
development of AI towards you know
 

5033
01:56:41,340 --> 01:56:43,490
development of AI towards you know
there's different values in terms of the

5034
01:56:43,490 --> 01:56:43,500
there's different values in terms of the
 

5035
01:56:43,500 --> 01:56:45,830
there's different values in terms of the
role of government and so on of ethical

5036
01:56:45,830 --> 01:56:45,840
role of government and so on of ethical
 

5037
01:56:45,840 --> 01:56:49,670
role of government and so on of ethical
transparent secure systems we see it

5038
01:56:49,670 --> 01:56:49,680
transparent secure systems we see it
 

5039
01:56:49,680 --> 01:56:51,200
transparent secure systems we see it
differently in the I States a little bit

5040
01:56:51,200 --> 01:56:51,210
differently in the I States a little bit
 

5041
01:56:51,210 --> 01:56:52,820
differently in the I States a little bit
than China but we're still trying to

5042
01:56:52,820 --> 01:56:52,830
than China but we're still trying to
 

5043
01:56:52,830 --> 01:56:55,130
than China but we're still trying to
work it out do you see the two countries

5044
01:56:55,130 --> 01:56:55,140
work it out do you see the two countries
 

5045
01:56:55,140 --> 01:56:56,840
work it out do you see the two countries
being able to successfully collaborate

5046
01:56:56,840 --> 01:56:56,850
being able to successfully collaborate
 

5047
01:56:56,850 --> 01:57:00,050
being able to successfully collaborate
and work in a healthy way without sort

5048
01:57:00,050 --> 01:57:00,060
and work in a healthy way without sort
 

5049
01:57:00,060 --> 01:57:03,890
and work in a healthy way without sort
of fighting and making it an AI arms

5050
01:57:03,890 --> 01:57:03,900
of fighting and making it an AI arms
 

5051
01:57:03,900 --> 01:57:07,100
of fighting and making it an AI arms
race kind of situation yeah I believe so

5052
01:57:07,100 --> 01:57:07,110
race kind of situation yeah I believe so
 

5053
01:57:07,110 --> 01:57:09,560
race kind of situation yeah I believe so
and I think it's science there's no

5054
01:57:09,560 --> 01:57:09,570
and I think it's science there's no
 

5055
01:57:09,570 --> 01:57:14,630
and I think it's science there's no
border and the advancement of technology

5056
01:57:14,630 --> 01:57:14,640
border and the advancement of technology
 

5057
01:57:14,640 --> 01:57:17,690
border and the advancement of technology
helps everyone helps the whole world and

5058
01:57:17,690 --> 01:57:17,700
helps everyone helps the whole world and
 

5059
01:57:17,700 --> 01:57:21,229
helps everyone helps the whole world and
so I certainly hope that the two

5060
01:57:21,229 --> 01:57:21,239
so I certainly hope that the two
 

5061
01:57:21,239 --> 01:57:22,610
so I certainly hope that the two
countries will collaborate

5062
01:57:22,610 --> 01:57:22,620
countries will collaborate
 

5063
01:57:22,620 --> 01:57:27,050
countries will collaborate
and I certainly believe so do you have

5064
01:57:27,050 --> 01:57:27,060
and I certainly believe so do you have
 

5065
01:57:27,060 --> 01:57:30,410
and I certainly believe so do you have
any reason to believe so except being an

5066
01:57:30,410 --> 01:57:30,420
any reason to believe so except being an
 

5067
01:57:30,420 --> 01:57:33,440
any reason to believe so except being an
optimist so first again like I said

5068
01:57:33,440 --> 01:57:33,450
optimist so first again like I said
 

5069
01:57:33,450 --> 01:57:35,930
optimist so first again like I said
science has no borders and especially

5070
01:57:35,930 --> 01:57:35,940
science has no borders and especially
 

5071
01:57:35,940 --> 01:57:38,450
science has no borders and especially
science doesn't know board borders right

5072
01:57:38,450 --> 01:57:38,460
science doesn't know board borders right
 

5073
01:57:38,460 --> 01:57:41,480
science doesn't know board borders right
and you believe that will you know in

5074
01:57:41,480 --> 01:57:41,490
and you believe that will you know in
 

5075
01:57:41,490 --> 01:57:43,070
and you believe that will you know in
this in the former Soviet Union during

5076
01:57:43,070 --> 01:57:43,080
this in the former Soviet Union during
 

5077
01:57:43,080 --> 01:57:44,770
this in the former Soviet Union during
the Cold War

5078
01:57:44,770 --> 01:57:44,780
the Cold War
 

5079
01:57:44,780 --> 01:57:46,970
the Cold War
yeah so this is the other point I was

5080
01:57:46,970 --> 01:57:46,980
yeah so this is the other point I was
 

5081
01:57:46,980 --> 01:57:49,130
yeah so this is the other point I was
going to mention is that especially in

5082
01:57:49,130 --> 01:57:49,140
going to mention is that especially in
 

5083
01:57:49,140 --> 01:57:51,920
going to mention is that especially in
academic research everything is public

5084
01:57:51,920 --> 01:57:51,930
academic research everything is public
 

5085
01:57:51,930 --> 01:57:54,800
academic research everything is public
like we write papers we open source

5086
01:57:54,800 --> 01:57:54,810
like we write papers we open source
 

5087
01:57:54,810 --> 01:57:58,700
like we write papers we open source
codes and others in the public domain it

5088
01:57:58,700 --> 01:57:58,710
codes and others in the public domain it
 

5089
01:57:58,710 --> 01:58:00,830
codes and others in the public domain it
doesn't matter whether the person is in

5090
01:58:00,830 --> 01:58:00,840
doesn't matter whether the person is in
 

5091
01:58:00,840 --> 01:58:02,660
doesn't matter whether the person is in
the u.s. in China or some other parts of

5092
01:58:02,660 --> 01:58:02,670
the u.s. in China or some other parts of
 

5093
01:58:02,670 --> 01:58:06,290
the u.s. in China or some other parts of
the world and they can go on archive and

5094
01:58:06,290 --> 01:58:06,300
the world and they can go on archive and
 

5095
01:58:06,300 --> 01:58:08,690
the world and they can go on archive and
look at the latest research and results

5096
01:58:08,690 --> 01:58:08,700
look at the latest research and results
 

5097
01:58:08,700 --> 01:58:12,110
look at the latest research and results
so that openness gives you hope yes me

5098
01:58:12,110 --> 01:58:12,120
so that openness gives you hope yes me
 

5099
01:58:12,120 --> 01:58:12,350
so that openness gives you hope yes me
too

5100
01:58:12,350 --> 01:58:12,360
too
 

5101
01:58:12,360 --> 01:58:15,920
too
and that's also how as a world we make

5102
01:58:15,920 --> 01:58:15,930
and that's also how as a world we make
 

5103
01:58:15,930 --> 01:58:20,600
and that's also how as a world we make
progress the best so apologize for the

5104
01:58:20,600 --> 01:58:20,610
progress the best so apologize for the
 

5105
01:58:20,610 --> 01:58:23,420
progress the best so apologize for the
romanticized question but looking back

5106
01:58:23,420 --> 01:58:23,430
romanticized question but looking back
 

5107
01:58:23,430 --> 01:58:24,700
romanticized question but looking back
what would you say was the most

5108
01:58:24,700 --> 01:58:24,710
what would you say was the most
 

5109
01:58:24,710 --> 01:58:30,790
what would you say was the most
transformative moment in your life that

5110
01:58:30,790 --> 01:58:30,800

 

5111
01:58:30,800 --> 01:58:32,930

maybe made you fall in love with

5112
01:58:32,930 --> 01:58:32,940
maybe made you fall in love with
 

5113
01:58:32,940 --> 01:58:34,880
maybe made you fall in love with
computer science you said physics you

5114
01:58:34,880 --> 01:58:34,890
computer science you said physics you
 

5115
01:58:34,890 --> 01:58:36,200
computer science you said physics you
remember there was a moment where you

5116
01:58:36,200 --> 01:58:36,210
remember there was a moment where you
 

5117
01:58:36,210 --> 01:58:37,850
remember there was a moment where you
thought you could derive the entirety of

5118
01:58:37,850 --> 01:58:37,860
thought you could derive the entirety of
 

5119
01:58:37,860 --> 01:58:40,880
thought you could derive the entirety of
the universe was there a moment that you

5120
01:58:40,880 --> 01:58:40,890
the universe was there a moment that you
 

5121
01:58:40,890 --> 01:58:43,430
the universe was there a moment that you
really fell in love with the work you do

5122
01:58:43,430 --> 01:58:43,440
really fell in love with the work you do
 

5123
01:58:43,440 --> 01:58:46,370
really fell in love with the work you do
now from security to machine learning to

5124
01:58:46,370 --> 01:58:46,380
now from security to machine learning to
 

5125
01:58:46,380 --> 01:58:49,940
now from security to machine learning to
program synthesis so maybe as I

5126
01:58:49,940 --> 01:58:49,950
program synthesis so maybe as I
 

5127
01:58:49,950 --> 01:58:53,150
program synthesis so maybe as I
mentioned actually in college a one

5128
01:58:53,150 --> 01:58:53,160
mentioned actually in college a one
 

5129
01:58:53,160 --> 01:58:55,280
mentioned actually in college a one
summer I should tell myself programming

5130
01:58:55,280 --> 01:58:55,290
summer I should tell myself programming
 

5131
01:58:55,290 --> 01:59:00,560
summer I should tell myself programming
see yes you just read a bug don't tell

5132
01:59:00,560 --> 01:59:00,570
see yes you just read a bug don't tell
 

5133
01:59:00,570 --> 01:59:01,760
see yes you just read a bug don't tell
me you fell in love with computer

5134
01:59:01,760 --> 01:59:01,770
me you fell in love with computer
 

5135
01:59:01,770 --> 01:59:04,010
me you fell in love with computer
science by programming and see remember

5136
01:59:04,010 --> 01:59:04,020
science by programming and see remember
 

5137
01:59:04,020 --> 01:59:06,260
science by programming and see remember
I mentioned when one of the draws for me

5138
01:59:06,260 --> 01:59:06,270
I mentioned when one of the draws for me
 

5139
01:59:06,270 --> 01:59:08,780
I mentioned when one of the draws for me
to come here sense is how easy it is to

5140
01:59:08,780 --> 01:59:08,790
to come here sense is how easy it is to
 

5141
01:59:08,790 --> 01:59:12,980
to come here sense is how easy it is to
realize their ideas so once I you don't

5142
01:59:12,980 --> 01:59:12,990
realize their ideas so once I you don't
 

5143
01:59:12,990 --> 01:59:15,200
realize their ideas so once I you don't
read the book started like it taught

5144
01:59:15,200 --> 01:59:15,210
read the book started like it taught
 

5145
01:59:15,210 --> 01:59:16,400
read the book started like it taught
myself how to program and see

5146
01:59:16,400 --> 01:59:16,410
myself how to program and see
 

5147
01:59:16,410 --> 01:59:18,500
myself how to program and see
immediately what what did I do

5148
01:59:18,500 --> 01:59:18,510
immediately what what did I do
 

5149
01:59:18,510 --> 01:59:22,280
immediately what what did I do
like I programmed two games um

5150
01:59:22,280 --> 01:59:22,290
like I programmed two games um
 

5151
01:59:22,290 --> 01:59:25,220
like I programmed two games um
ones just simple like it's a go game

5152
01:59:25,220 --> 01:59:25,230
ones just simple like it's a go game
 

5153
01:59:25,230 --> 01:59:27,350
ones just simple like it's a go game
like it supports you can move the stones

5154
01:59:27,350 --> 01:59:27,360
like it supports you can move the stones
 

5155
01:59:27,360 --> 01:59:29,120
like it supports you can move the stones
and so on and the other one actually

5156
01:59:29,120 --> 01:59:29,130
and so on and the other one actually
 

5157
01:59:29,130 --> 01:59:31,550
and so on and the other one actually
programmed the game that's like a 3d

5158
01:59:31,550 --> 01:59:31,560
programmed the game that's like a 3d
 

5159
01:59:31,560 --> 01:59:34,340
programmed the game that's like a 3d
Tetris it was a to not to be a super

5160
01:59:34,340 --> 01:59:34,350
Tetris it was a to not to be a super
 

5161
01:59:34,350 --> 01:59:36,230
Tetris it was a to not to be a super
hard game to play

5162
01:59:36,230 --> 01:59:36,240
hard game to play
 

5163
01:59:36,240 --> 01:59:38,970
hard game to play
it's obvious the standard 2d Tetris it's

5164
01:59:38,970 --> 01:59:38,980
it's obvious the standard 2d Tetris it's
 

5165
01:59:38,980 --> 01:59:42,120
it's obvious the standard 2d Tetris it's
actually a 3d thing but I can realize

5166
01:59:42,120 --> 01:59:42,130
actually a 3d thing but I can realize
 

5167
01:59:42,130 --> 01:59:44,130
actually a 3d thing but I can realize
wow you know I just had these ideas to

5168
01:59:44,130 --> 01:59:44,140
wow you know I just had these ideas to
 

5169
01:59:44,140 --> 01:59:48,530
wow you know I just had these ideas to
try it out and then you can just do this

5170
01:59:48,530 --> 01:59:48,540
try it out and then you can just do this
 

5171
01:59:48,540 --> 01:59:52,200
try it out and then you can just do this
so that's the one I realized wow this is

5172
01:59:52,200 --> 01:59:52,210
so that's the one I realized wow this is
 

5173
01:59:52,210 --> 01:59:52,950
so that's the one I realized wow this is
amazing

5174
01:59:52,950 --> 01:59:52,960
amazing
 

5175
01:59:52,960 --> 01:59:58,200
amazing
yeah you can create yourself from

5176
01:59:58,200 --> 01:59:58,210
yeah you can create yourself from
 

5177
01:59:58,210 --> 02:00:00,240
yeah you can create yourself from
nothing to something that's actually out

5178
02:00:00,240 --> 02:00:00,250
nothing to something that's actually out
 

5179
02:00:00,250 --> 02:00:03,930
nothing to something that's actually out
in the real world so let me ask let me

5180
02:00:03,930 --> 02:00:03,940
in the real world so let me ask let me
 

5181
02:00:03,940 --> 02:00:05,190
in the real world so let me ask let me
ask a silly question

5182
02:00:05,190 --> 02:00:05,200
ask a silly question
 

5183
02:00:05,200 --> 02:00:08,520
ask a silly question
or maybe the ultimate question what is

5184
02:00:08,520 --> 02:00:08,530
or maybe the ultimate question what is
 

5185
02:00:08,530 --> 02:00:12,960
or maybe the ultimate question what is
to you the meaning of life what what

5186
02:00:12,960 --> 02:00:12,970
to you the meaning of life what what

these are two different questions very

5192
02:00:21,330 --> 02:00:21,340
these are two different questions very
 

5193
02:00:21,340 --> 02:00:23,460
these are two different questions very
different yeah it's easy that you asked

5194
02:00:23,460 --> 02:00:23,470
different yeah it's easy that you asked
 

5195
02:00:23,470 --> 02:00:26,190
different yeah it's easy that you asked
this question maybe this question is

5196
02:00:26,190 --> 02:00:26,200
this question maybe this question is
 

5197

is there something you've arrived at you
 

5207
02:00:41,710 --> 02:00:44,850
is there something you've arrived at you
know that there's a moment I've talked

5208
02:00:44,850 --> 02:00:44,860
know that there's a moment I've talked
 

5209
02:00:44,860 --> 02:00:47,040
know that there's a moment I've talked
to a few people who have faced for

5210
02:00:47,040 --> 02:00:47,050
to a few people who have faced for
 

5211
02:00:47,050 --> 02:00:49,440
to a few people who have faced for
example a cancer diagnosis or faced

5212
02:00:49,440 --> 02:00:49,450
example a cancer diagnosis or faced
 

5213
02:00:49,450 --> 02:00:51,660
example a cancer diagnosis or faced
their own mortality and that seems to

5214
02:00:51,660 --> 02:00:51,670
their own mortality and that seems to
 

5215
02:00:51,670 --> 02:00:55,320
their own mortality and that seems to
change their views and it it seems to be

5216
02:00:55,320 --> 02:00:55,330
change their views and it it seems to be
 

5217
02:00:55,330 --> 02:00:57,720
change their views and it it seems to be
a catalyst for them removing most of the

5218
02:00:57,720 --> 02:00:57,730
a catalyst for them removing most of the
 

5219
02:00:57,730 --> 02:01:01,080
a catalyst for them removing most of the
crap that the of seeing that most of

5220
02:01:01,080 --> 02:01:01,090
crap that the of seeing that most of
 

5221
02:01:01,090 --> 02:01:03,180
crap that the of seeing that most of
what they've been doing is not that

5222
02:01:03,180 --> 02:01:03,190
what they've been doing is not that
 

5223
02:01:03,190 --> 02:01:05,880
what they've been doing is not that
important and really reducing it into

5224
02:01:05,880 --> 02:01:05,890
important and really reducing it into
 

5225
02:01:05,890 --> 02:01:07,890
important and really reducing it into
saying like here's is actually the few

5226
02:01:07,890 --> 02:01:07,900
saying like here's is actually the few
 

5227
02:01:07,900 --> 02:01:11,570
saying like here's is actually the few
things that really give me give meaning

5228
02:01:11,570 --> 02:01:11,580
things that really give me give meaning
 

5229
02:01:11,580 --> 02:01:14,340
things that really give me give meaning
mortality is a really powerful catalyst

5230
02:01:14,340 --> 02:01:14,350
mortality is a really powerful catalyst
 

5231
02:01:14,350 --> 02:01:16,560
mortality is a really powerful catalyst
for that it seems like facing mortality

5232
02:01:16,560 --> 02:01:16,570
for that it seems like facing mortality
 

5233
02:01:16,570 --> 02:01:17,970
for that it seems like facing mortality
whether it's your parents dying or

5234
02:01:17,970 --> 02:01:17,980
whether it's your parents dying or
 

5235
02:01:17,980 --> 02:01:20,100
whether it's your parents dying or
somebody close to you dying or facing

5236
02:01:20,100 --> 02:01:20,110
somebody close to you dying or facing
 

5237
02:01:20,110 --> 02:01:22,110
somebody close to you dying or facing
your own death for whatever reason or

5238
02:01:22,110 --> 02:01:22,120
your own death for whatever reason or
 

5239
02:01:22,120 --> 02:01:25,980
your own death for whatever reason or
cancer and so on yeah in my own case I

5240
02:01:25,980 --> 02:01:25,990
cancer and so on yeah in my own case I
 

5241
02:01:25,990 --> 02:01:36,690
cancer and so on yeah in my own case I
didn't need to face mortality and I

5242
02:01:36,690 --> 02:01:36,700
didn't need to face mortality and I
 

5243
02:01:36,700 --> 02:01:39,330
didn't need to face mortality and I
think there are a couple things so one

5244
02:01:39,330 --> 02:01:39,340
think there are a couple things so one
 

5245
02:01:39,340 --> 02:01:42,690
think there are a couple things so one
is like who should be defining the

5246
02:01:42,690 --> 02:01:42,700
is like who should be defining the
 

5247
02:01:42,700 --> 02:01:45,540
is like who should be defining the
meaning of your life right is there some

5248

meaning of your life right is there some
 

5249
02:01:45,550 --> 02:01:49,300
meaning of your life right is there some
kind of even greater things than you who

5250
02:01:49,300 --> 02:01:49,310
kind of even greater things than you who
 

5251

kind of even greater things than you who
should define the meaning of your life

5253
02:01:51,380 --> 02:01:53,710
should define the meaning of your life
so for example when people say that

5254
02:01:53,710 --> 02:01:53,720
so for example when people say that
 

5255
02:01:53,720 --> 02:01:57,130
so for example when people say that
searching the meaning for our life is is

5256
02:01:57,130 --> 02:01:57,140
searching the meaning for our life is is
 

5257
02:01:57,140 --> 02:02:00,040
searching the meaning for our life is is
there some there is some outside voice

02:02:03,580 --> 02:02:03,590
or is there something you know a set of
 

5261
02:02:03,590 --> 02:02:06,160
or is there something you know a set of
you who actually tells you you know some

5262
02:02:06,160 --> 02:02:06,170
you who actually tells you you know some
 

5263

you who actually tells you you know some
people talk about oh you know this is

5264
02:02:09,670 --> 02:02:09,680
people talk about oh you know this is
 

5265
02:02:09,680 --> 02:02:14,200
people talk about oh you know this is
what you have been born to do right

5266
02:02:14,200 --> 02:02:14,210

5269
02:02:19,910 --> 02:02:21,790
right like this is your destiny um so
who right so that's the one question

5270
02:02:21,790 --> 02:02:21,800
who right so that's the one question
 

5271
02:02:21,800 --> 02:02:24,280
who right so that's the one question
like who gets to define the meaning of

5272
02:02:24,280 --> 02:02:24,290
like who gets to define the meaning of
 

5273
02:02:24,290 --> 02:02:27,040
like who gets to define the meaning of
your life should you be finding some

5274
02:02:27,040 --> 02:02:27,050
your life should you be finding some
 

5275
02:02:27,050 --> 02:02:29,500
your life should you be finding some
other thing some other factor to define

5276
02:02:29,500 --> 02:02:29,510
other thing some other factor to define
 

5277
02:02:29,510 --> 02:02:31,690
other thing some other factor to define
this for you always something actually

5278
02:02:31,690 --> 02:02:31,700
this for you always something actually
 

5279
02:02:31,700 --> 02:02:34,480
this for you always something actually
it's just entirely where you define

5280
02:02:34,480 --> 02:02:34,490
it's just entirely where you define
 

5281
02:02:34,490 --> 02:02:36,760
it's just entirely where you define
yourself and it can be very arbitrary

5282
02:02:36,760 --> 02:02:36,770
yourself and it can be very arbitrary
 

5283
02:02:36,770 --> 02:02:40,900
yourself and it can be very arbitrary
yeah so in inner and inner voice or an

5284
02:02:40,900 --> 02:02:40,910
yeah so in inner and inner voice or an
 

5285
02:02:40,910 --> 02:02:42,700
yeah so in inner and inner voice or an
outer voice whether it's it could be

5286
02:02:42,700 --> 02:02:42,710
outer voice whether it's it could be
 

5287
02:02:42,710 --> 02:02:44,890
outer voice whether it's it could be
spiritual religious - with God or some

5288
02:02:44,890 --> 02:02:44,900
spiritual religious - with God or some
 

5289
02:02:44,900 --> 02:02:47,440
spiritual religious - with God or some
other components of the environment

5290
02:02:47,440 --> 02:02:47,450
other components of the environment
 

5291
02:02:47,450 --> 02:02:50,260
other components of the environment
outside of you or just your own voice do

5292
02:02:50,260 --> 02:02:50,270
outside of you or just your own voice do
 

5293
02:02:50,270 --> 02:02:53,850
outside of you or just your own voice do
you have up do you have an answer there

5294
02:02:53,850 --> 02:02:53,860
you have up do you have an answer there
 

5295
02:02:53,860 --> 02:02:57,310
you have up do you have an answer there
and so you know you know the long period

5296
02:02:57,310 --> 02:02:57,320
and so you know you know the long period
 

5297
02:02:57,320 --> 02:03:00,730
and so you know you know the long period
of time of thinking and searching even

5298
02:03:00,730 --> 02:03:00,740
of time of thinking and searching even
 

5299
02:03:00,740 --> 02:03:04,600
of time of thinking and searching even
searching through outsides right you

5300
02:03:04,600 --> 02:03:04,610
searching through outsides right you
 

5301
02:03:04,610 --> 02:03:07,480
searching through outsides right you
know voices are factors outside of me

5302
02:03:07,480 --> 02:03:07,490
know voices are factors outside of me
 

5303
02:03:07,490 --> 02:03:10,120
know voices are factors outside of me
yeah so that I have and so I've come to

5304
02:03:10,120 --> 02:03:10,130
yeah so that I have and so I've come to
 

5305
02:03:10,130 --> 02:03:14,200
yeah so that I have and so I've come to
the conclusion and realization that it's

5306
02:03:14,200 --> 02:03:14,210
the conclusion and realization that it's
 

5307
02:03:14,210 --> 02:03:16,150
the conclusion and realization that it's
you yourself that you finds the meaning

5308
02:03:16,150 --> 02:03:16,160
you yourself that you finds the meaning
 

5309
02:03:16,160 --> 02:03:19,510
you yourself that you finds the meaning
of life yeah that's a big burden no

5310
02:03:19,510 --> 02:03:19,520
of life yeah that's a big burden no
 

5311
02:03:19,520 --> 02:03:26,980
of life yeah that's a big burden no
isn't it right so then you have the

5312
02:03:26,980 --> 02:03:26,990
isn't it right so then you have the
 

5313
02:03:26,990 --> 02:03:31,480
isn't it right so then you have the
freedom to define it yes and and another

5314
02:03:31,480 --> 02:03:31,490
freedom to define it yes and and another
 

5315
02:03:31,490 --> 02:03:33,520
freedom to define it yes and and another
question is like what does it really

5316
02:03:33,520 --> 02:03:33,530
question is like what does it really
 

5317
02:03:33,530 --> 02:03:39,270
question is like what does it really
mean by the meaning of life right um and

5318
02:03:39,270 --> 02:03:39,280
mean by the meaning of life right um and
 

5319
02:03:39,280 --> 02:03:43,330
mean by the meaning of life right um and
also whether the question even make

5320
02:03:43,330 --> 02:03:43,340
also whether the question even make
 

5321
02:03:43,340 --> 02:03:47,100
also whether the question even make
sense absolutely and you said it somehow

5322
02:03:47,100 --> 02:03:47,110
sense absolutely and you said it somehow
 

5323
02:03:47,110 --> 02:03:50,200
sense absolutely and you said it somehow
distinct from happiness so meaning is

5324
02:03:50,200 --> 02:03:50,210
distinct from happiness so meaning is
 

5325
02:03:50,210 --> 02:03:52,990
distinct from happiness so meaning is
something much deeper than just any kind

5326
02:03:52,990 --> 02:03:53,000
something much deeper than just any kind
 

5327
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:56,590
something much deeper than just any kind
of emotional any any kind of contentment

5328
02:03:56,590 --> 02:03:56,600
of emotional any any kind of contentment
 

5329
02:03:56,600 --> 02:03:58,600
of emotional any any kind of contentment
or joy whatever it might be much deeper

5330
02:03:58,600 --> 02:03:58,610
or joy whatever it might be much deeper
 

5331
02:03:58,610 --> 02:04:01,810
or joy whatever it might be much deeper
and then you have to ask what is deeper

5332
02:04:01,810 --> 02:04:01,820
and then you have to ask what is deeper
 

5333
02:04:01,820 --> 02:04:02,380
and then you have to ask what is deeper
than that

5334
02:04:02,380 --> 02:04:02,390
than that
 

5335
02:04:02,390 --> 02:04:03,170
than that
what is

5336
02:04:03,170 --> 02:04:03,180
what is
 

5337
02:04:03,180 --> 02:04:05,060
what is
what is there at all and then the

5338
02:04:05,060 --> 02:04:05,070
what is there at all and then the
 

5339
02:04:05,070 --> 02:04:08,180
what is there at all and then the
question starts being silly right and

5340
02:04:08,180 --> 02:04:08,190
question starts being silly right and
 

5341
02:04:08,190 --> 02:04:09,890
question starts being silly right and
also you can say it's deeper but you can

5342
02:04:09,890 --> 02:04:09,900
also you can say it's deeper but you can
 

5343
02:04:09,900 --> 02:04:11,630
also you can say it's deeper but you can
also say it's a shallow depending on how

5344
02:04:11,630 --> 02:04:11,640
also say it's a shallow depending on how
 

5345
02:04:11,640 --> 02:04:13,910
also say it's a shallow depending on how
people want to define the meaning of

5346
02:04:13,910 --> 02:04:13,920
people want to define the meaning of
 

5347
02:04:13,920 --> 02:04:15,680
people want to define the meaning of
their life so for example most people

5348
02:04:15,680 --> 02:04:15,690
their life so for example most people
 

5349
02:04:15,690 --> 02:04:16,880
their life so for example most people
don't even think about this question

5350
02:04:16,880 --> 02:04:16,890
don't even think about this question
 

5351
02:04:16,890 --> 02:04:19,580
don't even think about this question
then the meaning of life to them it

5352
02:04:19,580 --> 02:04:19,590
then the meaning of life to them it
 

5353
02:04:19,590 --> 02:04:22,580
then the meaning of life to them it
doesn't really matter that much and also

5354
02:04:22,580 --> 02:04:22,590
doesn't really matter that much and also
 

5355
02:04:22,590 --> 02:04:25,480
doesn't really matter that much and also
whether knowing the meaning of life and

5356
02:04:25,480 --> 02:04:25,490
whether knowing the meaning of life and
 

5357
02:04:25,490 --> 02:04:28,580
whether knowing the meaning of life and
whether actually helps y'all love to be

5358
02:04:28,580 --> 02:04:28,590
whether actually helps y'all love to be
 

5359
02:04:28,590 --> 02:04:29,870
whether actually helps y'all love to be
present area or whether helps your life

5360
02:04:29,870 --> 02:04:29,880
present area or whether helps your life
 

5361
02:04:29,880 --> 02:04:33,500
present area or whether helps your life
to be happier and these actually are

5362

often questions is not worse most
questions open I tend to think that just

5366
02:04:38,930 --> 02:04:38,940
questions open I tend to think that just
 

5367
02:04:38,940 --> 02:04:41,030

you've done for a long time is the only
 

5371
02:04:43,380 --> 02:04:45,680
you've done for a long time is the only
that there is no answer and asking the

5372
02:04:45,680 --> 02:04:45,690
that there is no answer and asking the
 

5373
02:04:45,690 --> 02:04:47,330
that there is no answer and asking the
question is a really good exercise I

5374
02:04:47,330 --> 02:04:47,340
question is a really good exercise I
 

5375

said see programs
 

5393
02:05:12,990 --> 02:05:15,950

02:05:15,950 --> 02:05:15,960
I see programs as little creations I see
 

5395
02:05:15,960 --> 02:05:20,180
I see programs as little creations I see
robots as little creations I think those

5396
02:05:20,180 --> 02:05:20,190
robots as little creations I think those
 

5397
02:05:20,190 --> 02:05:21,920
robots as little creations I think those
are met those of those bring and then

5398
02:05:21,920 --> 02:05:21,930
are met those of those bring and then
 

5399
02:05:21,930 --> 02:05:25,190
are met those of those bring and then
ideas theorems and and are creations and

lot of these scientists but I think they
 

5407
02:05:32,130 --> 02:05:35,390
lot of these scientists but I think they
did a lot of people so that to me if I

5408

did a lot of people so that to me if I
 

5409
02:05:35,400 --> 02:05:37,520
did a lot of people so that to me if I
had to force the answer to that I would

5410
02:05:37,520 --> 02:05:37,530
had to force the answer to that I would
 

5411
02:05:37,530 --> 02:05:43,550
had to force the answer to that I would
say creating new things yourself for you

5412
02:05:43,550 --> 02:05:43,560
say creating new things yourself for you
 

5413
02:05:43,560 --> 02:05:47,030
say creating new things yourself for you
for me for me for me I don't know but

5414
02:05:47,030 --> 02:05:47,040
for me for me for me I don't know but
 

5415
02:05:47,040 --> 02:05:48,680
for me for me for me I don't know but
like you said as he keeps changing is

5416
02:05:48,680 --> 02:05:48,690
like you said as he keeps changing is
 

5417
02:05:48,690 --> 02:05:50,750
like you said as he keeps changing is
there some answer that some people they

5418
02:05:50,750 --> 02:05:50,760
there some answer that some people they
 

5419
02:05:50,760 --> 02:05:53,720
there some answer that some people they
can I think they may say it's experience

5420
02:05:53,720 --> 02:05:53,730
can I think they may say it's experience
 

5421
02:05:53,730 --> 02:05:56,060
can I think they may say it's experience
rights like their meaning of life all

5422
02:05:56,060 --> 02:05:56,070
rights like their meaning of life all
 

5423
02:05:56,070 --> 02:05:56,240
rights like their meaning of life all
right

5424
02:05:56,240 --> 02:05:56,250
right
 

5425
02:05:56,250 --> 02:05:57,980
right
they just want to experience to the

5426
02:05:57,980 --> 02:05:57,990
they just want to experience to the
 

5427
02:05:57,990 --> 02:06:00,320
they just want to experience to the
richest and full as they can and a lot

5428
02:06:00,320 --> 02:06:00,330
richest and full as they can and a lot
 

5429
02:06:00,330 --> 02:06:03,440
richest and full as they can and a lot
of people do take that path yes seeing

5430
02:06:03,440 --> 02:06:03,450
of people do take that path yes seeing
 

5431
02:06:03,450 --> 02:06:05,210
of people do take that path yes seeing
life is actually a collection of moments

5432
02:06:05,210 --> 02:06:05,220
life is actually a collection of moments
 

5433
02:06:05,220 --> 02:06:07,840
life is actually a collection of moments
and then trying to make the richest

5434
02:06:07,840 --> 02:06:07,850
and then trying to make the richest
 

5435
02:06:07,850 --> 02:06:10,170
and then trying to make the richest
possible

5436
02:06:10,170 --> 02:06:10,180
possible
 

5437
02:06:10,180 --> 02:06:12,030
possible
that's filled those moments with the

5438
02:06:12,030 --> 02:06:12,040
that's filled those moments with the
 

5439
02:06:12,040 --> 02:06:14,130
that's filled those moments with the
richest possible experiences yeah right

5440
02:06:14,130 --> 02:06:14,140
richest possible experiences yeah right
 

5441
02:06:14,140 --> 02:06:16,680
richest possible experiences yeah right
and for me I think it's certainly we do

5442
02:06:16,680 --> 02:06:16,690
and for me I think it's certainly we do
 

5443
02:06:16,690 --> 02:06:18,420
and for me I think it's certainly we do
share a lot of similarity here like the

5444
02:06:18,420 --> 02:06:18,430
share a lot of similarity here like the
 

5445
02:06:18,430 --> 02:06:20,100
share a lot of similarity here like the
creation is also really important for me

5446
02:06:20,100 --> 02:06:20,110
creation is also really important for me
 

5447
02:06:20,110 --> 02:06:21,690
creation is also really important for me
even from you know the things that I've

5448
02:06:21,690 --> 02:06:21,700
even from you know the things that I've
 

5449
02:06:21,700 --> 02:06:25,410
even from you know the things that I've
already talked about even like you know

5450
02:06:25,410 --> 02:06:25,420
already talked about even like you know
 

5451
02:06:25,420 --> 02:06:26,580
already talked about even like you know
writing papers and these are our

5452
02:06:26,580 --> 02:06:26,590
writing papers and these are our
 

5453
02:06:26,590 --> 02:06:31,950
writing papers and these are our
creations as well and I have not quite

5454
02:06:31,950 --> 02:06:31,960
creations as well and I have not quite
 

5455
02:06:31,960 --> 02:06:33,900
creations as well and I have not quite
thought whether that has really the

5456
02:06:33,900 --> 02:06:33,910
thought whether that has really the
 

5457
02:06:33,910 --> 02:06:35,730
thought whether that has really the
meaning of my life like in a sense also

5458
02:06:35,730 --> 02:06:35,740
meaning of my life like in a sense also
 

5459
02:06:35,740 --> 02:06:37,800
meaning of my life like in a sense also
that maybe like what kind of things

5460
02:06:37,800 --> 02:06:37,810
that maybe like what kind of things
 

5461
02:06:37,810 --> 02:06:38,910
that maybe like what kind of things
should you create there's so many

5462
02:06:38,910 --> 02:06:38,920
should you create there's so many
 

5463
02:06:38,920 --> 02:06:41,750
should you create there's so many
different things that you could create

5464
02:06:41,750 --> 02:06:41,760
different things that you could create
 

5465
02:06:41,760 --> 02:06:44,820
different things that you could create
and also you can say another view is

5466
02:06:44,820 --> 02:06:44,830
and also you can say another view is
 

5467
02:06:44,830 --> 02:06:48,990
and also you can say another view is
maybe growth is it's related but

5468
02:06:48,990 --> 02:06:49,000
maybe growth is it's related but
 

5469
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:51,570
maybe growth is it's related but
different from experience growth is also

5470
02:06:51,570 --> 02:06:51,580
different from experience growth is also
 

5471
02:06:51,580 --> 02:06:53,820
different from experience growth is also
maybe type of meaning of life it's just

5472
02:06:53,820 --> 02:06:53,830
maybe type of meaning of life it's just
 

5473
02:06:53,830 --> 02:06:56,790
maybe type of meaning of life it's just
you try to grow every day try to be a

5474
02:06:56,790 --> 02:06:56,800
you try to grow every day try to be a
 

5475
02:06:56,800 --> 02:07:01,200
you try to grow every day try to be a
better self every day and and also

5476
02:07:01,200 --> 02:07:01,210
better self every day and and also
 

5477
02:07:01,210 --> 02:07:05,550
better self every day and and also
ultimately we are here it's part of the

5478
02:07:05,550 --> 02:07:05,560
ultimately we are here it's part of the
 

5479
02:07:05,560 --> 02:07:10,440
ultimately we are here it's part of the
overall evolution the right the world is

5480
02:07:10,440 --> 02:07:10,450
overall evolution the right the world is
 

5481
02:07:10,450 --> 02:07:13,020
overall evolution the right the world is
evolving it's funny it's funny that the

5482
02:07:13,020 --> 02:07:13,030
evolving it's funny it's funny that the
 

5483
02:07:13,030 --> 02:07:15,330
evolving it's funny it's funny that the
growth seems to be the more important

5484
02:07:15,330 --> 02:07:15,340
growth seems to be the more important
 

5485
02:07:15,340 --> 02:07:17,220
growth seems to be the more important
thing than the thing you're growing

5486
02:07:17,220 --> 02:07:17,230
thing than the thing you're growing
 

5487
02:07:17,230 --> 02:07:19,650
thing than the thing you're growing
towards it's like it's not the goal it's

5488
02:07:19,650 --> 02:07:19,660
towards it's like it's not the goal it's
 

5489
02:07:19,660 --> 02:07:22,680
towards it's like it's not the goal it's
the the journey to it sort of it's

5490
02:07:22,680 --> 02:07:22,690
the the journey to it sort of it's
 

5491
02:07:22,690 --> 02:07:24,240
the the journey to it sort of it's
almost it's almost when you submit a

5492
02:07:24,240 --> 02:07:24,250
almost it's almost when you submit a
 

5493
02:07:24,250 --> 02:07:28,110
almost it's almost when you submit a
paper it's there's a sort of depressing

5494
02:07:28,110 --> 02:07:28,120
paper it's there's a sort of depressing
 

5495
02:07:28,120 --> 02:07:30,360
paper it's there's a sort of depressing
element to it not to submit a paper but

5496
02:07:30,360 --> 02:07:30,370
element to it not to submit a paper but
 

5497
02:07:30,370 --> 02:07:32,580
element to it not to submit a paper but
when that whole project is over I mean

5498
02:07:32,580 --> 02:07:32,590
when that whole project is over I mean
 

5499
02:07:32,590 --> 02:07:34,230
when that whole project is over I mean
there's a gratitude there's a

5500
02:07:34,230 --> 02:07:34,240
there's a gratitude there's a
 

5501
02:07:34,240 --> 02:07:36,960
there's a gratitude there's a
celebration and so on but you're usually

5502
02:07:36,960 --> 02:07:36,970
celebration and so on but you're usually
 

5503
02:07:36,970 --> 02:07:38,490
celebration and so on but you're usually
immediately looking for the next thing

5504
02:07:38,490 --> 02:07:38,500
immediately looking for the next thing
 

5505
02:07:38,500 --> 02:07:41,940
immediately looking for the next thing
yeah the next step right it's not it's

5506
02:07:41,940 --> 02:07:41,950
yeah the next step right it's not it's
 

5507
02:07:41,950 --> 02:07:43,470
yeah the next step right it's not it's
not that status that at the end of it is

5508
02:07:43,470 --> 02:07:43,480
not that status that at the end of it is
 

5509
02:07:43,480 --> 02:07:45,990
not that status that at the end of it is
not the satisfaction is the the hardship

5510
02:07:45,990 --> 02:07:46,000
not the satisfaction is the the hardship
 

5511
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:47,280
not the satisfaction is the the hardship
the challenge you have to overcome the

5512
02:07:47,280 --> 02:07:47,290
the challenge you have to overcome the
 

5513
02:07:47,290 --> 02:07:48,900
the challenge you have to overcome the
growth through the process it's

5514
02:07:48,900 --> 02:07:48,910
growth through the process it's
 

5515
02:07:48,910 --> 02:07:50,580
growth through the process it's
something it's somehow probably deeply

5516
02:07:50,580 --> 02:07:50,590
something it's somehow probably deeply
 

5517
02:07:50,590 --> 02:07:52,440
something it's somehow probably deeply
within us the same thing that drove that

5518
02:07:52,440 --> 02:07:52,450
within us the same thing that drove that
 

5519
02:07:52,450 --> 02:07:54,300
within us the same thing that drove that
drives the evolutionary process is

5520
02:07:54,300 --> 02:07:54,310
drives the evolutionary process is
 

5521
02:07:54,310 --> 02:07:56,580
drives the evolutionary process is
somehow within us with everything the

5522
02:07:56,580 --> 02:07:56,590
somehow within us with everything the
 

5523
02:07:56,590 --> 02:07:59,040
somehow within us with everything the
way the way we see the world since

02:07:59,040 --> 02:07:59,050
way the way we see the world since

you're thinking about this so you're
 

5527
02:08:00,400 --> 02:08:03,360
you're thinking about this so you're
still in search of an answer I mean yes

5528

still in search of an answer I mean yes
 

5529
02:08:03,370 --> 02:08:07,110
still in search of an answer I mean yes
and no in the sense that I think for

5530
02:08:07,110 --> 02:08:07,120
and no in the sense that I think for
 

5531
02:08:07,120 --> 02:08:10,020
and no in the sense that I think for
people who really dedicate time to

5532
02:08:10,020 --> 02:08:10,030
people who really dedicate time to
 

5533
02:08:10,030 --> 02:08:12,810
people who really dedicate time to
search for the answer to ask a question

5534
02:08:12,810 --> 02:08:12,820
search for the answer to ask a question
 

5535
02:08:12,820 --> 02:08:16,290
search for the answer to ask a question
what is the meaning of life it does not

5536
02:08:16,290 --> 02:08:16,300
what is the meaning of life it does not
 

5537
02:08:16,300 --> 02:08:19,050

as we bring your happiness
 

5539
02:08:19,060 --> 02:08:23,350
as we bring your happiness
yeah it's a question and we can say

5540
02:08:23,350 --> 02:08:23,360
yeah it's a question and we can say
 

5541
02:08:23,360 --> 02:08:24,850
yeah it's a question and we can say
right like weather is a well-defined

5542
02:08:24,850 --> 02:08:24,860
right like weather is a well-defined
 

5543
02:08:24,860 --> 02:08:29,320
right like weather is a well-defined
question and and on the other and but on

5544
02:08:29,320 --> 02:08:29,330
question and and on the other and but on
 

5545
02:08:29,330 --> 02:08:32,620
question and and on the other and but on
the other hand given that you get two

5546
02:08:32,620 --> 02:08:32,630
the other hand given that you get two
 

5547
02:08:32,630 --> 02:08:34,540
the other hand given that you get two
answers yourself you can define it

5548
02:08:34,540 --> 02:08:34,550
answers yourself you can define it
 

5549
02:08:34,550 --> 02:08:35,340
answers yourself you can define it
yourself

5550
02:08:35,340 --> 02:08:35,350
yourself
 

5551
02:08:35,350 --> 02:08:39,630
yourself
sure I can't just you know give it

5552
02:08:39,630 --> 02:08:39,640
sure I can't just you know give it
 

5553
02:08:39,640 --> 02:08:44,169
sure I can't just you know give it
answer and in that sense yes it can help

5554
02:08:44,169 --> 02:08:44,179
answer and in that sense yes it can help
 

5555
02:08:44,179 --> 02:08:48,130
answer and in that sense yes it can help
and like it's like we discussed if you

5556
02:08:48,130 --> 02:08:48,140
and like it's like we discussed if you
 

5557
02:08:48,140 --> 02:08:51,610
and like it's like we discussed if you
say oh then my meaning of life is to

5558
02:08:51,610 --> 02:08:51,620
say oh then my meaning of life is to
 

5559
02:08:51,620 --> 02:08:55,540
say oh then my meaning of life is to
create are to grow then then yes then I

5560
02:08:55,540 --> 02:08:55,550
create are to grow then then yes then I
 

5561
02:08:55,550 --> 02:08:58,030
create are to grow then then yes then I
think they can help but how do you know

5562
02:08:58,030 --> 02:08:58,040
think they can help but how do you know
 

5563
02:08:58,040 --> 02:09:00,280
think they can help but how do you know
that that is really the meaning of life

5564
02:09:00,280 --> 02:09:00,290
that that is really the meaning of life
 

5565
02:09:00,290 --> 02:09:03,790
that that is really the meaning of life
are the meaning of your life it's like

5568
02:09:05,140 --> 02:09:05,150
there's no way for you to really answer
 

5569
02:09:05,150 --> 02:09:06,939
there's no way for you to really answer
the question sure but something about

5570
02:09:06,939 --> 02:09:06,949
the question sure but something about
 

5571
02:09:06,949 --> 02:09:10,540
the question sure but something about
that certainty is liberating so if it

5572
02:09:10,540 --> 02:09:10,550
that certainty is liberating so if it
 

5573
02:09:10,550 --> 02:09:12,250
that certainty is liberating so if it
might be an illusion you know you might

5574
02:09:12,250 --> 02:09:12,260
might be an illusion you know you might
 

5575
02:09:12,260 --> 02:09:13,360
might be an illusion you know you might
not really know you might be just

5576
02:09:13,360 --> 02:09:13,370
not really know you might be just
 

5577
02:09:13,370 --> 02:09:15,700
not really know you might be just
convincing yourself falsely falsely but

5578
02:09:15,700 --> 02:09:15,710
convincing yourself falsely falsely but
 

5579
02:09:15,710 --> 02:09:18,669
convincing yourself falsely falsely but
being sure that that's the meaning the

5580
02:09:18,669 --> 02:09:18,679
being sure that that's the meaning the
 

5581
02:09:18,679 --> 02:09:21,880
being sure that that's the meaning the
there's something there's something

5582

liberating in that in that there's

5584
02:09:23,500 --> 02:09:23,510
liberating in that in that there's
 

5585
02:09:23,510 --> 02:09:25,689
liberating in that in that there's
something freeing in knowing this is

5586
02:09:25,689 --> 02:09:25,699
something freeing in knowing this is
 

5587
02:09:25,699 --> 02:09:27,459
something freeing in knowing this is
your purpose so you can fully give

5588
02:09:27,459 --> 02:09:27,469
your purpose so you can fully give
 

5589
02:09:27,469 --> 02:09:29,919
your purpose so you can fully give
yourself to that without you know for a

5590
02:09:29,919 --> 02:09:29,929
yourself to that without you know for a
 

5591
02:09:29,929 --> 02:09:32,560
yourself to that without you know for a
long time you know I thought like isn't

5592
02:09:32,560 --> 02:09:32,570
long time you know I thought like isn't
 

5593
02:09:32,570 --> 02:09:36,610
long time you know I thought like isn't
it all right like why what's how do we

5594
02:09:36,610 --> 02:09:36,620
it all right like why what's how do we
 

5595
02:09:36,620 --> 02:09:38,050
it all right like why what's how do we
even know what's good and what's evil

5596
02:09:38,050 --> 02:09:38,060
even know what's good and what's evil
 

5597
02:09:38,060 --> 02:09:39,850
even know what's good and what's evil
like it isn't everything just relative

5598
02:09:39,850 --> 02:09:39,860
like it isn't everything just relative
 

5599
02:09:39,860 --> 02:09:43,450
like it isn't everything just relative
like how do we know you know the the

5600
02:09:43,450 --> 02:09:43,460
like how do we know you know the the
 

5601
02:09:43,460 --> 02:09:44,979
like how do we know you know the the
question of meaning is ultimately the

5602
02:09:44,979 --> 02:09:44,989
question of meaning is ultimately the
 

5603
02:09:44,989 --> 02:09:48,640
question of meaning is ultimately the
question of why do anything why is

5604
02:09:48,640 --> 02:09:48,650
question of why do anything why is
 

5605
02:09:48,650 --> 02:09:52,530
question of why do anything why is
anything good or bad why is anything

5606
02:09:52,530 --> 02:09:52,540
anything good or bad why is anything
 

5607
02:09:52,540 --> 02:09:57,010
anything good or bad why is anything
moment then you start to I think just

5608
02:09:57,010 --> 02:09:57,020
moment then you start to I think just
 

5609
02:09:57,020 --> 02:09:59,320
moment then you start to I think just
like you said I think it's a really

5610
02:09:59,320 --> 02:09:59,330
like you said I think it's a really
 

5611
02:09:59,330 --> 02:10:03,669
like you said I think it's a really
useful question to ask but if you ask it

5612
02:10:03,669 --> 02:10:03,679
useful question to ask but if you ask it
 

5613
02:10:03,679 --> 02:10:07,870
useful question to ask but if you ask it
for too long and too aggressively I mean

5614
02:10:07,870 --> 02:10:07,880
for too long and too aggressively I mean
 

5615
02:10:07,880 --> 02:10:09,640
for too long and too aggressively I mean
not be so protect it not be productive

5616
02:10:09,640 --> 02:10:09,650
not be so protect it not be productive
 

5617
02:10:09,650 --> 02:10:13,899
not be so protect it not be productive
and not just for traditionally society

5618
02:10:13,899 --> 02:10:13,909
and not just for traditionally society
 

5619
02:10:13,909 --> 02:10:16,540
and not just for traditionally society
to find success but also for happiness

5620
02:10:16,540 --> 02:10:16,550
to find success but also for happiness
 

5621
02:10:16,550 --> 02:10:18,880
to find success but also for happiness
it seems like asking the question about

5622
02:10:18,880 --> 02:10:18,890
it seems like asking the question about
 

5623
02:10:18,890 --> 02:10:23,580
it seems like asking the question about
the meaning of life is like a trap is uh

5624
02:10:23,580 --> 02:10:23,590
the meaning of life is like a trap is uh
 

5625
02:10:23,590 --> 02:10:26,290
the meaning of life is like a trap is uh
were destined to be asking we destined

5626
02:10:26,290 --> 02:10:26,300
were destined to be asking we destined
 

5627
02:10:26,300 --> 02:10:27,790
were destined to be asking we destined
to look up to the stars and ask these

5628
02:10:27,790 --> 02:10:27,800
to look up to the stars and ask these
 

5629
02:10:27,800 --> 02:10:29,290
to look up to the stars and ask these
big white questions we'll never be able

5630
02:10:29,290 --> 02:10:29,300
big white questions we'll never be able
 

5631
02:10:29,300 --> 02:10:31,720
big white questions we'll never be able
to answer but we shouldn't get lost in

5632
02:10:31,720 --> 02:10:31,730
to answer but we shouldn't get lost in
 

5633
02:10:31,730 --> 02:10:32,170
to answer but we shouldn't get lost in
them and

5634
02:10:32,170 --> 02:10:32,180
them and
 

5635
02:10:32,180 --> 02:10:34,810
them and
that's probably the that's at least a

5636
02:10:34,810 --> 02:10:34,820
that's probably the that's at least a
 

5637
02:10:34,820 --> 02:10:36,850
that's probably the that's at least a
lesson I picked up so far I'm noting

5638
02:10:36,850 --> 02:10:36,860
lesson I picked up so far I'm noting
 

5639
02:10:36,860 --> 02:10:38,530
lesson I picked up so far I'm noting
that topic let me just add one more

5640
02:10:38,530 --> 02:10:38,540
that topic let me just add one more
 

5641
02:10:38,540 --> 02:10:41,800
that topic let me just add one more
thing so it's interesting so actually so

5642
02:10:41,800 --> 02:10:41,810
thing so it's interesting so actually so
 

5643
02:10:41,810 --> 02:10:46,030
thing so it's interesting so actually so
sometimes yes it can help you and to

5644
02:10:46,030 --> 02:10:46,040
sometimes yes it can help you and to
 

5645
02:10:46,040 --> 02:10:51,730
sometimes yes it can help you and to
focus so when I when I shifted my focus

5646
02:10:51,730 --> 02:10:51,740
focus so when I when I shifted my focus
 

5647
02:10:51,740 --> 02:10:54,850
focus so when I when I shifted my focus
more from security to a I am a Sunni at

5648
02:10:54,850 --> 02:10:54,860
more from security to a I am a Sunni at
 

5649
02:10:54,860 --> 02:10:58,060
more from security to a I am a Sunni at
the time the actually one of the main

5650
02:10:58,060 --> 02:10:58,070
the time the actually one of the main
 

5651
02:10:58,070 --> 02:11:01,360
the time the actually one of the main
reason why I did that was because at the

5652
02:11:01,360 --> 02:11:01,370
reason why I did that was because at the
 

5653
02:11:01,370 --> 02:11:06,820
reason why I did that was because at the
time I thought my mini the meaning of my

5654
02:11:06,820 --> 02:11:06,830
time I thought my mini the meaning of my
 

5655
02:11:06,830 --> 02:11:09,910
time I thought my mini the meaning of my
life and the purpose of my life is to

5656
02:11:09,910 --> 02:11:09,920
life and the purpose of my life is to
 

5657
02:11:09,920 --> 02:11:14,290
life and the purpose of my life is to
build in hydrogen machines and that's

5658
02:11:14,290 --> 02:11:14,300
build in hydrogen machines and that's
 

5659
02:11:14,300 --> 02:11:16,960
build in hydrogen machines and that's
and then your inner voice said that this

5660
02:11:16,960 --> 02:11:16,970
and then your inner voice said that this
 

5661
02:11:16,970 --> 02:11:19,450
and then your inner voice said that this
is the right this is the right journey

5662
02:11:19,450 --> 02:11:19,460
is the right this is the right journey
 

5663
02:11:19,460 --> 02:11:20,920
is the right this is the right journey
to take to build intelligent machines

5664
02:11:20,920 --> 02:11:20,930
to take to build intelligent machines
 

5665
02:11:20,930 --> 02:11:23,470
to take to build intelligent machines
and that you actually fully realized you

5666
02:11:23,470 --> 02:11:23,480
and that you actually fully realized you
 

5667
02:11:23,480 --> 02:11:26,530
and that you actually fully realized you
took a really legitimate big step to

5668
02:11:26,530 --> 02:11:26,540
took a really legitimate big step to
 

5669
02:11:26,540 --> 02:11:27,610
