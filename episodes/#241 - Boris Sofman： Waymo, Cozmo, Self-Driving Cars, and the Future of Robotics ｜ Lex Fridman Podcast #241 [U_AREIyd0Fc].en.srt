those were fantastic and then uh
 

81
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,190
those were fantastic and then uh
the terminator series just like really

82
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:33,200
the terminator series just like really
 

83
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,149
the terminator series just like really
really

84
00:01:34,149 --> 00:01:34,159
really
 

85
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,870
really
pretty wide wide range right uh but uh i

86
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:36,880
pretty wide wide range right uh but uh i
 

87
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,630
pretty wide wide range right uh but uh i
kind of love this uh dynamic where you

88
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:38,640
kind of love this uh dynamic where you
 

89
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,550
kind of love this uh dynamic where you
have this like incredible terminator

90
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:40,560
have this like incredible terminator
 

91
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,789
have this like incredible terminator
itself that arnold played but uh and

92
00:01:42,789 --> 00:01:42,799
itself that arnold played but uh and
 

93
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,429
itself that arnold played but uh and
then he was kind of like the inferior

94
00:01:45,429 --> 00:01:45,439
then he was kind of like the inferior
 

95
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,270
then he was kind of like the inferior
like previous generation version that

96
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:47,280
like previous generation version that
 

97
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,510
like previous generation version that
was like totally outmatched uh you know

98
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:49,520
was like totally outmatched uh you know
 

99
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,350
was like totally outmatched uh you know
in terms of kind of specs by the new one

100
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:51,360
in terms of kind of specs by the new one
 

101
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,030
in terms of kind of specs by the new one
but you know still kind of like held his

102
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:53,040
but you know still kind of like held his
 

103
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,789
but you know still kind of like held his
own and so it was kind of interesting

104
00:01:54,789 --> 00:01:54,799
own and so it was kind of interesting
 

105
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:56,950
own and so it was kind of interesting
where you you realize how many how many

106
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:56,960
where you you realize how many how many
 

107
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,789
where you you realize how many how many
levels there are on the spectrum from

108
00:01:58,789 --> 00:01:58,799
levels there are on the spectrum from
 

109
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,709
levels there are on the spectrum from
human to kind of potentials and ai and

110
00:02:00,709 --> 00:02:00,719
human to kind of potentials and ai and
 

111
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,670
human to kind of potentials and ai and
robotics to uh futures and so yeah that

112
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:03,680
robotics to uh futures and so yeah that
 

113
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,310
robotics to uh futures and so yeah that
movie really uh as much as it was like

114
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:06,320
movie really uh as much as it was like
 

115
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,710
movie really uh as much as it was like
kind of a dark world in a way was

116
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:08,720
kind of a dark world in a way was
 

117
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,229
kind of a dark world in a way was
actually quite fascinating gets the

118
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:10,239
actually quite fascinating gets the
 

119
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:11,589
actually quite fascinating gets the
imagination going well from an

120
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:11,599
imagination going well from an
 

121
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,270
imagination going well from an
engineering perspective both the movies

122
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:13,280
engineering perspective both the movies
 

123
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,670
engineering perspective both the movies
you mentioned wally and

124
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:15,680
you mentioned wally and
 

125
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,910
you mentioned wally and
terminator the first one

126
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:17,920
terminator the first one
 

127
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,309
terminator the first one
is probably achievable you know humanoid

128
00:02:20,309 --> 00:02:20,319
is probably achievable you know humanoid
 

129
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:21,350
is probably achievable you know humanoid
robot

130
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:21,360
robot
 

131
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,990
robot
maybe not with like the realism in terms

132
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:24,000
maybe not with like the realism in terms
 

133
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,830
maybe not with like the realism in terms
of skin and so on but

134
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:25,840
of skin and so on but
 

135
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,070
of skin and so on but
that humanoid form we have the humanoid

136
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:28,080
that humanoid form we have the humanoid
 

137
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,229
that humanoid form we have the humanoid
form it seems like a compelling form

138
00:02:30,229 --> 00:02:30,239
form it seems like a compelling form
 

139
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:31,509
form it seems like a compelling form
maybe the challenge is just super

140
00:02:31,509 --> 00:02:31,519
maybe the challenge is just super
 

141
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:34,150
maybe the challenge is just super
expensive to engine to build but you can

142
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:34,160
expensive to engine to build but you can
 

143
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,710
expensive to engine to build but you can
imagine maybe not a machine of war but

144
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:36,720
imagine maybe not a machine of war but
 

145
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,869
imagine maybe not a machine of war but
you could imagine terminator type robots

146
00:02:38,869 --> 00:02:38,879
you could imagine terminator type robots
 

147
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,550
you could imagine terminator type robots
walking around

148
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:40,560
walking around
 

149
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,390
walking around
and then the same obviously with wall-e

150
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:42,400
and then the same obviously with wall-e
 

151
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,150
and then the same obviously with wall-e
you've basically so for people who don't

152
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:44,160
you've basically so for people who don't
 

153
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,630
you've basically so for people who don't
know you uh created the company anki

154
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:46,640
know you uh created the company anki
 

155
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,270
know you uh created the company anki
that created a small robot with a big

156
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:49,280
that created a small robot with a big
 

157
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,990
that created a small robot with a big
personality called coswell that just it

158
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:52,000
personality called coswell that just it
 

159
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,150
personality called coswell that just it
does exactly what wally does which is

160
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:54,160
does exactly what wally does which is
 

161
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,830
does exactly what wally does which is
somehow with

162
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:55,840
somehow with
 

163
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,430
somehow with
very few basic

164
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:57,440
very few basic
 

165
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,430
very few basic
visual tools is able to communicate a

166
00:02:59,430 --> 00:02:59,440
visual tools is able to communicate a
 

167
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,229

depth of emotion and that's fascinating

168
00:03:02,229 --> 00:03:02,239
depth of emotion and that's fascinating
 

169
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:05,589
depth of emotion and that's fascinating
but then again the humanoid form is

170
00:03:05,589 --> 00:03:05,599
but then again the humanoid form is
 

171
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,949
but then again the humanoid form is
uh super compelling so like uh cosmo is

172
00:03:08,949 --> 00:03:08,959
uh super compelling so like uh cosmo is
 

173
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,030
uh super compelling so like uh cosmo is
very distant from a humanoid form and

174
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:11,040
very distant from a humanoid form and
 

175
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,110
very distant from a humanoid form and
then the terminator has a humanoid form

176
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:13,120
then the terminator has a humanoid form
 

177
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,030
then the terminator has a humanoid form
you can imagine both of those actually

178
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:15,040
you can imagine both of those actually
 

179
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,190
you can imagine both of those actually
being in our society it's true and it's

180
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:17,200
being in our society it's true and it's
 

181
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,270
being in our society it's true and it's
interesting because um it was very

182
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:19,280
interesting because um it was very
 

183
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,229
interesting because um it was very
intentional to go really far away from

184
00:03:22,229 --> 00:03:22,239
intentional to go really far away from
 

185
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:23,830
intentional to go really far away from
human form when you think about a

186
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:23,840
human form when you think about a
 

187
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,309
human form when you think about a
character like cosmo or like wall-e

188
00:03:26,309 --> 00:03:26,319
character like cosmo or like wall-e
 

189
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:27,990
character like cosmo or like wall-e
where

190
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:28,000
where
 

191
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,550
where
you can completely rethink uh the

192
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:30,560
you can completely rethink uh the
 

193
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,789
you can completely rethink uh the
constraints you put on that character um

194
00:03:32,789 --> 00:03:32,799
constraints you put on that character um
 

195
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:34,869
constraints you put on that character um
what tools you leverage and then how you

196
00:03:34,869 --> 00:03:34,879
what tools you leverage and then how you
 

197
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:38,070
what tools you leverage and then how you
actually create a personality uh and a

198
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:38,080
actually create a personality uh and a
 

199
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,589
actually create a personality uh and a
level of intelligence interactivity that

200
00:03:39,589 --> 00:03:39,599
level of intelligence interactivity that
 

201
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,030
level of intelligence interactivity that
actually

202
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:41,040
actually
 

203
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,869
actually
matches the constraints that you're

204
00:03:42,869 --> 00:03:42,879
matches the constraints that you're
 

205
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:45,670
matches the constraints that you're
under whether it's mechanical or sensors

206
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:45,680
under whether it's mechanical or sensors
 

207
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,789
under whether it's mechanical or sensors
or ai of the day this is why i almost

was always really surprised by how much

210
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:50,560
was always really surprised by how much
 

211
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,149
was always really surprised by how much
energy people put towards trying to

212
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:52,159
energy people put towards trying to
 

213
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:54,869
energy people put towards trying to
replicate human form in a robot because

214
00:03:54,869 --> 00:03:54,879
replicate human form in a robot because
 

215
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,470
replicate human form in a robot because
you actually take on some pretty

216
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:56,480
you actually take on some pretty
 

217
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,869
you actually take on some pretty
significant um kind of constraints and

218
00:03:58,869 --> 00:03:58,879
significant um kind of constraints and
 

219
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,390
significant um kind of constraints and
downsides when you do that

220
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:00,400
downsides when you do that
 

221
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,390
downsides when you do that
um the first of which is obviously the

um the first of which is obviously the
 

223
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,229

reasonably close form takes like a giant

00:04:14,869 --> 00:04:14,879
reasonably close form takes like a giant

00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,030
reasonably close form takes like a giant
amount of joints and actuators and uh in

00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:17,040
amount of joints and actuators and uh in
 

237
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,030
amount of joints and actuators and uh in
motion and and you know sensors and

238
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:19,040
motion and and you know sensors and
 

239
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,670
motion and and you know sensors and
encoders and so forth but then um you're

00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:21,680
encoders and so forth but then um you're
 

241
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,909
encoders and so forth but then um you're
almost like setting an expectation that

242
00:04:23,909 --> 00:04:23,919
almost like setting an expectation that
 

243
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:25,430
almost like setting an expectation that
the closer you try to get to human form

244
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:25,440
the closer you try to get to human form
 

245
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,870
the closer you try to get to human form
the more you expect the strengths to

246
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:26,880
the more you expect the strengths to
 

247
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,070
the more you expect the strengths to
match and that's not the way ai works is

248
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:30,080
match and that's not the way ai works is
 

249
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,510
match and that's not the way ai works is
there's places where you're way stronger

250
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:31,520
there's places where you're way stronger
 

251
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,110
there's places where you're way stronger
and there's places where you're weaker

252
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:33,120
and there's places where you're weaker
 

253
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,870
and there's places where you're weaker
and by moving away from human form you

254
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:34,880
and by moving away from human form you
 

255
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,390
and by moving away from human form you
can actually

256
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:36,400
can actually
 

257
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,230
can actually
change the rules and embrace your

258
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:38,240
change the rules and embrace your
 

259
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,990
change the rules and embrace your
strengths and bypass your weaknesses and

260
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:40,000
strengths and bypass your weaknesses and
 

261
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,870
strengths and bypass your weaknesses and
at the same time the human form

262
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:42,880
at the same time the human form
 

263
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,189
at the same time the human form
like has way too many degrees of freedom

264
00:04:45,189 --> 00:04:45,199
like has way too many degrees of freedom
 

265
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,430
like has way too many degrees of freedom
to play with it's it's kind of

266
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:47,440
to play with it's it's kind of
 

267
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,510
to play with it's it's kind of
counterintuitive just as you're saying

268
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:49,520
counterintuitive just as you're saying
 

269
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,629
counterintuitive just as you're saying
but when you have fewer constraints

270
00:04:52,629 --> 00:04:52,639
but when you have fewer constraints
 

271
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,749
but when you have fewer constraints
it's almost harder to master the the

272
00:04:55,749 --> 00:04:55,759
it's almost harder to master the the
 

273
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,990
it's almost harder to master the the
communication of emotion like you see

274
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:58,000
communication of emotion like you see
 

275
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,150
communication of emotion like you see
this with cartoons like stick figures

276
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:00,160
this with cartoons like stick figures
 

277
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,670
this with cartoons like stick figures
you can communicate quite a lot with

278
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:01,680
you can communicate quite a lot with
 

279
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,469
you can communicate quite a lot with
just

280
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:02,479
just
 

281
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:05,510
just
very minimal like two dots for eyes

282
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:05,520
very minimal like two dots for eyes
 

283
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,150
very minimal like two dots for eyes
and a line for for a smile i think like

284
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:08,160
and a line for for a smile i think like
 

285
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,830
and a line for for a smile i think like
you can almost communicate arbitrary

286
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:09,840
you can almost communicate arbitrary
 

287
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,230
you can almost communicate arbitrary
levels of emotion with just two dots and

288
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:12,240
levels of emotion with just two dots and
 

289
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,230
levels of emotion with just two dots and
a line yeah and like that's enough and

290
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:14,240
a line yeah and like that's enough and
 

291
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,230
a line yeah and like that's enough and
if you focus on just that

292
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:16,240
if you focus on just that
 

293
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,390
if you focus on just that
you can communicate the full range and

294
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:18,400
you can communicate the full range and
 

295
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,469
you can communicate the full range and
then you like if you do that then you

296
00:05:20,469 --> 00:05:20,479
then you like if you do that then you
 

297
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:23,029
then you like if you do that then you
can focus on the actual magic

298
00:05:23,029 --> 00:05:23,039
can focus on the actual magic
 

299
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,110
can focus on the actual magic
of of uh

300
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:25,120
of of uh
 

301
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,790
of of uh
human and

302
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:26,800
human and
 

303
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,510
human and
dot line interaction versus all the

304
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:29,520
dot line interaction versus all the
 

305
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,189
dot line interaction versus all the
engineering mess that's right like

306
00:05:31,189 --> 00:05:31,199
engineering mess that's right like
 

307
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,870
engineering mess that's right like
dimensionality voice all these sort of

308
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:32,880
dimensionality voice all these sort of
 

309
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,629
dimensionality voice all these sort of
things actually become a crutch where

310
00:05:34,629 --> 00:05:34,639
things actually become a crutch where
 

311
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:37,189
things actually become a crutch where
you get lost in a search space almost um

312
00:05:37,189 --> 00:05:37,199
you get lost in a search space almost um
 

313
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,350
you get lost in a search space almost um
and so some of the best animators that

314
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:39,360
and so some of the best animators that
 

315
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,710
and so some of the best animators that
we've worked with um they almost like

316
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:42,720
we've worked with um they almost like
 

317
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,790
we've worked with um they almost like
study when they come up uh you know kind

318
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:44,800
study when they come up uh you know kind
 

319
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,270
study when they come up uh you know kind
of in building their expertise by

320
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:47,280
of in building their expertise by
 

321
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,310
of in building their expertise by
forcing these um projects where all you

322
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:50,320
forcing these um projects where all you
 

323
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,469
forcing these um projects where all you
have is like a ball that can like kind

324
00:05:52,469 --> 00:05:52,479
have is like a ball that can like kind
 

325
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,469
have is like a ball that can like kind
of jump and manipulate itself or like

326
00:05:54,469 --> 00:05:54,479
of jump and manipulate itself or like
 

327
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,150
of jump and manipulate itself or like
really really like aggressive

328
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:56,160
really really like aggressive
 

329
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,469
really really like aggressive
constraints for your force to kind of

330
00:05:58,469 --> 00:05:58,479
constraints for your force to kind of
 

331
00:05:58,479 --> 00:05:59,990
constraints for your force to kind of
extract the deepest level of motion and

332
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:00,000
extract the deepest level of motion and
 

333
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,230
extract the deepest level of motion and
so in a lot of ways um you know we

334
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:02,240
so in a lot of ways um you know we
 

335
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,350
so in a lot of ways um you know we
thought when we thought about cosmos

336
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:03,360
thought when we thought about cosmos
 

337
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,950
thought when we thought about cosmos
like you're right like our if we had to

338
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:04,960
like you're right like our if we had to
 

339
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,629
like you're right like our if we had to
like describe it in like one small

340
00:06:06,629 --> 00:06:06,639
like describe it in like one small
 

341
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,950
like describe it in like one small
phrase it was bringing a pixar character

342
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:08,960
phrase it was bringing a pixar character
 

343
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,790
phrase it was bringing a pixar character
to life in the real world it's uh it's

344
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:10,800
to life in the real world it's uh it's
 

345
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,029
to life in the real world it's uh it's
what we were going for and um in a lot

346
00:06:13,029 --> 00:06:13,039
what we were going for and um in a lot
 

347
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,070
what we were going for and um in a lot
of ways what was interesting is that

348
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:14,080
of ways what was interesting is that
 

349
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,830
of ways what was interesting is that
with like wall-e which we studied

350
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:15,840
with like wall-e which we studied
 

351
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,510
with like wall-e which we studied
incredibly deeply and in fact some of

352
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:17,520
incredibly deeply and in fact some of
 

353
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,309
incredibly deeply and in fact some of
our team were you know kind of had

354
00:06:20,309 --> 00:06:20,319
our team were you know kind of had
 

355
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:22,230
our team were you know kind of had
worked previously at um at pixar and on

356
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:22,240
worked previously at um at pixar and on
 

357
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,150
worked previously at um at pixar and on
that project um they intentionally

358
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:24,160
that project um they intentionally
 

359
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,909
that project um they intentionally
constrained wall-e as well even though

360
00:06:25,909 --> 00:06:25,919
constrained wall-e as well even though
 

361
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,590
constrained wall-e as well even though
in an animated film you could do

362
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:27,600
in an animated film you could do
 

363
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,070
in an animated film you could do
whatever you wanted to because it forced

364
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:30,080
whatever you wanted to because it forced
 

365
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,189
whatever you wanted to because it forced
you to like

366
00:06:31,189 --> 00:06:31,199
you to like
 

367
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,029
you to like
really saturate the smaller amount of

368
00:06:33,029 --> 00:06:33,039
really saturate the smaller amount of
 

369
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:36,070
really saturate the smaller amount of
dimensions but uh you sometimes end up

370
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:36,080
dimensions but uh you sometimes end up
 

371
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,870
dimensions but uh you sometimes end up
getting a far more beautiful output um

372
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:38,880
getting a far more beautiful output um
 

373
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,670
getting a far more beautiful output um
because you're pushing at the extremes

374
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:41,680
because you're pushing at the extremes
 

375
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,909
because you're pushing at the extremes
of this emotional space in a way that

376
00:06:43,909 --> 00:06:43,919
of this emotional space in a way that
 

377
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,430
of this emotional space in a way that
you just wouldn't because you get lost

378
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:45,440
you just wouldn't because you get lost
 

379
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,189
you just wouldn't because you get lost
in a surface area if you have like

380
00:06:47,189 --> 00:06:47,199
in a surface area if you have like
 

381
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,629
in a surface area if you have like
something that is just infinitely

382
00:06:48,629 --> 00:06:48,639
something that is just infinitely
 

383
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,629
something that is just infinitely
articulable so if we backtrack a little

384
00:06:50,629 --> 00:06:50,639
articulable so if we backtrack a little
 

385
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,909
articulable so if we backtrack a little
bit and uh you thought of cosmo in 2011

386
00:06:53,909 --> 00:06:53,919
bit and uh you thought of cosmo in 2011
 

387
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:56,950
bit and uh you thought of cosmo in 2011
and 2013 actually uh designed and built

388
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:56,960
and 2013 actually uh designed and built
 

389
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,950
and 2013 actually uh designed and built
it what is anki what is cosmo

390
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:00,960
it what is anki what is cosmo
 

391
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,510
it what is anki what is cosmo
i guess who is cosmo and

392
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:03,520
i guess who is cosmo and
 

393
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,189
i guess who is cosmo and
uh what was the vision behind this

394
00:07:05,189 --> 00:07:05,199
uh what was the vision behind this
 

395
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,670
uh what was the vision behind this
incredible little robot we started

396
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:07,680
incredible little robot we started
 

397
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,270
incredible little robot we started
uh anki back in

398
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:09,280
uh anki back in
 

399
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,550
uh anki back in
like while we were still in graduate

400
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:10,560
like while we were still in graduate
 

401
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,070
like while we were still in graduate
school so myself and my two co-founders

402
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:12,080
school so myself and my two co-founders
 

403
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,029
school so myself and my two co-founders
we were phd students uh in the robotics

404
00:07:15,029 --> 00:07:15,039
we were phd students uh in the robotics
 

405
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:16,870
we were phd students uh in the robotics
institute at carnegie mellon um and so

406
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:16,880
institute at carnegie mellon um and so
 

407
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,990
institute at carnegie mellon um and so
we were uh studying robotics ai machine

408
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:20,000
we were uh studying robotics ai machine
 

409
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,270
we were uh studying robotics ai machine
learning kind of different you know

410
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:21,280
learning kind of different you know
 

411
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,270
learning kind of different you know
different uh uh areas one of my

412
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:23,280
different uh uh areas one of my
 

413
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,189
different uh uh areas one of my
co-founders working on walking robots uh

414
00:07:25,189 --> 00:07:25,199
co-founders working on walking robots uh
 

415
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,670
co-founders working on walking robots uh
you know for a period of time and so we

416
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:27,680
you know for a period of time and so we
 

417
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,469
you know for a period of time and so we
all had a um a bit of a

418
00:07:30,469 --> 00:07:30,479
all had a um a bit of a
 

419
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:33,029
all had a um a bit of a
really deep kind of a deeper passion for

420
00:07:33,029 --> 00:07:33,039
really deep kind of a deeper passion for
 

421
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,670
really deep kind of a deeper passion for
applications of robotics and ai where um

422
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:35,680
applications of robotics and ai where um
 

423
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,790
applications of robotics and ai where um
there's like a spectrum where there's

424
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:36,800
there's like a spectrum where there's
 

425
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,230
there's like a spectrum where there's
people that get like really fascinated

426
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:38,240
people that get like really fascinated
 

427
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,309
people that get like really fascinated
by the theory of ai and machine learning

428
00:07:40,309 --> 00:07:40,319
by the theory of ai and machine learning
 

429
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,550
by the theory of ai and machine learning
robotics where um whether it gets

430
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:42,560
robotics where um whether it gets
 

431
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,230
robotics where um whether it gets
applied in the near future or not is

432
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:44,240
applied in the near future or not is
 

433
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,070
applied in the near future or not is
less of a kind of factor on them but

434
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:46,080
less of a kind of factor on them but
 

435
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,350
less of a kind of factor on them but
they love the pursuit of like the

436
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:47,360
they love the pursuit of like the
 

437
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,790
they love the pursuit of like the
challenge and that's necessary and

438
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:48,800
challenge and that's necessary and
 

439
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,589
challenge and that's necessary and
there's a lot of incredible

440
00:07:49,589 --> 00:07:49,599
there's a lot of incredible
 

441
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:50,869
there's a lot of incredible
breakthroughs that happen there we're

442
00:07:50,869 --> 00:07:50,879
breakthroughs that happen there we're
 

443
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:51,990
breakthroughs that happen there we're
probably closer to the other end of the

444
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:52,000
probably closer to the other end of the
 

445
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,589
probably closer to the other end of the
spectrum where we love the technology

446
00:07:53,589 --> 00:07:53,599
spectrum where we love the technology
 

447
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,070
spectrum where we love the technology
and the um and all the evolution of it

448
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:56,080
and the um and all the evolution of it
 

449
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,909
and the um and all the evolution of it
but we were really driven by

450
00:07:57,909 --> 00:07:57,919
but we were really driven by
 

451
00:07:57,919 --> 00:07:59,430
but we were really driven by
applications like how can you really

452
00:07:59,430 --> 00:07:59,440
applications like how can you really
 

453
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,469
applications like how can you really
reinvent experiences and functionality

454
00:08:02,469 --> 00:08:02,479
reinvent experiences and functionality
 

455
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:04,710
reinvent experiences and functionality
and build value that wouldn't have been

456
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:04,720
and build value that wouldn't have been
 

457
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,110
and build value that wouldn't have been
possible without these approaches and

458
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:07,120
possible without these approaches and
 

459
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,950
possible without these approaches and
and that's what drove us and we had a

460
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:08,960
and that's what drove us and we had a
 

461
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,390
and that's what drove us and we had a
kind of some experiences through

462
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:10,400
kind of some experiences through
 

463
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,830
kind of some experiences through
previous jobs and internships where we

464
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:11,840
previous jobs and internships where we
 

465
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,589
previous jobs and internships where we
like got to see the applied side of

466
00:08:13,589 --> 00:08:13,599
like got to see the applied side of
 

467
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:15,670
like got to see the applied side of
robotics and at that time there was

468
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:15,680
robotics and at that time there was
 

469
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,670
robotics and at that time there was
actually relatively few applications of

470
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:17,680
actually relatively few applications of
 

471
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,950
actually relatively few applications of
robotics um that were outside of um

472
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:20,960
robotics um that were outside of um
 

473
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,629
robotics um that were outside of um
you know peer research or industrial

474
00:08:22,629 --> 00:08:22,639
you know peer research or industrial
 

475
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:25,029
you know peer research or industrial
applications um military applications

476
00:08:25,029 --> 00:08:25,039
applications um military applications
 

477
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:27,350
applications um military applications
and so forth there were very few outside

478
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:27,360
and so forth there were very few outside
 

479
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,110
and so forth there were very few outside
of it so maybe you know my robot was

480
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:29,120
of it so maybe you know my robot was
 

481
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,390
of it so maybe you know my robot was
like one exception and maybe there were

482
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:30,400
like one exception and maybe there were
 

483
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,070
like one exception and maybe there were
a few others but for the most part there

484
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:32,080
a few others but for the most part there
 

485
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,509
a few others but for the most part there
weren't that many and so we got excited

486
00:08:33,509 --> 00:08:33,519
weren't that many and so we got excited
 

487
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,750
weren't that many and so we got excited
about consumer applications of robotics

488
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:35,760
about consumer applications of robotics
 

489
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,670
about consumer applications of robotics
where you could leverage

490
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:37,680
where you could leverage
 

491
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,829
where you could leverage
way higher levels of intelligence

492
00:08:39,829 --> 00:08:39,839
way higher levels of intelligence
 

493
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:42,149
way higher levels of intelligence
through software to create value and

494
00:08:42,149 --> 00:08:42,159
through software to create value and
 

495
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,230
through software to create value and
experiences that were just not possible

496
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:44,240
experiences that were just not possible
 

497
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,509
experiences that were just not possible
in

498
00:08:45,509 --> 00:08:45,519
in
 

499
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,590
in
in those fields today

500
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:47,600
in those fields today
 

501
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,110
in those fields today
and we saw

502
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:49,120
and we saw
 

503
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,870
and we saw
kind of a pretty wide range of

504
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:50,880
kind of a pretty wide range of
 

505
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,470
kind of a pretty wide range of
applications

506
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:52,480
applications
 

507
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,990
applications
that varied in the complexity of what it

508
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:54,000
that varied in the complexity of what it
 

509
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,829
that varied in the complexity of what it
would take to actually solve those and

510
00:08:55,829 --> 00:08:55,839
would take to actually solve those and
 

511
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:56,790
would take to actually solve those and
what we wanted to do was to

512
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:56,800
what we wanted to do was to
 

513
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,550
what we wanted to do was to
commercialize this into a company but

514
00:08:58,550 --> 00:08:58,560
commercialize this into a company but
 

515
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,750
commercialize this into a company but
actually

516
00:08:59,750 --> 00:08:59,760
actually
 

517
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,509
actually
do a bottoms-up approach where we could

518
00:09:01,509 --> 00:09:01,519
do a bottoms-up approach where we could
 

519
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:03,430
do a bottoms-up approach where we could
have a huge impact in a space that was

520
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:03,440
have a huge impact in a space that was
 

521
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,750
have a huge impact in a space that was
ripe to have an impact at that time and

522
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:05,760
ripe to have an impact at that time and
 

523
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,190
ripe to have an impact at that time and
then build up off of that and move into

524
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:07,200
then build up off of that and move into
 

525
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,630
then build up off of that and move into
other areas and entertainment became the

526
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:08,640
other areas and entertainment became the
 

527
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,870
other areas and entertainment became the
place to start because um

528
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:10,880
place to start because um
 

529
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,470
place to start because um
you had relatively little innovation in

530
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:12,480
you had relatively little innovation in
 

531
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,829
you had relatively little innovation in
a toy space

532
00:09:13,829 --> 00:09:13,839
a toy space
 

533
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:15,110
a toy space
an entertainment space you had these

534
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:15,120
an entertainment space you had these
 

535
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,389
an entertainment space you had these
really rich

536
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:16,399
really rich
 

537
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,550
really rich
experiences in video games and uh and

538
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:18,560
experiences in video games and uh and
 

539
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,389
experiences in video games and uh and
movies but there was like this chasm in

540
00:09:20,389 --> 00:09:20,399
movies but there was like this chasm in
 

541
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,790
movies but there was like this chasm in
between and so we thought that

542
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:22,800
between and so we thought that
 

543
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,030
between and so we thought that
we could really reinvent that experience

544
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:25,040
we could really reinvent that experience
 

545
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,710
we could really reinvent that experience
and there was a

546
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:26,720
and there was a
 

547
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,990
and there was a
really fascinating transition

548
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:28,000
really fascinating transition
 

549
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,030
really fascinating transition
technically that was happening at the

550
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:29,040
technically that was happening at the
 

551
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,430
technically that was happening at the
time where the cost of components was

552
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:31,440
time where the cost of components was
 

553
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,350
time where the cost of components was
plummeting because of the mobile phone

554
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:33,360
plummeting because of the mobile phone
 

555
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,550
plummeting because of the mobile phone
industry and then the smartphone

556
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:34,560
industry and then the smartphone
 

557
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,150
industry and then the smartphone
industry and so the cost of a

558
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:36,160
industry and so the cost of a
 

559
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,990
industry and so the cost of a
microcontroller of a camera of a motor

560
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:38,000
microcontroller of a camera of a motor
 

561
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,750
microcontroller of a camera of a motor
of memory of

562
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:39,760
of memory of
 

563
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,389
of memory of
microphones cameras was dropping by

564
00:09:42,389 --> 00:09:42,399
microphones cameras was dropping by
 

565
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,550
microphones cameras was dropping by
orders of magnitude and then on top of

566
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:44,560
orders of magnitude and then on top of
 

567
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,190
orders of magnitude and then on top of
that with the iphone coming out in 2000

568
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:47,200
that with the iphone coming out in 2000
 

569
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,949
that with the iphone coming out in 2000
uh i think it was 2007 i believe

570
00:09:50,949 --> 00:09:50,959
uh i think it was 2007 i believe
 

571
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:52,310
uh i think it was 2007 i believe
um

572
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:52,320
um
 

573
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,829
um
it started to become apparent within a

574
00:09:53,829 --> 00:09:53,839
it started to become apparent within a
 

575
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:55,990
it started to become apparent within a
couple of years that this could become a

576
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:56,000
couple of years that this could become a
 

577
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,509
couple of years that this could become a
really incredible

578
00:09:57,509 --> 00:09:57,519
really incredible
 

579
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:00,230
really incredible
interface device and the brain with much

580
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:00,240
interface device and the brain with much
 

581
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,150
interface device and the brain with much
more computation behind a physical world

582
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:02,160
more computation behind a physical world
 

583
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,829
more computation behind a physical world
experience that wouldn't have been

584
00:10:03,829 --> 00:10:03,839
experience that wouldn't have been
 

585
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:05,350
experience that wouldn't have been
possible previously

586
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:05,360
possible previously
 

587
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,310
possible previously
and so

588
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:06,320
and so
 

589
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,949
and so
um we really got excited about that and

590
00:10:08,949 --> 00:10:08,959
um we really got excited about that and
 

591
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:11,190
um we really got excited about that and
how we push all the complexity from the

592
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:11,200
how we push all the complexity from the
 

593
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,190
how we push all the complexity from the
physical world into software by using

594
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:13,200
physical world into software by using
 

595
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,870
physical world into software by using
really inexpensive components but

596
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:14,880
really inexpensive components but
 

597
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,310
really inexpensive components but
putting huge amounts of complexity into

598
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:16,320
putting huge amounts of complexity into
 

599
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,550
putting huge amounts of complexity into
the ai side and so cosmo became our

600
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:18,560
the ai side and so cosmo became our
 

601
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,990
the ai side and so cosmo became our
second product and then the one that

602
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:20,000
second product and then the one that
 

603
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,829
second product and then the one that
we're probably most proud of the idea

604
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:21,839
we're probably most proud of the idea
 

605
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,150
we're probably most proud of the idea
there was to create a physical character

606
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:24,160
there was to create a physical character
 

607
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,389
there was to create a physical character
that had enough understanding and

608
00:10:26,389 --> 00:10:26,399
that had enough understanding and
 

609
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,230
that had enough understanding and
awareness of the physical world around

610
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:28,240
awareness of the physical world around
 

611
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,310
awareness of the physical world around
it in the context that mattered to feel

612
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:30,320
it in the context that mattered to feel
 

613
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,430
it in the context that mattered to feel
like

614
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:31,440
like
 

615
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,750
like
like he was alive um and

616
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:33,760
like he was alive um and
 

617
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,750
like he was alive um and
to be able to have these like emotional

618
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:35,760
to be able to have these like emotional
 

619
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,150
to be able to have these like emotional
kind connections and experiences with

620
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:38,160
kind connections and experiences with
 

621
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,509
kind connections and experiences with
people that you would typically only

622
00:10:39,509 --> 00:10:39,519
people that you would typically only
 

623
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,910
people that you would typically only
find uh inside of a movie and the

624
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:41,920
find uh inside of a movie and the
 

625
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,150
find uh inside of a movie and the
motivation very much was was pixar like

626
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:44,160
motivation very much was was pixar like
 

627
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,550
motivation very much was was pixar like
we had an incredible uh respect and

628
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:46,560
we had an incredible uh respect and
 

629
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,389
we had an incredible uh respect and
appreciation for what they were able to

630
00:10:48,389 --> 00:10:48,399
appreciation for what they were able to
 

631
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:49,990
appreciation for what they were able to
um build in this like really beautiful

632
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:50,000
um build in this like really beautiful
 

633
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,230
um build in this like really beautiful
fashion and film um but it was always

634
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:52,240
fashion and film um but it was always
 

635
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,389
fashion and film um but it was always
like a you know when it was virtual and

636
00:10:54,389 --> 00:10:54,399
like a you know when it was virtual and
 

637
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,470
like a you know when it was virtual and
two it was like a story on rails that

638
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:56,480
two it was like a story on rails that
 

639
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,470
two it was like a story on rails that
had no interactivity to it it was very

640
00:10:58,470 --> 00:10:58,480
had no interactivity to it it was very
 

641
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,269
had no interactivity to it it was very
fixed and it obviously had a magic to it

642
00:11:01,269 --> 00:11:01,279
fixed and it obviously had a magic to it
 

643
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:03,190
fixed and it obviously had a magic to it
but where you really start to hit a

644
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:03,200
but where you really start to hit a
 

645
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,550
but where you really start to hit a
different level of experiences when

646
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:04,560
different level of experiences when
 

647
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,430
different level of experiences when
you're actually able to physically

648
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:05,440
you're actually able to physically
 

649
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,870
you're actually able to physically
interact with that robot and then that

650
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:06,880
interact with that robot and then that
 

651
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,710
interact with that robot and then that
was your idea with anki like the first

652
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:08,720
was your idea with anki like the first
 

653
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,150
was your idea with anki like the first
product was the cars

654
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:10,160
product was the cars
 

655
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,710
product was the cars
so basically you take

656
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:12,720
so basically you take
 

657
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,790
so basically you take
you take a toy

658
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:14,800
you take a toy
 

659
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,110
you take a toy
you add intelligence into it in the same

660
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:17,120
you add intelligence into it in the same
 

661
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,430
you add intelligence into it in the same
way you would add intelligence into ai

662
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:19,440
way you would add intelligence into ai
 

663
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,670
way you would add intelligence into ai
systems within a video game but you're

664
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:21,680
systems within a video game but you're
 

665
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,269
systems within a video game but you're
not bringing into the physical space so

666
00:11:23,269 --> 00:11:23,279
not bringing into the physical space so
 

667
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:26,230
not bringing into the physical space so
the idea is is really brilliant which is

668
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:26,240
the idea is is really brilliant which is
 

669
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,030
the idea is is really brilliant which is
you're basically bringing video games to

670
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:29,040
you're basically bringing video games to
 

671
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,949
you're basically bringing video games to
life exactly that's exactly right we

672
00:11:30,949 --> 00:11:30,959
life exactly that's exactly right we
 

673
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:32,550
life exactly that's exactly right we
literally use that exact same phrase

674
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:32,560
literally use that exact same phrase
 

675
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,870
literally use that exact same phrase
because in the case of drive this was a

676
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:34,880
because in the case of drive this was a
 

677
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,150
because in the case of drive this was a
parallel of the racing genre and the

678
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:38,160
parallel of the racing genre and the
 

679
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,030
parallel of the racing genre and the
goal was to effectively have a physical

680
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:41,040
goal was to effectively have a physical
 

681
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,509
goal was to effectively have a physical
racing experience but have a virtual

682
00:11:43,509 --> 00:11:43,519
racing experience but have a virtual
 

683
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,590
racing experience but have a virtual
state at all times that matches what's

684
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:45,600
state at all times that matches what's
 

685
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,350
state at all times that matches what's
happening in the physical world and then

686
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:47,360
happening in the physical world and then
 

687
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,710
happening in the physical world and then
you can have a video game off of that

688
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:48,720
you can have a video game off of that
 

689
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,350
you can have a video game off of that
and you can have uh different characters

690
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:51,360
and you can have uh different characters
 

691
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,269
and you can have uh different characters
different traits for your

692
00:11:53,269 --> 00:11:53,279
different traits for your
 

693
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,629
different traits for your
the cars

694
00:11:54,629 --> 00:11:54,639
the cars
 

695
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:56,069
the cars
weapons and interactions and special

696
00:11:56,069 --> 00:11:56,079
weapons and interactions and special
 

697
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:57,269
weapons and interactions and special
abilities and all these sort of things

698
00:11:57,269 --> 00:11:57,279
abilities and all these sort of things
 

699
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,350
abilities and all these sort of things
that you think of virtually but then you

700
00:11:59,350 --> 00:11:59,360
that you think of virtually but then you
 

701
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,190
that you think of virtually but then you
can have it physically and um one of the

702
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:01,200
can have it physically and um one of the
 

703
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,470
can have it physically and um one of the
things that we were like really

704
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:02,480
things that we were like really
 

705
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,030
things that we were like really
surprised by that really stood out and

706
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:05,040
surprised by that really stood out and
 

707
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,550
surprised by that really stood out and
immediately led us to really like kind

708
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:06,560
immediately led us to really like kind
 

709
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,350
immediately led us to really like kind
of accelerate the path towards um cosmo

710
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:09,360
of accelerate the path towards um cosmo
 

711
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,350
of accelerate the path towards um cosmo
is that things that feel like they're

712
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:11,360
is that things that feel like they're
 

713
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,550
is that things that feel like they're
really constrained and simple in the

714
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:12,560
really constrained and simple in the
 

715
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,069
really constrained and simple in the
physical world they have an amplified

716
00:12:14,069 --> 00:12:14,079
physical world they have an amplified
 

717
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:15,910
physical world they have an amplified
impact on people where the exact same

718
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:15,920
impact on people where the exact same
 

719
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,030
impact on people where the exact same
experience virtually would not have

720
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:17,040
experience virtually would not have
 

721
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,629
experience virtually would not have
anywhere near the impact but seeing it

722
00:12:18,629 --> 00:12:18,639
anywhere near the impact but seeing it
 

723
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:21,269
anywhere near the impact but seeing it
physically really stood out and so

724
00:12:21,269 --> 00:12:21,279
physically really stood out and so
 

725
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:23,670
physically really stood out and so
effectively we've with with drive we

726
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:23,680
effectively we've with with drive we
 

727
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,190
effectively we've with with drive we
were creating a video game engine for

728
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:25,200
were creating a video game engine for
 

729
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,430
were creating a video game engine for
the physical world um and then with

730
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:27,440
the physical world um and then with
 

731
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,350
the physical world um and then with
cosmo we expanded that video game engine

732
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:29,360
cosmo we expanded that video game engine
 

733
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,269
cosmo we expanded that video game engine
to create a character and and

734
00:12:33,269 --> 00:12:33,279
to create a character and and
 

735
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:34,949
to create a character and and
kind of an animation and interaction

736
00:12:34,949 --> 00:12:34,959
kind of an animation and interaction
 

737
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:35,990
kind of an animation and interaction
engine

738
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:36,000
engine
 

739
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,629
engine
on top of it that allowed us to start to

740
00:12:38,629 --> 00:12:38,639
on top of it that allowed us to start to
 

741
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,790
on top of it that allowed us to start to
create these much more rich experiences

742
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:40,800
create these much more rich experiences
 

743
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,110
create these much more rich experiences
and a lot of those elements were uh

744
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:43,120
and a lot of those elements were uh
 

745
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,389
and a lot of those elements were uh
almost like a proving ground for what

746
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:44,399
almost like a proving ground for what
 

747
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,949
almost like a proving ground for what
would human robot interaction feel like

748
00:12:46,949 --> 00:12:46,959
would human robot interaction feel like
 

749
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:49,190
would human robot interaction feel like
in a domain it's much more forgiving

750
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:49,200
in a domain it's much more forgiving
 

751
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,110
in a domain it's much more forgiving
where you can make mistakes in a game

752
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:51,120
where you can make mistakes in a game
 

753
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,910
where you can make mistakes in a game
it's okay if like uh if you know car

754
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:53,920
it's okay if like uh if you know car
 

755
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,310
it's okay if like uh if you know car
goes off the track or if if cosmo makes

756
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:56,320
goes off the track or if if cosmo makes
 

757
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,150
goes off the track or if if cosmo makes
a mistake um and what's funny is

758
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:58,160
a mistake um and what's funny is
 

759
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,150
a mistake um and what's funny is
actually we're so worried about that

760
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:00,160
actually we're so worried about that
 

761
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,310
actually we're so worried about that
in reality we realized very quickly that

762
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:02,320
in reality we realized very quickly that
 

763
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,829
in reality we realized very quickly that
those mistakes can be endearing and if

764
00:13:03,829 --> 00:13:03,839
those mistakes can be endearing and if
 

765
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:05,030
those mistakes can be endearing and if
you make a mistake as long as you

766
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:05,040
you make a mistake as long as you
 

767
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,550
you make a mistake as long as you
realize you make a mistake and have the

768
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:06,560
realize you make a mistake and have the
 

769
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,910
realize you make a mistake and have the
right emotional reaction to it it builds

770
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:07,920
right emotional reaction to it it builds
 

771
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,670
right emotional reaction to it it builds
even more empathy with the character

772
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:09,680
even more empathy with the character
 

773
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,310
even more empathy with the character
that's brilliant exactly so when uh the

774
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:12,320
that's brilliant exactly so when uh the
 

775
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,150
that's brilliant exactly so when uh the
the thing you're optimizing for is fun

776
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:14,160
the thing you're optimizing for is fun
 

777
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,389
the thing you're optimizing for is fun
you have so much more freedom to fail

778
00:13:16,389 --> 00:13:16,399
you have so much more freedom to fail
 

779
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:17,670
you have so much more freedom to fail
to explore

780
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:17,680
to explore
 

781
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,150
to explore
and and also in the toy space like all

782
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:20,160
and and also in the toy space like all
 

783
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,910
and and also in the toy space like all
this is really brilliant like i got to

784
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:21,920
this is really brilliant like i got to
 

785
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,150
this is really brilliant like i got to
ask you backtrack

786
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:24,160
ask you backtrack
 

787
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,389
ask you backtrack
it seems for a roboticist

788
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:26,399
it seems for a roboticist
 

789
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,629
it seems for a roboticist
to take us jump

790
00:13:28,629 --> 00:13:28,639
to take us jump
 

791
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,350
to take us jump
in into the direction of fun

792
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:31,360
in into the direction of fun
 

793
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,590
in into the direction of fun
is a brilliant move because when you

794
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:33,600
is a brilliant move because when you
 

795
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,269
is a brilliant move because when you
have the freedom to explore to design

796
00:13:35,269 --> 00:13:35,279
have the freedom to explore to design
 

797
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:36,790
have the freedom to explore to design
all those kinds of things

798
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:36,800
all those kinds of things
 

799
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,829
all those kinds of things
and you can also build cheap robots

800
00:13:39,829 --> 00:13:39,839
and you can also build cheap robots
 

801
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:41,590
and you can also build cheap robots
like you don't have to like if you're

802
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:41,600
like you don't have to like if you're
 

803
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,509
like you don't have to like if you're
not chasing perfection

804
00:13:43,509 --> 00:13:43,519
not chasing perfection
 

805
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:44,710
not chasing perfection
and like

806
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:44,720
and like
 

807
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,470
and like
toys it's understood that you can go

808
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:46,480
toys it's understood that you can go
 

809
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,750
toys it's understood that you can go
cheaper which means in robot it's still

810
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:49,760
cheaper which means in robot it's still
 

811
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,990
cheaper which means in robot it's still
expensive but it's actually affordable

812
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:52,000
expensive but it's actually affordable
 

813
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,750
expensive but it's actually affordable
by a large number of people so it's a

814
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:53,760
by a large number of people so it's a
 

815
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,910
by a large number of people so it's a
really brilliant space to explore yeah

816
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:55,920
really brilliant space to explore yeah
 

817
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,509
really brilliant space to explore yeah
that's right it's uh and in fact we

818
00:13:57,509 --> 00:13:57,519
that's right it's uh and in fact we
 

819
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:58,710
that's right it's uh and in fact we
realized pretty quickly that like

820
00:13:58,710 --> 00:13:58,720
realized pretty quickly that like
 

821
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,470
realized pretty quickly that like
perfection is actually not fun yeah

822
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:00,480
perfection is actually not fun yeah
 

823
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,069
perfection is actually not fun yeah
because like in a traditional robotic

824
00:14:02,069 --> 00:14:02,079
because like in a traditional robotic
 

825
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:04,710
because like in a traditional robotic
roboticist sense the first kind of path

826
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:04,720
roboticist sense the first kind of path
 

827
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,550
roboticist sense the first kind of path
planner and uh this is the you know the

828
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:06,560
planner and uh this is the you know the
 

829
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,829
planner and uh this is the you know the
part that i worked worked on out of the

830
00:14:07,829 --> 00:14:07,839
part that i worked worked on out of the
 

831
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:09,750
part that i worked worked on out of the
gate was like a lot of the kind of ai

832
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:09,760
gate was like a lot of the kind of ai
 

833
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,590
gate was like a lot of the kind of ai
systems where you have these you know

834
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:11,600
systems where you have these you know
 

835
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,790
systems where you have these you know
vehicles and

836
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:12,800
vehicles and
 

837
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,230
vehicles and
you know cars racing kind of making

838
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:14,240
you know cars racing kind of making
 

839
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,910
you know cars racing kind of making
optimal maneuvers to try to kind of get

840
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:15,920
optimal maneuvers to try to kind of get
 

841
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,670
optimal maneuvers to try to kind of get
ahead and you realize very quickly that

842
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:17,680
ahead and you realize very quickly that
 

843
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,590
ahead and you realize very quickly that
like that's actually not fun because you

844
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:19,600
like that's actually not fun because you
 

845
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,949
like that's actually not fun because you
want the like

846
00:14:20,949 --> 00:14:20,959
want the like
 

847
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:23,030
want the like
chaos from mistakes and the

848
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:23,040
chaos from mistakes and the
 

849
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,150
chaos from mistakes and the
and so you start to kind of

850
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:24,160
and so you start to kind of
 

851
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,670
and so you start to kind of
intentionally almost add noise to the

852
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:25,680
intentionally almost add noise to the
 

853
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,670
intentionally almost add noise to the
system uh in order to kind of create

854
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:27,680
system uh in order to kind of create
 

855
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,189
system uh in order to kind of create
more of a realism in the exact same way

856
00:14:29,189 --> 00:14:29,199
more of a realism in the exact same way
 

857
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:31,509
more of a realism in the exact same way
the human player might start really

858
00:14:31,509 --> 00:14:31,519
the human player might start really
 

859
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:33,430
the human player might start really
ineffective and inefficient and then

860
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:33,440
ineffective and inefficient and then
 

861
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,949
ineffective and inefficient and then
start to kind of increase their quality

862
00:14:34,949 --> 00:14:34,959
start to kind of increase their quality
 

863
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:36,470
start to kind of increase their quality
bar as they

864
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:36,480
bar as they
 

865
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,990
bar as they
as they progress and

866
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:38,000
as they progress and
 

867
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,590
as they progress and
there is a really really aggressive

868
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:39,600
there is a really really aggressive
 

869
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,430
there is a really really aggressive
constraint that's forced on you by

870
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:41,440
constraint that's forced on you by
 

871
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,269
constraint that's forced on you by
being a consumer product where the price

872
00:14:43,269 --> 00:14:43,279
being a consumer product where the price
 

873
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:45,350
being a consumer product where the price
point matters a ton particularly in like

874
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:45,360
point matters a ton particularly in like
 

875
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,750
point matters a ton particularly in like
kind of an entertainment where um

876
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:47,760
kind of an entertainment where um
 

877
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,430
kind of an entertainment where um
you know you you can't make a thousand

878
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:49,440
you know you you can't make a thousand
 

879
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,710
you know you you can't make a thousand
dollar product unless you're going to

880
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:50,720
dollar product unless you're going to
 

881
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,470
dollar product unless you're going to
meet the qua like the expectations of a

882
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:52,480
meet the qua like the expectations of a
 

883
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,870
meet the qua like the expectations of a
thousand dollar product and so um in

884
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:54,880
thousand dollar product and so um in
 

885
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,710
thousand dollar product and so um in
order to make this work like your cost

886
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:56,720
order to make this work like your cost
 

887
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,949
order to make this work like your cost
of goods had to be like like you know

888
00:14:58,949 --> 00:14:58,959
of goods had to be like like you know
 

889
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:01,030
of goods had to be like like you know
well under a hundred dollars uh uh in

890
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:01,040
well under a hundred dollars uh uh in
 

891
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,550
well under a hundred dollars uh uh in
the case of cosmo we got it under fifty

892
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:02,560
the case of cosmo we got it under fifty
 

893
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,069
the case of cosmo we got it under fifty
dollars end-to-end fully packaged and

894
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:04,079
dollars end-to-end fully packaged and
 

895
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:05,430
dollars end-to-end fully packaged and
delivered and it was under two hundred

896
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:05,440
delivered and it was under two hundred
 

897
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,629
delivered and it was under two hundred
dollars

898
00:15:06,629 --> 00:15:06,639
dollars
 

899
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,550
dollars
it cost the retail yeah

900
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:08,560
it cost the retail yeah
 

901
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,269
it cost the retail yeah
so uh okay if we sit down like at this

902
00:15:11,269 --> 00:15:11,279
so uh okay if we sit down like at this
 

903
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:13,030
so uh okay if we sit down like at this
early stages

904
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:13,040
early stages
 

905
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,870
early stages
if you go back to that

906
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:14,880
if you go back to that
 

907
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,069
if you go back to that
and you're sitting down and thinking

908
00:15:16,069 --> 00:15:16,079
and you're sitting down and thinking
 

909
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:17,910
and you're sitting down and thinking
about what kosovo looks like from a

910
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:17,920
about what kosovo looks like from a
 

911
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,509
about what kosovo looks like from a
design perspective and from a cost

912
00:15:19,509 --> 00:15:19,519
design perspective and from a cost
 

913
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,030
design perspective and from a cost
perspective i imagine that was part of

914
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:21,040
perspective i imagine that was part of
 

915
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,910
perspective i imagine that was part of
the conversation

916
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:23,920

 

917
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,310

first of all what came first did you

918
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:26,320
first of all what came first did you
 

919
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,629
first of all what came first did you
have a cost in mind is there a target

920
00:15:28,629 --> 00:15:28,639
have a cost in mind is there a target
 

921
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:30,150
have a cost in mind is there a target
you're trying to chase

922
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:30,160
you're trying to chase
 

923
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,550
you're trying to chase
did you have a vision in mind like size

924
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:32,560
did you have a vision in mind like size
 

925
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,389
did you have a vision in mind like size
did you have because there's a lot of

926
00:15:34,389 --> 00:15:34,399
did you have because there's a lot of
 

927
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,069
did you have because there's a lot of
unique qualities to cosmos so for people

928
00:15:36,069 --> 00:15:36,079
unique qualities to cosmos so for people
 

929
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:37,030
unique qualities to cosmos so for people
who don't know they should definitely

930
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:37,040
who don't know they should definitely
 

931
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,230
who don't know they should definitely
check it out

932
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:38,240
check it out
 

933
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,069
check it out
there's a display there's eyes on the

934
00:15:40,069 --> 00:15:40,079
there's a display there's eyes on the
 

935
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:42,470
there's a display there's eyes on the
little display and those eyes can it's

936
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:42,480
little display and those eyes can it's
 

937
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,629
little display and those eyes can it's
pretty uh low resolution eyes right but

938
00:15:44,629 --> 00:15:44,639
pretty uh low resolution eyes right but
 

939
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,790
pretty uh low resolution eyes right but
they they still able to convey a lot of

940
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:46,800
they they still able to convey a lot of
 

941
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:50,310
they they still able to convey a lot of
emotion and there's this arm

942
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:50,320
emotion and there's this arm
 

943
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,790
emotion and there's this arm
like that out lift sort of lifts stuff

944
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:52,800
like that out lift sort of lifts stuff
 

945
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,749
like that out lift sort of lifts stuff
but there's something about arm movement

946
00:15:55,749 --> 00:15:55,759
but there's something about arm movement
 

947
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:59,509
but there's something about arm movement
that adds even more kind of depth

948
00:15:59,509 --> 00:15:59,519
that adds even more kind of depth
 

949
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,910
that adds even more kind of depth
it's like uh the face communicates

950
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:01,920
it's like uh the face communicates
 

951
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,790
it's like uh the face communicates
emotion and sadness and disappointment

952
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:04,800
emotion and sadness and disappointment
 

953
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,350
emotion and sadness and disappointment
and happiness and then the arms

954
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:07,360
and happiness and then the arms
 

955
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,310
and happiness and then the arms
kind of communicates i'm trying here

956
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:10,320
kind of communicates i'm trying here
 

957
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,910
kind of communicates i'm trying here
yeah i'm doing my best

958
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:13,920

 

959
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,670

exactly so it's um

960
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:15,680
exactly so it's um
 

961
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,389
exactly so it's um
uh it's interesting because like um

962
00:16:18,389 --> 00:16:18,399
uh it's interesting because like um
 

963
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:19,829
uh it's interesting because like um
all of cosmo's only four degrees of

964
00:16:19,829 --> 00:16:19,839
all of cosmo's only four degrees of
 

965
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:21,430
all of cosmo's only four degrees of
freedom and two of them are the two

966
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:21,440
freedom and two of them are the two
 

967
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,350
freedom and two of them are the two
treads which is for basic movement and

968
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:23,360
treads which is for basic movement and
 

969
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,829
treads which is for basic movement and
so you literally have only

970
00:16:25,829 --> 00:16:25,839
so you literally have only
 

971
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:27,430
so you literally have only
a head that goes up and down a lift that

972
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:27,440
a head that goes up and down a lift that
 

973
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,710
a head that goes up and down a lift that
goes up and down and then your two

974
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:28,720
goes up and down and then your two
 

975
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,069
goes up and down and then your two
wheels uh and you have sound uh and a

976
00:16:32,069 --> 00:16:32,079
wheels uh and you have sound uh and a
 

977
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:34,310
wheels uh and you have sound uh and a
screen yeah and a low resolution screen

978
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:34,320
screen yeah and a low resolution screen
 

979
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,509
screen yeah and a low resolution screen
and with that it's actually pretty

980
00:16:35,509 --> 00:16:35,519
and with that it's actually pretty
 

981
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:37,189
and with that it's actually pretty
incredible what you can uh what you can

982
00:16:37,189 --> 00:16:37,199
incredible what you can uh what you can
 

983
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:40,470
incredible what you can uh what you can
come up with where like you said it's a

984
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:40,480
come up with where like you said it's a
 

985
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,670
come up with where like you said it's a
uh it's a really interesting give and

986
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:41,680
uh it's a really interesting give and
 

987
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,269
uh it's a really interesting give and
take because there's a lot of ideas far

988
00:16:43,269 --> 00:16:43,279
take because there's a lot of ideas far
 

989
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:44,710
take because there's a lot of ideas far
beyond that obviously as you can imagine

990
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:44,720
beyond that obviously as you can imagine
 

991
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,230
beyond that obviously as you can imagine
where like you said how big is it how

992
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:46,240
where like you said how big is it how
 

993
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,670
where like you said how big is it how
much degrees of freedom what does it

994
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:47,680
much degrees of freedom what does it
 

995
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,230
much degrees of freedom what does it
look like um uh what does he sound like

996
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:50,240
look like um uh what does he sound like
 

997
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,069
look like um uh what does he sound like
how does he communicate it's it's a

00:16:52,069 --> 00:16:52,079
how does he communicate it's it's a
 

999
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:53,749
how does he communicate it's it's a
formula that actually scales way beyond

1000
00:16:53,749 --> 00:16:53,759
formula that actually scales way beyond
 

1001
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,189
formula that actually scales way beyond
entertainment this is the formula for

you have the ai side of

1018
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:09,600
you have the ai side of
 

1019
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,270
you have the ai side of
how do you understand the world around

1020
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:11,280
how do you understand the world around
 

1021
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,029
how do you understand the world around
you interact intelligently with it

1022
00:17:13,029 --> 00:17:13,039
you interact intelligently with it
 

1023
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:14,870
you interact intelligently with it
execute what you want to execute so

1024
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:14,880
execute what you want to execute so
 

1025
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,549
execute what you want to execute so
perceive the environment

1026
00:17:16,549 --> 00:17:16,559
perceive the environment

00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,470
perceive the environment
make intelligent decisions and

1028
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:18,480
make intelligent decisions and
 

1029
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,150
make intelligent decisions and
and move forward and then you have the

1030
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:20,160
and move forward and then you have the
 

1031
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,510
and move forward and then you have the
character side of it

1032
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:21,520
character side of it
 

1033
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,549
character side of it
um

1034
00:17:22,549 --> 00:17:22,559
um
 

1035
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:24,549
um
most uh companies have done anything in

1036
00:17:24,549 --> 00:17:24,559
most uh companies have done anything in
 

1037
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:27,350
most uh companies have done anything in
human robot interaction really uh missed

1038
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:27,360
human robot interaction really uh missed
 

1039
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,470
human robot interaction really uh missed
the mark or under invest in the

1040
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:28,480
the mark or under invest in the
 

1041
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,870
the mark or under invest in the
character side of it um they over invest

1042
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:30,880
character side of it um they over invest
 

1043
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,270
character side of it um they over invest
in the mechanical side of it uh

1044
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:33,280
in the mechanical side of it uh
 

1045
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,190
in the mechanical side of it uh
you know and then varied results on the

1046
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:35,200
you know and then varied results on the
 

1047
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,029
you know and then varied results on the
ai side of it and so the thinking is

1048
00:17:37,029 --> 00:17:37,039
ai side of it and so the thinking is
 

1049
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:38,630
ai side of it and so the thinking is
that you put more mechanical flexibility

1050
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:38,640
that you put more mechanical flexibility
 

1051
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,110
that you put more mechanical flexibility
into it you're gonna do better um you

1052
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:41,120
into it you're gonna do better um you
 

1053
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,470
into it you're gonna do better um you
don't necessarily you actually create a

1054
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:42,480
don't necessarily you actually create a
 

1055
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,029
don't necessarily you actually create a
much higher bar uh for a high roi

1056
00:17:45,029 --> 00:17:45,039
much higher bar uh for a high roi
 

1057
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:46,390
much higher bar uh for a high roi
because now your price point goes up

1058
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:46,400
because now your price point goes up
 

1059
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,789
because now your price point goes up
your expectations go up and if the ai

1060
00:17:48,789 --> 00:17:48,799
your expectations go up and if the ai
 

1061
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,789
your expectations go up and if the ai
can't meet it or the overall experience

1062
00:17:50,789 --> 00:17:50,799
can't meet it or the overall experience
 

1063
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:52,789
can't meet it or the overall experience
isn't there you missed the mark

1064
00:17:52,789 --> 00:17:52,799
isn't there you missed the mark
 

1065
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:55,190
isn't there you missed the mark
um so who like how did you through those

1066
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:55,200
um so who like how did you through those
 

1067
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,590
um so who like how did you through those
conversations get the cost down so much

1068
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:57,600
conversations get the cost down so much
 

1069
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,789
conversations get the cost down so much
and make it made it so simple like that

1070
00:18:00,789 --> 00:18:00,799
and make it made it so simple like that
 

1071
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:02,549
and make it made it so simple like that
there's a big theme here because you

1072
00:18:02,549 --> 00:18:02,559
there's a big theme here because you
 

1073
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:04,950
there's a big theme here because you
come from the mecca of robotics which is

1074
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:04,960
come from the mecca of robotics which is
 

1075
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,990
come from the mecca of robotics which is
carnegie mellon university robotics like

1076
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:08,000
carnegie mellon university robotics like
 

1077
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,909
carnegie mellon university robotics like
for all the people i've interacted with

1078
00:18:09,909 --> 00:18:09,919
for all the people i've interacted with
 

1079
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:12,549
for all the people i've interacted with
that come from there or just from

1080
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:12,559
that come from there or just from
 

1081
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,870
that come from there or just from
you know the world experts at robotics

1082
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:14,880
you know the world experts at robotics
 

1083
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,390
you know the world experts at robotics
they don't

1084
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:16,400
they don't
 

1085
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,990
they don't
they would never build something like

1086
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:18,000
they would never build something like
 

1087
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,630
they would never build something like
cosmo yeah and so where did that come

1088
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:20,640
cosmo yeah and so where did that come
 

1089
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,909
cosmo yeah and so where did that come
from so the simplicity it came from this

1090
00:18:23,909 --> 00:18:23,919
from so the simplicity it came from this
 

1091
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:25,510
from so the simplicity it came from this
combination of a team that we had it was

1092
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:25,520
combination of a team that we had it was
 

1093
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,270
combination of a team that we had it was
it was quite cool because like we and by

1094
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:27,280
it was quite cool because like we and by
 

1095
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,870
it was quite cool because like we and by
the way you ask anybody that's like

1096
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:28,880
the way you ask anybody that's like
 

1097
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,630
the way you ask anybody that's like
experienced in the like kind of you know

1098
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:30,640
experienced in the like kind of you know
 

1099
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,310
experienced in the like kind of you know
toy entertainment space you'll never

1100
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:32,320
toy entertainment space you'll never
 

1101
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,310
toy entertainment space you'll never
sell a product over 99 um that was

1102
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:34,320
sell a product over 99 um that was
 

1103
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,070
sell a product over 99 um that was
fundamentally false and we believed it

1104
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:36,080
fundamentally false and we believed it
 

1105
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,990
fundamentally false and we believed it
to be false it was because experience

1106
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:38,000
to be false it was because experience
 

1107
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,830
to be false it was because experience
had to kind of you know meet the mark

1108
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:39,840
had to kind of you know meet the mark
 

1109
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,430
had to kind of you know meet the mark
and so we pushed past that amount but

1110
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:41,440
and so we pushed past that amount but
 

1111
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,870
and so we pushed past that amount but
there was a pressure where the higher

1112
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:42,880
there was a pressure where the higher
 

1113
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,870
there was a pressure where the higher
you go the more seasonal you become and

1114
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:44,880
you go the more seasonal you become and
 

1115
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,190
you go the more seasonal you become and
the tougher it becomes and so on the

1116
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:47,200
the tougher it becomes and so on the
 

1117
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,990
the tougher it becomes and so on the
cost side we very quickly partnered up

1118
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:50,000
cost side we very quickly partnered up
 

1119
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,510
cost side we very quickly partnered up
with some previous contacts that we

1120
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:51,520
with some previous contacts that we
 

1121
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,669
with some previous contacts that we
worked with where just as an example one

1122
00:18:53,669 --> 00:18:53,679
worked with where just as an example one
 

1123
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:56,470
worked with where just as an example one
our head of mechanical engineering um

1124
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:56,480
our head of mechanical engineering um
 

1125
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,230
our head of mechanical engineering um
was one of the earliest heads of

1126
00:18:58,230 --> 00:18:58,240
was one of the earliest heads of
 

1127
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,310
was one of the earliest heads of
engineering at logitech and has a

1128
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:00,320
engineering at logitech and has a
 

1129
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,070
engineering at logitech and has a
billion units of consumer products and

1130
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:02,080
billion units of consumer products and
 

1131
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,070
billion units of consumer products and
circulation that he's worked on yeah so

1132
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:04,080
circulation that he's worked on yeah so
 

1133
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,630
circulation that he's worked on yeah so
like crazy low cost high volume consumer

1134
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:06,640

product experience with a really great

1136
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:08,320
product experience with a really great
 

1137
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,230
product experience with a really great
mechanical engineering team and just a

1138
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:10,240
mechanical engineering team and just a
 

1139
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,390
mechanical engineering team and just a
very practical mindset where we were not

1140
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:12,400
very practical mindset where we were not
 

1141
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,230
very practical mindset where we were not
going to compromise on feasibility in

1142
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:14,240
going to compromise on feasibility in
 

1143
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,070
going to compromise on feasibility in
the market in order to chase something

1144
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:16,080
the market in order to chase something
 

1145
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,150
the market in order to chase something
that would be enabler and we pushed a

1146
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:18,160
that would be enabler and we pushed a
 

1147
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,590
that would be enabler and we pushed a
huge amount of expectations onto the

1148
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:19,600
huge amount of expectations onto the
 

1149
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,870
huge amount of expectations onto the
software team where yes we're going to

1150
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:20,880
software team where yes we're going to
 

1151
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,630
software team where yes we're going to
use cheap

1152
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:22,640
use cheap
 

1153
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,110
use cheap
noisy motors and sensors but we're gonna

1154
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:25,120
noisy motors and sensors but we're gonna
 

1155
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,909
noisy motors and sensors but we're gonna
fix it in the um on the software side

1156
00:19:27,909 --> 00:19:27,919
fix it in the um on the software side
 

1157
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:29,590
fix it in the um on the software side
then we found on the design and

1158
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:29,600
then we found on the design and
 

1159
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,430
then we found on the design and
character side there was a faction that

1160
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:31,440
character side there was a faction that
 

1161
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,789
character side there was a faction that
was more from like a game design

1162
00:19:32,789 --> 00:19:32,799
was more from like a game design
 

1163
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:34,549
was more from like a game design
background that thought that it should

1164
00:19:34,549 --> 00:19:34,559
background that thought that it should
 

1165
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,789
background that thought that it should
be very games driven cosmo where you

1166
00:19:36,789 --> 00:19:36,799
be very games driven cosmo where you
 

1167
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:37,830
be very games driven cosmo where you
create a whole bunch of games

1168
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:37,840
create a whole bunch of games
 

1169
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,750
create a whole bunch of games
experiences and it's all about like game

1170
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:39,760
experiences and it's all about like game
 

1171
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,549
experiences and it's all about like game
mechanics and then there was um a

1172
00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:42,559
mechanics and then there was um a
 

1173
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:44,549
mechanics and then there was um a
faction which my my co-founder and i the

1174
00:19:44,549 --> 00:19:44,559
faction which my my co-founder and i the
 

1175
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:45,990
faction which my my co-founder and i the
most involved in this like really

1176
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:46,000
most involved in this like really
 

1177
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,590
most involved in this like really
believed in which was character driven

1178
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:47,600
believed in which was character driven
 

1179
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,270
believed in which was character driven
and the argument is that you will never

1180
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:49,280
and the argument is that you will never
 

1181
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,789
and the argument is that you will never
compete with what you can do virtually

1182
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:50,799
compete with what you can do virtually
 

1183
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:53,029
compete with what you can do virtually
from a game standpoint but you actually

1184
00:19:53,029 --> 00:19:53,039
from a game standpoint but you actually
 

1185
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:54,710
from a game standpoint but you actually
on the character side put this into your

1186
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:54,720
on the character side put this into your
 

1187
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,870
on the character side put this into your
wheelhouse and put it more towards your

1188
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:56,880
wheelhouse and put it more towards your
 

1189
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:57,830
wheelhouse and put it more towards your
advantage

00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:57,840
advantage
 

1191
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,590
advantage

virtually this is okay i can't just
 

1199
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,830
virtually this is okay i can't just
pause on that because this is so

pause on that because this is so
 

1201
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,669
pause on that because this is so
brilliant when i uh for people who don't

but there's also a depth of character

1208
00:20:13,029 --> 00:20:13,039
but there's also a depth of character
 

1209
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:14,630
but there's also a depth of character
and i actually when i was

1210
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:14,640
and i actually when i was
 

1211
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,270

you know playing with it
 

1213
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,830
you know playing with it
i wondered

1214
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:18,840
i wondered
 

1215
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,990
i wondered
exactly what is the compelling aspect of

1216
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:22,000
exactly what is the compelling aspect of
 

1217
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,310
exactly what is the compelling aspect of
this because to me obviously i'm i'm

1218
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:24,320
this because to me obviously i'm i'm
 

1219
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,630
this because to me obviously i'm i'm
biased but to me the character i get

1220
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:26,640
biased but to me the character i get
 

1221
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,870
biased but to me the character i get
what i enjoyed most honestly

1222
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:28,880
what i enjoyed most honestly
 

1223
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:29,830
what i enjoyed most honestly
or what

1224
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:29,840
or what
 

1225
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,549
or what
got me to return to it is the character

1226
00:20:32,549 --> 00:20:32,559
got me to return to it is the character
 

1227
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:33,909
got me to return to it is the character
that's right but that's that's a

1228
00:20:33,909 --> 00:20:33,919
that's right but that's that's a
 

1229
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:35,990
that's right but that's that's a
fascinating discussion of uh

1230
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:36,000
fascinating discussion of uh
 

1231
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,070
fascinating discussion of uh
you're right ultimately

1232
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:38,080
you're right ultimately
 

1233
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,990
you're right ultimately
you cannot compete

1234
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:40,000
you cannot compete
 

1235
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:40,950
you cannot compete
on the

1236
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:40,960
on the
 

1237
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,549
on the
quality of the gaming experience too

1238
00:20:42,549 --> 00:20:42,559
quality of the gaming experience too
 

1239
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:44,070
quality of the gaming experience too
restrictive the physical world is just

1240
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:44,080
restrictive the physical world is just
 

1241
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,070
restrictive the physical world is just
too restrictive and uh you don't have a

1242
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:46,080
too restrictive and uh you don't have a
 

1243
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,590
too restrictive and uh you don't have a
graphics engine it's like all this but

1244
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:47,600
graphics engine it's like all this but
 

1245
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,029
graphics engine it's like all this but
on the character side

1246
00:20:49,029 --> 00:20:49,039
on the character side
 

1247
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,430
on the character side
we uh and clearly we moved in that

1248
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:51,440
we uh and clearly we moved in that
 

1249
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,510
we uh and clearly we moved in that
direction is like kind of the the the

1250
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:53,520
direction is like kind of the the the
 

1251
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,669
direction is like kind of the the the
winning path and um

1252
00:20:55,669 --> 00:20:55,679
winning path and um
 

1253
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:58,710
winning path and um
we partnered up with this uh really we

1254
00:20:58,710 --> 00:20:58,720
we partnered up with this uh really we
 

1255
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,590
we partnered up with this uh really we
immediately like went towards pixar and

1256
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:01,600
immediately like went towards pixar and
 

1257
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,750
immediately like went towards pixar and
carlos bana he was um one of like had

1258
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:03,760
carlos bana he was um one of like had
 

1259
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,750
carlos bana he was um one of like had
been in pixar for nine years he'd worked

1260
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:05,760
been in pixar for nine years he'd worked
 

1261
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,750
been in pixar for nine years he'd worked
on tons of the movies including wally

1262
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:07,760
on tons of the movies including wally
 

1263
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,630
on tons of the movies including wally
and others and just immediately kind of

1264
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:10,640
and others and just immediately kind of
 

1265
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,549
and others and just immediately kind of
spoke the language and just clicked on

1266
00:21:12,549 --> 00:21:12,559
spoke the language and just clicked on
 

1267
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:13,990
spoke the language and just clicked on
how you think about that like kind of

1268
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:14,000
how you think about that like kind of
 

1269
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,070
how you think about that like kind of
magic and drive and then he we built out

1270
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:16,080
magic and drive and then he we built out
 

1271
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,350
magic and drive and then he we built out
a team uh

1272
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:17,360
a team uh
 

1273
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,710
a team uh
you know with him as like a really kind

1274
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:18,720
you know with him as like a really kind
 

1275
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,950
you know with him as like a really kind
of prominent kind of driver of this with

1276
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:20,960
of prominent kind of driver of this with
 

1277
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,310
of prominent kind of driver of this with
different types of backgrounds and

1278
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:22,320
different types of backgrounds and
 

1279
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,470
different types of backgrounds and
animators and character developers where

1280
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:24,480
animators and character developers where
 

1281
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,669
animators and character developers where
um we put these constraints on the team

1282
00:21:27,669 --> 00:21:27,679
um we put these constraints on the team
 

1283
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:29,830
um we put these constraints on the team
but then got them to really try to

1284
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:29,840
but then got them to really try to
 

1285
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,789
but then got them to really try to
create magic despite that and we

1286
00:21:32,789 --> 00:21:32,799
create magic despite that and we
 

1287
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:34,950
create magic despite that and we
converged on this system that was at the

1288
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:34,960
converged on this system that was at the
 

1289
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,750
converged on this system that was at the
overlap of character and the character

1290
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:37,760
overlap of character and the character

00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,630
that where if you imagine the
dimensionality of emotions happy

1296
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:42,640
dimensionality of emotions happy
 

1297
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,710
dimensionality of emotions happy
sad angry surprised confused uh um

1298
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:46,720
sad angry surprised confused uh um
 

1299
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,549
sad angry surprised confused uh um
scared like you think of these extreme

1300
00:21:48,549 --> 00:21:48,559
scared like you think of these extreme
 

1301
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:50,470
scared like you think of these extreme
emotions

1302
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:50,480
emotions
 

1303
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,669
emotions
we almost like kind of put this

1304
00:21:51,669 --> 00:21:51,679
we almost like kind of put this
 

1305
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:53,110
we almost like kind of put this
challenge to kind of populate this

1306
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:53,120
challenge to kind of populate this
 

1307
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,590
challenge to kind of populate this
library of responses on how do you show

1308
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:55,600
library of responses on how do you show
 

1309
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,270
library of responses on how do you show
the extreme

1310
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:57,280
the extreme
 

1311
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,750
the extreme
response that like goes to the extreme

1312
00:21:59,750 --> 00:21:59,760
response that like goes to the extreme
 

1313
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,909
response that like goes to the extreme
spectrum on angry or frustrated or

1314
00:22:01,909 --> 00:22:01,919
spectrum on angry or frustrated or
 

1315
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:03,990
spectrum on angry or frustrated or
whatever and and so that gave us a lot

1316
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:04,000
whatever and and so that gave us a lot
 

1317
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,310
whatever and and so that gave us a lot
of intuition and learnings and um and

1318
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:06,320
of intuition and learnings and um and
 

1319
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,669
of intuition and learnings and um and
then we started parameterizing them

1320
00:22:07,669 --> 00:22:07,679
then we started parameterizing them
 

1321
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:08,950
then we started parameterizing them
where it wasn't just a fixed recording

1322
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:08,960
where it wasn't just a fixed recording
 

1323
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,390
where it wasn't just a fixed recording
but they were parameterized and had

1324
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:10,400
but they were parameterized and had
 

1325
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,630
but they were parameterized and had
randomness to them where you could have

1326
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:12,640
randomness to them where you could have
 

1327
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,470
randomness to them where you could have
infinite permutations of happy and

1328
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:14,480
infinite permutations of happy and
 

1329
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,390
infinite permutations of happy and
surprised and so forth

1330
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:16,400
surprised and so forth
 

1331
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,710
surprised and so forth
and then we had a behavioral engine that

1332
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:18,720
and then we had a behavioral engine that
 

1333
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,789
and then we had a behavioral engine that
took the context from the real world

1334
00:22:20,789 --> 00:22:20,799
took the context from the real world
 

1335
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:22,710
took the context from the real world
and would interpret it and then create

1336
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:22,720
and would interpret it and then create
 

1337
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,870
and would interpret it and then create
kind of probability mappings on what

1338
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:24,880
kind of probability mappings on what
 

1339
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,630
kind of probability mappings on what
sort of responses you would have that

1340
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:26,640
sort of responses you would have that
 

1341
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,190
sort of responses you would have that
actually made sense and so if cosmo saw

1342
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:29,200
actually made sense and so if cosmo saw
 

1343
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,430
actually made sense and so if cosmo saw
you for the first time in a day um he'd

1344
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:31,440
you for the first time in a day um he'd
 

1345
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,190
you for the first time in a day um he'd
be really surprised and happy in the

1346
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:33,200
be really surprised and happy in the
 

1347
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,549
be really surprised and happy in the
same way that the first time you walk in

1348
00:22:34,549 --> 00:22:34,559
same way that the first time you walk in
 

1349
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:36,950
same way that the first time you walk in
and like your toddler sees you they're

1350
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:36,960
and like your toddler sees you they're
 

1351
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,230
and like your toddler sees you they're
so happy but they're not gonna be that

1352
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:38,240
so happy but they're not gonna be that
 

1353
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,230
so happy but they're not gonna be that
happy for the entirety of your next two

1354
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:40,240
happy for the entirety of your next two
 

1355
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,070
happy for the entirety of your next two
hours but like you have this like spike

1356
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:42,080
hours but like you have this like spike
 

1357
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,990
hours but like you have this like spike
in response or if you leave him alone

1358
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:44,000
in response or if you leave him alone
 

1359
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,430
in response or if you leave him alone
for too long he gets bored and starts

1360
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:45,440
for too long he gets bored and starts
 

1361
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,110
for too long he gets bored and starts
causing trouble and like nudging things

1362
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:47,120
causing trouble and like nudging things
 

1363
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,270
causing trouble and like nudging things
off the table um or if you beat him in a

1364
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:49,280
off the table um or if you beat him in a
 

1365
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,669
off the table um or if you beat him in a
game um the most enjoyable emotions are

1366
00:22:51,669 --> 00:22:51,679
game um the most enjoyable emotions are
 

1367
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:53,909
game um the most enjoyable emotions are
him getting frustrated and grumpy to a

1368
00:22:53,909 --> 00:22:53,919
him getting frustrated and grumpy to a
 

1369
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:55,590

point where our testers and our

1370
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:55,600
point where our testers and our
 

1371
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,110
point where our testers and our
customers would be like

1372
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:57,120
customers would be like
 

1373
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,470
customers would be like
i had to let him win because i don't

1374
00:22:58,470 --> 00:22:58,480
i had to let him win because i don't
 

1375
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,390
i had to let him win because i don't
want him to be upset and

1376
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:00,400
want him to be upset and
 

1377
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,549
want him to be upset and
so you start to like create this

1378
00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:02,559
so you start to like create this
 

1379
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:04,549
so you start to like create this
feedback loop where you see how powerful

1380
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:04,559
feedback loop where you see how powerful
 

1381
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:06,230
feedback loop where you see how powerful
those emotions are and just to give you

1382
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:06,240
those emotions are and just to give you
 

1383
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,590
those emotions are and just to give you
an example something as simple as eye

1384
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:07,600
an example something as simple as eye
 

1385
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,669
an example something as simple as eye
contact um you don't think about it in a

1386
00:23:09,669 --> 00:23:09,679
contact um you don't think about it in a
 

1387
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,510
contact um you don't think about it in a
movie just like it kind of happens like

1388
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:11,520
movie just like it kind of happens like
 

1389
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,669
movie just like it kind of happens like
you know camera angles and so forth um

1390
00:23:13,669 --> 00:23:13,679
you know camera angles and so forth um
 

1391
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:15,830
you know camera angles and so forth um
but that's not really a prominent source

1392
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:15,840
but that's not really a prominent source
 

1393
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,190
but that's not really a prominent source
of interaction

1394
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:17,200
of interaction
 

1395
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,590
of interaction
what happens when a physical character

1396
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:19,600
what happens when a physical character
 

1397
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,430
what happens when a physical character
like cosmo when he makes eye contact

1398
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:21,440
like cosmo when he makes eye contact
 

1399
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,510
like cosmo when he makes eye contact
with you um

1400
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:23,520
with you um
 

1401
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,149
with you um
it built universal kind of connection

1402
00:23:26,149 --> 00:23:26,159
it built universal kind of connection
 

1403
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:28,310
it built universal kind of connection
kids all the way through adults um and

1404
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:28,320
kids all the way through adults um and
 

1405
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,470
kids all the way through adults um and
it was truly universal it was not like

1406
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:30,480
it was truly universal it was not like
 

1407
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,470
it was truly universal it was not like
people stopped caring after 10 12 years

1408
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:32,480
people stopped caring after 10 12 years
 

1409
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,070
people stopped caring after 10 12 years
old

1410
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:34,080
old
 

1411
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,510
old
and so

1412
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:35,520
and so
 

1413
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,950
and so
we started doing experiments and we

1414
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:36,960
we started doing experiments and we
 

1415
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,789
we started doing experiments and we
found something as simple as

1416
00:23:38,789 --> 00:23:38,799
found something as simple as
 

1417
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:40,950
found something as simple as
increasing the amount of eye contact

1418
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:40,960
increasing the amount of eye contact
 

1419
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,549
increasing the amount of eye contact
like the amount of times in a minute

1420
00:23:42,549 --> 00:23:42,559
like the amount of times in a minute
 

1421
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:43,990
like the amount of times in a minute
that he'll look over for your approval

1422
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:44,000
that he'll look over for your approval
 

1423
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,950
that he'll look over for your approval
to like kind of make eye contact just by

1424
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:46,960
to like kind of make eye contact just by
 

1425
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,269
to like kind of make eye contact just by
i think doubling it we increase the play

1426
00:23:49,269 --> 00:23:49,279
i think doubling it we increase the play
 

1427
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:50,789
i think doubling it we increase the play
time engagement by 40

1428
00:23:50,789 --> 00:23:50,799
time engagement by 40
 

1429
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:52,390
time engagement by 40
like you see these sort of like kind of

1430
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:52,400
like you see these sort of like kind of
 

1431
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,350
like you see these sort of like kind of
interactions where you build that

1432
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:53,360
interactions where you build that
 

1433
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,430
interactions where you build that
empathy and and so we studied pets we

1434
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:55,440
empathy and and so we studied pets we
 

1435
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,510
empathy and and so we studied pets we
studied um virtual characters there's

1436
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:57,520
studied um virtual characters there's
 

1437
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,990
studied um virtual characters there's
like a lot of times actually dogs are

1438
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:00,000
like a lot of times actually dogs are
 

1439
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,789
like a lot of times actually dogs are
one of the perfect most perfect uh um

1440
00:24:02,789 --> 00:24:02,799
one of the perfect most perfect uh um
 

1441
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:04,390
one of the perfect most perfect uh um
influencers behind these sort of

1442
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:04,400
influencers behind these sort of
 

1443
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,909
influencers behind these sort of
interactions and what we realized is

1444
00:24:05,909 --> 00:24:05,919
interactions and what we realized is
 

1445
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:07,510
interactions and what we realized is
that the games were not there to

1446
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:07,520
that the games were not there to
 

1447
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,350
that the games were not there to
entertain you the games were to create

1448
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:09,360
entertain you the games were to create
 

1449
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,510
entertain you the games were to create
context to bring out the character and

1450
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:11,520
context to bring out the character and
 

1451
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,870
context to bring out the character and
if you think about the types of games

1452
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:12,880
if you think about the types of games
 

1453
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,390
if you think about the types of games
that you know that you played they're

1454
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:14,400
that you know that you played they're
 

1455
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,390
that you know that you played they're
relatively simple but they were always

1456
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:16,400
relatively simple but they were always
 

1457
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,230
relatively simple but they were always
once to create scenarios of either

1458
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:18,240
once to create scenarios of either
 

1459
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,470
once to create scenarios of either
tension or winning or losing or surprise

1460
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:20,480
tension or winning or losing or surprise
 

1461
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,710
tension or winning or losing or surprise
or whatever the case might be and they

1462
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:22,720
or whatever the case might be and they
 

1463
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,950
or whatever the case might be and they
were purely there to just like create

1464
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:24,960
were purely there to just like create
 

1465
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,789
were purely there to just like create
context to where an emotion could feel

1466
00:24:26,789 --> 00:24:26,799
context to where an emotion could feel
 

1467
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,710
context to where an emotion could feel
intelligent and not random

1468
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:28,720
intelligent and not random
 

1469
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,750
intelligent and not random
and in the end it was all about the

1470
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:29,760
and in the end it was all about the
 

1471
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,710
and in the end it was all about the
character

1472
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:30,720
character
 

1473
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,549
character
so yeah there's so many

1474
00:24:32,549 --> 00:24:32,559
so yeah there's so many
 

1475
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:34,390
so yeah there's so many
elements to play with here so you said

1476
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:34,400
elements to play with here so you said
 

1477
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,430
elements to play with here so you said
dogs what lessons do we draw from cats

1478
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:37,440
dogs what lessons do we draw from cats
 

1479
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,149
dogs what lessons do we draw from cats
who don't seem to give a damn about you

1480
00:24:40,149 --> 00:24:40,159
who don't seem to give a damn about you
 

1481
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:42,070
who don't seem to give a damn about you
is that just another character is this

1482
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:42,080
is that just another character is this
 

1483
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,750
is that just another character is this
another it's just another character and

1484
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:43,760
another it's just another character and
 

1485
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,510
another it's just another character and
so you you could almost like in early

1486
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:45,520
so you you could almost like in early
 

1487
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,669
so you you could almost like in early
aspirations we thought it would be

1488
00:24:47,669 --> 00:24:47,679
aspirations we thought it would be
 

1489
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:49,350
aspirations we thought it would be
really incredible if you had a diversity

1490
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:49,360
really incredible if you had a diversity
 

1491
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,430
really incredible if you had a diversity
of characters where you almost help

1492
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:51,440
of characters where you almost help
 

1493
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,950
of characters where you almost help
encourage which direction it goes just

1494
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:52,960
encourage which direction it goes just
 

1495
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,830
encourage which direction it goes just
like in a role-playing game um and you

1496
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:55,840
like in a role-playing game um and you
 

1497
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,310
like in a role-playing game um and you
had uh like think of like the you know

1498
00:24:58,310 --> 00:24:58,320
had uh like think of like the you know
 

1499
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,870
had uh like think of like the you know
seven dwarfs sort of and uh um and

1500
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:00,880
seven dwarfs sort of and uh um and
 

1501
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,070
seven dwarfs sort of and uh um and
initially we even thought that it would

1502
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:02,080
initially we even thought that it would
 

1503
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,390
initially we even thought that it would
be amazing if like the other like

1504
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:04,400
be amazing if like the other like
 

1505
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,029
be amazing if like the other like
you know like their characters actually

1506
00:25:07,029 --> 00:25:07,039
you know like their characters actually
 

1507
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:08,950
you know like their characters actually
help them be have strengths and

1508
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:08,960
help them be have strengths and
 

1509
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,230
help them be have strengths and
weaknesses and some you know like

1510
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:10,240
weaknesses and some you know like
 

1511
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,230
weaknesses and some you know like
whatever they end up doing like some are

1512
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:12,240
whatever they end up doing like some are
 

1513
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,590
whatever they end up doing like some are
scared some are

1514
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:13,600
scared some are
 

1515
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,630
scared some are
you know

1516
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:14,640
you know
 

1517
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,710
you know
arrogant some are uh

1518
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:16,720
arrogant some are uh
 

1519
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,390
arrogant some are uh
you know super warm and like kind of

1520
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:18,400
you know super warm and like kind of
 

1521
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,990
you know super warm and like kind of
friendly and in the end we focused on

1522
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:20,000
friendly and in the end we focused on
 

1523
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,590
friendly and in the end we focused on
one because it made it very clear that

1524
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:21,600
one because it made it very clear that
 

1525
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,789
one because it made it very clear that
hey we got to build out enough depth

1526
00:25:22,789 --> 00:25:22,799
hey we got to build out enough depth
 

1527
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:24,070
hey we got to build out enough depth
here because you're

1528
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:24,080
here because you're
 

1529
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,990
here because you're
kind of trying to expand

1530
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:26,000
kind of trying to expand
 

1531
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,350
kind of trying to expand
it's almost like how long can you

1532
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:27,360
it's almost like how long can you
 

1533
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,710
it's almost like how long can you
maintain a fiction that this character

1534
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:28,720
maintain a fiction that this character
 

1535
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,269
maintain a fiction that this character
is alive um to where the person's

1536
00:25:31,269 --> 00:25:31,279
is alive um to where the person's
 

1537
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:33,350
is alive um to where the person's
explorations don't hit a boundary um

1538
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:33,360
explorations don't hit a boundary um
 

1539
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,789
explorations don't hit a boundary um
which happens almost immediately with

1540
00:25:34,789 --> 00:25:34,799
which happens almost immediately with
 

1541
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:37,830
which happens almost immediately with
with typical toys um and you know even

1542
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:37,840
with typical toys um and you know even
 

1543
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,390
with typical toys um and you know even
with video games uh how long can we

1544
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:40,400
with video games uh how long can we
 

1545
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,230
with video games uh how long can we
create that immersive experience to

1546
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:42,240
create that immersive experience to
 

1547
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,830
create that immersive experience to
where you expand the boundary and one of

1548
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:43,840
where you expand the boundary and one of
 

1549
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,230
where you expand the boundary and one of
the things we realized is that you're um

1550
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:46,240
the things we realized is that you're um
 

1551
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,470
the things we realized is that you're um
just way more forgiving when something

1552
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:48,480
just way more forgiving when something
 

1553
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,029
just way more forgiving when something
has a personality and it's physical

1554
00:25:51,029 --> 00:25:51,039
has a personality and it's physical
 

1555
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:52,630
has a personality and it's physical
that is the key

1556
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:52,640
that is the key
 

1557
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,990
that is the key
that unlocks

1558
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:54,000
that unlocks
 

1559
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,149
that unlocks
uh robotics interacting you know in the

1560
00:25:56,149 --> 00:25:56,159
uh robotics interacting you know in the
 

1561
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:57,830
uh robotics interacting you know in the
physical world more generally is that

1562
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:57,840
physical world more generally is that
 

1563
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,830
physical world more generally is that
that uh the

1564
00:25:59,830 --> 00:25:59,840
that uh the
 

1565
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,430
that uh the
when you have a when you don't have a

00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:03,120
personality and you make a mistake as a
 

1569
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,430
personality and you make a mistake as a
robot the stupid robot made a mistake

1570
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:05,440
robot the stupid robot made a mistake
 

1571
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,029
robot the stupid robot made a mistake
why is it not perfect when you have a

1572
00:26:07,029 --> 00:26:07,039
why is it not perfect when you have a
 

1573
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:08,870
why is it not perfect when you have a
character and you make a mistake you

1574
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:08,880
character and you make a mistake you
 

1575
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,310
character and you make a mistake you
have empathy and it becomes endearing

1576
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:10,320
have empathy and it becomes endearing
 

1577
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,669
have empathy and it becomes endearing
and you're way more forgiving and that

1578
00:26:11,669 --> 00:26:11,679
and you're way more forgiving and that
 

1579
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:13,590
and you're way more forgiving and that
was the key that was like i think goes

1580
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:13,600
was the key that was like i think goes
 

1581
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,669
was the key that was like i think goes
far far beyond entertainment it actually

1582
00:26:15,669 --> 00:26:15,679
far far beyond entertainment it actually
 

1583
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:17,430
far far beyond entertainment it actually
builds the depth of the personality the

1584
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:17,440
builds the depth of the personality the
 

1585
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,990
builds the depth of the personality the
mistakes so let me ask the the movie her

1586
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:20,000
mistakes so let me ask the the movie her
 

1587
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,830
mistakes so let me ask the the movie her
question then

1588
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:21,840
question then
 

1589
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,510
question then
how and so

1590
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:23,520
how and so
 

1591
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,630
how and so
cosmos seem feels like the early days of

1592
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:26,640
cosmos seem feels like the early days of
 

1593
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,310
cosmos seem feels like the early days of
something that will obviously be

1594
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:28,320
something that will obviously be
 

1595
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,350
something that will obviously be
prevalent throughout society at a scale

1596
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:31,360
prevalent throughout society at a scale
 

1597
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,950
prevalent throughout society at a scale
that

1598
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:32,960
that
 

1599
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,110
that
we cannot even imagine

1600
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:35,120
we cannot even imagine
 

1601
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,549
we cannot even imagine
my sense is

1602
00:26:36,549 --> 00:26:36,559
my sense is
 

1603
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:38,390
my sense is
it seems obvious

1604
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:38,400
it seems obvious
 

1605
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,149
it seems obvious
that these kinds of characters will

1606
00:26:40,149 --> 00:26:40,159
that these kinds of characters will
 

1607
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:42,710
that these kinds of characters will
permeate society and they will be

1608
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:42,720
permeate society and they will be
 

1609
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,630
permeate society and they will be
friends with them we'll be interacting

1610
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:44,640
friends with them we'll be interacting
 

1611
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,750
friends with them we'll be interacting
with them in different ways the in the

1612
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:45,760
with them in different ways the in the
 

1613
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,750
with them in different ways the in the
way we i mean you don't think of it this

1614
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:47,760
way we i mean you don't think of it this
 

1615
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:51,510
way we i mean you don't think of it this
way but when you play video games

1616
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:51,520
way but when you play video games
 

1617
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,590
way but when you play video games
they're kind they're often cold and

1618
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:53,600
they're kind they're often cold and
 

1619

they're kind they're often cold and
impersonal

1620
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:54,960
impersonal
 

1621
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,430
impersonal
but but even then

1622
00:26:57,430 --> 00:26:57,440
but but even then
 

1623
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,590
but but even then
uh you think about role-playing games

1624
00:26:59,590 --> 00:26:59,600
uh you think about role-playing games
 

1625
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,190
uh you think about role-playing games
you become friends with certain

1626
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:01,200
you become friends with certain
 

1627
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,269
you become friends with certain
characters in that game they're they

1628
00:27:03,269 --> 00:27:03,279
characters in that game they're they
 

1629
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:05,990
characters in that game they're they
don't remember much about you they

1630
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:06,000
don't remember much about you they
 

1631
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,830
don't remember much about you they
they're they're just telling a story

1632
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:07,840
they're they're just telling a story
 

1633
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,430
they're they're just telling a story
it's exactly what you're saying they

1634
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:09,440
it's exactly what you're saying they
 

1635
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,590
it's exactly what you're saying they
they exist in that virtual world but if

1636
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:11,600
they exist in that virtual world but if
 

1637
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,669
they exist in that virtual world but if
they acknowledge that you exist in this

1638
00:27:13,669 --> 00:27:13,679
they acknowledge that you exist in this
 

1639
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:15,590
they acknowledge that you exist in this
physical world if the characters in the

1640
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:15,600
physical world if the characters in the
 

1641
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,870
physical world if the characters in the
game remember that you exist that you

1642
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:18,880
game remember that you exist that you
 

1643
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,350
game remember that you exist that you
like for me like lex they understand

1644
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:21,360
like for me like lex they understand
 

1645
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,230
like for me like lex they understand
that i'm a human being who has like

1646
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:24,240
that i'm a human being who has like
 

1647
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:28,149
that i'm a human being who has like
hopes and dreams and so on it seems like

1648
00:27:28,149 --> 00:27:28,159
hopes and dreams and so on it seems like
 

1649
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:30,310
hopes and dreams and so on it seems like
there's going to be a like

1650
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:30,320
there's going to be a like
 

1651
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,430
there's going to be a like
billions

1652
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:31,440
billions
 

1653
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,990
billions
if not trillions of cosmos in the world

1654
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:34,000
if not trillions of cosmos in the world
 

1655
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,470
if not trillions of cosmos in the world
so if we look at that future

1656
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:36,480
so if we look at that future
 

1657
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,230
so if we look at that future
there are several questions to ask how

1658
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:38,240
there are several questions to ask how
 

1659
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,870
there are several questions to ask how
intelligent does that future cosmo need

1660
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:40,880
intelligent does that future cosmo need
 

1661
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,149
intelligent does that future cosmo need
to be

1662
00:27:42,149 --> 00:27:42,159
to be
 

1663
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:44,230
to be
to create

1664
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:44,240
to create
 

1665
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,149
to create
fulfilling

1666
00:27:46,149 --> 00:27:46,159
fulfilling
 

1667
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:48,870
fulfilling
relationships like friendships yeah it's

1668
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:48,880
relationships like friendships yeah it's
 

1669
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,789
relationships like friendships yeah it's
a great question and and part of it was

1670
00:27:50,789 --> 00:27:50,799
a great question and and part of it was
 

1671
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:52,149
a great question and and part of it was
a recognition it's going to take time to

1672
00:27:52,149 --> 00:27:52,159
a recognition it's going to take time to
 

1673
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:53,269
a recognition it's going to take time to
get there because it has to be a lot

1674
00:27:53,269 --> 00:27:53,279
get there because it has to be a lot
 

1675
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:55,430
get there because it has to be a lot
more intelligent um because what's good

1676
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:55,440
more intelligent um because what's good
 

1677
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,549
more intelligent um because what's good
enough to

1678
00:27:56,549 --> 00:27:56,559
enough to
 

1679
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:58,710
enough to
be a magical experience for

1680
00:27:58,710 --> 00:27:58,720
be a magical experience for
 

1681
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,430
be a magical experience for
uh you know an eight-year-old um it's a

1682
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:01,440
uh you know an eight-year-old um it's a
 

1683
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,590
uh you know an eight-year-old um it's a
higher bar to do that be a complaint

1684
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:03,600
higher bar to do that be a complaint
 

1685
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,470
higher bar to do that be a complaint
like a pet in the home or to help with

1686
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:06,480
like a pet in the home or to help with
 

1687
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,909
like a pet in the home or to help with
functional interface in an office

1688
00:28:07,909 --> 00:28:07,919
functional interface in an office
 

1689
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:10,149
functional interface in an office
environment or in a home or uh and so

1690
00:28:10,149 --> 00:28:10,159
environment or in a home or uh and so
 

1691
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:12,230
environment or in a home or uh and so
forth and so and the idea was that you

1692
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:12,240
forth and so and the idea was that you
 

1693
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,590
forth and so and the idea was that you
build on that and you kind of get there

1694
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:13,600
build on that and you kind of get there
 

1695
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,909
build on that and you kind of get there
and as technology becomes more prevalent

1696
00:28:15,909 --> 00:28:15,919
and as technology becomes more prevalent
 

1697
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:17,430
and as technology becomes more prevalent
and less expensive and so forth you can

1698
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:17,440
and less expensive and so forth you can
 

1699
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,909
and less expensive and so forth you can
start to kind of work up to it um but

1700
00:28:19,909 --> 00:28:19,919
start to kind of work up to it um but
 

1701
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:20,950
start to kind of work up to it um but
you know you're absolutely right at the

1702
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:20,960
you know you're absolutely right at the
 

1703
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,950
you know you're absolutely right at the
end of the day um we almost equated it

1704
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:22,960
end of the day um we almost equated it
 

1705
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,350
end of the day um we almost equated it
to how uh the touchscreen created like

1706
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:25,360
to how uh the touchscreen created like
 

1707
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,029
to how uh the touchscreen created like
this really novel interface to you know

1708
00:28:27,029 --> 00:28:27,039
this really novel interface to you know
 

1709
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:29,110
this really novel interface to you know
physical kind of devices like this

1710
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:29,120
physical kind of devices like this
 

1711
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,870
physical kind of devices like this
this is the extension of it where you

1712
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:30,880
this is the extension of it where you
 

1713
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:31,669
this is the extension of it where you
have

1714
00:28:31,669 --> 00:28:31,679
have
 

1715
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:33,669
have
much richer physical interaction in the

1716
00:28:33,669 --> 00:28:33,679
much richer physical interaction in the
 

1717
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:35,590
much richer physical interaction in the
real world this is this is the enabler

1718
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:35,600
real world this is this is the enabler
 

1719
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,230
real world this is this is the enabler
for it um and it shows itself in a few

1720
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:38,240
for it um and it shows itself in a few
 

1721
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,590
for it um and it shows itself in a few
kind of really obvious places so just

1722
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:39,600
kind of really obvious places so just
 

1723
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,789
kind of really obvious places so just
take something as simple as a voice

1724
00:28:40,789 --> 00:28:40,799
take something as simple as a voice
 

1725
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:43,430
take something as simple as a voice
assistant um you will never most people

1726
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:43,440
assistant um you will never most people
 

1727
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,909
assistant um you will never most people
will never tolerate uh an alexa or a

1728
00:28:45,909 --> 00:28:45,919
will never tolerate uh an alexa or a
 

1729
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:48,470
will never tolerate uh an alexa or a
google home just starting a conversation

1730
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:48,480
google home just starting a conversation
 

1731
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,110
google home just starting a conversation
um proactively uh when you weren't kind

1732
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:51,120
um proactively uh when you weren't kind
 

1733
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,870
um proactively uh when you weren't kind
of expecting it because it it feels

1734
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:52,880
of expecting it because it it feels
 

1735
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,230
of expecting it because it it feels
weird it's like you were listening and

1736
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:54,240
weird it's like you were listening and
 

1737
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,909
weird it's like you were listening and
like and then now you're kind of it

1738
00:28:55,909 --> 00:28:55,919
like and then now you're kind of it
 

1739
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:57,990
like and then now you're kind of it
feels intrusive but if you had a

1740
00:28:57,990 --> 00:28:58,000
feels intrusive but if you had a
 

1741
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,549
feels intrusive but if you had a
character um like a cat that touches you

1742
00:29:00,549 --> 00:29:00,559
character um like a cat that touches you
 

1743
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:02,310
character um like a cat that touches you
and gets your attention or toddler like

1744
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:02,320
and gets your attention or toddler like
 

1745
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,669
and gets your attention or toddler like
you never think twice about it what we

1746
00:29:03,669 --> 00:29:03,679
you never think twice about it what we
 

1747
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:05,990
you never think twice about it what we
found really kind of immediately is that

1748
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:06,000
found really kind of immediately is that
 

1749
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,669
found really kind of immediately is that
um these types of characters like cosmo

1750
00:29:07,669 --> 00:29:07,679
um these types of characters like cosmo
 

1751
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:08,710
um these types of characters like cosmo
and they would like roam around and kind

1752
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:08,720
and they would like roam around and kind
 

1753
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,230
and they would like roam around and kind
of get your attention and we had a

1754
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:10,240
of get your attention and we had a
 

1755
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,070
of get your attention and we had a
future version it was always on kind of

1756
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:12,080
future version it was always on kind of
 

1757
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,750
future version it was always on kind of
called vector people were way more

1758
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:13,760
called vector people were way more
 

1759
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,789
called vector people were way more
forgiving

1760
00:29:14,789 --> 00:29:14,799
forgiving
 

1761
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:17,110
forgiving
and so you could initiate interaction in

1762
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:17,120
and so you could initiate interaction in
 

1763
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,830
and so you could initiate interaction in
a way that is not acceptable for

1764
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:19,840
a way that is not acceptable for
 

1765
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,870
a way that is not acceptable for
for machines and in general um you know

1766
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:22,880
for machines and in general um you know
 

1767
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,710
for machines and in general um you know
there's a lot of ways to customize it

1768
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:24,720
there's a lot of ways to customize it
 

1769
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,110
there's a lot of ways to customize it
but it makes people who are skeptical of

question
and it was because

1846

when it conversation came up it was
 

1851
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:47,990
when it conversation came up it was
almost like well of course he has to see

1852
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:48,000
almost like well of course he has to see
 

1853

and it completely disarmed um this like
 

1859
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,990
and it completely disarmed um this like
fear of technology that enabled this

1860
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:56,000
fear of technology that enabled this
 

1861
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,750
fear of technology that enabled this
interaction to be much more fluid and

1862
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:57,760
interaction to be much more fluid and
 

1863
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,190
interaction to be much more fluid and
again like entertainment was a proving

1864
00:30:59,190 --> 00:30:59,200
again like entertainment was a proving
 

1865
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,549
again like entertainment was a proving
ground but that is like a you know

1866
00:31:00,549 --> 00:31:00,559
ground but that is like a you know
 

1867
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:02,549
ground but that is like a you know
there's like ingredients there that

1868
00:31:02,549 --> 00:31:02,559
there's like ingredients there that
 

1869
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:05,029
there's like ingredients there that
carry over to a lot of other uh

1870
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:05,039
carry over to a lot of other uh
 

1871
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:06,870
carry over to a lot of other uh
elements down the road that's hilarious

1872
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:06,880
elements down the road that's hilarious
 

1873
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,630
elements down the road that's hilarious
that we're a lot less concerned about

1874
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:08,640
that we're a lot less concerned about
 

1875
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,350
that we're a lot less concerned about
privacy if the if the thing is value and

1876
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:11,360
privacy if the if the thing is value and

charisma

1878
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:13,120
charisma
 

1879
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,870
charisma
i mean that's true for all of women to

1880
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:14,880
i mean that's true for all of women to
 

1881
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,310
i mean that's true for all of women to
human interaction too it's an

1882
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:16,320
human interaction too it's an
 

1883
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,230
human interaction too it's an
understanding of intent where like well

1884
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:18,240
understanding of intent where like well
 

1885
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,669
understanding of intent where like well
he's looking at me he can see me if he's

1886
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:19,679
he's looking at me he can see me if he's
 

1887
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:21,029
he's looking at me he can see me if he's
not looking at me he can't see me right

1888

not looking at me he can't see me right
so it's almost like uh

1890
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:22,640
so it's almost like uh
 

1891
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,029
so it's almost like uh
um you're communicating intent and with

1892
00:31:25,029 --> 00:31:25,039
um you're communicating intent and with
 

1893
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:26,389
um you're communicating intent and with
that intent

1894
00:31:26,389 --> 00:31:26,399
that intent
 

1895
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:28,310
that intent
people are like kind of kind of more

1899
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:31,509
understanding and calmer and it's a it's
interesting we just it was just the

1900
00:31:31,509 --> 00:31:31,519
interesting we just it was just the
 

1901
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:33,029

earliest kind of version of starting an

1902
00:31:33,029 --> 00:31:33,039
earliest kind of version of starting an
 

1903
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:34,870
earliest kind of version of starting an
experiment with this but um it wasn't

1904
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:34,880
experiment with this but um it wasn't
 

1905

when you uh when you think about it it
 

2011
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,190
when you uh when you think about it it
was it wasn't just a cost savings like

was it wasn't just a cost savings like
 

2013
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,509
was it wasn't just a cost savings like
for them it was actually for all of

2014

for them it was actually for all of
 

2015
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:25,669
for them it was actually for all of
these purposes it was because when you

and an eight-year-old might get a very
 

2031
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:40,310
and an eight-year-old might get a very
different interpretation than a 40 year

but you create a dynamic range and so

2036
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:42,640
but you create a dynamic range and so
 

2037
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,149
but you create a dynamic range and so
you just you can lean into these

2038
00:33:44,149 --> 00:33:44,159
you just you can lean into these
 

2039
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:46,549
you just you can lean into these
advantages much more um and something

2040
00:33:46,549 --> 00:33:46,559
advantages much more um and something
 

2041
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:48,230
advantages much more um and something
that doesn't resemble a human and so

2042
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:48,240
that doesn't resemble a human and so
 

2043
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,070
that doesn't resemble a human and so
that'll come faster

2044
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:50,080
that'll come faster
 

2045
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,389
that'll come faster
i don't know when a human like that's

at this point the the chat interfaces

2050
00:33:57,190 --> 00:33:57,200
at this point the the chat interfaces
 

2051
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,430
at this point the the chat interfaces
are getting way more interesting and

00:34:35,669 --> 00:34:35,679
on that a little bit
 

2087
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:38,790
on that a little bit
because i feel like is it possible

2088
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:38,800
because i feel like is it possible
 

2089
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,790
because i feel like is it possible
that if you're just good at playing a

2090
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:40,800
that if you're just good at playing a
 

2091
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,950
that if you're just good at playing a
character yeah you're in in a movie

2092
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:42,960
character yeah you're in in a movie
 

2093
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,389
character yeah you're in in a movie
there's a bunch of characters if you

2094
00:34:44,389 --> 00:34:44,399
there's a bunch of characters if you
 

2095
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:46,470
there's a bunch of characters if you
just understand what creates compelling

2096
00:34:46,470 --> 00:34:46,480
just understand what creates compelling
 

2097
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,669
just understand what creates compelling
characters

2098
00:34:47,669 --> 00:34:47,679
characters
 

2099
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:49,990
characters
and then you you just are that character

2100
00:34:49,990 --> 00:34:50,000
and then you you just are that character
 

2101
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,990
and then you you just are that character
and you exist in the world and other

2102
00:34:51,990 --> 00:34:52,000
and you exist in the world and other
 

2103
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,069
and you exist in the world and other
people find you and they connect with

2104
00:34:54,069 --> 00:34:54,079
people find you and they connect with
 

2105
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:55,430
people find you and they connect with
you just like you do when you talk to

2106
00:34:55,430 --> 00:34:55,440
you just like you do when you talk to
 

2107
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,510
you just like you do when you talk to
somebody at a bar i like this character

2108
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:57,520
somebody at a bar i like this character
 

2109
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,950
somebody at a bar i like this character
this character is kind of shady i don't

2110
00:34:58,950 --> 00:34:58,960
this character is kind of shady i don't
 

2111
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,790
this character is kind of shady i don't
like them you pick the ones that you

2112
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:00,800
like them you pick the ones that you
 

2113
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,270
like them you pick the ones that you
like and you know maybe it's somebody

2114
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:03,280
like and you know maybe it's somebody
 

2115
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:06,069
like and you know maybe it's somebody
that's uh reminds you of your father or

2116
00:35:06,069 --> 00:35:06,079
that's uh reminds you of your father or
 

2117
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:07,910
that's uh reminds you of your father or
mother i don't know what it is but the

2118
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:07,920
mother i don't know what it is but the
 

2119
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,829
mother i don't know what it is but the
the freudian thing but there's some kind

2120
00:35:09,829 --> 00:35:09,839
the freudian thing but there's some kind
 

2121
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:12,150
the freudian thing but there's some kind
of connection that happens and that's

2122
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:12,160
of connection that happens and that's
 

2123
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,150
of connection that happens and that's
that that's the cosmo you connect to

2124
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:14,160
that that's the cosmo you connect to
 

2125
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,990
that that's the cosmo you connect to
that's the future cosmo you connect and

2126
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:16,000
that's the future cosmo you connect and
 

2127
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:16,950
that's the future cosmo you connect and
that's

2128
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:16,960
that's
 

2129
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,390
that's
so i guess the statement i'm trying to

2130
00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:18,400
so i guess the statement i'm trying to
 

2131
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,030
so i guess the statement i'm trying to
make is it possible to achieve a depth

2132
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:21,040
make is it possible to achieve a depth
 

2133
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,670
make is it possible to achieve a depth
of friendship without solving

2134
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:23,680
of friendship without solving
 

2135
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,109
of friendship without solving
general intelligence i think so it's

2136
00:35:25,109 --> 00:35:25,119
general intelligence i think so it's
 

2137
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:26,950
general intelligence i think so it's
about intelligent kind of constraints

2138
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:26,960
about intelligent kind of constraints
 

2139
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:30,310
about intelligent kind of constraints
right and just uh you set expectations

2140
00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:30,320
right and just uh you set expectations
 

2141
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,990
right and just uh you set expectations
and constraints such that in the space

2142
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:32,000
and constraints such that in the space
 

2143
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,990
and constraints such that in the space
that's left you can be successful and so

2144
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:34,000
that's left you can be successful and so
 

2145
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,710
that's left you can be successful and so
you can do that by having a very focused

2146
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:36,720
you can do that by having a very focused
 

2147
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:37,829
you can do that by having a very focused
domain that you can operate in for

2148
00:35:37,829 --> 00:35:37,839
domain that you can operate in for
 

2149
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:39,109
domain that you can operate in for
example you're a customer support agent

2150
00:35:39,109 --> 00:35:39,119
example you're a customer support agent
 

2151
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:40,790
example you're a customer support agent
for a particular product and you create

2152
00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:40,800
for a particular product and you create
 

2153
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,230
for a particular product and you create
intelligence and a good interface around

2154
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:42,240
intelligence and a good interface around
 

2155
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,270
intelligence and a good interface around
that or uh you know kind of in the

2156
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:45,280
that or uh you know kind of in the
 

2157
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,109
that or uh you know kind of in the
personal companionship side you can't be

2158
00:35:47,109 --> 00:35:47,119
personal companionship side you can't be
 

2159
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:48,790
personal companionship side you can't be
everything to

2160
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:48,800
everything to
 

2161
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,069
everything to
across the board

2162
00:35:50,069 --> 00:35:50,079
across the board
 

2163
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:51,589
across the board
you you kind of solve those constraints

2164
00:35:51,589 --> 00:35:51,599
you you kind of solve those constraints
 

2165
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:53,829
you you kind of solve those constraints
and i think uh i think it's possible my

2166
00:35:53,829 --> 00:35:53,839
and i think uh i think it's possible my
 

2167
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:55,990
and i think uh i think it's possible my
my worry is like i

2168
00:35:55,990 --> 00:35:56,000
my worry is like i
 

2169
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,510
my worry is like i
right now i don't see anybody that has

2170
00:35:59,510 --> 00:35:59,520
right now i don't see anybody that has
 

2171
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,750
right now i don't see anybody that has
picked up on where kind of cosmo left

2172
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:01,760
picked up on where kind of cosmo left
 

2173
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,829
picked up on where kind of cosmo left
off yes and is pushing on it in the same

2174
00:36:03,829 --> 00:36:03,839
off yes and is pushing on it in the same
 

2175
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:05,270
off yes and is pushing on it in the same
way and so i don't know if it's a sort

2176
00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:05,280
way and so i don't know if it's a sort
 

2177
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,510
way and so i don't know if it's a sort
of thing where similar to like how you

2178
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:07,520
of thing where similar to like how you
 

2179
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,790
of thing where similar to like how you
know in dot com there were all these

2180
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:08,800
know in dot com there were all these
 

2181
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,870
know in dot com there were all these
concepts that we considered like you

2182
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:10,880
concepts that we considered like you
 

2183
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,870
concepts that we considered like you
know that didn't work out or like failed

2184
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:12,880
know that didn't work out or like failed
 

2185
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,470
know that didn't work out or like failed
or like were too early or whatnot and

2186
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:14,480
or like were too early or whatnot and
 

2187
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,069
or like were too early or whatnot and
then 20 years later you have these like

2188
00:36:16,069 --> 00:36:16,079
then 20 years later you have these like
 

2189
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:17,990
then 20 years later you have these like
incredible successes on almost the same

2190
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:18,000
incredible successes on almost the same
 

2191
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,670
incredible successes on almost the same
concept like it might be that sort of

2192
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:19,680
concept like it might be that sort of
 

2193
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,430
concept like it might be that sort of
thing where like there's another pass at

2194
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:21,440
thing where like there's another pass at
 

2195
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,589
thing where like there's another pass at
it that happens in five years or in 10

2196
00:36:23,589 --> 00:36:23,599
it that happens in five years or in 10
 

2197
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:26,870
it that happens in five years or in 10
years but um it does feel like that

2198
00:36:26,870 --> 00:36:26,880
years but um it does feel like that
 

2199
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,349
years but um it does feel like that
appreciation of that like that this the

2200
00:36:29,349 --> 00:36:29,359
appreciation of that like that this the
 

2201
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:31,270
appreciation of that like that this the
three like it's duel if you will between

2202
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:31,280
three like it's duel if you will between
 

2203
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,790
three like it's duel if you will between
like you know the hardware the ai and

2204
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:32,800
like you know the hardware the ai and
 

2205
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,510
like you know the hardware the ai and
the character um that balance it's hard

2206
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:35,520
the character um that balance it's hard
 

2207
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,230
the character um that balance it's hard
to

2208
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:36,240
to
 

2209
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,630
to
i'm not aware of of any pro anywhere

2210
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:38,640
i'm not aware of of any pro anywhere
 

2211
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,630
i'm not aware of of any pro anywhere
right now where like that same kind of

2212
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:40,640
right now where like that same kind of
 

2213
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,790
right now where like that same kind of
aggressive drive with the value on the

2214
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:42,800
aggressive drive with the value on the
 

2215
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,790
aggressive drive with the value on the
character is uh is happening and so to

2216
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:44,800
character is uh is happening and so to
 

2217
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:45,589
character is uh is happening and so to
me

2218
00:36:45,589 --> 00:36:45,599
me
 

2219
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:48,310
me
just a prediction exactly as you said

2220
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:48,320
just a prediction exactly as you said
 

2221
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,150
just a prediction exactly as you said
something that looks awfully a lot like

2222
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:50,160
something that looks awfully a lot like
 

2223
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,470
something that looks awfully a lot like
cosmo not in the actual physical form

2224
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:52,480
cosmo not in the actual physical form
 

2225
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,550
cosmo not in the actual physical form
but in the three-legged stool

2226
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:54,560
but in the three-legged stool
 

2227
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,390
but in the three-legged stool
something like that in some number of

2228
00:36:56,390 --> 00:36:56,400
something like that in some number of
 

2229
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,470
something like that in some number of
years would be a trillion dollar company

2230
00:36:58,470 --> 00:36:58,480
years would be a trillion dollar company
 

2231
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,790
years would be a trillion dollar company
i don't understand like it's obvious to

2232
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:00,800
i don't understand like it's obvious to
 

2233
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,790
i don't understand like it's obvious to
me yeah that

2234
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:02,800
me yeah that
 

2235
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,829
me yeah that
like

2236
00:37:03,829 --> 00:37:03,839
like
 

2237
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:06,870
like
character not just as robotic companions

2238
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:06,880
character not just as robotic companions
 

2239
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,589
character not just as robotic companions
but in all our computers they'll be

2240
00:37:09,589 --> 00:37:09,599
but in all our computers they'll be
 

2241
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:12,230
but in all our computers they'll be
there it's like uh

2242
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:12,240
there it's like uh
 

2243
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,710
there it's like uh
clippy was like

2244
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:14,720
clippy was like
 

2245
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,550
clippy was like
two legs of that stool or something like

2246
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:16,560
two legs of that stool or something like
 

2247
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,150
two legs of that stool or something like
that yeah i mean that those are all

2248
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:18,160
that yeah i mean that those are all
 

2249
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,829
that yeah i mean that those are all
different attempts and

2250
00:37:19,829 --> 00:37:19,839
different attempts and
 

2251
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:23,430
different attempts and
what's really confusing to me is they

2252
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:23,440
what's really confusing to me is they
 

2253
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,790
what's really confusing to me is they
they're born

2254
00:37:24,790 --> 00:37:24,800
they're born
 

2255
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,950
they're born
these attempts and they they everybody

2256
00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:26,960
these attempts and they they everybody
 

2257
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,630
these attempts and they they everybody
gets excited and for some reason they

2258
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:28,640
gets excited and for some reason they
 

2259
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,870
gets excited and for some reason they
die and then nobody else tries to pick

2260
00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:30,880
die and then nobody else tries to pick
 

2261
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:33,670
die and then nobody else tries to pick
it up and then maybe a few years later

2262
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:33,680
it up and then maybe a few years later
 

2263
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,910
it up and then maybe a few years later
a crazy guy like you comes comes around

2264
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:35,920
a crazy guy like you comes comes around
 

2265
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:39,270
a crazy guy like you comes comes around
with just enough brilliance and vision

2266
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:39,280
with just enough brilliance and vision
 

2267
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:42,470
with just enough brilliance and vision
to create this thing and it's born a lot

2268
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:42,480
to create this thing and it's born a lot
 

2269
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,069
to create this thing and it's born a lot
of people love it a lot of people get

2270
00:37:44,069 --> 00:37:44,079
of people love it a lot of people get
 

2271
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:46,150
of people love it a lot of people get
excited but maybe the timing is not

2272
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:46,160
excited but maybe the timing is not
 

2273
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,270
excited but maybe the timing is not
right yet

2274
00:37:47,270 --> 00:37:47,280
right yet
 

2275
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,670
right yet
and then and then when the timing is

2276
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:49,680
and then and then when the timing is
 

2277
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,670
and then and then when the timing is
right it just blows up and it just keeps

2278
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:51,680
right it just blows up and it just keeps
 

2279
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,990
right it just blows up and it just keeps
blowing up more and more until it just

2280
00:37:53,990 --> 00:37:54,000
blowing up more and more until it just
 

2281
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,630
blowing up more and more until it just
blows up and i guess everything in the

2282
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:56,640
blows up and i guess everything in the
 

2283
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:57,910
blows up and i guess everything in the
full span of human civilization

2284
00:37:57,910 --> 00:37:57,920
full span of human civilization
 

2285
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,670
full span of human civilization
collapses eventually

2286
00:37:59,670 --> 00:37:59,680
collapses eventually
 

2287
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,109
collapses eventually
and that wouldn't surprise me at all and

2288
00:38:01,109 --> 00:38:01,119
and that wouldn't surprise me at all and
 

2289
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:02,230
and that wouldn't surprise me at all and
like what's gonna be different in

2290
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:02,240
like what's gonna be different in
 

2291
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,550
like what's gonna be different in
another five years or ten years what not

2292
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:04,560
another five years or ten years what not
 

2293
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,710

that's happening in animation and you
know these other areas where um that is

2330
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:48,400
know these other areas where um that is
 

2331
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,870
know these other areas where um that is
that was a big unlock in um you know in

2332
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:50,880
that was a big unlock in um you know in
 

2333
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,190
that was a big unlock in um you know in
film obviously uh and so i think yeah

2334
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:53,200
film obviously uh and so i think yeah
 

2335
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,390
film obviously uh and so i think yeah
the pieces can reconnect and the

2336
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:54,400
the pieces can reconnect and the
 

2337
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,510
the pieces can reconnect and the
building blocks are actually gonna be

2338
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:55,520
building blocks are actually gonna be
 

2339
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,190
building blocks are actually gonna be
way more impressive than they were five

2340
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:57,200
way more impressive than they were five
 

2341
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,430
way more impressive than they were five
years ago so

2505
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,950
slow growth like you do in some other uh
consumer electronics industries and so

2506
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:34,960
consumer electronics industries and so
 

2507
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,390
consumer electronics industries and so
before then like hardware kind of like

2508
00:41:36,390 --> 00:41:36,400
before then like hardware kind of like
 

2509
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,390
before then like hardware kind of like
went out of favor too and so you had

2510
00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:38,400
went out of favor too and so you had
 

2511
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,309
went out of favor too and so you had
fitbit and gopro dropped from 10 billion

2512
00:41:40,309 --> 00:41:40,319
fitbit and gopro dropped from 10 billion

2515
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,790
revenue to 1 billion revenue and
hardware companies are getting valued at

2516
00:41:42,790 --> 00:41:42,800
hardware companies are getting valued at
 

2517
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,430
hardware companies are getting valued at
like 1x revenue oftentimes um which is

2518
00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:45,440
like 1x revenue oftentimes um which is
 

2519
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,510
like 1x revenue oftentimes um which is
tough right and so

2520
00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:47,520
tough right and so
 

2521
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,349
tough right and so
we effectively kind of got caught in the

2522
00:41:49,349 --> 00:41:49,359
we effectively kind of got caught in the
 

2523
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:51,430
we effectively kind of got caught in the
middle where we were trying to

2524
00:41:51,430 --> 00:41:51,440
middle where we were trying to
 

2525
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,510
middle where we were trying to
quickly evolve out of entertainment and

2526
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:53,520
quickly evolve out of entertainment and
 

2527
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,670
quickly evolve out of entertainment and
move into some other categories but you

2528
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:55,680
move into some other categories but you
 

2529
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,190
move into some other categories but you
can't let go of that business because

2530
00:41:57,190 --> 00:41:57,200
can't let go of that business because
 

2531
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,470
can't let go of that business because
like that's what you're valued on that's

2532
00:41:58,470 --> 00:41:58,480
like that's what you're valued on that's
 

2533
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,309
like that's what you're valued on that's
what you're raising money on um but

2534
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:00,319
what you're raising money on um but
 

2535
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:01,750
what you're raising money on um but
there's no path to prop kind of pure

2536
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:01,760
there's no path to prop kind of pure
 

2537
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:04,069
there's no path to prop kind of pure
profitability just there because it was

2538
00:42:04,069 --> 00:42:04,079
profitability just there because it was
 

2539
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:06,630
profitability just there because it was
you know such you know uh specific type

2540
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:06,640
you know such you know uh specific type
 

2541
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,630
you know such you know uh specific type
of price points and so forth and so

2542
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:08,640
of price points and so forth and so
 

2543
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:09,430
of price points and so forth and so
um

2544
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:09,440
um
 

2545
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,349
um
we tried really hard to make that

2546
00:42:11,349 --> 00:42:11,359
we tried really hard to make that
 

2547
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:13,990
we tried really hard to make that
transition and um yeah we had a

2548
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:14,000
transition and um yeah we had a
 

2549
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,349
transition and um yeah we had a
financing round that fell apart at the

2550
00:42:15,349 --> 00:42:15,359
financing round that fell apart at the
 

2551
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:16,710
financing round that fell apart at the
last second and effectively there was

2552
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:16,720
last second and effectively there was
 

2553
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:19,670
last second and effectively there was
just no path to kind of get through that

2554
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:19,680
just no path to kind of get through that
 

2555
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,349
just no path to kind of get through that
and get to the next kind of like holiday

2556
00:42:21,349 --> 00:42:21,359
and get to the next kind of like holiday
 

2557
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:23,670
and get to the next kind of like holiday
season and so we ended up um

2558
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:23,680

success and it it failing was
 

2801
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:22,950
success and it it failing was
i don't know there was heartbreak on

2802
00:46:22,950 --> 00:46:22,960
i don't know there was heartbreak on
 

2803
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:25,270
i don't know there was heartbreak on
many levels for me just as an external

2804
00:46:25,270 --> 00:46:25,280
many levels for me just as an external
 

2805
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:26,950
many levels for me just as an external
observer

2806

observer
 

2807
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:29,589
observer
is i was thinking how hard is it to run

2808
00:46:29,589 --> 00:46:29,599
is i was thinking how hard is it to run
 

2809
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:30,710
is i was thinking how hard is it to run
a business

2810
00:46:30,710 --> 00:46:30,720
a business
 

2811
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:32,150
a business
that's that's what i was thinking like

2812
00:46:32,150 --> 00:46:32,160
that's that's what i was thinking like
 

2813
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:33,910
that's that's what i was thinking like
if this failed this must have failed

2814
00:46:33,910 --> 00:46:33,920
if this failed this must have failed
 

2815
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:37,270
if this failed this must have failed
because uh it's obviously not like

2816

2821
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:42,950
it's some aspect of the manufacturing
and so on but i'm now realizing it's

2822
00:46:42,950 --> 00:46:42,960
and so on but i'm now realizing it's
 

2823
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:45,030
and so on but i'm now realizing it's
also not just that it's

2824
00:46:45,030 --> 00:46:45,040
also not just that it's
 

2825
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:45,910
also not just that it's
yeah

2826
00:46:45,910 --> 00:46:45,920

00:47:31,829 --> 00:47:31,839
that came on board and like you know
 

2877
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:33,990
that came on board and like you know
really great people there the ai side

2878
00:47:33,990 --> 00:47:34,000
really great people there the ai side
 

2879
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,829
really great people there the ai side
the um uh

2880
00:47:35,829 --> 00:47:35,839
the um uh
 

2881
00:47:35,839 --> 00:47:39,510
the um uh
the manufacturing the you know where um

2882
00:47:39,510 --> 00:47:39,520
the manufacturing the you know where um
 

2883
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:41,109
the manufacturing the you know where um
like never missing a launch right and

2884
00:47:41,109 --> 00:47:41,119
like never missing a launch right and
 

2885
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:42,309
like never missing a launch right and
actually you know he kind of hitting

2886
00:47:42,309 --> 00:47:42,319
actually you know he kind of hitting
 

2887
00:47:42,319 --> 00:47:44,230
actually you know he kind of hitting
that quality was um yeah it was it was

2888
00:47:44,230 --> 00:47:44,240
that quality was um yeah it was it was
 

2889
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:46,870
that quality was um yeah it was it was
heartbreaking but uh

2890
00:47:46,870 --> 00:47:46,880
heartbreaking but uh
 

2891
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:48,630
heartbreaking but uh
here's one neat thing is like we we had

2892
00:47:48,630 --> 00:47:48,640
here's one neat thing is like we we had
 

2893
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:51,030
here's one neat thing is like we we had
so much like fan mail from kind of kids

2894
00:47:51,030 --> 00:47:51,040
so much like fan mail from kind of kids
 

2895
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:53,030
so much like fan mail from kind of kids
parents like i actually like there was a

2896
00:47:53,030 --> 00:47:53,040
parents like i actually like there was a
 

2897
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:54,870
parents like i actually like there was a
bunch they collected in the end yeah

2898
00:47:54,870 --> 00:47:54,880
bunch they collected in the end yeah
 

2899
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:57,190
bunch they collected in the end yeah
that um i actually saved and like i

2900
00:47:57,190 --> 00:47:57,200
that um i actually saved and like i
 

2901
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:58,870
that um i actually saved and like i
never it was too emotional to open it

2902
00:47:58,870 --> 00:47:58,880
never it was too emotional to open it
 

2903
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:00,870
never it was too emotional to open it
and i still haven't opened it um and so

2904
00:48:00,870 --> 00:48:00,880
and i still haven't opened it um and so
 

2905
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:02,230
and i still haven't opened it um and so
i actually have this giant envelope of

2906
00:48:02,230 --> 00:48:02,240
i actually have this giant envelope of
 

2907
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:03,990
i actually have this giant envelope of
like a stack this much of like letters

2908
00:48:03,990 --> 00:48:04,000
like a stack this much of like letters
 

2909
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,390
like a stack this much of like letters
from you know kids and families just

2910
00:48:06,390 --> 00:48:06,400
from you know kids and families just
 

2911
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:07,990
from you know kids and families just
like every you know perpetration

2912
00:48:07,990 --> 00:48:08,000
like every you know perpetration
 

2913
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,670
like every you know perpetration
permutation you can imagine and so

2914
00:48:09,670 --> 00:48:09,680
permutation you can imagine and so
 

2915
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:10,950
permutation you can imagine and so
planning to kind of i don't know maybe

2916
00:48:10,950 --> 00:48:10,960
planning to kind of i don't know maybe
 

2917
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:12,870
planning to kind of i don't know maybe
like a five year you know five year

2918
00:48:12,870 --> 00:48:12,880
like a five year you know five year
 

2919
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:14,630
like a five year you know five year
eight some year reunion just inviting

2920
00:48:14,630 --> 00:48:14,640
eight some year reunion just inviting
 

2921
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:16,390
eight some year reunion just inviting
everybody over and we'll just like kind

2922
00:48:16,390 --> 00:48:16,400
everybody over and we'll just like kind
 

2923
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,150
everybody over and we'll just like kind
of dig into it and um kind of bring back

2924
00:48:18,150 --> 00:48:18,160
of dig into it and um kind of bring back
 

2925
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:20,549
of dig into it and um kind of bring back
some memories but um you know good

2926
00:48:20,549 --> 00:48:20,559
some memories but um you know good
 

2927
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:23,030
some memories but um you know good
impact and uh um well i i think there

2928
00:48:23,030 --> 00:48:23,040
impact and uh um well i i think there
 

2929
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:26,390
impact and uh um well i i think there
will be companies uh maybe waymo and

2930
00:48:26,390 --> 00:48:26,400
will be companies uh maybe waymo and
 

2931
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:28,390
will be companies uh maybe waymo and
google will be somehow involved that

2932
00:48:28,390 --> 00:48:28,400
google will be somehow involved that
 

2933
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:31,510
google will be somehow involved that
will carry this flag forward and will uh

2934
00:48:31,510 --> 00:48:31,520
will carry this flag forward and will uh
 

2935
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:33,349
will carry this flag forward and will uh
will make you proud whether you're

2936
00:48:33,349 --> 00:48:33,359
will make you proud whether you're
 

2937
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:35,670
will make you proud whether you're
involved or not i think this is one of

2938
00:48:35,670 --> 00:48:35,680
involved or not i think this is one of
 

2939
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:37,670
involved or not i think this is one of
the greatest robotics companies in the

2940
00:48:37,670 --> 00:48:37,680
the greatest robotics companies in the
 

2941
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:41,030
the greatest robotics companies in the
history of robotics so you should be

2942
00:48:41,030 --> 00:48:41,040
history of robotics so you should be
 

2943
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:44,230
history of robotics so you should be
proud it's still tragic to know that

2944
00:48:44,230 --> 00:48:44,240
proud it's still tragic to know that
 

2945
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:45,990
proud it's still tragic to know that
you know because you read all the

2946
00:48:45,990 --> 00:48:46,000
you know because you read all the
 

2947
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,430
you know because you read all the
stories of apple and and

2948
00:48:49,430 --> 00:48:49,440
stories of apple and and
 

2949
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:53,750
stories of apple and and
let's see spacex and like companies that

2950
00:48:53,750 --> 00:48:53,760
let's see spacex and like companies that
 

2951
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:55,670
let's see spacex and like companies that
were just on the verge of failure

2952
00:48:55,670 --> 00:48:55,680
were just on the verge of failure
 

2953
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:57,430
were just on the verge of failure
several times through that story and

2954
00:48:57,430 --> 00:48:57,440
several times through that story and
 

2955
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:59,349
several times through that story and
they just it's almost like a roll of the

2956
00:48:59,349 --> 00:48:59,359
they just it's almost like a roll of the
 

2957
00:48:59,359 --> 00:49:01,510
they just it's almost like a roll of the
diet they succeeded and here's the role

2958
00:49:01,510 --> 00:49:01,520
diet they succeeded and here's the role
 

2959
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:04,069
diet they succeeded and here's the role
of the dice that just happened to go

2960
00:49:04,069 --> 00:49:04,079
of the dice that just happened to go
 

2961
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:05,430
of the dice that just happened to go
and that's the appreciation that like

2962
00:49:05,430 --> 00:49:05,440
and that's the appreciation that like
 

2963
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:06,870
and that's the appreciation that like
when you really like talk to a lot of

2964
00:49:06,870 --> 00:49:06,880
when you really like talk to a lot of
 

2965
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:07,750
when you really like talk to a lot of
the

2966
00:49:07,750 --> 00:49:07,760
the
 

2967
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:09,190
the
founders like everybody goes through

2968
00:49:09,190 --> 00:49:09,200
founders like everybody goes through
 

2969
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:11,510
founders like everybody goes through
those moments and sometimes it really is

2970
00:49:11,510 --> 00:49:11,520
those moments and sometimes it really is
 

2971
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:13,589
those moments and sometimes it really is
a matter of like you know timing a

2972
00:49:13,589 --> 00:49:13,599
a matter of like you know timing a
 

2973
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:15,190
a matter of like you know timing a
little bit of luck like some things are

2974
00:49:15,190 --> 00:49:15,200
little bit of luck like some things are
 

2975
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:17,670
little bit of luck like some things are
just out of your control and um

2976
00:49:17,670 --> 00:49:17,680
just out of your control and um
 

2977
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:19,589
just out of your control and um
uh and you you get a much deeper

2978
00:49:19,589 --> 00:49:19,599
uh and you you get a much deeper
 

2979
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:22,069
uh and you you get a much deeper
appreciation for um just the

2980
00:49:22,069 --> 00:49:22,079
appreciation for um just the
 

2981
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:24,230
appreciation for um just the
dimensionality of of that challenge but

2982
00:49:24,230 --> 00:49:24,240
dimensionality of of that challenge but
 

2983
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:26,230
dimensionality of of that challenge but
um the great thing is that like a lot of

2984
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:26,240
um the great thing is that like a lot of
 

2985
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:27,750
um the great thing is that like a lot of
the team actually like stayed together

2986
00:49:27,750 --> 00:49:27,760
the team actually like stayed together
 

2987
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:30,470
the team actually like stayed together
and so um they were actually a couple of

2988
00:49:30,470 --> 00:49:30,480
and so um they were actually a couple of
 

2989
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:32,390
and so um they were actually a couple of
companies that we we kind of kept big

2990
00:49:32,390 --> 00:49:32,400
companies that we we kind of kept big
 

2991
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:33,510
companies that we we kind of kept big
chunks of the team together and we

2992
00:49:33,510 --> 00:49:33,520
chunks of the team together and we
 

2993
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:35,910
chunks of the team together and we
actually kind of helped align this uh um

2994
00:49:35,910 --> 00:49:35,920
actually kind of helped align this uh um
 

2995
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:38,150
actually kind of helped align this uh um
you know to help people out as well um

2996
00:49:38,150 --> 00:49:38,160
you know to help people out as well um
 

2997
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:40,549
you know to help people out as well um
and one of them was waymo where uh

2998
00:49:40,549 --> 00:49:40,559
and one of them was waymo where uh
 

2999
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:44,230
and one of them was waymo where uh
a majority of the ai and robotics team

3000
00:49:44,230 --> 00:49:44,240
a majority of the ai and robotics team
 

3001
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:46,710
a majority of the ai and robotics team
actually had the exact background uh

3002
00:49:46,710 --> 00:49:46,720
actually had the exact background uh
 

3003
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:47,910
actually had the exact background uh
that you would look for in like kind of

3004
00:49:47,910 --> 00:49:47,920
that you would look for in like kind of
 

3005
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:49,510
that you would look for in like kind of
a b space it was a space that a lot of

3006
00:49:49,510 --> 00:49:49,520
a b space it was a space that a lot of
 

3007
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:52,069
a b space it was a space that a lot of
us like you know were you know worked on

3008
00:49:52,069 --> 00:49:52,079
us like you know were you know worked on
 

3009
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:53,430
us like you know were you know worked on
in grad school were always passionate

3010
00:49:53,430 --> 00:49:53,440
in grad school were always passionate
 

3011
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:55,829
in grad school were always passionate
about and ended up uh you know maybe the

3012
00:49:55,829 --> 00:49:55,839
about and ended up uh you know maybe the
 

3013
00:49:55,839 --> 00:49:57,190
about and ended up uh you know maybe the
time you know

3014
00:49:57,190 --> 00:49:57,200
time you know
 

3015
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:58,549
time you know
serendipitous timings from another

3016
00:49:58,549 --> 00:49:58,559
serendipitous timings from another
 

3017
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:01,270
serendipitous timings from another
perspective where like uh um kind of

3018
00:50:01,270 --> 00:50:01,280
perspective where like uh um kind of
 

3019
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:02,950
perspective where like uh um kind of
landed in a really unique um

3020
00:50:02,950 --> 00:50:02,960
landed in a really unique um
 

3021
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:04,230
landed in a really unique um
circumstance it's actually been quite

3022
00:50:04,230 --> 00:50:04,240
circumstance it's actually been quite
 

3023
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:05,750
circumstance it's actually been quite
exciting too

3024
00:50:05,750 --> 00:50:05,760
exciting too
 

3025
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:07,990
exciting too
so it's interesting to ask you just your

3026
00:50:07,990 --> 00:50:08,000
so it's interesting to ask you just your
 

3027
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,950
so it's interesting to ask you just your
thoughts uh cosmo still lives on

3028
00:50:10,950 --> 00:50:10,960
thoughts uh cosmo still lives on
 

3029
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:13,589
thoughts uh cosmo still lives on
under dream labs i think

3030
00:50:13,589 --> 00:50:13,599
under dream labs i think
 

3031
00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:15,190
under dream labs i think
is that

3032
00:50:15,190 --> 00:50:15,200
is that
 

3033
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:17,030
is that
are you tracking the progress there or

3034
00:50:17,030 --> 00:50:17,040
are you tracking the progress there or
 

3035
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:19,349
are you tracking the progress there or
is it too much pain

3036
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:19,359
is it too much pain
 

3037
00:50:19,359 --> 00:50:21,270
is it too much pain
is it are you is that something that

3038
00:50:21,270 --> 00:50:21,280
is it are you is that something that
 

3039
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:23,990
is it are you is that something that
you're excited to see where that goes

3040
00:50:23,990 --> 00:50:24,000
you're excited to see where that goes
 

3041
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,069
you're excited to see where that goes
so keeping an eye on it of course just

3042
00:50:26,069 --> 00:50:26,079
so keeping an eye on it of course just
 

3043
00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:27,670
so keeping an eye on it of course just
out of your curiosity and obviously just

3044
00:50:27,670 --> 00:50:27,680
out of your curiosity and obviously just
 

3045
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:30,150
out of your curiosity and obviously just
kind of care for product line i think um

3046
00:50:30,150 --> 00:50:30,160
kind of care for product line i think um
 

3047
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:31,670
kind of care for product line i think um
it's deceptive how complex it is to

3048
00:50:31,670 --> 00:50:31,680
it's deceptive how complex it is to
 

3049
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:34,710
it's deceptive how complex it is to
manufacture and evolve that product line

3050
00:50:34,710 --> 00:50:34,720
manufacture and evolve that product line
 

3051
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:38,150
manufacture and evolve that product line
um and the amount of

3052
00:50:38,150 --> 00:50:38,160
um and the amount of
 

3053
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:41,349
um and the amount of
experiences that are required to

3054
00:50:41,349 --> 00:50:41,359
experiences that are required to
 

3055
00:50:41,359 --> 00:50:42,710
experiences that are required to
complete the picture and be able to move

3056
00:50:42,710 --> 00:50:42,720
complete the picture and be able to move
 

3057
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:44,150
complete the picture and be able to move
that forward and i think that's going to

3058
00:50:44,150 --> 00:50:44,160
that forward and i think that's going to
 

3059
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:46,470
that forward and i think that's going to
make it pretty hard to do something

3060
00:50:46,470 --> 00:50:46,480
make it pretty hard to do something
 

3061
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:48,710
make it pretty hard to do something
really substantial with it it would be

3062
00:50:48,710 --> 00:50:48,720
really substantial with it it would be
 

3063
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:50,230
really substantial with it it would be
cool if like even the product in the way

3064
00:50:50,230 --> 00:50:50,240
cool if like even the product in the way
 

3065
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:52,309
cool if like even the product in the way
it was was able to be manufactured yes

3066
00:50:52,309 --> 00:50:52,319
it was was able to be manufactured yes
 

3067
00:50:52,319 --> 00:50:54,309
it was was able to be manufactured yes
again that would be

3068
00:50:54,309 --> 00:50:54,319
again that would be
 

3069
00:50:54,319 --> 00:50:56,950
again that would be
yeah which would be neat um but uh it's

3070
00:50:56,950 --> 00:50:56,960
yeah which would be neat um but uh it's
 

3071
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:59,190
yeah which would be neat um but uh it's
i think it was it's deceptive how tricky

3072
00:50:59,190 --> 00:50:59,200
i think it was it's deceptive how tricky
 

3073
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:01,510
i think it was it's deceptive how tricky
that is on like everything from the

3074
00:51:01,510 --> 00:51:01,520
that is on like everything from the
 

3075
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:03,750
that is on like everything from the
quality control the details and um and

3076
00:51:03,750 --> 00:51:03,760
quality control the details and um and
 

3077
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:05,990
quality control the details and um and
then like technology changes that forces

3078
00:51:05,990 --> 00:51:06,000
then like technology changes that forces
 

3079
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,109
then like technology changes that forces
you to rick

3080
00:51:07,109 --> 00:51:07,119
you to rick
 

3081
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:10,069
you to rick
reinvent and update certain things um so

3082
00:51:10,069 --> 00:51:10,079
reinvent and update certain things um so
 

3083
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:12,150
reinvent and update certain things um so
uh i haven't been super close to it but

3084
00:51:12,150 --> 00:51:12,160
uh i haven't been super close to it but
 

3085
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:13,670
uh i haven't been super close to it but
just kind of keeping an eye on it yeah

3086
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:13,680
just kind of keeping an eye on it yeah
 

3087
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:15,990
just kind of keeping an eye on it yeah
it's really interesting how

3088
00:51:15,990 --> 00:51:16,000
it's really interesting how
 

3089
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,750
it's really interesting how
it's deceptively difficult just as

3090
00:51:17,750 --> 00:51:17,760
it's deceptively difficult just as
 

3091
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:20,230
it's deceptively difficult just as
you're saying for example

3092
00:51:20,230 --> 00:51:20,240
you're saying for example
 

3093
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:23,109
you're saying for example
those same folks uh and i've spoken with

3094

them they're
they partnered up with rick and morty uh

3098
00:51:28,069 --> 00:51:28,079
they partnered up with rick and morty uh
 

3099
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:30,309
they partnered up with rick and morty uh
creators to uh to do the butter robot

3100
00:51:30,309 --> 00:51:30,319
creators to uh to do the butter robot
 

3101
00:51:30,319 --> 00:51:33,670
creators to uh to do the butter robot
yes i love the idea i just recently

3102

show is and obviously i think in season
 

3115
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:48,549
show is and obviously i think in season
one is where the butter robot comes

3116
00:51:48,549 --> 00:51:48,559
one is where the butter robot comes
 

3117
00:51:48,559 --> 00:51:51,750
one is where the butter robot comes
along for just a few minutes or whatever

3118

a robot
 

3133
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:05,430
a robot
who's doing a particular task

3134

who's doing a particular task
 

3135

3153
00:52:23,359 --> 00:52:25,270
that realization that's a that's a
beautiful little realization for a robot

3154
00:52:25,270 --> 00:52:25,280
beautiful little realization for a robot
 

3155
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:27,670
beautiful little realization for a robot
that my purpose is very

3156
00:52:27,670 --> 00:52:27,680
that my purpose is very
 

3157
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:29,670
that my purpose is very
limited with this particular task it's

3158
00:52:29,670 --> 00:52:29,680
limited with this particular task it's
 

3159
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:31,990
limited with this particular task it's
abuse it's humor of course it's darkness

3160
00:52:31,990 --> 00:52:32,000
abuse it's humor of course it's darkness
 

3161
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,549
abuse it's humor of course it's darkness
it's a beautiful mix but so they want to

3162
00:52:34,549 --> 00:52:34,559
it's a beautiful mix but so they want to
 

3163
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:37,030
it's a beautiful mix but so they want to
release that butter robot

3164
00:52:37,030 --> 00:52:37,040
release that butter robot
 

3165
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:40,549
release that butter robot
but something tells me

3166
00:52:40,549 --> 00:52:40,559

 

3167
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:43,349

that to do the same depth of personality

3168
00:52:43,349 --> 00:52:43,359
that to do the same depth of personality
 

3169
00:52:43,359 --> 00:52:45,990
that to do the same depth of personality
as cosmo had the same richness it would

3170
00:52:45,990 --> 00:52:46,000
as cosmo had the same richness it would
 

3171
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,430
as cosmo had the same richness it would
be on the manufacturing on the ai

00:52:49,430 --> 00:52:49,440
be on the manufacturing on the ai
 

3173
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:51,510
be on the manufacturing on the ai
on the storytelling on the design it's

on the storytelling on the design it's
 

3175
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:53,510
on the storytelling on the design it's
going to be very very difficult it could

3176
00:52:53,510 --> 00:52:53,520
going to be very very difficult it could
 

3177
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:56,630
going to be very very difficult it could
be a cool sort of uh toy

3178
00:52:56,630 --> 00:52:56,640
be a cool sort of uh toy
 

3179
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:58,390
be a cool sort of uh toy
for rick and morty fans

3180
00:52:58,390 --> 00:52:58,400
for rick and morty fans
 

3181
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:02,549
for rick and morty fans
but to create the same depth of

3182
00:53:02,549 --> 00:53:02,559
but to create the same depth of
 

3183
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:05,829
but to create the same depth of
existential angst yeah that the butter

3184
00:53:05,829 --> 00:53:05,839
existential angst yeah that the butter
 

3185
00:53:05,839 --> 00:53:08,470
existential angst yeah that the butter
robot symbolizes is is really

3186
00:53:08,470 --> 00:53:08,480
robot symbolizes is is really
 

3187
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:11,030
robot symbolizes is is really
that's the brave effort you succeeded at

3188
00:53:11,030 --> 00:53:11,040
that's the brave effort you succeeded at
 

3189
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:13,670
that's the brave effort you succeeded at
with cosmo but it's not easy it's really

3190
00:53:13,670 --> 00:53:13,680
with cosmo but it's not easy it's really
 

3191
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:14,870
with cosmo but it's not easy it's really
studies and

3192
00:53:14,870 --> 00:53:14,880
studies and
 

3193
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:16,710
studies and
you can fail on almost any one of the

3194
00:53:16,710 --> 00:53:16,720
you can fail on almost any one of the
 

3195
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:19,270
you can fail on almost any one of the
kind of dimensions and like uh and yeah

3196
00:53:19,270 --> 00:53:19,280
kind of dimensions and like uh and yeah
 

3197
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:20,790
kind of dimensions and like uh and yeah
it takes you know

3198
00:53:20,790 --> 00:53:20,800
it takes you know
 

3199
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:22,150
it takes you know
yeah unique convergence of a lot of

3200
00:53:22,150 --> 00:53:22,160
yeah unique convergence of a lot of
 

3201
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:24,309
yeah unique convergence of a lot of
different skill sets to try to pull that

3202
00:53:24,309 --> 00:53:24,319
different skill sets to try to pull that
 

3203
00:53:24,319 --> 00:53:25,829
different skill sets to try to pull that
off yeah

3204
00:53:25,829 --> 00:53:25,839
off yeah
 

3205
00:53:25,839 --> 00:53:27,510
off yeah
on this topic let me ask you for some

3206
00:53:27,510 --> 00:53:27,520
on this topic let me ask you for some
 

3207
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:28,630
on this topic let me ask you for some
advice

3208
00:53:28,630 --> 00:53:28,640
advice
 

3209
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:30,549
advice
because uh as i've been watching rick

3210
00:53:30,549 --> 00:53:30,559
because uh as i've been watching rick
 

3211
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:33,270
because uh as i've been watching rick
and morty i i told myself i have to

3212
00:53:33,270 --> 00:53:33,280
and morty i i told myself i have to
 

3213
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:35,349
and morty i i told myself i have to
build the butter robot just as a hobby

3214
00:53:35,349 --> 00:53:35,359
build the butter robot just as a hobby
 

3215
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:37,990
build the butter robot just as a hobby
project and so uh i got a nice platform

3216
00:53:37,990 --> 00:53:38,000
project and so uh i got a nice platform
 

3217
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,510
project and so uh i got a nice platform
for it with treads and and there's a

3218
00:53:39,510 --> 00:53:39,520
for it with treads and and there's a
 

3219
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:42,150
for it with treads and and there's a
camera that moves up and down and so on

3220
00:53:42,150 --> 00:53:42,160
camera that moves up and down and so on
 

3221
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:44,790
camera that moves up and down and so on
um i'll probably paint it

3222
00:53:44,790 --> 00:53:44,800
um i'll probably paint it
 

3223
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:46,549
um i'll probably paint it
but

3224
00:53:46,549 --> 00:53:46,559
but
 

3225
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:48,549
but
the question i'd like to ask there's

3226
00:53:48,549 --> 00:53:48,559
the question i'd like to ask there's
 

3227
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:50,150
the question i'd like to ask there's
obvious technical questions i'm fine

3228
00:53:50,150 --> 00:53:50,160
obvious technical questions i'm fine
 

3229
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:52,309
obvious technical questions i'm fine
with communication the personality

3230
00:53:52,309 --> 00:53:52,319
with communication the personality
 

3231
00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:55,349
with communication the personality
storytelling all those kinds of things

3232
00:53:55,349 --> 00:53:55,359
storytelling all those kinds of things
 

3233
00:53:55,359 --> 00:53:57,109
storytelling all those kinds of things
i think i understand the process of that

3234
00:53:57,109 --> 00:53:57,119
i think i understand the process of that
 

3235
00:53:57,119 --> 00:54:01,030
i think i understand the process of that
but how do you know

3236
00:54:01,030 --> 00:54:01,040

 

3237
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:02,630

when you got it right

3238
00:54:02,630 --> 00:54:02,640
when you got it right
 

3239
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:05,670
when you got it right
so with with cosmo how did you know

3240
00:54:05,670 --> 00:54:05,680
so with with cosmo how did you know
 

3241
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:08,630
so with with cosmo how did you know
this is great like or um something is

3242
00:54:08,630 --> 00:54:08,640
this is great like or um something is
 

3243
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:11,190
this is great like or um something is
off like yeah is this brainstorming with

3244
00:54:11,190 --> 00:54:11,200
off like yeah is this brainstorming with
 

3245
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:12,230
off like yeah is this brainstorming with
the team

3246
00:54:12,230 --> 00:54:12,240
the team
 

3247
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:13,829
the team
do you know it when you see it is it

3248
00:54:13,829 --> 00:54:13,839
do you know it when you see it is it
 

3249
00:54:13,839 --> 00:54:14,790
do you know it when you see it is it
like

3250
00:54:14,790 --> 00:54:14,800
like
 

3251
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:16,470
like
love at first sight it's like this is

3252
00:54:16,470 --> 00:54:16,480
love at first sight it's like this is
 

3253
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:19,510
love at first sight it's like this is
right or like i guess if we think of it

3254
00:54:19,510 --> 00:54:19,520
right or like i guess if we think of it
 

3255
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:21,910
right or like i guess if we think of it
as an optimization space

3256
00:54:21,910 --> 00:54:21,920
as an optimization space
 

3257
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:24,069
as an optimization space
is there uncanny valley we're like

3258
00:54:24,069 --> 00:54:24,079
is there uncanny valley we're like
 

3259
00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:26,549
is there uncanny valley we're like
that's not right or this is right or are

3260
00:54:26,549 --> 00:54:26,559
that's not right or this is right or are
 

3261
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:28,710
that's not right or this is right or are
a lot of characters right yeah

3262
00:54:28,710 --> 00:54:28,720
a lot of characters right yeah
 

3263
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:30,470
a lot of characters right yeah
we stayed away from uncanny valley just

3264
00:54:30,470 --> 00:54:30,480
we stayed away from uncanny valley just
 

3265
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:32,870
we stayed away from uncanny valley just
by having such a different what like

3266
00:54:32,870 --> 00:54:32,880
by having such a different what like
 

3267
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:34,950
by having such a different what like
mapping where it didn't try to look like

3268
00:54:34,950 --> 00:54:34,960
mapping where it didn't try to look like
 

3269
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:37,109
mapping where it didn't try to look like
a dog or a human or anything like that

3270
00:54:37,109 --> 00:54:37,119
a dog or a human or anything like that
 

3271
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:38,789
a dog or a human or anything like that
and so uh

3272
00:54:38,789 --> 00:54:38,799
and so uh
 

3273
00:54:38,799 --> 00:54:41,589
and so uh
you avoided having like a weird pseudo

3274
00:54:41,589 --> 00:54:41,599
you avoided having like a weird pseudo
 

3275
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:42,950
you avoided having like a weird pseudo
similarity but not quite hitting the

3276
00:54:42,950 --> 00:54:42,960
similarity but not quite hitting the
 

3277
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:45,109
similarity but not quite hitting the
mark um but you could like just fall

3278
00:54:45,109 --> 00:54:45,119
mark um but you could like just fall
 

3279
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:47,030
mark um but you could like just fall
flat where just like a personality or a

3280
00:54:47,030 --> 00:54:47,040
flat where just like a personality or a
 

3281
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:48,470
flat where just like a personality or a
you know character emotion just didn't

3282
00:54:48,470 --> 00:54:48,480
you know character emotion just didn't
 

3283
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:50,390
you know character emotion just didn't
feel right and so it actually mirrored

3284
00:54:50,390 --> 00:54:50,400
feel right and so it actually mirrored
 

3285
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:51,829
feel right and so it actually mirrored
very closely to kind of the iterations

3286
00:54:51,829 --> 00:54:51,839
very closely to kind of the iterations
 

3287
00:54:51,839 --> 00:54:53,190
very closely to kind of the iterations
that a character director of pixar would

3288
00:54:53,190 --> 00:54:53,200
that a character director of pixar would
 

3289
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:54,789
that a character director of pixar would
have where you're

3290
00:54:54,789 --> 00:54:54,799
have where you're
 

3291
00:54:54,799 --> 00:54:57,589
have where you're
running through it and you can virtually

3292
00:54:57,589 --> 00:54:57,599
running through it and you can virtually
 

3293
00:54:57,599 --> 00:54:59,990
running through it and you can virtually
kind of like see what it'll look like we

3294
00:54:59,990 --> 00:55:00,000
kind of like see what it'll look like we
 

3295
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,910
kind of like see what it'll look like we
we created a plug-in to where we

3296
00:55:01,910 --> 00:55:01,920
we created a plug-in to where we
 

3297
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:04,230
we created a plug-in to where we
actually used like like maya the sim you

3298
00:55:04,230 --> 00:55:04,240
actually used like like maya the sim you
 

3299
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:05,589
actually used like like maya the sim you
know the animation tools and then we

3300
00:55:05,589 --> 00:55:05,599
know the animation tools and then we
 

3301
00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:07,190
know the animation tools and then we
created a plug-in that

3302
00:55:07,190 --> 00:55:07,200
created a plug-in that
 

3303
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:08,230
created a plug-in that
perfectly

3304
00:55:08,230 --> 00:55:08,240
perfectly
 

3305
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:10,230
perfectly
matched it uh to the physical one and so

3306
00:55:10,230 --> 00:55:10,240
matched it uh to the physical one and so
 

3307
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:11,829
matched it uh to the physical one and so
you could like test it out virtually and

3308
00:55:11,829 --> 00:55:11,839
you could like test it out virtually and
 

3309
00:55:11,839 --> 00:55:14,150
you could like test it out virtually and
then push a button and see it physically

3310
00:55:14,150 --> 00:55:14,160
then push a button and see it physically
 

3311
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:15,349
then push a button and see it physically
play out and there's like subtle

3312
00:55:15,349 --> 00:55:15,359
play out and there's like subtle
 

3313
00:55:15,359 --> 00:55:16,710
play out and there's like subtle
differences and so you want to like make

3314
00:55:16,710 --> 00:55:16,720
differences and so you want to like make
 

3315
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:18,309
differences and so you want to like make
sure that that feedback loop is super

3316
00:55:18,309 --> 00:55:18,319
sure that that feedback loop is super
 

3317
00:55:18,319 --> 00:55:20,549
sure that that feedback loop is super
easy to be able to test it live

3318
00:55:20,549 --> 00:55:20,559
easy to be able to test it live
 

3319
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:23,190
easy to be able to test it live
um and then sometimes like

3320
00:55:23,190 --> 00:55:23,200
um and then sometimes like
 

3321
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:25,510
um and then sometimes like
you would just feel it that it's right

3322
00:55:25,510 --> 00:55:25,520
you would just feel it that it's right
 

3323
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:27,349
you would just feel it that it's right
and intuitively no and then you'd also

3324
00:55:27,349 --> 00:55:27,359
and intuitively no and then you'd also
 

3325
00:55:27,359 --> 00:55:29,829
and intuitively no and then you'd also
do we did user testing but

3326
00:55:29,829 --> 00:55:29,839
do we did user testing but
 

3327
00:55:29,839 --> 00:55:32,390
do we did user testing but
it was very very often that like the

3328
00:55:32,390 --> 00:55:32,400
it was very very often that like the
 

3329
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:34,789
it was very very often that like the
into like if we found it magical it

3330
00:55:34,789 --> 00:55:34,799
into like if we found it magical it
 

3331
00:55:34,799 --> 00:55:36,870
into like if we found it magical it
would scale and be magical uh more

3332
00:55:36,870 --> 00:55:36,880
would scale and be magical uh more
 

3333
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:38,549
would scale and be magical uh more
broadly there were not too many cases

3334
00:55:38,549 --> 00:55:38,559
broadly there were not too many cases
 

3335
00:55:38,559 --> 00:55:39,670
broadly there were not too many cases
where like

3336
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:39,680
where like
 

3337
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:41,109
where like
like we were pretty decent about not

3338
00:55:41,109 --> 00:55:41,119
like we were pretty decent about not
 

3339
00:55:41,119 --> 00:55:43,670
like we were pretty decent about not
like getting to it you know geeking out

3340
00:55:43,670 --> 00:55:43,680
like getting to it you know geeking out
 

3341
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:44,870
like getting to it you know geeking out
or getting too attached to something

3342
00:55:44,870 --> 00:55:44,880
or getting too attached to something
 

3343
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:47,510
or getting too attached to something
that was super unique to us um but

3344
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:47,520
that was super unique to us um but
 

3345
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:49,270
that was super unique to us um but
trying to kind of like you know put a

3346
00:55:49,270 --> 00:55:49,280
trying to kind of like you know put a
 

3347
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:51,030
trying to kind of like you know put a
customer hat on and does it truly kind

3348
00:55:51,030 --> 00:55:51,040
customer hat on and does it truly kind
 

3349
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:53,190
customer hat on and does it truly kind
of feel magical and so in a lot of ways

3350
00:55:53,190 --> 00:55:53,200
of feel magical and so in a lot of ways
 

3351
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:55,030
of feel magical and so in a lot of ways
we just give a lot of um

3352
00:55:55,030 --> 00:55:55,040
we just give a lot of um
 

3353
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:56,549
we just give a lot of um
autonomy to the

3354
00:55:56,549 --> 00:55:56,559
autonomy to the
 

3355
00:55:56,559 --> 00:55:59,510
autonomy to the
character team to really think about the

3356
00:55:59,510 --> 00:55:59,520
character team to really think about the
 

3357
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:01,190
character team to really think about the
you know character board and mood boards

3358
00:56:01,190 --> 00:56:01,200
you know character board and mood boards
 

3359
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:02,710
you know character board and mood boards
and storyboards and like what's the

3360
00:56:02,710 --> 00:56:02,720
and storyboards and like what's the
 

3361
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:04,069
and storyboards and like what's the
background of this character and how

3362
00:56:04,069 --> 00:56:04,079
background of this character and how
 

3363
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:06,069
background of this character and how
would they react um and they went

3364
00:56:06,069 --> 00:56:06,079
would they react um and they went
 

3365
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:07,589
would they react um and they went
through a process that's actually pretty

3366
00:56:07,589 --> 00:56:07,599
through a process that's actually pretty
 

3367
00:56:07,599 --> 00:56:09,190
through a process that's actually pretty
familiar but now had to operate under

3368
00:56:09,190 --> 00:56:09,200
familiar but now had to operate under
 

3369
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:11,829
familiar but now had to operate under
these unique constraints um but

3370
00:56:11,829 --> 00:56:11,839
these unique constraints um but
 

3371
00:56:11,839 --> 00:56:14,309
these unique constraints um but
the moment where it felt right um

3372
00:56:14,309 --> 00:56:14,319
the moment where it felt right um
 

3373
00:56:14,319 --> 00:56:15,990
the moment where it felt right um
kind of took a fairly similar journey

3374
00:56:15,990 --> 00:56:16,000
kind of took a fairly similar journey
 

3375
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,670
kind of took a fairly similar journey
than like a as a character in an

3376
00:56:17,670 --> 00:56:17,680
than like a as a character in an
 

3377
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:19,190
than like a as a character in an
animated film actually it's quite cool

3378
00:56:19,190 --> 00:56:19,200
animated film actually it's quite cool
 

3379
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:20,710
animated film actually it's quite cool
well the the thing that's really

3380
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:20,720
well the the thing that's really
 

3381
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:22,069
well the the thing that's really
important to me and i wonder if it's

3382
00:56:22,069 --> 00:56:22,079
important to me and i wonder if it's
 

3383
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:24,230
important to me and i wonder if it's
possible well i hope it's possible

3384
00:56:24,230 --> 00:56:24,240
possible well i hope it's possible
 

3385
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:25,990
possible well i hope it's possible
pretty sure it's possible is

3386
00:56:25,990 --> 00:56:26,000
pretty sure it's possible is
 

3387
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,190
pretty sure it's possible is
for me

3388
00:56:27,190 --> 00:56:27,200
for me
 

3389
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:29,510
for me
even though i know how it works

3390
00:56:29,510 --> 00:56:29,520
even though i know how it works
 

3391
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:31,990
even though i know how it works
to make sure there's sufficient

3392
00:56:31,990 --> 00:56:32,000
to make sure there's sufficient
 

3393
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,789
to make sure there's sufficient
randomness in the process yeah

3394
00:56:34,789 --> 00:56:34,799
randomness in the process yeah
 

3395
00:56:34,799 --> 00:56:36,150
randomness in the process yeah
probably because it would be machine

3396
00:56:36,150 --> 00:56:36,160
probably because it would be machine
 

3397
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:37,829
probably because it would be machine
learning based

3398
00:56:37,829 --> 00:56:37,839
learning based
 

3399
00:56:37,839 --> 00:56:39,510
learning based
that i'm surprised

3400
00:56:39,510 --> 00:56:39,520
that i'm surprised
 

3401
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:41,109
that i'm surprised
that i don't i'm surprised by certain

3402
00:56:41,109 --> 00:56:41,119
that i don't i'm surprised by certain
 

3403
00:56:41,119 --> 00:56:43,109
that i don't i'm surprised by certain
reactions i'm surprised by certain

3404
00:56:43,109 --> 00:56:43,119
reactions i'm surprised by certain
 

3405
00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:45,349
reactions i'm surprised by certain
communication maybe that's in a form of

3406
00:56:45,349 --> 00:56:45,359
communication maybe that's in a form of
 

3407
00:56:45,359 --> 00:56:47,109
communication maybe that's in a form of
a question

3408
00:56:47,109 --> 00:56:47,119
a question
 

3409
00:56:47,119 --> 00:56:49,349
a question
um were you surprised by certain things

3410
00:56:49,349 --> 00:56:49,359
um were you surprised by certain things
 

3411
00:56:49,359 --> 00:56:52,230
um were you surprised by certain things
cosmo did like certain interactions

3412
00:56:52,230 --> 00:56:52,240
cosmo did like certain interactions
 

3413
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:55,190
cosmo did like certain interactions
yeah we made it intentionally like

3414
00:56:55,190 --> 00:56:55,200
yeah we made it intentionally like
 

3415
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:57,109
yeah we made it intentionally like
uh so that there would be some surprise

3416
00:56:57,109 --> 00:56:57,119
uh so that there would be some surprise
 

3417
00:56:57,119 --> 00:56:59,430
uh so that there would be some surprise
then like a decent amount of variability

3418
00:56:59,430 --> 00:56:59,440
then like a decent amount of variability
 

3419
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:00,470
then like a decent amount of variability
in how

3420
00:57:00,470 --> 00:57:00,480
in how
 

3421
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:02,150
in how
he'd respond in certain circumstances

3422
00:57:02,150 --> 00:57:02,160
he'd respond in certain circumstances
 

3423
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:04,710
he'd respond in certain circumstances
and so in the end like it's um

3424
00:57:04,710 --> 00:57:04,720
and so in the end like it's um
 

3425
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:08,309
and so in the end like it's um
this is this isn't general ai this is a

3426
00:57:08,309 --> 00:57:08,319
this is this isn't general ai this is a
 

3427
00:57:08,319 --> 00:57:10,630
this is this isn't general ai this is a
giant like spectrum and library of like

3428
00:57:10,630 --> 00:57:10,640
giant like spectrum and library of like
 

3429
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:12,549
giant like spectrum and library of like
parametrized kind of emotional responses

3430
00:57:12,549 --> 00:57:12,559
parametrized kind of emotional responses
 

3431
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:13,910
parametrized kind of emotional responses
and an emotional engine that would like

3432
00:57:13,910 --> 00:57:13,920
and an emotional engine that would like
 

3433
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:15,270
and an emotional engine that would like
kind of map

3434
00:57:15,270 --> 00:57:15,280
kind of map
 

3435
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:17,990
kind of map
your current state of the game your

3436
00:57:17,990 --> 00:57:18,000
your current state of the game your
 

3437
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,349
your current state of the game your
emotions the world the people are

3438
00:57:19,349 --> 00:57:19,359
emotions the world the people are
 

3439
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:21,109
emotions the world the people are
playing with you all so forth to what's

3440
00:57:21,109 --> 00:57:21,119
playing with you all so forth to what's
 

3441
00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:23,510
playing with you all so forth to what's
happening um but we could make it feel

3442
00:57:23,510 --> 00:57:23,520
happening um but we could make it feel
 

3443
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:25,589
happening um but we could make it feel
spontaneous by creating enough

3444
00:57:25,589 --> 00:57:25,599
spontaneous by creating enough
 

3445
00:57:25,599 --> 00:57:29,270
spontaneous by creating enough
diversity uh and randomness uh but still

3446
00:57:29,270 --> 00:57:29,280
diversity uh and randomness uh but still
 

3447
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:31,109
diversity uh and randomness uh but still
within the bounds of what felt felt like

3448
00:57:31,109 --> 00:57:31,119
within the bounds of what felt felt like
 

3449
00:57:31,119 --> 00:57:33,430
within the bounds of what felt felt like
very realistic um to make that work and

3450
00:57:33,430 --> 00:57:33,440
very realistic um to make that work and
 

3451
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:34,789
very realistic um to make that work and
then what was really neat is that we

3452
00:57:34,789 --> 00:57:34,799
then what was really neat is that we
 

3453
00:57:34,799 --> 00:57:36,230
then what was really neat is that we
could get statistics on how much of that

3454
00:57:36,230 --> 00:57:36,240
could get statistics on how much of that
 

3455
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:38,789
could get statistics on how much of that
space we were saturating um and then add

3456
00:57:38,789 --> 00:57:38,799
space we were saturating um and then add
 

3457
00:57:38,799 --> 00:57:40,230
space we were saturating um and then add
more animations and more diversity in

3458
00:57:40,230 --> 00:57:40,240
more animations and more diversity in
 

3459
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:41,990
more animations and more diversity in
the places that would get hit more often

3460
00:57:41,990 --> 00:57:42,000
the places that would get hit more often
 

3461
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,069
the places that would get hit more often
so that you stay ahead of the um you

3462
00:57:44,069 --> 00:57:44,079
so that you stay ahead of the um you
 

3463
00:57:44,079 --> 00:57:46,549
so that you stay ahead of the um you
know the curve and maximize the uh the

3464
00:57:46,549 --> 00:57:46,559
know the curve and maximize the uh the
 

3465
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:48,950
know the curve and maximize the uh the
chance that it it stays feeling alive um

3466
00:57:48,950 --> 00:57:48,960
chance that it it stays feeling alive um
 

3467
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:51,030
chance that it it stays feeling alive um
and so but then when you like combine it

3468
00:57:51,030 --> 00:57:51,040
and so but then when you like combine it
 

3469
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:52,549
and so but then when you like combine it
like

3470
00:57:52,549 --> 00:57:52,559
like
 

3471
00:57:52,559 --> 00:57:54,390
like
the permutations and kind of like the

3472
00:57:54,390 --> 00:57:54,400
the permutations and kind of like the
 

3473
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:55,750
the permutations and kind of like the
combinations of emotions stitched

3474
00:57:55,750 --> 00:57:55,760
combinations of emotions stitched
 

3475
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:57,750
combinations of emotions stitched
together sometimes surprised us because

3476
00:57:57,750 --> 00:57:57,760
together sometimes surprised us because
 

3477
00:57:57,760 --> 00:57:59,589
together sometimes surprised us because
you see them in isolation but when you

3478
00:57:59,589 --> 00:57:59,599
you see them in isolation but when you
 

3479
00:57:59,599 --> 00:58:01,510
you see them in isolation but when you
actually see them and you see them live

3480
00:58:01,510 --> 00:58:01,520
actually see them and you see them live
 

3481
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:03,109
actually see them and you see them live
you know relative to some event that

3482
00:58:03,109 --> 00:58:03,119
you know relative to some event that
 

3483
00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:04,789
you know relative to some event that
happened in the game or whatnot like it

3484
00:58:04,789 --> 00:58:04,799
happened in the game or whatnot like it
 

3485
00:58:04,799 --> 00:58:06,230
happened in the game or whatnot like it
was kind of cool to see the combination

3486
00:58:06,230 --> 00:58:06,240
was kind of cool to see the combination
 

3487
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:08,470
was kind of cool to see the combination
of the two and um uh and not too

3488
00:58:08,470 --> 00:58:08,480
of the two and um uh and not too
 

3489
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:09,910
of the two and um uh and not too
different in other robotics applications

3490
00:58:09,910 --> 00:58:09,920
different in other robotics applications
 

3491
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:11,430
different in other robotics applications
where like you get you get so used to

3492
00:58:11,430 --> 00:58:11,440
where like you get you get so used to
 

3493
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:13,510
where like you get you get so used to
thinking about like the modules of a

3494
00:58:13,510 --> 00:58:13,520
thinking about like the modules of a
 

3495
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:15,109
thinking about like the modules of a
system and how things progress through a

3496
00:58:15,109 --> 00:58:15,119
system and how things progress through a
 

3497
00:58:15,119 --> 00:58:16,230
system and how things progress through a
tech stack

3498
00:58:16,230 --> 00:58:16,240
tech stack
 

3499
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:18,069
tech stack
that the real magic is when all the

3500
00:58:18,069 --> 00:58:18,079
that the real magic is when all the
 

3501
00:58:18,079 --> 00:58:19,430
that the real magic is when all the
pieces come together and you start

3502
00:58:19,430 --> 00:58:19,440
pieces come together and you start
 

3503
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:20,309
pieces come together and you start
getting

3504
00:58:20,309 --> 00:58:20,319
getting
 

3505
00:58:20,319 --> 00:58:23,109
getting
the right emergent behavior um in a way

3506
00:58:23,109 --> 00:58:23,119
the right emergent behavior um in a way
 

3507
00:58:23,119 --> 00:58:24,309
the right emergent behavior um in a way
that's easy to lose when you just kind

3508
00:58:24,309 --> 00:58:24,319
that's easy to lose when you just kind
 

3509
00:58:24,319 --> 00:58:25,910
that's easy to lose when you just kind
of go too deep into any one piece of it

3510
00:58:25,910 --> 00:58:25,920
of go too deep into any one piece of it
 

3511
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:27,270
of go too deep into any one piece of it
yeah when the system is sufficiently

3512
00:58:27,270 --> 00:58:27,280
yeah when the system is sufficiently
 

3513
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:29,109
yeah when the system is sufficiently
complex there is something like emergent

3514
00:58:29,109 --> 00:58:29,119
complex there is something like emergent
 

3515
00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:30,470
complex there is something like emergent
behavior and that's where the magic is

3516
00:58:30,470 --> 00:58:30,480
behavior and that's where the magic is
 

3517
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:31,829
behavior and that's where the magic is
you as a human being you can still

3518
00:58:31,829 --> 00:58:31,839
you as a human being you can still
 

3519
00:58:31,839 --> 00:58:33,910
you as a human being you can still
appreciate the beauty of that magic of

3520
00:58:33,910 --> 00:58:33,920
appreciate the beauty of that magic of
 

3521
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:36,069
appreciate the beauty of that magic of
the fine at the system level first of

3522
00:58:36,069 --> 00:58:36,079
the fine at the system level first of
 

3523
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:37,990
the fine at the system level first of
all thank you for humoring me on this uh

3524
00:58:37,990 --> 00:58:38,000
all thank you for humoring me on this uh
 

3525
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,589
all thank you for humoring me on this uh
it's really really

3526
00:58:39,589 --> 00:58:39,599
it's really really
 

3527
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:41,109
it's really really
uh fascinating i think a lot of people

3528
00:58:41,109 --> 00:58:41,119
uh fascinating i think a lot of people
 

3529
00:58:41,119 --> 00:58:43,190
uh fascinating i think a lot of people
would love this i i'd love to just one

3530
00:58:43,190 --> 00:58:43,200
would love this i i'd love to just one
 

3531
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:46,150
would love this i i'd love to just one
last thing on the butter robot i promise

3532
00:58:46,150 --> 00:58:46,160
last thing on the butter robot i promise
 

3533
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:50,309
last thing on the butter robot i promise
in terms of uh speech yeah

3534
00:58:50,309 --> 00:58:50,319
in terms of uh speech yeah
 

3535
00:58:50,319 --> 00:58:53,270
in terms of uh speech yeah
cosmo is able to communicate so much

3536
00:58:53,270 --> 00:58:53,280
cosmo is able to communicate so much
 

3537
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:56,069
cosmo is able to communicate so much
with just movement and face

3538
00:58:56,069 --> 00:58:56,079
with just movement and face
 

3539
00:58:56,079 --> 00:58:58,390
with just movement and face
do you think speech

3540
00:58:58,390 --> 00:58:58,400
do you think speech
 

3541
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:01,670
do you think speech
is too much of a degree of freedom

3542
00:59:01,670 --> 00:59:01,680
is too much of a degree of freedom
 

3543
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:04,950
is too much of a degree of freedom
like a speech a feature or a bug of uh

3544
00:59:04,950 --> 00:59:04,960
like a speech a feature or a bug of uh
 

3545
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:06,470
like a speech a feature or a bug of uh
deep

3546
00:59:06,470 --> 00:59:06,480
deep
 

3547
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:08,309
deep
uh interaction

3548
00:59:08,309 --> 00:59:08,319
uh interaction
 

3549
00:59:08,319 --> 00:59:10,870
uh interaction
emotional interaction yeah

3550
00:59:10,870 --> 00:59:10,880
emotional interaction yeah
 

3551
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:12,150
emotional interaction yeah
for a product

3552
00:59:12,150 --> 00:59:12,160
for a product
 

3553
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:14,309
for a product
it's too deep right now it's just not

3554
00:59:14,309 --> 00:59:14,319
it's too deep right now it's just not
 

3555
00:59:14,319 --> 00:59:15,990
it's too deep right now it's just not
real uh it would immediately break the

3556
00:59:15,990 --> 00:59:16,000
real uh it would immediately break the
 

3557
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,510
real uh it would immediately break the
fiction because the state of the art is

3558
00:59:17,510 --> 00:59:17,520
fiction because the state of the art is
 

3559
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:21,030
fiction because the state of the art is
just not good enough um and

3560
00:59:21,030 --> 00:59:21,040
just not good enough um and
 

3561
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:22,549
just not good enough um and
that's on top of just narrowing down the

3562
00:59:22,549 --> 00:59:22,559
that's on top of just narrowing down the
 

3563
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:24,150
that's on top of just narrowing down the
demographic where like the way you speak

3564
00:59:24,150 --> 00:59:24,160
demographic where like the way you speak
 

3565
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:25,510
demographic where like the way you speak
to an adult versus a way speak to a

3566
00:59:25,510 --> 00:59:25,520
to an adult versus a way speak to a
 

3567
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:27,349
to an adult versus a way speak to a
child is very different

3568
00:59:27,349 --> 00:59:27,359
child is very different
 

3569
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:30,549
child is very different
yet a dog is able to appeal to everybody

3570
00:59:30,549 --> 00:59:30,559
yet a dog is able to appeal to everybody
 

3571
00:59:30,559 --> 00:59:33,349
yet a dog is able to appeal to everybody
and so right now there is no speech

3572
00:59:33,349 --> 00:59:33,359
and so right now there is no speech
 

3573
00:59:33,359 --> 00:59:36,710
and so right now there is no speech
system that is like rich enough and and

3574
00:59:36,710 --> 00:59:36,720
system that is like rich enough and and
 

3575
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:39,430
system that is like rich enough and and
subtly realistic enough to feel

3576
00:59:39,430 --> 00:59:39,440
subtly realistic enough to feel
 

3577
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:41,589
subtly realistic enough to feel
appropriate um and so we very very

3578
00:59:41,589 --> 00:59:41,599
appropriate um and so we very very
 

3579
00:59:41,599 --> 00:59:43,109
appropriate um and so we very very
quickly kind of like moved away from it

3580
00:59:43,109 --> 00:59:43,119
quickly kind of like moved away from it
 

3581
00:59:43,119 --> 00:59:45,349
quickly kind of like moved away from it
now speech understanding is a different

3582
00:59:45,349 --> 00:59:45,359
now speech understanding is a different
 

3583
00:59:45,359 --> 00:59:47,510
now speech understanding is a different
matter where understanding intent that's

3584
00:59:47,510 --> 00:59:47,520
matter where understanding intent that's
 

3585
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:50,470
matter where understanding intent that's
a really valuable input um

3586
00:59:50,470 --> 00:59:50,480
a really valuable input um
 

3587
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:51,270
a really valuable input um
but

3588
00:59:51,270 --> 00:59:51,280
but
 

3589
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:53,829
but
giving it back requires like a you know

3590
00:59:53,829 --> 00:59:53,839
giving it back requires like a you know
 

3591
00:59:53,839 --> 00:59:55,910
giving it back requires like a you know
way way higher bar given kind of where

3592
00:59:55,910 --> 00:59:55,920
way way higher bar given kind of where
 

3593
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:57,109
way way higher bar given kind of where
today's

3594
00:59:57,109 --> 00:59:57,119
today's
 

3595
00:59:57,119 --> 00:59:59,190
today's
world is and so

3596
00:59:59,190 --> 00:59:59,200
world is and so
 

3597
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:00,470
world is and so
that realization that you can do

3598
01:00:00,470 --> 01:00:00,480
that realization that you can do
 

3599
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:02,309
that realization that you can do
surprisingly much with

3600
01:00:02,309 --> 01:00:02,319
surprisingly much with
 

3601
01:00:02,319 --> 01:00:04,470
surprisingly much with
uh either no speech or kind of tonal

3602
01:00:04,470 --> 01:00:04,480
uh either no speech or kind of tonal
 

3603
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:06,789
uh either no speech or kind of tonal
like the way you know wally r2d2 and

3604
01:00:06,789 --> 01:00:06,799
like the way you know wally r2d2 and
 

3605
01:00:06,799 --> 01:00:09,589
like the way you know wally r2d2 and
kind of other characters are able to um

3606
01:00:09,589 --> 01:00:09,599
kind of other characters are able to um
 

3607
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:11,750
kind of other characters are able to um
it's quite powerful and it generalizes

3608
01:00:11,750 --> 01:00:11,760
it's quite powerful and it generalizes
 

3609
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:13,990
it's quite powerful and it generalizes
um across cultures and across ages

3610
01:00:13,990 --> 01:00:14,000
um across cultures and across ages
 

3611
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,510
um across cultures and across ages
really really well i think we're going

3612
01:00:15,510 --> 01:00:15,520
really really well i think we're going
 

3613
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:16,630
really really well i think we're going
to be in that

3614
01:00:16,630 --> 01:00:16,640
to be in that
 

3615
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:18,870
to be in that
world for a little while where it's

3616
01:00:18,870 --> 01:00:18,880
world for a little while where it's
 

3617
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:20,390
world for a little while where it's
still very much an unsolved problem on

3618
01:00:20,390 --> 01:00:20,400
still very much an unsolved problem on
 

3619
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:22,950
still very much an unsolved problem on
how to like make something it touches on

3620
01:00:22,950 --> 01:00:22,960
how to like make something it touches on
 

3621
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:24,950
how to like make something it touches on
kenny valley thing so if you have legs

3622
01:00:24,950 --> 01:00:24,960
kenny valley thing so if you have legs
 

3623
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:26,549
kenny valley thing so if you have legs
and you're a big humanoid looking thing

3624
01:00:26,549 --> 01:00:26,559
and you're a big humanoid looking thing
 

3625
01:00:26,559 --> 01:00:28,069
and you're a big humanoid looking thing
you have very different expectations and

3626
01:00:28,069 --> 01:00:28,079
you have very different expectations and
 

3627
01:00:28,079 --> 01:00:29,750
you have very different expectations and
a much narrower degree of what's going

3628
01:00:29,750 --> 01:00:29,760
a much narrower degree of what's going
 

3629
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:32,150
a much narrower degree of what's going
to be acceptable by society than if

3630
01:00:32,150 --> 01:00:32,160
to be acceptable by society than if
 

3631
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:35,190
to be acceptable by society than if
you're a you know robot like uh like

3632
01:00:35,190 --> 01:00:35,200
you're a you know robot like uh like
 

3633
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:36,950
you're a you know robot like uh like
cosmo or wall and you can or some other

3634
01:00:36,950 --> 01:00:36,960
cosmo or wall and you can or some other
 

3635
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:38,710
cosmo or wall and you can or some other
form where you can kind of like reinvent

3636
01:00:38,710 --> 01:00:38,720
form where you can kind of like reinvent
 

3637
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:40,630
form where you can kind of like reinvent
the character speech has that same

3638
01:00:40,630 --> 01:00:40,640
the character speech has that same
 

3639
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:42,549
the character speech has that same
property where speech is so well

3640
01:00:42,549 --> 01:00:42,559
property where speech is so well
 

3641
01:00:42,559 --> 01:00:44,789
property where speech is so well
understood um in terms of expectations

3642
01:00:44,789 --> 01:00:44,799
understood um in terms of expectations
 

3643
01:00:44,799 --> 01:00:46,950
understood um in terms of expectations
by humans that you have far less

3644
01:00:46,950 --> 01:00:46,960
by humans that you have far less
 

3645
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:48,950
by humans that you have far less
flexibility on how to deviate from that

3646
01:00:48,950 --> 01:00:48,960
flexibility on how to deviate from that
 

3647
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:51,430
flexibility on how to deviate from that
and lean into your strengths and avoid

3648
01:00:51,430 --> 01:00:51,440
and lean into your strengths and avoid
 

3649
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:53,510
and lean into your strengths and avoid
weaknesses but i wonder if there is

3650
01:00:53,510 --> 01:00:53,520
weaknesses but i wonder if there is
 

3651
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:55,190
weaknesses but i wonder if there is
obviously there's certain kinds of

3652
01:00:55,190 --> 01:00:55,200
obviously there's certain kinds of
 

3653
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:58,150
obviously there's certain kinds of
speech that

3654
01:00:58,150 --> 01:00:58,160
speech that
 

3655
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:00,230
speech that
activates the uncanny valley and breaks

3656
01:01:00,230 --> 01:01:00,240
activates the uncanny valley and breaks
 

3657
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:02,710
activates the uncanny valley and breaks
the illusion faster so

3658
01:01:02,710 --> 01:01:02,720
the illusion faster so
 

3659
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:04,950
the illusion faster so
i guess my intuition is

3660
01:01:04,950 --> 01:01:04,960
i guess my intuition is
 

3661
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:06,549
i guess my intuition is
we will solve

3662
01:01:06,549 --> 01:01:06,559
we will solve
 

3663
01:01:06,559 --> 01:01:08,950
we will solve
certain we would be able to

3664
01:01:08,950 --> 01:01:08,960
certain we would be able to
 

3665
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:11,670
certain we would be able to
create some speech-based personalities

3666
01:01:11,670 --> 01:01:11,680
create some speech-based personalities
 

3667
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:14,230
create some speech-based personalities
sooner than others so for example i

01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:16,150
sooner than others so for example i
could i could think of

3670
01:01:16,150 --> 01:01:16,160
could i could think of
 

3671
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:19,030
could i could think of
a robot that doesn't know english and is

that's exactly right so you can have
 

3683
01:01:29,119 --> 01:01:29,910
that's exactly right so you can have
like

3684
01:01:29,910 --> 01:01:29,920
like
 

3685
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:31,109
like
uh

3686
01:01:31,109 --> 01:01:31,119
uh
 

3687
01:01:31,119 --> 01:01:33,270
uh
tie it into the experience where uh it

3688
01:01:33,270 --> 01:01:33,280
tie it into the experience where uh it
 

3689
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:34,630
tie it into the experience where uh it
is a more limited character or you

3690
01:01:34,630 --> 01:01:34,640
is a more limited character or you
 

3691
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:36,710
is a more limited character or you
embrace the lack of emotions as part or

embrace the lack of emotions as part or
 

3693
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:39,270
embrace the lack of emotions as part or
the lack of sorry dynamic range in the

3694
01:01:39,270 --> 01:01:39,280
the lack of sorry dynamic range in the
 

3695
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:41,109
the lack of sorry dynamic range in the
speech kind of capabilities emotions as

3696
01:01:41,109 --> 01:01:41,119
speech kind of capabilities emotions as
 

3697
01:01:41,119 --> 01:01:42,789
speech kind of capabilities emotions as
like part of the character itself and

3698
01:01:42,789 --> 01:01:42,799
like part of the character itself and
 

3699
01:01:42,799 --> 01:01:43,829
like part of the character itself and
you've seen that in like kind of

3700
01:01:43,829 --> 01:01:43,839
you've seen that in like kind of
 

3701
01:01:43,839 --> 01:01:46,390
you've seen that in like kind of
fictional characters as well yeah um but

3702
01:01:46,390 --> 01:01:46,400
fictional characters as well yeah um but
 

3703
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:49,750
fictional characters as well yeah um but
that's why this podcast works and

3704
01:01:49,750 --> 01:01:49,760
that's why this podcast works and
 

3705
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:51,430
that's why this podcast works and
yeah like you kind of had that with like

3706
01:01:51,430 --> 01:01:51,440
yeah like you kind of had that with like
 

3707
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:52,870
yeah like you kind of had that with like
um i don't know i guess like you know

3708
01:01:52,870 --> 01:01:52,880
um i don't know i guess like you know
 

3709
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:54,470
um i don't know i guess like you know
data and some of the other yeah

3710
01:01:54,470 --> 01:01:54,480
data and some of the other yeah
 

3711
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:57,750
data and some of the other yeah
like um but yeah so you have to and that

3712
01:01:57,750 --> 01:01:57,760
like um but yeah so you have to and that
 

3713
01:01:57,760 --> 01:02:00,150
like um but yeah so you have to and that
becomes a constraint that lets you

3714
01:02:00,150 --> 01:02:00,160
becomes a constraint that lets you
 

3715
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:03,510
becomes a constraint that lets you
meet the bar um see i i honestly think

3716
01:02:03,510 --> 01:02:03,520
meet the bar um see i i honestly think
 

3717
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:07,829
meet the bar um see i i honestly think
like also if you add uh drunk

3718
01:02:07,829 --> 01:02:07,839
like also if you add uh drunk
 

3719
01:02:07,839 --> 01:02:09,589
like also if you add uh drunk
and angry

3720
01:02:09,589 --> 01:02:09,599
and angry
 

3721
01:02:09,599 --> 01:02:12,230
and angry
that gives you more constraints that

3722
01:02:12,230 --> 01:02:12,240
that gives you more constraints that
 

3723
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:13,589
that gives you more constraints that
allow you to be

3724
01:02:13,589 --> 01:02:13,599
allow you to be
 

3725
01:02:13,599 --> 01:02:15,990
allow you to be
dumber from an nlp perspective like

3726
01:02:15,990 --> 01:02:16,000
dumber from an nlp perspective like
 

3727
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,150
dumber from an nlp perspective like
there's certain aspects so if you modify

3728
01:02:18,150 --> 01:02:18,160
there's certain aspects so if you modify
 

3729
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:20,630
there's certain aspects so if you modify
human behavior like let's just so forget

3730
01:02:20,630 --> 01:02:20,640
human behavior like let's just so forget
 

3731
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:22,309
human behavior like let's just so forget
the sort of artificial thing where you

3732
01:02:22,309 --> 01:02:22,319
the sort of artificial thing where you
 

3733
01:02:22,319 --> 01:02:25,670
the sort of artificial thing where you
don't know english toddler thing

3734
01:02:25,670 --> 01:02:25,680
don't know english toddler thing
 

3735
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:27,670
don't know english toddler thing
we if you just look at the full range of

3736
01:02:27,670 --> 01:02:27,680
we if you just look at the full range of
 

3737
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:28,870
we if you just look at the full range of
humans

3738
01:02:28,870 --> 01:02:28,880
humans
 

3739
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:31,510
humans
i think we there's certain

3740
01:02:31,510 --> 01:02:31,520
i think we there's certain
 

3741
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:34,950
i think we there's certain
situations where we put up

3742
01:02:34,950 --> 01:02:34,960
situations where we put up
 

3743
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:38,390
situations where we put up
with uh like lower level of intelligence

3744
01:02:38,390 --> 01:02:38,400
with uh like lower level of intelligence
 

3745
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:40,549
with uh like lower level of intelligence
in our communication like if somebody's

3746
01:02:40,549 --> 01:02:40,559
in our communication like if somebody's
 

3747
01:02:40,559 --> 01:02:42,230
in our communication like if somebody's
drunk we understand this issue that

3748
01:02:42,230 --> 01:02:42,240
drunk we understand this issue that
 

3749
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:43,670
drunk we understand this issue that
they're probably under the influence

3750
01:02:43,670 --> 01:02:43,680
they're probably under the influence
 

3751
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:45,510
they're probably under the influence
like we understand that they're not

3752
01:02:45,510 --> 01:02:45,520
like we understand that they're not
 

3753
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:47,589
like we understand that they're not
going to be making any sense anger is

3754
01:02:47,589 --> 01:02:47,599
going to be making any sense anger is
 

3755
01:02:47,599 --> 01:02:49,029
going to be making any sense anger is
another one like that i'm sure there's a

3756
01:02:49,029 --> 01:02:49,039
another one like that i'm sure there's a
 

3757
01:02:49,039 --> 01:02:51,829
another one like that i'm sure there's a
lot of other kind of situation

3758
01:02:51,829 --> 01:02:51,839
lot of other kind of situation
 

3759
01:02:51,839 --> 01:02:54,390
lot of other kind of situation
yeah maybe uh yeah again language loss

3760
01:02:54,390 --> 01:02:54,400
yeah maybe uh yeah again language loss
 

3761
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:56,470
yeah maybe uh yeah again language loss
in translation

3762
01:02:56,470 --> 01:02:56,480
in translation
 

3763
01:02:56,480 --> 01:02:58,789
in translation
that kind of stuff that i think if you

3764
01:02:58,789 --> 01:02:58,799
that kind of stuff that i think if you
 

3765
01:02:58,799 --> 01:03:00,950
that kind of stuff that i think if you
if you play with that

3766
01:03:00,950 --> 01:03:00,960
if you play with that
 

3767
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:02,630
if you play with that
uh what is it the ukrainian boy that

3768
01:03:02,630 --> 01:03:02,640
uh what is it the ukrainian boy that
 

3769
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:04,309
uh what is it the ukrainian boy that
passed the touring test you know play

3770
01:03:04,309 --> 01:03:04,319
passed the touring test you know play
 

3771
01:03:04,319 --> 01:03:05,670
passed the touring test you know play
with those ideas i think that's really

3772
01:03:05,670 --> 01:03:05,680
with those ideas i think that's really
 

3773
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:06,870
with those ideas i think that's really
interesting and then you can create

3774
01:03:06,870 --> 01:03:06,880
interesting and then you can create
 

3775
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:08,630
interesting and then you can create
compelling characters but you're right

3776
01:03:08,630 --> 01:03:08,640
compelling characters but you're right
 

3777
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:10,870
compelling characters but you're right
that's a dangerous sort of road to walk

3778
01:03:10,870 --> 01:03:10,880
that's a dangerous sort of road to walk
 

3779
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:12,789
that's a dangerous sort of road to walk
because uh you're adding degrees of

3780
01:03:12,789 --> 01:03:12,799
because uh you're adding degrees of
 

3781
01:03:12,799 --> 01:03:14,390
because uh you're adding degrees of
freedom that can get you in trouble yeah

3782
01:03:14,390 --> 01:03:14,400
freedom that can get you in trouble yeah
 

3783
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:16,230
freedom that can get you in trouble yeah
and that's why like you have these um

3784
01:03:16,230 --> 01:03:16,240
and that's why like you have these um
 

3785
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:18,470
and that's why like you have these um
big pushes that like for most of the

3786
01:03:18,470 --> 01:03:18,480
big pushes that like for most of the
 

3787
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:20,870
big pushes that like for most of the
last decade plus like where you'd have

3788
01:03:20,870 --> 01:03:20,880
last decade plus like where you'd have
 

3789
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:21,589
last decade plus like where you'd have
like

3790
01:03:21,589 --> 01:03:21,599
like
 

3791
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:23,029
like
full like

3792
01:03:23,029 --> 01:03:23,039
full like
 

3793
01:03:23,039 --> 01:03:24,789
full like
human replicas of robots really being

3794
01:03:24,789 --> 01:03:24,799
human replicas of robots really being
 

3795
01:03:24,799 --> 01:03:26,549
human replicas of robots really being
down to like skin and like kind of in

3796
01:03:26,549 --> 01:03:26,559
down to like skin and like kind of in
 

3797
01:03:26,559 --> 01:03:30,150
down to like skin and like kind of in
some places um

3798
01:03:30,150 --> 01:03:30,160

 

3799
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:32,870

my personal feeling is like man like

3800
01:03:32,870 --> 01:03:32,880
my personal feeling is like man like
 

3801
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:35,109
my personal feeling is like man like
that's not the direction that's most

3802
01:03:35,109 --> 01:03:35,119
that's not the direction that's most
 

3803
01:03:35,119 --> 01:03:38,390
that's not the direction that's most
fruitful right now um beautiful art yeah

3804
01:03:38,390 --> 01:03:38,400
fruitful right now um beautiful art yeah
 

3805
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:40,630
fruitful right now um beautiful art yeah
it's not in terms of a

3806
01:03:40,630 --> 01:03:40,640
it's not in terms of a
 

3807
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:43,109
it's not in terms of a
uh rich deep fulfilling experience yeah

3808
01:03:43,109 --> 01:03:43,119
uh rich deep fulfilling experience yeah
 

3809
01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:45,510
uh rich deep fulfilling experience yeah
you're right yeah and the way creating a

3810
01:03:45,510 --> 01:03:45,520
you're right yeah and the way creating a
 

3811
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:48,150
you're right yeah and the way creating a
minefield of potential places to feel

3812
01:03:48,150 --> 01:03:48,160
minefield of potential places to feel
 

3813
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:49,670
minefield of potential places to feel
off uh

3814
01:03:49,670 --> 01:03:49,680
off uh
 

3815
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:51,270
off uh
and then and then you're sidestepping

3816
01:03:51,270 --> 01:03:51,280
and then and then you're sidestepping
 

3817
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:52,549
and then and then you're sidestepping
where like the biggest kind of

3818
01:03:52,549 --> 01:03:52,559
where like the biggest kind of
 

3819
01:03:52,559 --> 01:03:54,309
where like the biggest kind of
functional ai challenges are to actually

3820
01:03:54,309 --> 01:03:54,319
functional ai challenges are to actually
 

3821
01:03:54,319 --> 01:03:55,029
functional ai challenges are to actually
have

3822
01:03:55,029 --> 01:03:55,039
have
 

3823
01:03:55,039 --> 01:03:56,230
have
you know kind of like really rich

3824
01:03:56,230 --> 01:03:56,240
you know kind of like really rich
 

3825
01:03:56,240 --> 01:03:57,430
you know kind of like really rich
productivity that actually kind of

3826
01:03:57,430 --> 01:03:57,440
productivity that actually kind of
 

3827
01:03:57,440 --> 01:03:59,750
productivity that actually kind of
justifies a you know kind of the higher

3828
01:03:59,750 --> 01:03:59,760
justifies a you know kind of the higher
 

3829
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:01,029
justifies a you know kind of the higher
price points and that's that's part of

3830
01:04:01,029 --> 01:04:01,039
price points and that's that's part of
 

3831
01:04:01,039 --> 01:04:02,789
price points and that's that's part of
the challenges like yeah like robots are

3832
01:04:02,789 --> 01:04:02,799
the challenges like yeah like robots are
 

3833
01:04:02,799 --> 01:04:04,230
the challenges like yeah like robots are
going to get to like thousands of

3834
01:04:04,230 --> 01:04:04,240
going to get to like thousands of
 

3835
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:05,589
going to get to like thousands of
dollars tens of thousands of dollars and

3836
01:04:05,589 --> 01:04:05,599
dollars tens of thousands of dollars and
 

3837
01:04:05,599 --> 01:04:07,109
dollars tens of thousands of dollars and
so forth but you can imagine what sort

3838
01:04:07,109 --> 01:04:07,119
so forth but you can imagine what sort
 

3839
01:04:07,119 --> 01:04:08,950
so forth but you can imagine what sort
of expectation of value that comes with

3840
01:04:08,950 --> 01:04:08,960
of expectation of value that comes with
 

3841
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:11,510
of expectation of value that comes with
it um and so that's where

3842
01:04:11,510 --> 01:04:11,520
it um and so that's where
 

3843
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:13,430
it um and so that's where
you want to be able to invest the

3844
01:04:13,430 --> 01:04:13,440
you want to be able to invest the
 

3845
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:16,390
you want to be able to invest the
the the time and uh and depth and so

3846
01:04:16,390 --> 01:04:16,400
the the time and uh and depth and so
 

3847
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:18,789
the the time and uh and depth and so
going down the full human replica route

3848
01:04:18,789 --> 01:04:18,799
going down the full human replica route
 

3849
01:04:18,799 --> 01:04:19,670
going down the full human replica route
um

3850
01:04:19,670 --> 01:04:19,680
um
 

3851
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:22,230
um
creates a gigantic uh

3852
01:04:22,230 --> 01:04:22,240
creates a gigantic uh
 

3853
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:23,510
creates a gigantic uh
uh

3854
01:04:23,510 --> 01:04:23,520
uh
 

3855
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:26,950
uh
distraction and really really high bar

3856
01:04:26,950 --> 01:04:26,960
distraction and really really high bar
 

3857
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:29,270
distraction and really really high bar
that can end up sucking up so much of

3858
01:04:29,270 --> 01:04:29,280
that can end up sucking up so much of
 

3859
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:30,789
that can end up sucking up so much of
your resources

3860
01:04:30,789 --> 01:04:30,799
your resources
 

3861
01:04:30,799 --> 01:04:33,670
your resources
so it's weird to say but you happen to

3862
01:04:33,670 --> 01:04:33,680
so it's weird to say but you happen to
 

3863
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:35,990
so it's weird to say but you happen to
be one of the greatest at this point

3864
01:04:35,990 --> 01:04:36,000
be one of the greatest at this point
 

3865
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,829
be one of the greatest at this point

like incredible uh kind of catalyst for
 

3947
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:08,390
like incredible uh kind of catalyst for
this whole space um and so google

3948

this whole space um and so google
 

3949
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:09,670
this whole space um and so google
started this project and then eventually

3950
01:06:09,670 --> 01:06:09,680
started this project and then eventually
 

3951
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:11,670
started this project and then eventually
waymo spun out and so what waymo is

waymo spun out and so what waymo is
 

3953
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:14,789
waymo spun out and so what waymo is
doing is creating uh the

3954

to transport goods so in a lot of ways

3972
01:06:34,549 --> 01:06:34,559
to transport goods so in a lot of ways
 

3973
01:06:34,559 --> 01:06:35,510
to transport goods so in a lot of ways
it's transporting people and

it's transporting people and
 

3975
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:37,430
it's transporting people and
transporting goods um but at the end of

3976
01:06:37,430 --> 01:06:37,440
transporting goods um but at the end of
 

3977
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:39,829
transporting goods um but at the end of
the day the underlying capabilities are

3978
01:06:39,829 --> 01:06:39,839
the day the underlying capabilities are
 

3979
01:06:39,839 --> 01:06:42,069
the day the underlying capabilities are
required to do that are surprisingly

3980

uh
vehicle it's operating in there you have

4004
01:07:07,990 --> 01:07:08,000
vehicle it's operating in there you have
 

4005
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,390
vehicle it's operating in there you have
a set of sensors that perceive the world

4006
01:07:10,390 --> 01:07:10,400
a set of sensors that perceive the world
 

4007
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:13,109
a set of sensors that perceive the world
can act in that world and move this

4008
01:07:13,109 --> 01:07:13,119
can act in that world and move this
 

4009
01:07:13,119 --> 01:07:14,390
can act in that world and move this
whatever the vehicle is what's that

4010
01:07:14,390 --> 01:07:14,400
whatever the vehicle is what's that
 

4011
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:16,069
whatever the vehicle is what's that
legal platform that's right and so in

4012
01:07:16,069 --> 01:07:16,079
legal platform that's right and so in
 

4013
01:07:16,079 --> 01:07:17,029
legal platform that's right and so in
the same way that you have a driver's

4014
01:07:17,029 --> 01:07:17,039
the same way that you have a driver's
 

4015
01:07:17,039 --> 01:07:18,950
the same way that you have a driver's
license and like your ability to drive

4016
01:07:18,950 --> 01:07:18,960
license and like your ability to drive
 

4017

driver very very large you carry over
 

4027
01:07:28,319 --> 01:07:29,910
driver very very large you carry over
and then there's uniquenesses related to

4028
01:07:29,910 --> 01:07:29,920
and then there's uniquenesses related to
 

4029
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:31,910
and then there's uniquenesses related to
a particular environment or domain or a

add some extra additive challenges but

4034
01:07:37,670 --> 01:07:37,680
add some extra additive challenges but
 

4035
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:39,910
add some extra additive challenges but
that's exactly right it's the underlying

01:07:39,910 --> 01:07:39,920
that's exactly right it's the underlying
 

4037
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:42,470
that's exactly right it's the underlying
systems that enable uh

4038
01:07:42,470 --> 01:07:42,480
systems that enable uh
 

4039
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:44,309
systems that enable uh
a physical vehicle without a human

4040
01:07:44,309 --> 01:07:44,319
a physical vehicle without a human
 

4041
01:07:44,319 --> 01:07:47,270

01:07:47,270 --> 01:07:47,280
driver to uh very successfully
 

4043
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:49,430

accomplish the tasks that previously um

4044
01:07:49,430 --> 01:07:49,440
accomplish the tasks that previously um
 

4045
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:52,390
accomplish the tasks that previously um
what wasn't possible um without um you

4046
01:07:52,390 --> 01:07:52,400
what wasn't possible um without um you
 

4047
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:54,630
what wasn't possible um without um you
know 100 human driving

4048
01:07:54,630 --> 01:07:54,640
know 100 human driving
 

4049
01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:55,750
know 100 human driving
and then there's

4050
01:07:55,750 --> 01:07:55,760
and then there's
 

4051
01:07:55,760 --> 01:07:58,309
and then there's
way more one which is the transporting

4052
01:07:58,309 --> 01:07:58,319
way more one which is the transporting
 

4053
01:07:58,319 --> 01:08:00,230
way more one which is the transporting
people that's right from a brand

4054
01:08:00,230 --> 01:08:00,240
people that's right from a brand
 

4055
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:02,950
people that's right from a brand
perspective and just in case we refer to

4056
01:08:02,950 --> 01:08:02,960
perspective and just in case we refer to
 

4057
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:04,950
perspective and just in case we refer to
it so people know and then there's waymo

4058
01:08:04,950 --> 01:08:04,960
it so people know and then there's waymo
 

4059
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:07,829
it so people know and then there's waymo
via which is the trucking component why

4060
01:08:07,829 --> 01:08:07,839
via which is the trucking component why
 

4061
01:08:07,839 --> 01:08:10,069
via which is the trucking component why
via by the way what is that what is that

4062
01:08:10,069 --> 01:08:10,079
via by the way what is that what is that
 

4063
01:08:10,079 --> 01:08:11,990
via by the way what is that what is that
what's is it just like a cool sounding

4064
01:08:11,990 --> 01:08:12,000
what's is it just like a cool sounding
 

4065
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:15,510
what's is it just like a cool sounding
name that just yeah uh like is there

4066
01:08:15,510 --> 01:08:15,520
name that just yeah uh like is there
 

4067
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:16,870
name that just yeah uh like is there
does there an interesting story there

4068
01:08:16,870 --> 01:08:16,880
does there an interesting story there
 

4069
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:18,550
does there an interesting story there
just it is a pretty cool sounding name

4070
01:08:18,550 --> 01:08:18,560
just it is a pretty cool sounding name
 

4071
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:19,829
just it is a pretty cool sounding name
it's a cool sounding name i mean when

4072
01:08:19,829 --> 01:08:19,839
it's a cool sounding name i mean when
 

4073
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:21,189
it's a cool sounding name i mean when
you think about it it's just like well

4074
01:08:21,189 --> 01:08:21,199
you think about it it's just like well
 

4075
01:08:21,199 --> 01:08:22,950
you think about it it's just like well
we're gonna transport it via this and

4076
01:08:22,950 --> 01:08:22,960
we're gonna transport it via this and
 

4077
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:24,950
we're gonna transport it via this and
that like so it's just kind of like an

4078
01:08:24,950 --> 01:08:24,960
that like so it's just kind of like an
 

4079
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:27,269
that like so it's just kind of like an
allusion to um the mechanics of

4080
01:08:27,269 --> 01:08:27,279
allusion to um the mechanics of
 

4081
01:08:27,279 --> 01:08:29,269
allusion to um the mechanics of
transporting something yes cool um and

4082
01:08:29,269 --> 01:08:29,279
transporting something yes cool um and
 

4083
01:08:29,279 --> 01:08:31,110
transporting something yes cool um and
uh and it is a pretty good grouping and

4084
01:08:31,110 --> 01:08:31,120
uh and it is a pretty good grouping and
 

4085
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:32,070
uh and it is a pretty good grouping and
the interesting thing is that even the

4086
01:08:32,070 --> 01:08:32,080
the interesting thing is that even the
 

4087
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:34,390
the interesting thing is that even the
groupings kind of bore where waymo one

4088
01:08:34,390 --> 01:08:34,400
groupings kind of bore where waymo one
 

4089
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:35,910
groupings kind of bore where waymo one
is like human transportation and uh

4090
01:08:35,910 --> 01:08:35,920
is like human transportation and uh
 

4091
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:37,749
is like human transportation and uh
there's a fully autonomous service in

4092
01:08:37,749 --> 01:08:37,759
there's a fully autonomous service in
 

4093
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:39,910
there's a fully autonomous service in
the phoenix area that like every day is

4094
01:08:39,910 --> 01:08:39,920
the phoenix area that like every day is
 

4095
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:41,510
the phoenix area that like every day is
transporting people and it's pretty

4096
01:08:41,510 --> 01:08:41,520
transporting people and it's pretty
 

4097
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:43,349
transporting people and it's pretty
incredible to like just you know see

4098
01:08:43,349 --> 01:08:43,359
incredible to like just you know see
 

4099
01:08:43,359 --> 01:08:45,349
incredible to like just you know see
that operate at reasonably large scale

4100
01:08:45,349 --> 01:08:45,359
that operate at reasonably large scale
 

4101
01:08:45,359 --> 01:08:47,510
that operate at reasonably large scale
and just kind of happen and then on the

4102
01:08:47,510 --> 01:08:47,520
and just kind of happen and then on the
 

4103
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:50,229
and just kind of happen and then on the
via side it doesn't even have to be

4104
01:08:50,229 --> 01:08:50,239
via side it doesn't even have to be
 

4105
01:08:50,239 --> 01:08:52,789
via side it doesn't even have to be
like long-haul trucking is a like a

4106
01:08:52,789 --> 01:08:52,799
like long-haul trucking is a like a
 

4107
01:08:52,799 --> 01:08:55,590
like long-haul trucking is a like a
major focus of uh of ours but down the

4108
01:08:55,590 --> 01:08:55,600
major focus of uh of ours but down the
 

4109
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:57,910
major focus of uh of ours but down the
road you can stitch together the vehicle

4110
01:08:57,910 --> 01:08:57,920
road you can stitch together the vehicle
 

4111
01:08:57,920 --> 01:08:59,349
road you can stitch together the vehicle
transportation as well for local

4112
01:08:59,349 --> 01:08:59,359
transportation as well for local
 

4113
01:08:59,359 --> 01:09:01,590
transportation as well for local
delivery um also and a lot of this

4114
01:09:01,590 --> 01:09:01,600
delivery um also and a lot of this
 

4115
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:03,430
delivery um also and a lot of this
requirements for local delivery overlap

4116
01:09:03,430 --> 01:09:03,440
requirements for local delivery overlap
 

4117
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:05,030
requirements for local delivery overlap
very heavily with consumer

4118
01:09:05,030 --> 01:09:05,040
very heavily with consumer
 

4119
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:06,630
very heavily with consumer
transportation um

4120
01:09:06,630 --> 01:09:06,640
transportation um
 

4121
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:08,550
transportation um
obviously uh you know given that you're

4122
01:09:08,550 --> 01:09:08,560
obviously uh you know given that you're
 

4123
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:10,550
obviously uh you know given that you're
operating on a lot of the same roads um

4124
01:09:10,550 --> 01:09:10,560
operating on a lot of the same roads um
 

4125
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:12,070
operating on a lot of the same roads um
and uh

4126
01:09:12,070 --> 01:09:12,080
and uh
 

4127
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:13,749
and uh
and navigating the same safety

4128
01:09:13,749 --> 01:09:13,759
and navigating the same safety
 

4129
01:09:13,759 --> 01:09:15,749
and navigating the same safety
challenges and so um

4130
01:09:15,749 --> 01:09:15,759
challenges and so um
 

4131
01:09:15,759 --> 01:09:18,789
challenges and so um
yeah and wave mode very much is a

4132
01:09:18,789 --> 01:09:18,799
yeah and wave mode very much is a
 

4133
01:09:18,799 --> 01:09:21,030
yeah and wave mode very much is a
multi-product company that

4134
01:09:21,030 --> 01:09:21,040
multi-product company that
 

4135
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:21,829
multi-product company that
has

4136
01:09:21,829 --> 01:09:21,839
has
 

4137
01:09:21,839 --> 01:09:23,349
has
ambitions in both they have different

4138
01:09:23,349 --> 01:09:23,359
ambitions in both they have different
 

4139
01:09:23,359 --> 01:09:24,950
ambitions in both they have different
challenges and both are tremendous

4140
01:09:24,950 --> 01:09:24,960
challenges and both are tremendous
 

4141
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:27,189
challenges and both are tremendous
opportunities but the cool thing is is

4142
01:09:27,189 --> 01:09:27,199
opportunities but the cool thing is is
 

4143
01:09:27,199 --> 01:09:29,590
opportunities but the cool thing is is
that there's a huge amount of leverage

4144
01:09:29,590 --> 01:09:29,600
that there's a huge amount of leverage
 

4145
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:31,510
that there's a huge amount of leverage
and this kind of core technology stack

4146
01:09:31,510 --> 01:09:31,520
and this kind of core technology stack
 

4147
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:35,030
and this kind of core technology stack
now gets pushed on by both sides and

4148
01:09:35,030 --> 01:09:35,040
now gets pushed on by both sides and
 

4149
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:36,550
now gets pushed on by both sides and
that adds its own unique challenges but

4150
01:09:36,550 --> 01:09:36,560
that adds its own unique challenges but
 

4151
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:38,870
that adds its own unique challenges but
the success case is that um the

4152
01:09:38,870 --> 01:09:38,880
the success case is that um the
 

4153
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:41,430
the success case is that um the
challenges that you push on um they get

4154
01:09:41,430 --> 01:09:41,440
challenges that you push on um they get
 

4155
01:09:41,440 --> 01:09:43,990
challenges that you push on um they get
leveraged across all platforms and also

4156
01:09:43,990 --> 01:09:44,000
leveraged across all platforms and also
 

4157
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:45,349
leveraged across all platforms and also
from an engineering perspective the

4158
01:09:45,349 --> 01:09:45,359
from an engineering perspective the
 

4159
01:09:45,359 --> 01:09:47,030
from an engineering perspective the
teams are integrated

4160
01:09:47,030 --> 01:09:47,040
teams are integrated
 

4161
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:48,950
teams are integrated
it's a mix so there's a huge amount of

4162
01:09:48,950 --> 01:09:48,960
it's a mix so there's a huge amount of
 

4163
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:50,789
it's a mix so there's a huge amount of
centralized kind of core teams that

4164
01:09:50,789 --> 01:09:50,799
centralized kind of core teams that
 

4165
01:09:50,799 --> 01:09:52,390
centralized kind of core teams that
support all applications and so you

4166
01:09:52,390 --> 01:09:52,400
support all applications and so you
 

4167
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:54,070
support all applications and so you
think of something like the hardware

4168
01:09:54,070 --> 01:09:54,080
think of something like the hardware
 

4169
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:55,350
think of something like the hardware
team that develops the lasers the

4170
01:09:55,350 --> 01:09:55,360
team that develops the lasers the
 

4171
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:56,790
team that develops the lasers the
compute integrates into vehicle

4172
01:09:56,790 --> 01:09:56,800
compute integrates into vehicle
 

4173
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:58,550
compute integrates into vehicle
platforms this is an experience that

4174
01:09:58,550 --> 01:09:58,560
platforms this is an experience that
 

4175
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:00,790
platforms this is an experience that
carries over across um you know any

4176
01:10:00,790 --> 01:10:00,800
carries over across um you know any
 

4177
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:02,310
carries over across um you know any
application that we'd have and they have

4178
01:10:02,310 --> 01:10:02,320
application that we'd have and they have
 

4179
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:04,070
application that we'd have and they have
been flow with both then there's like

4180
01:10:04,070 --> 01:10:04,080
been flow with both then there's like
 

4181
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:06,709
been flow with both then there's like
really unique um perception challenges

4182
01:10:06,709 --> 01:10:06,719
really unique um perception challenges
 

4183
01:10:06,719 --> 01:10:09,030
really unique um perception challenges
planning challenges like other you know

4184
01:10:09,030 --> 01:10:09,040
planning challenges like other you know
 

4185
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:11,030
planning challenges like other you know
types of challenges where there's a huge

4186
01:10:11,030 --> 01:10:11,040
types of challenges where there's a huge
 

4187
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:12,550
types of challenges where there's a huge
amount of leverage on a cortex stack but

4188
01:10:12,550 --> 01:10:12,560
amount of leverage on a cortex stack but
 

4189
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:13,910
amount of leverage on a cortex stack but
then there's like dedicated teams that

4190
01:10:13,910 --> 01:10:13,920
then there's like dedicated teams that
 

4191
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:15,510
then there's like dedicated teams that
think of how do you deal with a unique

4192
01:10:15,510 --> 01:10:15,520
think of how do you deal with a unique
 

4193
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:17,270
think of how do you deal with a unique
challenge for example

4194
01:10:17,270 --> 01:10:17,280
challenge for example
 

4195
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:19,350
challenge for example
an articulated trailer with varying

4196
01:10:19,350 --> 01:10:19,360
an articulated trailer with varying
 

4197
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:20,950
an articulated trailer with varying
loads that completely changes the

4198
01:10:20,950 --> 01:10:20,960
loads that completely changes the
 

4199
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:22,630
loads that completely changes the
physical dynamics of a vehicle that

4200
01:10:22,630 --> 01:10:22,640
physical dynamics of a vehicle that
 

4201
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:24,709
physical dynamics of a vehicle that
doesn't exist on a car but becomes one

4202
01:10:24,709 --> 01:10:24,719
doesn't exist on a car but becomes one
 

4203
01:10:24,719 --> 01:10:26,070
doesn't exist on a car but becomes one
of the most important

4204
01:10:26,070 --> 01:10:26,080
of the most important
 

4205
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:28,310
of the most important
kind of unique new challenges on a truck

4206
01:10:28,310 --> 01:10:28,320
kind of unique new challenges on a truck
 

4207
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:29,750
kind of unique new challenges on a truck
so

4208
01:10:29,750 --> 01:10:29,760
so
 

4209
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:32,470
so
what's the long-term dream

4210
01:10:32,470 --> 01:10:32,480
what's the long-term dream
 

4211
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:34,070
what's the long-term dream
of waymo via

4212
01:10:34,070 --> 01:10:34,080
of waymo via
 

4213
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:35,830
of waymo via
uh the autonomous trucking effort that

4214
01:10:35,830 --> 01:10:35,840
uh the autonomous trucking effort that
 

4215
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:37,990
uh the autonomous trucking effort that
waymo is doing yeah so we're starting

4216
01:10:37,990 --> 01:10:38,000
waymo is doing yeah so we're starting
 

4217
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,669
waymo is doing yeah so we're starting
with developing

4218
01:10:39,669 --> 01:10:39,679
with developing
 

4219
01:10:39,679 --> 01:10:40,950
with developing
uh

4220
01:10:40,950 --> 01:10:40,960
uh
 

4221
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:42,550
uh
l4 autonomy for

4222
01:10:42,550 --> 01:10:42,560
l4 autonomy for
 

4223
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:44,229
l4 autonomy for
class 8 trucks these are 53-foot

4224
01:10:44,229 --> 01:10:44,239
class 8 trucks these are 53-foot
 

4225
01:10:44,239 --> 01:10:45,590
class 8 trucks these are 53-foot
trailers that

4226
01:10:45,590 --> 01:10:45,600
trailers that
 

4227
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:47,750
trailers that
capture like a big perc a pretty sizable

4228
01:10:47,750 --> 01:10:47,760
capture like a big perc a pretty sizable
 

4229
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:49,030
capture like a big perc a pretty sizable
percentage of the good transportation in

4230
01:10:49,030 --> 01:10:49,040
percentage of the good transportation in
 

4231
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:50,790
percentage of the good transportation in
the country

4232
01:10:50,790 --> 01:10:50,800
the country
 

4233
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:52,550
the country
long term the opportunity is obviously

4234
01:10:52,550 --> 01:10:52,560
long term the opportunity is obviously
 

4235
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:55,110
long term the opportunity is obviously
to expand to much more diverse types of

4236
01:10:55,110 --> 01:10:55,120
to expand to much more diverse types of
 

4237
01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:56,149
to expand to much more diverse types of
vehicles

4238
01:10:56,149 --> 01:10:56,159
vehicles
 

4239
01:10:56,159 --> 01:10:58,790
vehicles
types of good transportation and start

4240
01:10:58,790 --> 01:10:58,800
types of good transportation and start
 

4241
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:00,790
types of good transportation and start
to really expand in both the volume and

4242
01:11:00,790 --> 01:11:00,800
to really expand in both the volume and
 

4243
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:03,189
to really expand in both the volume and
the route feasibility that's possible

4244
01:11:03,189 --> 01:11:03,199
the route feasibility that's possible
 

4245
01:11:03,199 --> 01:11:05,430
the route feasibility that's possible
and so just like we did on the car side

4246
01:11:05,430 --> 01:11:05,440
and so just like we did on the car side
 

4247
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:06,870
and so just like we did on the car side
you start with

4248
01:11:06,870 --> 01:11:06,880
you start with
 

4249
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:09,350
you start with
a single route with a very specific

4250
01:11:09,350 --> 01:11:09,360
a single route with a very specific
 

4251
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:12,310
a single route with a very specific
operating kind of domain and constraints

4252
01:11:12,310 --> 01:11:12,320
operating kind of domain and constraints
 

4253
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:14,070
operating kind of domain and constraints
that allow you to solve the problem but

4254
01:11:14,070 --> 01:11:14,080
that allow you to solve the problem but
 

4255
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:16,390
that allow you to solve the problem but
then over time you start to really try

4256
01:11:16,390 --> 01:11:16,400
then over time you start to really try
 

4257
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:17,830
then over time you start to really try
to push

4258
01:11:17,830 --> 01:11:17,840
to push
 

4259
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:19,669
to push
against those boundaries and open up

4260
01:11:19,669 --> 01:11:19,679
against those boundaries and open up
 

4261
01:11:19,679 --> 01:11:22,630
against those boundaries and open up
deeper feasibility across routes across

4262
01:11:22,630 --> 01:11:22,640
deeper feasibility across routes across
 

4263
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:24,470
deeper feasibility across routes across
surface streets across environmental

4264
01:11:24,470 --> 01:11:24,480
surface streets across environmental
 

4265
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:26,470
surface streets across environmental
conditions across the type of goods that

4266
01:11:26,470 --> 01:11:26,480
conditions across the type of goods that
 

4267
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:28,550
conditions across the type of goods that
you carry the versatility of those goods

4268
01:11:28,550 --> 01:11:28,560
you carry the versatility of those goods
 

4269
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:29,669
you carry the versatility of those goods
and how

4270
01:11:29,669 --> 01:11:29,679
and how
 

4271
01:11:29,679 --> 01:11:31,590
and how
little supervision is necessary to just

4272
01:11:31,590 --> 01:11:31,600
little supervision is necessary to just
 

4273
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:33,350
little supervision is necessary to just
start to scale this network

4274
01:11:33,350 --> 01:11:33,360
start to scale this network
 

4275
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:34,229
start to scale this network
and

4276
01:11:34,229 --> 01:11:34,239
and
 

4277
01:11:34,239 --> 01:11:36,390
and
long term there's actually it's a pretty

4278
01:11:36,390 --> 01:11:36,400
long term there's actually it's a pretty
 

4279
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:38,790
long term there's actually it's a pretty
incredible enabler where um

4280
01:11:38,790 --> 01:11:38,800
incredible enabler where um
 

4281
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:40,390
incredible enabler where um
you know today you have

4282
01:11:40,390 --> 01:11:40,400
you know today you have
 

4283
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:41,990
you know today you have
already a giant shortage of truck

4284
01:11:41,990 --> 01:11:42,000
already a giant shortage of truck
 

4285
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,630
already a giant shortage of truck
drivers it's uh over 80 000 truck driver

4286
01:11:44,630 --> 01:11:44,640
drivers it's uh over 80 000 truck driver
 

4287
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:46,390
drivers it's uh over 80 000 truck driver
shortage that's expected to grow to

4288
01:11:46,390 --> 01:11:46,400
shortage that's expected to grow to
 

4289
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:48,630
shortage that's expected to grow to
hundreds of thousands in the years ahead

4290
01:11:48,630 --> 01:11:48,640
hundreds of thousands in the years ahead
 

4291
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:49,910
hundreds of thousands in the years ahead
you have

4292
01:11:49,910 --> 01:11:49,920
you have
 

4293
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:52,070
you have
really really quickly increasing demand

4337
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:33,189
before they're they're not allowed to
drive anymore which is a very important

4338
01:12:33,189 --> 01:12:33,199
drive anymore which is a very important
 

4339
01:12:33,199 --> 01:12:35,270

safety constraint
 

4341
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:36,709
safety constraint
what that does is it enforces

4342
01:12:36,709 --> 01:12:36,719
what that does is it enforces
 

4343
01:12:36,719 --> 01:12:38,630
what that does is it enforces
limitations on how far

4344

how goods are transported which
 

4355
01:12:47,679 --> 01:12:50,950
how goods are transported which
influences costs and so um

them are on the road for 300 days a year
it's a very unique type of lifestyle so

4422
01:13:51,750 --> 01:13:51,760
it's a very unique type of lifestyle so
 

4423
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:53,189
it's a very unique type of lifestyle so
there's fascinating stuff there just

4424
01:13:53,189 --> 01:13:53,199
there's fascinating stuff there just
 

4425
01:13:53,199 --> 01:13:54,709
there's fascinating stuff there just
like you said there's a shortage of

4426
01:13:54,709 --> 01:13:54,719
like you said there's a shortage of
 

4427
01:13:54,719 --> 01:13:55,669
like you said there's a shortage of
actually

4428
01:13:55,669 --> 01:13:55,679
actually
 

4429
01:13:55,679 --> 01:13:58,550
actually
people uh truck drivers

4430
01:13:58,550 --> 01:13:58,560
people uh truck drivers
 

4431
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:00,310
people uh truck drivers
taking the job counter to what this i

4432
01:14:00,310 --> 01:14:00,320
taking the job counter to what this i
 

4433
01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:04,149
taking the job counter to what this i
think is publicly believed

4434
01:14:04,149 --> 01:14:04,159

 

4435
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:06,149

so there's an excess of jobs and a

4436
01:14:06,149 --> 01:14:06,159
so there's an excess of jobs and a
 

4437
01:14:06,159 --> 01:14:08,470
so there's an excess of jobs and a
shortage of people to take up those jobs

4438
01:14:08,470 --> 01:14:08,480
shortage of people to take up those jobs
 

4439
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:10,229
shortage of people to take up those jobs
and just like you said it's such a

4440
01:14:10,229 --> 01:14:10,239
and just like you said it's such a
 

4441
01:14:10,239 --> 01:14:12,070
and just like you said it's such a
difficult problem

4442
01:14:12,070 --> 01:14:12,080
difficult problem
 

4443
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:14,149
difficult problem
and these are experts at driving it's

4444
01:14:14,149 --> 01:14:14,159
and these are experts at driving it's
 

4445
01:14:14,159 --> 01:14:16,229
and these are experts at driving it's
solving this particular problem and it's

4446
01:14:16,229 --> 01:14:16,239
solving this particular problem and it's
 

4447
01:14:16,239 --> 01:14:17,669
solving this particular problem and it's
fascinating to learn from them to

4448
01:14:17,669 --> 01:14:17,679
fascinating to learn from them to
 

4449

01:14:21,510 --> 01:14:21,520
you know how hard is this problem and
 

4453
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:22,709
you know how hard is this problem and
that's the question i want to ask you

4454

you can comment on which scenarios are

4464
01:14:32,470 --> 01:14:32,480
you can comment on which scenarios are
 

4465
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:34,310
you can comment on which scenarios are
super difficult which are more

4466
01:14:34,310 --> 01:14:34,320
super difficult which are more
 

4467
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:36,229
super difficult which are more
manageable is there is there a way to

manageable is there is there a way to
 

4469
01:14:36,239 --> 01:14:39,030
manageable is there is there a way to
kind of convert into words

4470
01:14:39,030 --> 01:14:39,040
kind of convert into words
 

4471
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:41,750
kind of convert into words
how difficult the problem is yeah it's a

4472
01:14:41,750 --> 01:14:41,760
how difficult the problem is yeah it's a
 

4473
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:43,830
how difficult the problem is yeah it's a
good question so there's um

4474
01:14:43,830 --> 01:14:43,840
good question so there's um
 

4475
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:45,830
good question so there's um
and as you can expect it's a mix some

4476
01:14:45,830 --> 01:14:45,840
and as you can expect it's a mix some
 

4477
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:48,950
and as you can expect it's a mix some
things become a lot uh uh

4478
01:14:48,950 --> 01:14:48,960
things become a lot uh uh
 

4479
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:50,310
things become a lot uh uh
a lot

4480
01:14:50,310 --> 01:14:50,320
a lot
 

4481
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:52,709
a lot
easier or at least more flexible um some

4482
01:14:52,709 --> 01:14:52,719
easier or at least more flexible um some
 

4483
01:14:52,719 --> 01:14:55,270
easier or at least more flexible um some
things are harder and so you know on the

4484
01:14:55,270 --> 01:14:55,280
things are harder and so you know on the
 

4485
01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:57,350
things are harder and so you know on the
things that are like uh the tailwinds

4486
01:14:57,350 --> 01:14:57,360
things that are like uh the tailwinds
 

4487
01:14:57,360 --> 01:14:59,270
things that are like uh the tailwinds
the benefits um

4488
01:14:59,270 --> 01:14:59,280
the benefits um
 

4489
01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:00,550
the benefits um
a big focus of

4490
01:15:00,550 --> 01:15:00,560
a big focus of
 

4491
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:02,790
a big focus of
automating trucking especially initially

4492
01:15:02,790 --> 01:15:02,800
automating trucking especially initially
 

4493
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:04,229
automating trucking especially initially
is really focusing on the long-haul

4494
01:15:04,229 --> 01:15:04,239
is really focusing on the long-haul
 

4495
01:15:04,239 --> 01:15:06,070
is really focusing on the long-haul
freeway stretch of it where that's where

4496
01:15:06,070 --> 01:15:06,080
freeway stretch of it where that's where
 

4497
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:08,070
freeway stretch of it where that's where
a majority of the value is captured on a

4498
01:15:08,070 --> 01:15:08,080
a majority of the value is captured on a
 

4499
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:09,590
a majority of the value is captured on a
freeway you have a lot more structure

4500
01:15:09,590 --> 01:15:09,600
freeway you have a lot more structure
 

4501
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:11,669
freeway you have a lot more structure
and a lot more consistency across

4502
01:15:11,669 --> 01:15:11,679
and a lot more consistency across
 

4503
01:15:11,679 --> 01:15:13,990
and a lot more consistency across
freeways across the u.s

4504
01:15:13,990 --> 01:15:14,000
freeways across the u.s
 

4505
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:15,510
freeways across the u.s
compared to surface streets where you

4506
01:15:15,510 --> 01:15:15,520
compared to surface streets where you
 

4507
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:19,189
compared to surface streets where you
have a way higher dimensionality of what

4508
01:15:19,189 --> 01:15:19,199
have a way higher dimensionality of what
 

4509
01:15:19,199 --> 01:15:20,790
have a way higher dimensionality of what
can happen lack of structural lack of

4510
01:15:20,790 --> 01:15:20,800
can happen lack of structural lack of
 

4511
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:22,310
can happen lack of structural lack of
consistency and variability across

4512
01:15:22,310 --> 01:15:22,320
consistency and variability across
 

4513
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:23,910
consistency and variability across
cities so you can leverage that

4514
01:15:23,910 --> 01:15:23,920
cities so you can leverage that
 

4515
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:26,390
cities so you can leverage that
consistency to

4516
01:15:26,390 --> 01:15:26,400
consistency to
 

4517
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:28,870
consistency to
tackle at least in that respect a more

4518
01:15:28,870 --> 01:15:28,880
tackle at least in that respect a more
 

4519
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:31,510
tackle at least in that respect a more
constrained ai problem which has some

4520
01:15:31,510 --> 01:15:31,520
constrained ai problem which has some
 

4521
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:33,510
constrained ai problem which has some
benefits to it um you can itemize much

4522
01:15:33,510 --> 01:15:33,520
benefits to it um you can itemize much
 

4523
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:34,550
benefits to it um you can itemize much
more of the sort of things you might

4524
01:15:34,550 --> 01:15:34,560
more of the sort of things you might
 

4525
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:36,149
more of the sort of things you might
encounter and so forth and so

4526
01:15:36,149 --> 01:15:36,159
encounter and so forth and so
 

4527
01:15:36,159 --> 01:15:38,390
encounter and so forth and so
those are benefits is there a canonical

4528
01:15:38,390 --> 01:15:38,400
those are benefits is there a canonical
 

4529
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:39,590
those are benefits is there a canonical
freeway

4530
01:15:39,590 --> 01:15:39,600
freeway
 

4531
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:41,590
freeway
and city we should be thinking about

4532
01:15:41,590 --> 01:15:41,600
and city we should be thinking about
 

4533
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:42,790
and city we should be thinking about
like

4534
01:15:42,790 --> 01:15:42,800
like
 

4535
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:44,310
like
is there is there a standard thing

4536
01:15:44,310 --> 01:15:44,320
is there is there a standard thing
 

4537
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:45,910
is there is there a standard thing
that's brought up in conversation often

4538
01:15:45,910 --> 01:15:45,920
that's brought up in conversation often
 

4539
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:48,950
that's brought up in conversation often
like here's a stretch of road

4540
01:15:48,950 --> 01:15:48,960
like here's a stretch of road
 

4541
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:51,270
like here's a stretch of road
um what is it like when people talk

4542
01:15:51,270 --> 01:15:51,280
um what is it like when people talk
 

4543
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:52,790
um what is it like when people talk
about traveling across country they'll

4544
01:15:52,790 --> 01:15:52,800
about traveling across country they'll
 

4545
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:54,310
about traveling across country they'll
talk about

4546
01:15:54,310 --> 01:15:54,320
talk about
 

4547
01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:57,510
talk about
new york this is san francisco

4548
01:15:57,510 --> 01:15:57,520
new york this is san francisco
 

4549
01:15:57,520 --> 01:15:59,510
new york this is san francisco
is that the route like is there a

4550
01:15:59,510 --> 01:15:59,520
is that the route like is there a
 

4551
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:02,229
is that the route like is there a
stretch of road that's like nice and

4552
01:16:02,229 --> 01:16:02,239
stretch of road that's like nice and
 

4553
01:16:02,239 --> 01:16:03,270
stretch of road that's like nice and
clean

4554
01:16:03,270 --> 01:16:03,280
clean
 

4555
01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:05,030
clean
and then there's like cities with

4556
01:16:05,030 --> 01:16:05,040
and then there's like cities with
 

4557
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:06,630
and then there's like cities with
difficulties in them that you kind of

4558
01:16:06,630 --> 01:16:06,640
difficulties in them that you kind of
 

4559
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:08,470
difficulties in them that you kind of
think of as the canonical problem to

4560
01:16:08,470 --> 01:16:08,480
think of as the canonical problem to
 

4561
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:10,950
think of as the canonical problem to
solve here right uh so starting with the

4562
01:16:10,950 --> 01:16:10,960
solve here right uh so starting with the
 

4563
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:13,189
solve here right uh so starting with the
car side um

4564
01:16:13,189 --> 01:16:13,199
car side um
 

4565
01:16:13,199 --> 01:16:15,189
car side um
well waymo very intentionally picked the

4566
01:16:15,189 --> 01:16:15,199
well waymo very intentionally picked the
 

4567
01:16:15,199 --> 01:16:17,590
well waymo very intentionally picked the
phoenix area and the san francisco area

4568
01:16:17,590 --> 01:16:17,600
phoenix area and the san francisco area
 

4569
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:19,990
phoenix area and the san francisco area
as a follow once we hit driverless where

4570
01:16:19,990 --> 01:16:20,000
as a follow once we hit driverless where
 

4571
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:21,510
as a follow once we hit driverless where
when you think of consumer

4572
01:16:21,510 --> 01:16:21,520
when you think of consumer
 

4573
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:23,910
when you think of consumer
transportation and ride sharing you know

4574
01:16:23,910 --> 01:16:23,920
transportation and ride sharing you know
 

4575
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:25,830
transportation and ride sharing you know
kind of economy a big percentage of that

4576
01:16:25,830 --> 01:16:25,840
kind of economy a big percentage of that
 

4577
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:27,669
kind of economy a big percentage of that
market is captured in the densest cities

4578
01:16:27,669 --> 01:16:27,679
market is captured in the densest cities
 

4579
01:16:27,679 --> 01:16:29,510
market is captured in the densest cities
in the united states and so really

4580
01:16:29,510 --> 01:16:29,520
in the united states and so really
 

4581
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:31,189
in the united states and so really
pushing out and solving san francisco

4582
01:16:31,189 --> 01:16:31,199
pushing out and solving san francisco
 

4583
01:16:31,199 --> 01:16:33,510
pushing out and solving san francisco
becomes a really huge opportunity and uh

4584
01:16:33,510 --> 01:16:33,520
becomes a really huge opportunity and uh
 

4585
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:35,510
becomes a really huge opportunity and uh
importance and um

4586
01:16:35,510 --> 01:16:35,520
importance and um
 

4587
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:37,669
importance and um
and you know places one dot on kind of

4588
01:16:37,669 --> 01:16:37,679
and you know places one dot on kind of
 

4589
01:16:37,679 --> 01:16:38,709
and you know places one dot on kind of
like the spectrum of like kind of

4590
01:16:38,709 --> 01:16:38,719
like the spectrum of like kind of
 

4591
01:16:38,719 --> 01:16:41,510
like the spectrum of like kind of
complexity uh the phoenix area starting

4592
01:16:41,510 --> 01:16:41,520
complexity uh the phoenix area starting
 

4593
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:42,630
complexity uh the phoenix area starting
with chandler and then like kind of

4594
01:16:42,630 --> 01:16:42,640
with chandler and then like kind of
 

4595
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:44,470
with chandler and then like kind of
expanding more broadly in the phoenix uh

4596
01:16:44,470 --> 01:16:44,480
expanding more broadly in the phoenix uh
 

4597
01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:46,870
expanding more broadly in the phoenix uh
metropolitan area it's i believe the

4598
01:16:46,870 --> 01:16:46,880
metropolitan area it's i believe the
 

4599
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:49,830
metropolitan area it's i believe the
fastest growing city in the us it's a uh

4600
01:16:49,830 --> 01:16:49,840
fastest growing city in the us it's a uh
 

4601
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:51,590
fastest growing city in the us it's a uh
kind of a higher medium-sized city but

4602
01:16:51,590 --> 01:16:51,600
kind of a higher medium-sized city but
 

4603
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:52,950
kind of a higher medium-sized city but
growing quickly

4604
01:16:52,950 --> 01:16:52,960
growing quickly
 

4605
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:55,189
growing quickly
and still captures a really wide range

4606
01:16:55,189 --> 01:16:55,199
and still captures a really wide range
 

4607
01:16:55,199 --> 01:16:56,630
and still captures a really wide range
of kind of like complexities and so

4608
01:16:56,630 --> 01:16:56,640
of kind of like complexities and so
 

4609
01:16:56,640 --> 01:16:58,630
of kind of like complexities and so
getting to driverless there actually

4610
01:16:58,630 --> 01:16:58,640
getting to driverless there actually
 

4611
01:16:58,640 --> 01:17:00,149
getting to driverless there actually
exposes you a lot of the building blocks

4612
01:17:00,149 --> 01:17:00,159
exposes you a lot of the building blocks
 

4613
01:17:00,159 --> 01:17:01,910
exposes you a lot of the building blocks
you need for the more complicated

4614
01:17:01,910 --> 01:17:01,920
you need for the more complicated
 

4615
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:04,470
you need for the more complicated
environments and so in a lot of ways

4616
01:17:04,470 --> 01:17:04,480
environments and so in a lot of ways
 

4617
01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:06,070
environments and so in a lot of ways
there's a thesis that if you start to

4618
01:17:06,070 --> 01:17:06,080
there's a thesis that if you start to
 

4619
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:07,510
there's a thesis that if you start to
kind of place a few of these kind of

4620
01:17:07,510 --> 01:17:07,520
kind of place a few of these kind of
 

4621
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:09,750
kind of place a few of these kind of
dots where san francisco has these types

4622
01:17:09,750 --> 01:17:09,760
dots where san francisco has these types
 

4623
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:11,430
dots where san francisco has these types
of unique challenges dense pedestrians

4624
01:17:11,430 --> 01:17:11,440
of unique challenges dense pedestrians
 

4625
01:17:11,440 --> 01:17:13,270
of unique challenges dense pedestrians
all this like complexity especially when

4626
01:17:13,270 --> 01:17:13,280
all this like complexity especially when
 

4627
01:17:13,280 --> 01:17:14,790
all this like complexity especially when
you get into the downtown areas and so

4628
01:17:14,790 --> 01:17:14,800
you get into the downtown areas and so
 

4629
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:16,550
you get into the downtown areas and so
forth and phoenix has like

4630
01:17:16,550 --> 01:17:16,560
forth and phoenix has like
 

4631
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:18,070
forth and phoenix has like
a really interesting kind of spectrum of

4632
01:17:18,070 --> 01:17:18,080
a really interesting kind of spectrum of
 

4633
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:20,390
a really interesting kind of spectrum of
challenges maybe you know other ones

4634
01:17:20,390 --> 01:17:20,400
challenges maybe you know other ones
 

4635
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:22,390
challenges maybe you know other ones
like la kind of add freeway focus and so

4636
01:17:22,390 --> 01:17:22,400
like la kind of add freeway focus and so
 

4637
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:24,870
like la kind of add freeway focus and so
forth you start to kind of cover the

4638
01:17:24,870 --> 01:17:24,880
forth you start to kind of cover the
 

4639
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:26,550
forth you start to kind of cover the
full set of features that you might

4640
01:17:26,550 --> 01:17:26,560
full set of features that you might
 

4641
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:28,709
full set of features that you might
expect and it becomes faster and faster

4642
01:17:28,709 --> 01:17:28,719
expect and it becomes faster and faster
 

4643
01:17:28,719 --> 01:17:29,830
expect and it becomes faster and faster
if you have the right systems in the

4644
01:17:29,830 --> 01:17:29,840
if you have the right systems in the
 

4645
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:30,630
if you have the right systems in the
right

4646
01:17:30,630 --> 01:17:30,640
right
 

4647
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:32,790
right
organization to then open up the fifth

trucking there's uh similar properties

4652
01:17:37,350 --> 01:17:37,360
trucking there's uh similar properties
 

4653
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:39,910
trucking there's uh similar properties
where um obviously there's uniquenesses

4654
01:17:39,910 --> 01:17:39,920
where um obviously there's uniquenesses
 

4655
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:41,189
where um obviously there's uniquenesses
and freeways when you get into really

4656
01:17:41,189 --> 01:17:41,199
and freeways when you get into really
 

4657
01:17:41,199 --> 01:17:42,950
and freeways when you get into really
dense environments and then

4658
01:17:42,950 --> 01:17:42,960
dense environments and then
 

4659
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:45,270
dense environments and then
the real opportunity uh to then you know

4660
01:17:45,270 --> 01:17:45,280
the real opportunity uh to then you know
 

4661
01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:47,990
the real opportunity uh to then you know
get even more uh value is to think about

4662
01:17:47,990 --> 01:17:48,000
get even more uh value is to think about
 

4663
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:49,350
get even more uh value is to think about
how you expand with like some of the

4664
01:17:49,350 --> 01:17:49,360
how you expand with like some of the
 

4665
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:50,470
how you expand with like some of the
service street challenges but for

4666
01:17:50,470 --> 01:17:50,480
service street challenges but for
 

4667
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:52,950
service street challenges but for
example right now we're looking um we

4668

example right now we're looking um we
 

4669
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:54,870
example right now we're looking um we
have a big facility that we're uh

4670
01:17:54,870 --> 01:17:54,880
have a big facility that we're uh
 

4671
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:57,430
have a big facility that we're uh
finishing building in q1 in uh dallas

4672
01:17:57,430 --> 01:17:57,440
finishing building in q1 in uh dallas
 

4673
01:17:57,440 --> 01:17:59,669
finishing building in q1 in uh dallas
area um that'll allow us to do testing

4674
01:17:59,669 --> 01:17:59,679
area um that'll allow us to do testing
 

4675
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:01,430
area um that'll allow us to do testing
from the dallas area on routes like

4676
01:18:01,430 --> 01:18:01,440
from the dallas area on routes like
 

4677
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:03,910
from the dallas area on routes like
dallas to houston dallas to phoenix um

4678
01:18:03,910 --> 01:18:03,920
dallas to houston dallas to phoenix um
 

4679
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:06,950
dallas to houston dallas to phoenix um
going out east and dallas to austin

4680
01:18:06,950 --> 01:18:06,960
going out east and dallas to austin
 

4681
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:09,270
going out east and dallas to austin
austin so that triangle um waymo should

4682
01:18:09,270 --> 01:18:09,280
austin so that triangle um waymo should
 

4683
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:11,350
austin so that triangle um waymo should
come to austin

4684
01:18:11,350 --> 01:18:11,360
come to austin
 

4685
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:12,950
come to austin
well waymo the car side was in austin

4686
01:18:12,950 --> 01:18:12,960
well waymo the car side was in austin
 

4687
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:15,350
well waymo the car side was in austin
for a while yes i know yeah come back

4688
01:18:15,350 --> 01:18:15,360
for a while yes i know yeah come back
 

4689
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:17,510
for a while yes i know yeah come back
yeah but uh trucking is actually texas

4690
01:18:17,510 --> 01:18:17,520
yeah but uh trucking is actually texas
 

4691
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:19,110
yeah but uh trucking is actually texas
is one of the best places to start uh

4692
01:18:19,110 --> 01:18:19,120
is one of the best places to start uh
 

4693
01:18:19,120 --> 01:18:20,870
is one of the best places to start uh
because of both volume regulatory

4694
01:18:20,870 --> 01:18:20,880
because of both volume regulatory
 

4695
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:23,430
because of both volume regulatory
weather there's a lot of benefits um on

4696
01:18:23,430 --> 01:18:23,440
weather there's a lot of benefits um on
 

4697
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:25,669
weather there's a lot of benefits um on
trucking a huge opportunity is port of

4698
01:18:25,669 --> 01:18:25,679
trucking a huge opportunity is port of
 

4699
01:18:25,679 --> 01:18:29,030
trucking a huge opportunity is port of
la going east so in a lot of ways a lot

4700
01:18:29,030 --> 01:18:29,040
la going east so in a lot of ways a lot
 

4701
01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:30,870
la going east so in a lot of ways a lot
of the work is to start to stitch

4702
01:18:30,870 --> 01:18:30,880
of the work is to start to stitch
 

4703
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:33,430
of the work is to start to stitch
together a network and converge to

4704
01:18:33,430 --> 01:18:33,440
together a network and converge to
 

4705
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:35,270
together a network and converge to
port of la where you have the biggest

4706
01:18:35,270 --> 01:18:35,280
port of la where you have the biggest
 

4707
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:37,830
port of la where you have the biggest
port in the united states um and the

4708
01:18:37,830 --> 01:18:37,840
port in the united states um and the
 

4709
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:39,830
port in the united states um and the
amount of goods going east from there is

4710
01:18:39,830 --> 01:18:39,840
amount of goods going east from there is
 

4711
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:41,990
amount of goods going east from there is
pretty tremendous and then obviously

4712
01:18:41,990 --> 01:18:42,000
pretty tremendous and then obviously
 

4713
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:43,590
pretty tremendous and then obviously
there's you know kind of channels

4714
01:18:43,590 --> 01:18:43,600
there's you know kind of channels
 

4715
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:45,030
there's you know kind of channels
everywhere and you have extra

4716
01:18:45,030 --> 01:18:45,040
everywhere and you have extra
 

4717
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:46,950
everywhere and you have extra
complexities as you get into like snow

4718
01:18:46,950 --> 01:18:46,960
complexities as you get into like snow
 

4719
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:48,790
complexities as you get into like snow
and inclement weather and so forth but

4720
01:18:48,790 --> 01:18:48,800
and inclement weather and so forth but
 

4721
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:50,709
and inclement weather and so forth but
um what's interesting about trucking is

4722
01:18:50,709 --> 01:18:50,719
um what's interesting about trucking is
 

4723
01:18:50,719 --> 01:18:52,709
um what's interesting about trucking is
every single route segment that you add

4724
01:18:52,709 --> 01:18:52,719
every single route segment that you add
 

4725
01:18:52,719 --> 01:18:54,149
every single route segment that you add
increases the value of the whole network

4726
01:18:54,149 --> 01:18:54,159
increases the value of the whole network
 

4727
01:18:54,159 --> 01:18:55,750
increases the value of the whole network
and so it has this kind of network

4728
01:18:55,750 --> 01:18:55,760
and so it has this kind of network
 

4729
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:57,270
and so it has this kind of network
effect and cumulative effect that's very

4730
01:18:57,270 --> 01:18:57,280
effect and cumulative effect that's very
 

4731
01:18:57,280 --> 01:18:58,709
effect and cumulative effect that's very
unique and so there's all these

4732
01:18:58,709 --> 01:18:58,719
unique and so there's all these
 

4733
01:18:58,719 --> 01:19:00,470
unique and so there's all these
dimensions that we think about um and so

4734
01:19:00,470 --> 01:19:00,480
dimensions that we think about um and so
 

4735
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:02,390
dimensions that we think about um and so
in a lot of ways dallas has a really

4736
01:19:02,390 --> 01:19:02,400
in a lot of ways dallas has a really
 

4737
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:03,669
in a lot of ways dallas has a really
unique hub that opens up a lot of

4738
01:19:03,669 --> 01:19:03,679
unique hub that opens up a lot of
 

4739
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:05,430
unique hub that opens up a lot of
options has become a really valuable

4740
01:19:05,430 --> 01:19:05,440
options has become a really valuable
 

4741
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:07,270
options has become a really valuable
weber so the million questions i get

4742
01:19:07,270 --> 01:19:07,280
weber so the million questions i get
 

4743
01:19:07,280 --> 01:19:08,709
weber so the million questions i get
asked first of all

4744
01:19:08,709 --> 01:19:08,719
asked first of all
 

4745
01:19:08,719 --> 01:19:11,510
asked first of all
you mentioned level four

4746
01:19:11,510 --> 01:19:11,520
you mentioned level four
 

4747
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:13,430
you mentioned level four
for people who totally don't know

4748
01:19:13,430 --> 01:19:13,440
for people who totally don't know
 

4749
01:19:13,440 --> 01:19:16,229
for people who totally don't know
there's these levels of automation

4750
01:19:16,229 --> 01:19:16,239
there's these levels of automation
 

4751
01:19:16,239 --> 01:19:19,669
there's these levels of automation
that uh level four refers to uh

4752
01:19:19,669 --> 01:19:19,679
that uh level four refers to uh
 

4753
01:19:19,679 --> 01:19:21,750
that uh level four refers to uh
kind of the first step that you could

4754
01:19:21,750 --> 01:19:21,760
kind of the first step that you could
 

4755
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:24,229
kind of the first step that you could
recognize is fully autonomous driving

4756
01:19:24,229 --> 01:19:24,239
recognize is fully autonomous driving
 

4757
01:19:24,239 --> 01:19:26,790
recognize is fully autonomous driving
level five is really fully autonomous

4758
01:19:26,790 --> 01:19:26,800
level five is really fully autonomous
 

4759
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:28,790
level five is really fully autonomous
driving level four is kind of fully

4760
01:19:28,790 --> 01:19:28,800
driving level four is kind of fully
 

4761
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:30,550
driving level four is kind of fully
autonomous driving and then there are

4762
01:19:30,550 --> 01:19:30,560
autonomous driving and then there are
 

4763
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:32,870
autonomous driving and then there are
specific definitions depending on who

4764
01:19:32,870 --> 01:19:32,880
specific definitions depending on who
 

4765
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:35,270
specific definitions depending on who
you ask what that actually means but

4766
01:19:35,270 --> 01:19:35,280
you ask what that actually means but
 

4767
01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:37,910
you ask what that actually means but
for you what does the level four mean

4768
01:19:37,910 --> 01:19:37,920
for you what does the level four mean
 

4769
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:40,470
for you what does the level four mean
and you mentioned freeway let's say like

4770
01:19:40,470 --> 01:19:40,480
and you mentioned freeway let's say like
 

4771
01:19:40,480 --> 01:19:42,470
and you mentioned freeway let's say like
there's three parts of long-haul

4772
01:19:42,470 --> 01:19:42,480
there's three parts of long-haul
 

4773
01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:44,709
there's three parts of long-haul
trucking maybe i'm wrong in this but

4774
01:19:44,709 --> 01:19:44,719
trucking maybe i'm wrong in this but
 

4775
01:19:44,719 --> 01:19:46,630
trucking maybe i'm wrong in this but
there's freeway driving

4776
01:19:46,630 --> 01:19:46,640
there's freeway driving
 

4777
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:47,830
there's freeway driving
there's like

4778
01:19:47,830 --> 01:19:47,840
there's like
 

4779
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:49,669
there's like
truck stop

4780
01:19:49,669 --> 01:19:49,679
truck stop
 

4781
01:19:49,679 --> 01:19:51,350
truck stop
and then there's

4782
01:19:51,350 --> 01:19:51,360
and then there's
 

4783
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:55,110
and then there's
more urban-y type of area so which of

4784
01:19:55,110 --> 01:19:55,120
more urban-y type of area so which of
 

4785
01:19:55,120 --> 01:19:57,510
more urban-y type of area so which of
those do you want to tackle

4786
01:19:57,510 --> 01:19:57,520
those do you want to tackle
 

4787
01:19:57,520 --> 01:19:59,430
those do you want to tackle
which of them do you include under level

4788
01:19:59,430 --> 01:19:59,440
which of them do you include under level
 

4789
01:19:59,440 --> 01:20:01,350
which of them do you include under level
four like how do you think about this

4790
01:20:01,350 --> 01:20:01,360
four like how do you think about this
 

4791
01:20:01,360 --> 01:20:03,270
four like how do you think about this
problem what do you focus on where's the

4792
01:20:03,270 --> 01:20:03,280
problem what do you focus on where's the
 

4793
01:20:03,280 --> 01:20:04,870
problem what do you focus on where's the
biggest impact to be had in the short

4794
01:20:04,870 --> 01:20:04,880
biggest impact to be had in the short
 

4795
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:05,750
biggest impact to be had in the short
term

4796
01:20:05,750 --> 01:20:05,760
term
 

4797
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:07,669
term
so the goal is to we get we got to get

4798
01:20:07,669 --> 01:20:07,679
so the goal is to we get we got to get
 

4799
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:09,270
so the goal is to we get we got to get
to market as fast as we can because the

4800
01:20:09,270 --> 01:20:09,280
to market as fast as we can because the
 

4801
01:20:09,280 --> 01:20:10,870
to market as fast as we can because the
moment you get the market you just learn

4802
01:20:10,870 --> 01:20:10,880
moment you get the market you just learn
 

4803
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:12,470
moment you get the market you just learn
so much and it influences everything

4804
01:20:12,470 --> 01:20:12,480
so much and it influences everything
 

4805
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:14,870
so much and it influences everything
that you do and it is um

4806
01:20:14,870 --> 01:20:14,880
that you do and it is um
 

4807
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:16,629
that you do and it is um
uh i mean one of the experiences that

4808
01:20:16,629 --> 01:20:16,639
uh i mean one of the experiences that
 

4809
01:20:16,639 --> 01:20:19,430
uh i mean one of the experiences that
carried over from before is that you add

4810
01:20:19,430 --> 01:20:19,440
carried over from before is that you add
 

4811
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:20,950
carried over from before is that you add
constraints you figure out the right

4812
01:20:20,950 --> 01:20:20,960
constraints you figure out the right
 

4813
01:20:20,960 --> 01:20:22,550
constraints you figure out the right
compromises you do whatever it takes

4814
01:20:22,550 --> 01:20:22,560
compromises you do whatever it takes
 

4815
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:24,709
compromises you do whatever it takes
because getting the market like is so

4816
01:20:24,709 --> 01:20:24,719
because getting the market like is so
 

4817
01:20:24,719 --> 01:20:26,790
because getting the market like is so
critical right and here with autonomous

4818
01:20:26,790 --> 01:20:26,800
critical right and here with autonomous
 

4819
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:28,149
critical right and here with autonomous
driving you can get to market in so many

4820
01:20:28,149 --> 01:20:28,159
driving you can get to market in so many
 

4821
01:20:28,159 --> 01:20:30,070
driving you can get to market in so many
different ways that's right and so one

4822
01:20:30,070 --> 01:20:30,080
different ways that's right and so one
 

4823
01:20:30,080 --> 01:20:31,990
different ways that's right and so one
of the simplified simplifications that

4824
01:20:31,990 --> 01:20:32,000
of the simplified simplifications that
 

4825
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,149
of the simplified simplifications that
we intentionally have put on is using

4826
01:20:34,149 --> 01:20:34,159
we intentionally have put on is using
 

4827
01:20:34,159 --> 01:20:35,590
we intentionally have put on is using
what we call transfer hubs where you can

4828
01:20:35,590 --> 01:20:35,600
what we call transfer hubs where you can
 

4829
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:36,790
what we call transfer hubs where you can
imagine

4830
01:20:36,790 --> 01:20:36,800
imagine
 

4831
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:39,110
imagine
depots uh that are

4832
01:20:39,110 --> 01:20:39,120
depots uh that are
 

4833
01:20:39,120 --> 01:20:39,910
depots uh that are
uh

4834
01:20:39,910 --> 01:20:39,920
uh
 

4835
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:41,590
uh
at the entry points to metropolitan

areas like let's say dallas like the hub

4838
01:20:43,750 --> 01:20:43,760
areas like let's say dallas like the hub
 

4839
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:46,470
areas like let's say dallas like the hub
that we're building which does a few

4840
01:20:46,470 --> 01:20:46,480
that we're building which does a few
 

4841
01:20:46,480 --> 01:20:48,310
that we're building which does a few
things that are very valuable so from a

4842
01:20:48,310 --> 01:20:48,320
things that are very valuable so from a
 

4843
01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:50,070
things that are very valuable so from a
first product standpoint you can

4844
01:20:50,070 --> 01:20:50,080
first product standpoint you can
 

4845
01:20:50,080 --> 01:20:52,229
first product standpoint you can
automate transfer hub to transfer hub

4846
01:20:52,229 --> 01:20:52,239
automate transfer hub to transfer hub
 

4847
01:20:52,239 --> 01:20:55,350
automate transfer hub to transfer hub
and that path from the transfer hub to

4848
01:20:55,350 --> 01:20:55,360
and that path from the transfer hub to
 

4849
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:56,149
and that path from the transfer hub to
the

4850
01:20:56,149 --> 01:20:56,159
the
 

4851
01:20:56,159 --> 01:20:58,390
the
you know the full freeway route can be a

4852
01:20:58,390 --> 01:20:58,400
you know the full freeway route can be a
 

4853
01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:00,310
you know the full freeway route can be a
very intentional single route that you

4854
01:21:00,310 --> 01:21:00,320
very intentional single route that you
 

4855
01:21:00,320 --> 01:21:02,070
very intentional single route that you
can select for the features that you

4856
01:21:02,070 --> 01:21:02,080
can select for the features that you
 

4857
01:21:02,080 --> 01:21:03,430
can select for the features that you
feel you want to handle at that point in

4858
01:21:03,430 --> 01:21:03,440
feel you want to handle at that point in
 

4859
01:21:03,440 --> 01:21:05,830
feel you want to handle at that point in
time then you build the hub

4860
01:21:05,830 --> 01:21:05,840
time then you build the hub
 

4861
01:21:05,840 --> 01:21:07,669
time then you build the hub
specifically designed

4862
01:21:07,669 --> 01:21:07,679
specifically designed
 

4863
01:21:07,679 --> 01:21:08,790
specifically designed
for time tracking and that's what's

4864
01:21:08,790 --> 01:21:08,800
for time tracking and that's what's
 

4865
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:10,070
for time tracking and that's what's
going to happen actually like and you

4866
01:21:10,070 --> 01:21:10,080
going to happen actually like and you
 

4867
01:21:10,080 --> 01:21:11,510
going to happen actually like and you
get you need to come out in january and

4868
01:21:11,510 --> 01:21:11,520
get you need to come out in january and
 

4869
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:12,390
get you need to come out in january and
check it out because it's going to be

4870
01:21:12,390 --> 01:21:12,400
check it out because it's going to be
 

4871
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:14,229
check it out because it's going to be
really cool it's the not only is it our

4872
01:21:14,229 --> 01:21:14,239
really cool it's the not only is it our
 

4873
01:21:14,239 --> 01:21:17,669
really cool it's the not only is it our
main operating um headquarters for our

01:21:17,669 --> 01:21:17,679
main operating um headquarters for our
 

4875
01:21:17,679 --> 01:21:20,550
main operating um headquarters for our
fleet there but it will be the first uh

in terms of where do they enter where do
 

4883
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:27,830
in terms of where do they enter where do
they depart how do you think about the

4884
01:21:27,830 --> 01:21:27,840
they depart how do you think about the
 

4885
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:29,270
they depart how do you think about the
flow of people goods everything it's

4886
01:21:29,270 --> 01:21:29,280
flow of people goods everything it's
 

4887
01:21:29,280 --> 01:21:31,110
flow of people goods everything it's
like it's quite cool and it's really

4888
01:21:31,110 --> 01:21:31,120
like it's quite cool and it's really
 

4889
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:32,629
like it's quite cool and it's really
beautiful on how it's thought through

4890
01:21:32,629 --> 01:21:32,639
beautiful on how it's thought through
 

4891
01:21:32,639 --> 01:21:35,270
beautiful on how it's thought through
and so early on it is totally reasonable

4892
01:21:35,270 --> 01:21:35,280
and so early on it is totally reasonable
 

4893
01:21:35,280 --> 01:21:36,950
and so early on it is totally reasonable
to do the last

4894
01:21:36,950 --> 01:21:36,960
to do the last
 

4895
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:39,669
to do the last
five miles manually to get to the final

five miles manually to get to the final
 

4897
01:21:39,679 --> 01:21:41,189
five miles manually to get to the final
kind of depot to avoid having to solve

4898
01:21:41,189 --> 01:21:41,199
kind of depot to avoid having to solve
 

4899
01:21:41,199 --> 01:21:42,629
kind of depot to avoid having to solve
the general surface street problem which

4900
01:21:42,629 --> 01:21:42,639
the general surface street problem which
 

4901
01:21:42,639 --> 01:21:44,790
the general surface street problem which
is obviously very complex now when the

4902
01:21:44,790 --> 01:21:44,800
is obviously very complex now when the
 

4903
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:48,149
is obviously very complex now when the
time comes and we are increasingly we're

4904
01:21:48,149 --> 01:21:48,159
time comes and we are increasingly we're
 

4905
01:21:48,159 --> 01:21:49,270
time comes and we are increasingly we're
already we're pushing on some of this

4906
01:21:49,270 --> 01:21:49,280
already we're pushing on some of this
 

4907
01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:50,550
already we're pushing on some of this
but we will increasingly be pushing on

4908
01:21:50,550 --> 01:21:50,560
but we will increasingly be pushing on
 

4909
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:52,629
but we will increasingly be pushing on
surface street capabilities to build out

4910
01:21:52,629 --> 01:21:52,639
surface street capabilities to build out
 

4911
01:21:52,639 --> 01:21:54,709
surface street capabilities to build out
the value chain to go all the way deeper

4912
01:21:54,709 --> 01:21:54,719
the value chain to go all the way deeper
 

4913
01:21:54,719 --> 01:21:56,149
the value chain to go all the way deeper
to depot instead of transfer hub the

4914
01:21:56,149 --> 01:21:56,159
to depot instead of transfer hub the
 

4915
01:21:56,159 --> 01:21:58,229
to depot instead of transfer hub the
transfer hub and we have probably the

4916
01:21:58,229 --> 01:21:58,239
transfer hub and we have probably the
 

4917
01:21:58,239 --> 01:21:59,590
transfer hub and we have probably the
best advantages in the world because of

4918
01:21:59,590 --> 01:21:59,600
best advantages in the world because of
 

4919
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:01,030
best advantages in the world because of
all the waymo experience on surface

4920
01:22:01,030 --> 01:22:01,040
all the waymo experience on surface
 

4921
01:22:01,040 --> 01:22:03,270
all the waymo experience on surface
streets but that's not the highest roi

4922
01:22:03,270 --> 01:22:03,280
streets but that's not the highest roi
 

4923
01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:05,189
streets but that's not the highest roi
right now where the highest roi is

01:22:05,189 --> 01:22:05,199
right now where the highest roi is
 

4925
01:22:05,199 --> 01:22:07,110
right now where the highest roi is
hub the hub and get the routes going and

so when you ask what's l4

4928
01:22:09,350 --> 01:22:09,360
so when you ask what's l4
 

4929
01:22:09,360 --> 01:22:11,990
so when you ask what's l4
l4 can be applied to any domain

01:22:11,990 --> 01:22:12,000
l4 can be applied to any domain
 

4931
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:13,350
l4 can be applied to any domain
operating domain or scope but it's

4932
01:22:13,350 --> 01:22:13,360
operating domain or scope but it's
 

4933
01:22:13,360 --> 01:22:14,950
operating domain or scope but it's
effectively for the places where we say

effectively for the places where we say
 

4935
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:17,750
effectively for the places where we say
we're ready for autonomous operation we

01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:28,870
self-driving truck with no uh human
behind the wheel that is l4 autonomy and

4944
01:22:28,870 --> 01:22:28,880
behind the wheel that is l4 autonomy and
 

4945
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:29,990
behind the wheel that is l4 autonomy and
it doesn't mean that you operate in

4946
01:22:29,990 --> 01:22:30,000
it doesn't mean that you operate in
 

4947
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:31,110
it doesn't mean that you operate in
every condition it doesn't mean you

4948
01:22:31,110 --> 01:22:31,120
every condition it doesn't mean you
 

4949
01:22:31,120 --> 01:22:33,350
every condition it doesn't mean you
operate on every road but for a

4950
01:22:33,350 --> 01:22:33,360
operate on every road but for a
 

4951
01:22:33,360 --> 01:22:36,550
operate on every road but for a
particularly well-defined area uh

4952
01:22:36,550 --> 01:22:36,560
particularly well-defined area uh
 

4953
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:38,629
particularly well-defined area uh
operating conditions routes kind of

4954
01:22:38,629 --> 01:22:38,639
operating conditions routes kind of
 

4955
01:22:38,639 --> 01:22:40,470
operating conditions routes kind of
domain you are fully autonomous and

4956
01:22:40,470 --> 01:22:40,480
domain you are fully autonomous and
 

4957
01:22:40,480 --> 01:22:41,990
domain you are fully autonomous and
that's the difference between l4 and l5

4958
01:22:41,990 --> 01:22:42,000
that's the difference between l4 and l5
 

4959
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:43,590
that's the difference between l4 and l5
and most people would agree that at

4960
01:22:43,590 --> 01:22:43,600
and most people would agree that at
 

4961
01:22:43,600 --> 01:22:45,030
and most people would agree that at
least any time in the foreseeable future

4962
01:22:45,030 --> 01:22:45,040
least any time in the foreseeable future
 

4963
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:46,870
least any time in the foreseeable future
l5 is just not even really worth

4964
01:22:46,870 --> 01:22:46,880
l5 is just not even really worth
 

4965
01:22:46,880 --> 01:22:48,550
l5 is just not even really worth
thinking about because there's always

4966
01:22:48,550 --> 01:22:48,560
thinking about because there's always
 

4967
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:50,470
thinking about because there's always
going to be these extremes

4968
01:22:50,470 --> 01:22:50,480
going to be these extremes
 

4969
01:22:50,480 --> 01:22:53,030
going to be these extremes
and so it's a race and a almost like a

4970
01:22:53,030 --> 01:22:53,040
and so it's a race and a almost like a
 

4971
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:55,189
and so it's a race and a almost like a
game where you think of what is the

4972
01:22:55,189 --> 01:22:55,199
game where you think of what is the
 

4973
01:22:55,199 --> 01:22:57,750
game where you think of what is the
sequence of expanded capabilities that

4974
01:22:57,750 --> 01:22:57,760
sequence of expanded capabilities that
 

4975
01:22:57,760 --> 01:22:59,910
sequence of expanded capabilities that
create the most value and teach us the

4976
01:22:59,910 --> 01:22:59,920
create the most value and teach us the
 

4977
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:02,149
create the most value and teach us the
most and create this feedback loop where

4978
01:23:02,149 --> 01:23:02,159
most and create this feedback loop where
 

4979
01:23:02,159 --> 01:23:03,750
most and create this feedback loop where
we're building out and unlocking more

4980
01:23:03,750 --> 01:23:03,760
we're building out and unlocking more
 

4981
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:05,990
we're building out and unlocking more
and more capability over time i gotta

4982
01:23:05,990 --> 01:23:06,000
and more capability over time i gotta
 

4983
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,629
and more capability over time i gotta
ask you just curious so first of all i

4984
01:23:08,629 --> 01:23:08,639
ask you just curious so first of all i
 

4985
01:23:08,639 --> 01:23:11,189
ask you just curious so first of all i
have to when i'm allowed to visit the

4986
01:23:11,189 --> 01:23:11,199
have to when i'm allowed to visit the
 

4987
01:23:11,199 --> 01:23:13,110
have to when i'm allowed to visit the
dallas facility because it's super cool

4988
01:23:13,110 --> 01:23:13,120
dallas facility because it's super cool
 

4989
01:23:13,120 --> 01:23:15,189
dallas facility because it's super cool
it's like robot

4990
01:23:15,189 --> 01:23:15,199
it's like robot
 

4991
01:23:15,199 --> 01:23:17,350
it's like robot
on the giving and the receiving end it's

4992
01:23:17,350 --> 01:23:17,360
on the giving and the receiving end it's
 

4993
01:23:17,360 --> 01:23:20,070
on the giving and the receiving end it's
the truck is a robot and the the hub is

4994
01:23:20,070 --> 01:23:20,080
the truck is a robot and the the hub is
 

4995
01:23:20,080 --> 01:23:21,669
the truck is a robot and the the hub is
a robot yeah it's got to be very robot

4996
01:23:21,669 --> 01:23:21,679
a robot yeah it's got to be very robot
 

4997
01:23:21,679 --> 01:23:24,070
a robot yeah it's got to be very robot
friendly so yeah that's great

4998
01:23:24,070 --> 01:23:24,080
friendly so yeah that's great
 

4999
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:26,390
friendly so yeah that's great
i will feel at home uh

5000
01:23:26,390 --> 01:23:26,400
i will feel at home uh
 

5001
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:28,390
i will feel at home uh
the what's the sensor suite like on the

5002
01:23:28,390 --> 01:23:28,400
the what's the sensor suite like on the
 

5003
01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:30,790
the what's the sensor suite like on the
hub if you can just high level mention

5004
01:23:30,790 --> 01:23:30,800
hub if you can just high level mention
 

5005
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:31,830
hub if you can just high level mention
it is

5006
01:23:31,830 --> 01:23:31,840
it is
 

5007
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:34,470
it is
does the hub have like lidars and like

5008
01:23:34,470 --> 01:23:34,480
does the hub have like lidars and like
 

5009
01:23:34,480 --> 01:23:37,189
does the hub have like lidars and like
is is it is the truck doing most of the

5010
01:23:37,189 --> 01:23:37,199
is is it is the truck doing most of the
 

5011
01:23:37,199 --> 01:23:39,030
is is it is the truck doing most of the
intelligence or is the hub also

5012
01:23:39,030 --> 01:23:39,040
intelligence or is the hub also
 

5013
01:23:39,040 --> 01:23:41,270
intelligence or is the hub also
intelligent yeah so most of it will be

5014
01:23:41,270 --> 01:23:41,280
intelligent yeah so most of it will be
 

5015
01:23:41,280 --> 01:23:43,189
intelligent yeah so most of it will be
the truck and uh everything is like

5016
01:23:43,189 --> 01:23:43,199
the truck and uh everything is like
 

5017
01:23:43,199 --> 01:23:46,070
the truck and uh everything is like
connected like so we uh we have our

5018
01:23:46,070 --> 01:23:46,080
connected like so we uh we have our
 

5019
01:23:46,080 --> 01:23:47,270
connected like so we uh we have our
servers where we know exactly where

5020
01:23:47,270 --> 01:23:47,280
servers where we know exactly where
 

5021
01:23:47,280 --> 01:23:48,870
servers where we know exactly where
every truck is we know exactly what's

5022
01:23:48,870 --> 01:23:48,880
every truck is we know exactly what's
 

5023
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:50,470
every truck is we know exactly what's
happening at a hub and so you can

5024
01:23:50,470 --> 01:23:50,480
happening at a hub and so you can
 

5025
01:23:50,480 --> 01:23:52,390
happening at a hub and so you can
imagine like a large back-end system

5026
01:23:52,390 --> 01:23:52,400
imagine like a large back-end system
 

5027
01:23:52,400 --> 01:23:55,110
imagine like a large back-end system
that over time starts to manage uh

5028
01:23:55,110 --> 01:23:55,120
that over time starts to manage uh
 

5029
01:23:55,120 --> 01:23:57,590
that over time starts to manage uh
timings goods delivery windows all these

5030
01:23:57,590 --> 01:23:57,600
timings goods delivery windows all these
 

5031
01:23:57,600 --> 01:24:00,310
timings goods delivery windows all these
sort of things and so you don't actually

5032
01:24:00,310 --> 01:24:00,320
sort of things and so you don't actually
 

5033
01:24:00,320 --> 01:24:01,350
sort of things and so you don't actually
uh

5034
01:24:01,350 --> 01:24:01,360
uh
 

5035
01:24:01,360 --> 01:24:03,750
uh
need to um there might be special cases

5036
01:24:03,750 --> 01:24:03,760
need to um there might be special cases
 

5037
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:05,110
need to um there might be special cases
where that is valuable to equip some

5038
01:24:05,110 --> 01:24:05,120
where that is valuable to equip some
 

5039
01:24:05,120 --> 01:24:07,110
where that is valuable to equip some
sensors in the hub but a majority of the

5040
01:24:07,110 --> 01:24:07,120
sensors in the hub but a majority of the
 

5041
01:24:07,120 --> 01:24:08,629
sensors in the hub but a majority of the
intelligence is going to be on the truck

5042
01:24:08,629 --> 01:24:08,639
intelligence is going to be on the truck
 

5043
01:24:08,639 --> 01:24:09,830
intelligence is going to be on the truck
because um

5044
01:24:09,830 --> 01:24:09,840
because um
 

5045
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:11,990
because um
whatever is relevant to the truck

5046
01:24:11,990 --> 01:24:12,000
whatever is relevant to the truck
 

5047
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:13,750
whatever is relevant to the truck
relevance should be seen by the truck

5048
01:24:13,750 --> 01:24:13,760
relevance should be seen by the truck
 

5049
01:24:13,760 --> 01:24:15,270
relevance should be seen by the truck
and can be relayed

5050
01:24:15,270 --> 01:24:15,280
and can be relayed
 

5051
01:24:15,280 --> 01:24:17,510
and can be relayed
uh remotely for any sort of kind of

5052
01:24:17,510 --> 01:24:17,520
uh remotely for any sort of kind of
 

5053
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:19,750
uh remotely for any sort of kind of
cognizance or decision making but

5054
01:24:19,750 --> 01:24:19,760
cognizance or decision making but
 

5055
01:24:19,760 --> 01:24:21,430
cognizance or decision making but
there's a distinct type of workflow

5056
01:24:21,430 --> 01:24:21,440
there's a distinct type of workflow
 

5057
01:24:21,440 --> 01:24:23,990
there's a distinct type of workflow
where um where do you check trucks where

5058
01:24:23,990 --> 01:24:24,000
where um where do you check trucks where
 

5059
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:25,110
where um where do you check trucks where
do you want them to enter what if

5060
01:24:25,110 --> 01:24:25,120
do you want them to enter what if
 

5061
01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:26,950
do you want them to enter what if
there's many operating at once where's

5062
01:24:26,950 --> 01:24:26,960
there's many operating at once where's
 

5063
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:29,270
there's many operating at once where's
the staging area to depart how do you

5064
01:24:29,270 --> 01:24:29,280
the staging area to depart how do you
 

5065
01:24:29,280 --> 01:24:32,470
the staging area to depart how do you
set up the flow of humans and human cars

5066
01:24:32,470 --> 01:24:32,480
set up the flow of humans and human cars
 

5067
01:24:32,480 --> 01:24:34,629
set up the flow of humans and human cars
and traffic so that you minimize the

5068
01:24:34,629 --> 01:24:34,639
and traffic so that you minimize the
 

5069
01:24:34,639 --> 01:24:36,790
and traffic so that you minimize the
interaction between humans and kind of

5070
01:24:36,790 --> 01:24:36,800
interaction between humans and kind of
 

5071
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:38,870
interaction between humans and kind of
self-driving trucks uh and then how do

5072
01:24:38,870 --> 01:24:38,880
self-driving trucks uh and then how do
 

5073
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:40,229
self-driving trucks uh and then how do
you even intelligently select the

5074
01:24:40,229 --> 01:24:40,239
you even intelligently select the
 

5075
01:24:40,239 --> 01:24:42,310
you even intelligently select the
locations of these transfer hubs that

5076
01:24:42,310 --> 01:24:42,320
locations of these transfer hubs that
 

5077
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:44,470
locations of these transfer hubs that
are both really great service locations

5078
01:24:44,470 --> 01:24:44,480
are both really great service locations
 

5079
01:24:44,480 --> 01:24:45,910
are both really great service locations
for a metropolitan area and there could

5080
01:24:45,910 --> 01:24:45,920
for a metropolitan area and there could
 

5081
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:47,750
for a metropolitan area and there could
be over time many of them for a

5082
01:24:47,750 --> 01:24:47,760
be over time many of them for a
 

5083
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:49,430
be over time many of them for a
metropolitan area

5084
01:24:49,430 --> 01:24:49,440

01:25:06,070 --> 01:25:06,080
to have no human in the truck
 

5101
01:25:06,080 --> 01:25:07,590
to have no human in the truck
the goal is to have no human in the

5102
01:25:07,590 --> 01:25:07,600
the goal is to have no human in the
 

5103
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:09,270
the goal is to have no human in the
truck now of course right now we're

5104
01:25:09,270 --> 01:25:09,280
truck now of course right now we're
 

5105
01:25:09,280 --> 01:25:11,350
truck now of course right now we're
testing with expert operators and so

5106
01:25:11,350 --> 01:25:11,360
testing with expert operators and so
 

5107
01:25:11,360 --> 01:25:14,629
testing with expert operators and so
forth but um the goal is to um now there

5108
01:25:14,629 --> 01:25:14,639
forth but um the goal is to um now there
 

5109
01:25:14,639 --> 01:25:15,910
forth but um the goal is to um now there
might be circumstances where it makes

5110
01:25:15,910 --> 01:25:15,920
might be circumstances where it makes
 

5111
01:25:15,920 --> 01:25:18,470
might be circumstances where it makes
sense to have a human or uh and and

5112
01:25:18,470 --> 01:25:18,480
sense to have a human or uh and and
 

5113
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:19,669
sense to have a human or uh and and
obviously these trucks can also be

5114
01:25:19,669 --> 01:25:19,679
obviously these trucks can also be
 

5115
01:25:19,679 --> 01:25:21,910
obviously these trucks can also be
manually driven so sometimes like our we

5116
01:25:21,910 --> 01:25:21,920
manually driven so sometimes like our we
 

5117
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:23,990
manually driven so sometimes like our we
talk with our fleet partners about how

5118
01:25:23,990 --> 01:25:24,000
talk with our fleet partners about how
 

5119
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:27,910
talk with our fleet partners about how
um you can buy a waymo equipped diamor

5120
01:25:27,910 --> 01:25:27,920
um you can buy a waymo equipped diamor
 

5121

that add safety systems and so forth but

5130
01:25:37,990 --> 01:25:38,000
that add safety systems and so forth but
 

5131
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:39,430
that add safety systems and so forth but
as soon as they become

as soon as they become
 

5133
01:25:39,440 --> 01:25:41,189

01:25:41,189 --> 01:25:41,199
as soon as we expand in software the
 

5135
01:25:41,199 --> 01:25:43,270
as soon as we expand in software the

01:25:47,830 --> 01:25:47,840
now start using them um in real time and
 

5141
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:51,189
now start using them um in real time and
so you can imagine uh this mixed use but

5142
01:25:51,189 --> 01:25:51,199
so you can imagine uh this mixed use but
 

5143
01:25:51,199 --> 01:25:53,430
so you can imagine uh this mixed use but
at the end of the day the largest value

literally just it's old school like they
it's just like it's not computer it's

01:26:35,110 --> 01:26:35,120
it's just like it's not computer it's

5190
01:26:37,430 --> 01:26:37,440
like
 

5191
01:26:37,440 --> 01:26:39,510
like
truckers are almost like contractors

there there's an independence and

5194
01:26:41,510 --> 01:26:41,520
there there's an independence and
 

5195
01:26:41,520 --> 01:26:43,110
there there's an independence and
there's not a nice interface where they

5196
01:26:43,110 --> 01:26:43,120
there's not a nice interface where they
 

5197
01:26:43,120 --> 01:26:44,390
there's not a nice interface where they
can communicate where they're going

5198
01:26:44,390 --> 01:26:44,400
can communicate where they're going
 

5199
01:26:44,400 --> 01:26:45,510
can communicate where they're going
where they're at

01:27:16,950 --> 01:27:16,960
of problems that are like you wanna you
 

5233
01:27:16,960 --> 01:27:18,550
of problems that are like you wanna you
have to solve to get to like the first

5234
01:27:18,550 --> 01:27:18,560
have to solve to get to like the first
 

5235
01:27:18,560 --> 01:27:20,070
have to solve to get to like the first
checkpoints and first drive list and so

5236
01:27:20,070 --> 01:27:20,080
checkpoints and first drive list and so
 

5237
01:27:20,080 --> 01:27:21,990
checkpoints and first drive list and so
forth and inevitably like in a space

5238
01:27:21,990 --> 01:27:22,000
forth and inevitably like in a space
 

5239
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,550
forth and inevitably like in a space
like this you plug in initially into the

5240
01:27:24,550 --> 01:27:24,560
like this you plug in initially into the
 

5241
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:26,310
like this you plug in initially into the
existing kind of system and start to

5242
01:27:26,310 --> 01:27:26,320
existing kind of system and start to

kind of you know learn and iterate but

5244
01:27:28,070 --> 01:27:28,080
kind of you know learn and iterate but
 

5245
01:27:28,080 --> 01:27:29,910
kind of you know learn and iterate but
um that opportunity is massive and so

5246
01:27:29,910 --> 01:27:29,920
um that opportunity is massive and so
 

5247
01:27:29,920 --> 01:27:31,350
um that opportunity is massive and so
you know a couple of the factors that um

5248
01:27:31,350 --> 01:27:31,360
you know a couple of the factors that um
 

5249
01:27:31,360 --> 01:27:34,470
you know a couple of the factors that um
play into it so first of all um there's

5250
01:27:34,470 --> 01:27:34,480
play into it so first of all um there's
 

5251
01:27:34,480 --> 01:27:36,229
play into it so first of all um there's
obviously just the physical constraints

5252
01:27:36,229 --> 01:27:36,239
obviously just the physical constraints
 

5253
01:27:36,239 --> 01:27:38,790
obviously just the physical constraints

5257
01:27:41,280 --> 01:27:43,590
some fleets have a 95 attrition rate you
know right now because of just

5258
01:27:43,590 --> 01:27:43,600
know right now because of just
 

5259
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:46,070
know right now because of just
this demands and like you know kind of

5260
01:27:46,070 --> 01:27:46,080
this demands and like you know kind of
 

5261
01:27:46,080 --> 01:27:47,990
this demands and like you know kind of
gaps in competition and so forth and

5262
01:27:47,990 --> 01:27:48,000
gaps in competition and so forth and
 

5263
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:49,510
gaps in competition and so forth and
then it's also incredibly fragmented

5264
01:27:49,510 --> 01:27:49,520
then it's also incredibly fragmented
 

5265
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:50,470
then it's also incredibly fragmented
where

5266
01:27:50,470 --> 01:27:50,480
where
 

5267
01:27:50,480 --> 01:27:52,390
where
you would be shocked at like when you

5268
01:27:52,390 --> 01:27:52,400
you would be shocked at like when you
 

5269
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:53,590
you would be shocked at like when you
when you look at industries like when

5270
01:27:53,590 --> 01:27:53,600
when you look at industries like when
 

5271
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:55,350
when you look at industries like when
you think of the top 10 players like the

5272
01:27:55,350 --> 01:27:55,360
you think of the top 10 players like the
 

5273
01:27:55,360 --> 01:27:56,709
you think of the top 10 players like the
biggest fleets like the walmarts and

5274
01:27:56,709 --> 01:27:56,719
biggest fleets like the walmarts and
 

5275
01:27:56,719 --> 01:27:59,430
biggest fleets like the walmarts and
fedexes and so forth the percentage of

5276
01:27:59,430 --> 01:27:59,440
fedexes and so forth the percentage of
 

5277
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:00,709
fedexes and so forth the percentage of
the overall trucking market that's

5278
01:28:00,709 --> 01:28:00,719
the overall trucking market that's
 

5279
01:28:00,719 --> 01:28:02,629
the overall trucking market that's
captured by the top 10 or 50 fleets is

5280
01:28:02,629 --> 01:28:02,639
captured by the top 10 or 50 fleets is
 

5281
01:28:02,639 --> 01:28:05,510
captured by the top 10 or 50 fleets is
surprisingly small um the average kind

5282
01:28:05,510 --> 01:28:05,520
surprisingly small um the average kind
 

5283
01:28:05,520 --> 01:28:08,470
surprisingly small um the average kind
of uh truck operation is like a one to

5284
01:28:08,470 --> 01:28:08,480
of uh truck operation is like a one to
 

5285
01:28:08,480 --> 01:28:11,350
of uh truck operation is like a one to
five truck you know family business um

5286
01:28:11,350 --> 01:28:11,360
five truck you know family business um
 

5287
01:28:11,360 --> 01:28:13,189
five truck you know family business um
and so and so there's just like a huge

5288
01:28:13,189 --> 01:28:13,199
and so and so there's just like a huge
 

5289
01:28:13,199 --> 01:28:14,390
and so and so there's just like a huge
amount of like

5290
01:28:14,390 --> 01:28:14,400
amount of like
 

5291
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:16,950
amount of like
fragmentation which makes for um

5292
01:28:16,950 --> 01:28:16,960
fragmentation which makes for um
 

5293
01:28:16,960 --> 01:28:19,030
fragmentation which makes for um
really interesting challenges in kind of

5294
01:28:19,030 --> 01:28:19,040
really interesting challenges in kind of
 

5295
01:28:19,040 --> 01:28:21,189
really interesting challenges in kind of
stitching together through like bulletin

5296
01:28:21,189 --> 01:28:21,199
stitching together through like bulletin
 

5297
01:28:21,199 --> 01:28:23,430
stitching together through like bulletin
boards and brokerages and some people

5298
01:28:23,430 --> 01:28:23,440
boards and brokerages and some people
 

5299
01:28:23,440 --> 01:28:25,110
boards and brokerages and some people
run their own fleets and and this

5300
01:28:25,110 --> 01:28:25,120
run their own fleets and and this
 

5301
01:28:25,120 --> 01:28:28,790
run their own fleets and and this
world's kind of like evolving um but

5302
01:28:28,790 --> 01:28:28,800
world's kind of like evolving um but
 

5303
01:28:28,800 --> 01:28:31,590
world's kind of like evolving um but
it is one of the less digitized and

5304
01:28:31,590 --> 01:28:31,600
it is one of the less digitized and
 

5305
01:28:31,600 --> 01:28:34,470
it is one of the less digitized and
optimized worlds that there is

5306
01:28:34,470 --> 01:28:34,480
optimized worlds that there is
 

5307
01:28:34,480 --> 01:28:36,070
optimized worlds that there is
and the part that is optimized is

5308
01:28:36,070 --> 01:28:36,080
and the part that is optimized is
 

5309
01:28:36,080 --> 01:28:38,550
and the part that is optimized is
optimized to the constraints of today

5310
01:28:38,550 --> 01:28:38,560
optimized to the constraints of today
 

5311
01:28:38,560 --> 01:28:40,310
optimized to the constraints of today
and even within the constraints of today

01:28:40,310 --> 01:28:40,320
and even within the constraints of today
 

5313
01:28:40,320 --> 01:28:41,910
and even within the constraints of today
this is the 900 billion dollar industry

5314
01:28:41,910 --> 01:28:41,920
this is the 900 billion dollar industry
 

5315
01:28:41,920 --> 01:28:43,189
this is the 900 billion dollar industry
in the u.s

5316
01:28:43,189 --> 01:28:43,199
in the u.s
 

5317
01:28:43,199 --> 01:28:44,870
in the u.s
and it's continuing to grow it feels

5318
01:28:44,870 --> 01:28:44,880
and it's continuing to grow it feels
 

5319
01:28:44,880 --> 01:28:46,870
and it's continuing to grow it feels
like from a business perspective

5320
01:28:46,870 --> 01:28:46,880
like from a business perspective
 

5321
01:28:46,880 --> 01:28:48,790
like from a business perspective
if i were to predict

5322
01:28:48,790 --> 01:28:48,800
if i were to predict
 

5323
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:50,390
if i were to predict
that while trying to solve the

5324
01:28:50,390 --> 01:28:50,400
that while trying to solve the
 

5325
01:28:50,400 --> 01:28:52,629
that while trying to solve the
autonomous trucking problem waymo might

5326
01:28:52,629 --> 01:28:52,639
autonomous trucking problem waymo might
 

5327
01:28:52,639 --> 01:28:55,430
autonomous trucking problem waymo might
solve first the logistics problem

5328
01:28:55,430 --> 01:28:55,440
solve first the logistics problem
 

5329
01:28:55,440 --> 01:28:57,270
solve first the logistics problem
like because that that would already be

5330
01:28:57,270 --> 01:28:57,280
like because that that would already be
 

5331
01:28:57,280 --> 01:28:59,910
like because that that would already be
a huge impact yeah so on the way to

5332
01:28:59,910 --> 01:28:59,920
a huge impact yeah so on the way to
 

5333
01:28:59,920 --> 01:29:01,990
a huge impact yeah so on the way to
solving autonomous trucking

5334
01:29:01,990 --> 01:29:02,000
solving autonomous trucking
 

5335
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,390
solving autonomous trucking
the human driven like there's so much

5336
01:29:04,390 --> 01:29:04,400
the human driven like there's so much
 

5337
01:29:04,400 --> 01:29:06,629
the human driven like there's so much
opportunity to

5338
01:29:06,629 --> 01:29:06,639
opportunity to
 

5339
01:29:06,639 --> 01:29:09,669
opportunity to
significantly improve the human driven

5340
01:29:09,669 --> 01:29:09,679
significantly improve the human driven
 

5341
01:29:09,679 --> 01:29:12,709
significantly improve the human driven
trucking the timing the logistics so you

5342
01:29:12,709 --> 01:29:12,719
trucking the timing the logistics so you
 

5343
01:29:12,719 --> 01:29:14,550
trucking the timing the logistics so you
use humans optimally the handoffs the

5344
01:29:14,550 --> 01:29:14,560
use humans optimally the handoffs the
 

5345
01:29:14,560 --> 01:29:17,270
use humans optimally the handoffs the
like you know well even that you i mean

5346
01:29:17,270 --> 01:29:17,280
like you know well even that you i mean
 

5347
01:29:17,280 --> 01:29:18,709
like you know well even that you i mean
you get really ambitious you start to

5348
01:29:18,709 --> 01:29:18,719
you get really ambitious you start to
 

5349
01:29:18,719 --> 01:29:21,030
you get really ambitious you start to
expand this beyond like how does the uh

5350
01:29:21,030 --> 01:29:21,040
expand this beyond like how does the uh
 

5351
01:29:21,040 --> 01:29:22,470
expand this beyond like how does the uh
fulfillment center work and like how

5352
01:29:22,470 --> 01:29:22,480
fulfillment center work and like how
 

5353
01:29:22,480 --> 01:29:23,990
fulfillment center work and like how
does the transfer hub work how does a

5354
01:29:23,990 --> 01:29:24,000
does the transfer hub work how does a
 

5355
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:25,590
does the transfer hub work how does a
warehouse work to

5356
01:29:25,590 --> 01:29:25,600
warehouse work to
 

5357
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:26,950
warehouse work to
i mean there's a lot of opportunities to

5358
01:29:26,950 --> 01:29:26,960
i mean there's a lot of opportunities to
 

5359
01:29:26,960 --> 01:29:29,430
i mean there's a lot of opportunities to
start to automate these chains and um

5360
01:29:29,430 --> 01:29:29,440
start to automate these chains and um
 

5361
01:29:29,440 --> 01:29:30,870
start to automate these chains and um
a lot of the inefficiency today is

5362
01:29:30,870 --> 01:29:30,880
a lot of the inefficiency today is
 

5363
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:33,830
a lot of the inefficiency today is
because like you have a delay like port

5364
01:29:33,830 --> 01:29:33,840
because like you have a delay like port
 

5365
01:29:33,840 --> 01:29:35,990
because like you have a delay like port
of la has a bunch of ships right now

5366
01:29:35,990 --> 01:29:36,000
of la has a bunch of ships right now
 

5367
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:37,590
of la has a bunch of ships right now
waiting outside of it because they can't

5368
01:29:37,590 --> 01:29:37,600
waiting outside of it because they can't
 

5369
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:39,669
waiting outside of it because they can't
dock because there's not enough

5370
01:29:39,669 --> 01:29:39,679
dock because there's not enough
 

5371
01:29:39,679 --> 01:29:41,590
dock because there's not enough
labor inside of the port of la that

5372
01:29:41,590 --> 01:29:41,600
labor inside of the port of la that
 

5373
01:29:41,600 --> 01:29:43,030
labor inside of the port of la that
means there's a big backlog of trucks

5374
01:29:43,030 --> 01:29:43,040
means there's a big backlog of trucks
 

5375
01:29:43,040 --> 01:29:44,390
means there's a big backlog of trucks
which means there's a big backlog of

5376
01:29:44,390 --> 01:29:44,400
which means there's a big backlog of
 

5377
01:29:44,400 --> 01:29:45,669
which means there's a big backlog of
deliveries which means the drivers

5378
01:29:45,669 --> 01:29:45,679
deliveries which means the drivers
 

5379
01:29:45,679 --> 01:29:47,030
deliveries which means the drivers
aren't where they need to be and so you

5380
01:29:47,030 --> 01:29:47,040
aren't where they need to be and so you
 

5381
01:29:47,040 --> 01:29:49,110
aren't where they need to be and so you
have this like huge chain reaction and

5382
01:29:49,110 --> 01:29:49,120
have this like huge chain reaction and
 

5383
01:29:49,120 --> 01:29:51,510
have this like huge chain reaction and
your feasibility of readjusting in this

5384
01:29:51,510 --> 01:29:51,520
your feasibility of readjusting in this
 

5385
01:29:51,520 --> 01:29:53,910
your feasibility of readjusting in this
network is low because everything's tied

5386
01:29:53,910 --> 01:29:53,920
network is low because everything's tied
 

5387
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:56,550
network is low because everything's tied
to humans and manual kind of processes

5388
01:29:56,550 --> 01:29:56,560
to humans and manual kind of processes
 

5389
01:29:56,560 --> 01:29:58,870
to humans and manual kind of processes
uh or distributed processes across a

5390
01:29:58,870 --> 01:29:58,880
uh or distributed processes across a
 

5391
01:29:58,880 --> 01:30:00,470
uh or distributed processes across a
whole bunch of players

5392
01:30:00,470 --> 01:30:00,480
whole bunch of players
 

5393
01:30:00,480 --> 01:30:01,590
whole bunch of players
and so

5394
01:30:01,590 --> 01:30:01,600
and so
 

5395
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:03,750
and so
one of the biggest enablers is um yes we

5396
01:30:03,750 --> 01:30:03,760
one of the biggest enablers is um yes we
 

5397
01:30:03,760 --> 01:30:05,350
one of the biggest enablers is um yes we
have to solve autonomous trucking first

5398
01:30:05,350 --> 01:30:05,360
have to solve autonomous trucking first
 

5399
01:30:05,360 --> 01:30:06,709
have to solve autonomous trucking first
and that by the way that's not like an

5400
01:30:06,709 --> 01:30:06,719
and that by the way that's not like an
 

5401
01:30:06,719 --> 01:30:08,470
and that by the way that's not like an
overnight thing that's decades of

5402
01:30:08,470 --> 01:30:08,480
overnight thing that's decades of
 

5403
01:30:08,480 --> 01:30:10,950
overnight thing that's decades of
continued kind of expansion and work

5404
01:30:10,950 --> 01:30:10,960
continued kind of expansion and work
 

5405
01:30:10,960 --> 01:30:13,430
continued kind of expansion and work
but um the first checkpoint in the first

5406
01:30:13,430 --> 01:30:13,440
but um the first checkpoint in the first
 

5407
01:30:13,440 --> 01:30:16,070
but um the first checkpoint in the first
route is like is not that far off but

5408
01:30:16,070 --> 01:30:16,080
route is like is not that far off but
 

5409
01:30:16,080 --> 01:30:17,590
route is like is not that far off but
once you start enabling and you start to

5410
01:30:17,590 --> 01:30:17,600
once you start enabling and you start to
 

5411
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:18,950
once you start enabling and you start to
learn about how

5412
01:30:18,950 --> 01:30:18,960
learn about how
 

5413
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:19,750
learn about how
the

5414
01:30:19,750 --> 01:30:19,760
the
 

5415
01:30:19,760 --> 01:30:22,790
the
constraints of autonomous trucking which

5416
01:30:22,790 --> 01:30:22,800
constraints of autonomous trucking which
 

5417
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:24,149
constraints of autonomous trucking which
are very different in the constraints of

5418
01:30:24,149 --> 01:30:24,159
are very different in the constraints of
 

5419
01:30:24,159 --> 01:30:25,830
are very different in the constraints of
human trucking and again strengths and

5420
01:30:25,830 --> 01:30:25,840
human trucking and again strengths and
 

5421
01:30:25,840 --> 01:30:27,510
human trucking and again strengths and
weaknesses

5422
01:30:27,510 --> 01:30:27,520
weaknesses
 

5423
01:30:27,520 --> 01:30:30,390
weaknesses
how do you then start to leverage that

5424
01:30:30,390 --> 01:30:30,400
how do you then start to leverage that
 

5425
01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:31,350
how do you then start to leverage that
and

5426
01:30:31,350 --> 01:30:31,360
and
 

5427
01:30:31,360 --> 01:30:34,629
and
rethink a flow of goods uh more broadly

5428
01:30:34,629 --> 01:30:34,639
rethink a flow of goods uh more broadly
 

5429
01:30:34,639 --> 01:30:36,310
rethink a flow of goods uh more broadly
and this is where like the learnings of

5430
01:30:36,310 --> 01:30:36,320
and this is where like the learnings of
 

5431
01:30:36,320 --> 01:30:38,390
and this is where like the learnings of
like really partnering with some of the

5432
01:30:38,390 --> 01:30:38,400
like really partnering with some of the
 

5433
01:30:38,400 --> 01:30:40,310
like really partnering with some of the
largest fleets in the us

5434
01:30:40,310 --> 01:30:40,320
largest fleets in the us
 

5435
01:30:40,320 --> 01:30:41,590
largest fleets in the us
and the sort of

5436
01:30:41,590 --> 01:30:41,600
and the sort of
 

5437
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:42,790
and the sort of
learnings that they have about the

5438
01:30:42,790 --> 01:30:42,800
learnings that they have about the
 

5439
01:30:42,800 --> 01:30:44,070
learnings that they have about the
industry and the sort of needs that they

have and
 

5443
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:46,870
have and
what would change if you just

5444
01:30:46,870 --> 01:30:46,880
what would change if you just
 

5445
01:30:46,880 --> 01:30:48,870
what would change if you just
like really broke this one constraint

5446
01:30:48,870 --> 01:30:48,880
like really broke this one constraint
 

5447
01:30:48,880 --> 01:30:50,790
like really broke this one constraint
that like holds up the whole network or

5448
01:30:50,790 --> 01:30:50,800
that like holds up the whole network or
 

5449
01:30:50,800 --> 01:30:51,990
that like holds up the whole network or
what if you enabled this other

5450
01:30:51,990 --> 01:30:52,000
what if you enabled this other
 

5451
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:52,950
what if you enabled this other
constraint

5452
01:30:52,950 --> 01:30:52,960
constraint
 

5453
01:30:52,960 --> 01:30:54,310
constraint
that actually drives the roadmap in a

that actually drives the roadmap in a
 

5455
01:30:54,320 --> 01:30:56,629
that actually drives the roadmap in a
lot of ways because um this is not like

5456
01:30:56,629 --> 01:30:56,639
lot of ways because um this is not like
 

5457
01:30:56,639 --> 01:30:58,470
lot of ways because um this is not like
an all or nothing problem it's uh you

01:30:58,470 --> 01:30:58,480
an all or nothing problem it's uh you
 

5459
01:30:58,480 --> 01:30:59,750
an all or nothing problem it's uh you
know you start to kind of unlock more

5460
01:30:59,750 --> 01:30:59,760
know you start to kind of unlock more
 

5461
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:02,229
know you start to kind of unlock more
and more functionality over time which

5462
01:31:02,229 --> 01:31:02,239
and more functionality over time which
 

5463
01:31:02,239 --> 01:31:04,470
and more functionality over time which
functionality most enables this

5464
01:31:04,470 --> 01:31:04,480
functionality most enables this
 

5465
01:31:04,480 --> 01:31:06,149

01:31:31,430 --> 01:31:31,440
reinventing the entire system um in the
 

5491
01:31:31,440 --> 01:31:33,910
reinventing the entire system um in the
same way that uh you know you see you

5492
01:31:33,910 --> 01:31:33,920
same way that uh you know you see you
 

5493
01:31:33,920 --> 01:31:35,750
same way that uh you know you see you
know these other industries that uh like

01:31:35,750 --> 01:31:35,760
know these other industries that uh like
 

5495
01:31:35,760 --> 01:31:37,270
know these other industries that uh like
when you get to enough scale you can

5496
01:31:37,270 --> 01:31:37,280
when you get to enough scale you can
 

5497
01:31:37,280 --> 01:31:39,590
when you get to enough scale you can
really rethink um how you build around

5498
01:31:39,590 --> 01:31:39,600
really rethink um how you build around
 

5499
01:31:39,600 --> 01:31:41,830

your new set of capabilities not
 

5501
01:31:41,840 --> 01:31:43,910
your new set of capabilities not
the old set of capabilities yeah use the

5502
01:31:43,910 --> 01:31:43,920
the old set of capabilities yeah use the
 

5503
01:31:43,920 --> 01:31:45,750
the old set of capabilities yeah use the
analogy metaphor or whatever that

autonomous trucking is like email versus
 

5507
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:50,070
autonomous trucking is like email versus
mail and then with email you're still

5508
01:31:50,070 --> 01:31:50,080
mail and then with email you're still
 

5509
01:31:50,080 --> 01:31:51,830
mail and then with email you're still
doing the communication but it opens up

01:31:51,830 --> 01:31:51,840
doing the communication but it opens up

01:31:57,510 --> 01:31:57,520
you didn't anticipate that's right
 

5517

you didn't anticipate that's right
constraints are just completely

5518
01:31:58,629 --> 01:31:58,639
constraints are just completely
 

5519
01:31:58,639 --> 01:32:00,709
constraints are just completely
different um and yeah there's definitely

5520
01:32:00,709 --> 01:32:00,719
different um and yeah there's definitely
 

5521
01:32:00,719 --> 01:32:03,189
different um and yeah there's definitely
a property of that here um and we're

5522
01:32:03,189 --> 01:32:03,199
a property of that here um and we're
 

5523
01:32:03,199 --> 01:32:04,950
a property of that here um and we're
also still learning about it because

5524
01:32:04,950 --> 01:32:04,960
also still learning about it because
 

5525
01:32:04,960 --> 01:32:07,110
also still learning about it because
there there is a lot of really um

5526
01:32:07,110 --> 01:32:07,120
there there is a lot of really um
 

5527
01:32:07,120 --> 01:32:09,189
there there is a lot of really um
fascinating and sometimes really elegant

5528
01:32:09,189 --> 01:32:09,199
fascinating and sometimes really elegant
 

5529
01:32:09,199 --> 01:32:10,550
fascinating and sometimes really elegant
things that the industry has done where

5530
01:32:10,550 --> 01:32:10,560
things that the industry has done where
 

5531
01:32:10,560 --> 01:32:12,070
things that the industry has done where
there's companies whose entire existence

5532
01:32:12,070 --> 01:32:12,080
there's companies whose entire existence
 

5533
01:32:12,080 --> 01:32:14,310
there's companies whose entire existence
is around despite the constraints

5534
01:32:14,310 --> 01:32:14,320
is around despite the constraints
 

5535
01:32:14,320 --> 01:32:16,229
is around despite the constraints
optimizing as much as they can out of it

5536
01:32:16,229 --> 01:32:16,239
optimizing as much as they can out of it
 

5537
01:32:16,239 --> 01:32:18,790
optimizing as much as they can out of it
and those lessons do carry over but it's

5538
01:32:18,790 --> 01:32:18,800
and those lessons do carry over but it's
 

5539
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:20,470
and those lessons do carry over but it's
an interesting kind of merger of worlds

5540
01:32:20,470 --> 01:32:20,480
an interesting kind of merger of worlds
 

5541
01:32:20,480 --> 01:32:22,709
an interesting kind of merger of worlds
to think about like well what if this

5542
01:32:22,709 --> 01:32:22,719
to think about like well what if this
 

5543
01:32:22,719 --> 01:32:24,229
to think about like well what if this
was completely different how would we

5544
01:32:24,229 --> 01:32:24,239
was completely different how would we
 

5545
01:32:24,239 --> 01:32:25,510
was completely different how would we
approach it

5546
01:32:25,510 --> 01:32:25,520
approach it
 

5547
01:32:25,520 --> 01:32:28,070
approach it
and the interesting thing is that

5548
01:32:28,070 --> 01:32:28,080
and the interesting thing is that
 

5549
01:32:28,080 --> 01:32:30,070
and the interesting thing is that
for a really really really long time

5550
01:32:30,070 --> 01:32:30,080
for a really really really long time
 

5551
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:31,350
for a really really really long time
it's actually going to be the merger

5552
01:32:31,350 --> 01:32:31,360
it's actually going to be the merger
 

5553
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:32,790
it's actually going to be the merger
between how to use autonomy and how to

5554
01:32:32,790 --> 01:32:32,800
between how to use autonomy and how to
 

5555
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:34,950
between how to use autonomy and how to
use humans that leans into each each of

5556
01:32:34,950 --> 01:32:34,960
use humans that leans into each each of
 

5557
01:32:34,960 --> 01:32:36,310
use humans that leans into each each of
their strengths

5558
01:32:36,310 --> 01:32:36,320
their strengths
 

5559
01:32:36,320 --> 01:32:38,790
their strengths
yeah and then we're back to cosmo

5560
01:32:38,790 --> 01:32:38,800
yeah and then we're back to cosmo
 

5561
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:40,790
yeah and then we're back to cosmo
human robot interaction so and the

5562
01:32:40,790 --> 01:32:40,800
human robot interaction so and the
 

5563
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:42,390
human robot interaction so and the
interesting thing about waymo is because

5564
01:32:42,390 --> 01:32:42,400
interesting thing about waymo is because
 

5565
01:32:42,400 --> 01:32:44,229
interesting thing about waymo is because
there's the passenger vehicle the the

5566
01:32:44,229 --> 01:32:44,239
there's the passenger vehicle the the
 

5567
01:32:44,239 --> 01:32:46,229
there's the passenger vehicle the the
human the transportation of humans and

5568
01:32:46,229 --> 01:32:46,239
human the transportation of humans and
 

5569
01:32:46,239 --> 01:32:47,990

transportation of goods
 

5571
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:49,910
transportation of goods
you could see over time they might kind

5572
01:32:49,910 --> 01:32:49,920
you could see over time they might kind
 

5573
01:32:49,920 --> 01:32:51,030
you could see over time they might kind
of

01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:54,790
meld together more
because you you'll probably have like

5578
01:32:54,790 --> 01:32:54,800
because you you'll probably have like
 

5579
01:32:54,800 --> 01:32:56,790
because you you'll probably have like
zero occupancy vehicles moving around so

5580
01:32:56,790 --> 01:32:56,800
zero occupancy vehicles moving around so
 

5581
01:32:56,800 --> 01:32:58,870
zero occupancy vehicles moving around so
you have transportation goods for short

5582
01:32:58,870 --> 01:32:58,880
you have transportation goods for short
 

5583
01:32:58,880 --> 01:33:00,709
you have transportation goods for short
distances and then

5584
01:33:00,709 --> 01:33:00,719
distances and then
 

5585
01:33:00,719 --> 01:33:02,629
distances and then
for slightly longer distances and then

5586
01:33:02,629 --> 01:33:02,639
for slightly longer distances and then
 

5587
01:33:02,639 --> 01:33:04,070
for slightly longer distances and then
slightly longer and then there'll be

5588
01:33:04,070 --> 01:33:04,080
slightly longer and then there'll be
 

5589
01:33:04,080 --> 01:33:05,750
slightly longer and then there'll be
this then you just see the difference

5590
01:33:05,750 --> 01:33:05,760
this then you just see the difference
 

5591
01:33:05,760 --> 01:33:08,629
this then you just see the difference
between a passenger vehicle and a truck

5592
01:33:08,629 --> 01:33:08,639
between a passenger vehicle and a truck
 

5593
01:33:08,639 --> 01:33:10,149
between a passenger vehicle and a truck
is just size and you can have different

5594
01:33:10,149 --> 01:33:10,159
is just size and you can have different
 

5595
01:33:10,159 --> 01:33:11,990
is just size and you can have different
sizes and all that kind of stuff and at

5596
01:33:11,990 --> 01:33:12,000
sizes and all that kind of stuff and at
 

5597
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:13,510
sizes and all that kind of stuff and at
the core you can have a way more driver

5598
01:33:13,510 --> 01:33:13,520
the core you can have a way more driver
 

5599
01:33:13,520 --> 01:33:15,030
the core you can have a way more driver
that doesn't as long as you have the

5600
01:33:15,030 --> 01:33:15,040
that doesn't as long as you have the
 

5601
01:33:15,040 --> 01:33:16,629
that doesn't as long as you have the
same that's sweet you can just think of

5602
01:33:16,629 --> 01:33:16,639
same that's sweet you can just think of
 

5603
01:33:16,639 --> 01:33:18,070
same that's sweet you can just think of
it as one problem and that's why over

5604
01:33:18,070 --> 01:33:18,080
it as one problem and that's why over
 

5605
01:33:18,080 --> 01:33:20,070
it as one problem and that's why over
time these do come kind of converge

5606
01:33:20,070 --> 01:33:20,080
time these do come kind of converge
 

5607
01:33:20,080 --> 01:33:21,750
time these do come kind of converge
where in a lot of ways a lot of the

5608
01:33:21,750 --> 01:33:21,760
where in a lot of ways a lot of the
 

5609
01:33:21,760 --> 01:33:23,430

01:33:24,870 --> 01:33:24,880
driving which are going to carry over
 

5613
01:33:24,880 --> 01:33:26,790
driving which are going to carry over
very well to the vehicles to the car

5614
01:33:26,790 --> 01:33:26,800
very well to the vehicles to the car

um but there are like then unique

5618
01:33:30,149 --> 01:33:30,159
um but there are like then unique
 

5619
01:33:30,159 --> 01:33:32,310
um but there are like then unique
challenges like uh you have a very

5620
01:33:32,310 --> 01:33:32,320
challenges like uh you have a very
 

5621
01:33:32,320 --> 01:33:33,750
challenges like uh you have a very
different dynamics in your vehicle where

5622
01:33:33,750 --> 01:33:33,760
different dynamics in your vehicle where
 

5623
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:35,590
different dynamics in your vehicle where
you have to see much further out in

5624
01:33:35,590 --> 01:33:35,600
you have to see much further out in
 

5625
01:33:35,600 --> 01:33:37,510
you have to see much further out in
order to have the proper like response

5626
01:33:37,510 --> 01:33:37,520
order to have the proper like response
 

5627
01:33:37,520 --> 01:33:39,030
order to have the proper like response
time because you have an 80 000 pound

5628
01:33:39,030 --> 01:33:39,040
time because you have an 80 000 pound
 

5629
01:33:39,040 --> 01:33:41,910
time because you have an 80 000 pound
fully loaded truck um that's a very very

5630
01:33:41,910 --> 01:33:41,920
fully loaded truck um that's a very very
 

5631
01:33:41,920 --> 01:33:43,669
fully loaded truck um that's a very very
different type of braking profile than a

5632
01:33:43,669 --> 01:33:43,679
different type of braking profile than a
 

5633
01:33:43,679 --> 01:33:46,149
different type of braking profile than a
than a car you have uh

5634
01:33:46,149 --> 01:33:46,159
than a car you have uh
 

5635
01:33:46,159 --> 01:33:48,149
than a car you have uh
really interesting kind of dynamic

5636
01:33:48,149 --> 01:33:48,159
really interesting kind of dynamic
 

5637
01:33:48,159 --> 01:33:50,790
really interesting kind of dynamic
limits because of the trailer where you

5638
01:33:50,790 --> 01:33:50,800
limits because of the trailer where you
 

5639
01:33:50,800 --> 01:33:52,310
limits because of the trailer where you
actually it's very very hard to like

5640
01:33:52,310 --> 01:33:52,320
actually it's very very hard to like
 

5641
01:33:52,320 --> 01:33:54,229
actually it's very very hard to like
physically like flip a car or do

5642
01:33:54,229 --> 01:33:54,239
physically like flip a car or do
 

5643
01:33:54,239 --> 01:33:56,310
physically like flip a car or do
something like physically like most risk

5644
01:33:56,310 --> 01:33:56,320
something like physically like most risk
 

5645
01:33:56,320 --> 01:33:58,950
something like physically like most risk
in a car is from just collisions um

5646
01:33:58,950 --> 01:33:58,960
in a car is from just collisions um
 

5647
01:33:58,960 --> 01:34:00,790
in a car is from just collisions um
it's very hard to like in any normal

5648
01:34:00,790 --> 01:34:00,800
it's very hard to like in any normal
 

5649
01:34:00,800 --> 01:34:02,229
it's very hard to like in any normal
operation to do something other than

5650
01:34:02,229 --> 01:34:02,239
operation to do something other than
 

5651
01:34:02,239 --> 01:34:03,830
operation to do something other than
like you know unless you hit something

5652
01:34:03,830 --> 01:34:03,840
like you know unless you hit something
 

5653
01:34:03,840 --> 01:34:05,030
like you know unless you hit something
it's actually kind of like roll over or

5654
01:34:05,030 --> 01:34:05,040
it's actually kind of like roll over or
 

5655
01:34:05,040 --> 01:34:07,270
it's actually kind of like roll over or
something on a truck you actually have

5656
01:34:07,270 --> 01:34:07,280
something on a truck you actually have
 

5657
01:34:07,280 --> 01:34:08,790
something on a truck you actually have
to drive much closer to the physical

5658
01:34:08,790 --> 01:34:08,800
to drive much closer to the physical
 

5659
01:34:08,800 --> 01:34:11,189
to drive much closer to the physical
bounds of the safety limits um

5660
01:34:11,189 --> 01:34:11,199
bounds of the safety limits um
 

5661
01:34:11,199 --> 01:34:12,709
bounds of the safety limits um
but you actually have like

5662
01:34:12,709 --> 01:34:12,719
but you actually have like
 

5663
01:34:12,719 --> 01:34:15,669
but you actually have like
real constraints because you could uh

5664
01:34:15,669 --> 01:34:15,679
real constraints because you could uh
 

5665
01:34:15,679 --> 01:34:17,430
real constraints because you could uh
you know you could have a really

5666
01:34:17,430 --> 01:34:17,440
you know you could have a really
 

5667
01:34:17,440 --> 01:34:18,629
you know you could have a really
interesting interactions between the

5668
01:34:18,629 --> 01:34:18,639
interesting interactions between the
 

5669
01:34:18,639 --> 01:34:20,149
interesting interactions between the
cabin and the trailer yeah there's

5670
01:34:20,149 --> 01:34:20,159
cabin and the trailer yeah there's
 

5671
01:34:20,159 --> 01:34:22,310
cabin and the trailer yeah there's
something called jackknifing if you turn

5672
01:34:22,310 --> 01:34:22,320
something called jackknifing if you turn
 

5673
01:34:22,320 --> 01:34:23,669
something called jackknifing if you turn
you know too quickly

5674
01:34:23,669 --> 01:34:23,679
you know too quickly
 

5675
01:34:23,679 --> 01:34:25,510
you know too quickly
you have roll risks and so forth and so

5676
01:34:25,510 --> 01:34:25,520
you have roll risks and so forth and so
 

5677
01:34:25,520 --> 01:34:26,550
you have roll risks and so forth and so
we spend a huge amount of time

5678
01:34:26,550 --> 01:34:26,560
we spend a huge amount of time
 

5679
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:28,310
we spend a huge amount of time
understanding those boundaries and those

5680
01:34:28,310 --> 01:34:28,320
understanding those boundaries and those
 

5681
01:34:28,320 --> 01:34:30,229
understanding those boundaries and those
boundaries change based on the load that

5682
01:34:30,229 --> 01:34:30,239
boundaries change based on the load that
 

5683
01:34:30,239 --> 01:34:31,990
boundaries change based on the load that
you have which is also an interesting

5684
01:34:31,990 --> 01:34:32,000
you have which is also an interesting
 

5685
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:33,270
you have which is also an interesting
difference you have to propagate through

5686
01:34:33,270 --> 01:34:33,280
difference you have to propagate through
 

5687
01:34:33,280 --> 01:34:34,790
difference you have to propagate through
the out that through the algorithm so

5688
01:34:34,790 --> 01:34:34,800
the out that through the algorithm so
 

5689
01:34:34,800 --> 01:34:37,030
the out that through the algorithm so
that you're leveraging your dynamic

5690
01:34:37,030 --> 01:34:37,040
that you're leveraging your dynamic
 

5691
01:34:37,040 --> 01:34:39,030
that you're leveraging your dynamic
range but always staying within the

5692
01:34:39,030 --> 01:34:39,040
range but always staying within the
 

5693
01:34:39,040 --> 01:34:40,310
range but always staying within the
safety balance but understanding what

5694
01:34:40,310 --> 01:34:40,320
safety balance but understanding what
 

5695
01:34:40,320 --> 01:34:42,149
safety balance but understanding what
those safety bonds are and so we have

5696
01:34:42,149 --> 01:34:42,159
those safety bonds are and so we have
 

5697
01:34:42,159 --> 01:34:43,430
those safety bonds are and so we have
this like really cool test facility

5698
01:34:43,430 --> 01:34:43,440
this like really cool test facility
 

5699
01:34:43,440 --> 01:34:45,270
this like really cool test facility
where we like take it to the max and

5700
01:34:45,270 --> 01:34:45,280
where we like take it to the max and
 

5701
01:34:45,280 --> 01:34:47,590
where we like take it to the max and
actually imagine a truck with these

5702
01:34:47,590 --> 01:34:47,600
actually imagine a truck with these
 

5703
01:34:47,600 --> 01:34:49,189
actually imagine a truck with these
giant training wheels on the back of the

5704
01:34:49,189 --> 01:34:49,199
giant training wheels on the back of the
 

5705
01:34:49,199 --> 01:34:51,669
giant training wheels on the back of the
trailer and you're pushing it past the

5706
01:34:51,669 --> 01:34:51,679
trailer and you're pushing it past the
 

5707
01:34:51,679 --> 01:34:54,310
trailer and you're pushing it past the
safety limits uh in order to like try to

5708
01:34:54,310 --> 01:34:54,320
safety limits uh in order to like try to
 

5709
01:34:54,320 --> 01:34:56,310
safety limits uh in order to like try to
actually see where it rolls and so you

5710
01:34:56,310 --> 01:34:56,320
actually see where it rolls and so you
 

5711
01:34:56,320 --> 01:34:58,149
actually see where it rolls and so you
you you define this high dimensional

5712
01:34:58,149 --> 01:34:58,159
you you define this high dimensional
 

5713
01:34:58,159 --> 01:34:59,910
you you define this high dimensional
boundary which then gets captured in

5714
01:34:59,910 --> 01:34:59,920
boundary which then gets captured in
 

5715
01:34:59,920 --> 01:35:01,350
boundary which then gets captured in
software to stay safe and actually do

5716
01:35:01,350 --> 01:35:01,360
software to stay safe and actually do
 

5717
01:35:01,360 --> 01:35:03,030
software to stay safe and actually do
the right thing but uh it's kind of

5718
01:35:03,030 --> 01:35:03,040
the right thing but uh it's kind of
 

5719
01:35:03,040 --> 01:35:04,709
the right thing but uh it's kind of
fascinating the sort of uh you know kind

5720
01:35:04,709 --> 01:35:04,719
fascinating the sort of uh you know kind
 

5721
01:35:04,719 --> 01:35:06,709
fascinating the sort of uh you know kind
of challenges you have there um but then

5722
01:35:06,709 --> 01:35:06,719
of challenges you have there um but then
 

5723
01:35:06,719 --> 01:35:07,910
of challenges you have there um but then
all of these things drive really

5724
01:35:07,910 --> 01:35:07,920
all of these things drive really
 

5725
01:35:07,920 --> 01:35:09,430
all of these things drive really
interesting challenges from perception

5726
01:35:09,430 --> 01:35:09,440
interesting challenges from perception
 

5727
01:35:09,440 --> 01:35:10,870
interesting challenges from perception
to um

5728
01:35:10,870 --> 01:35:10,880
to um
 

5729
01:35:10,880 --> 01:35:12,310
to um
unique behavior prediction challenges

5730
01:35:12,310 --> 01:35:12,320
unique behavior prediction challenges
 

5731
01:35:12,320 --> 01:35:14,390
unique behavior prediction challenges
and obviously in planner where you have

5732
01:35:14,390 --> 01:35:14,400
and obviously in planner where you have
 

5733
01:35:14,400 --> 01:35:17,350
and obviously in planner where you have
to think about merging and creating gaps

5734
01:35:17,350 --> 01:35:17,360
to think about merging and creating gaps
 

5735
01:35:17,360 --> 01:35:19,910
to think about merging and creating gaps
with a 53 foot trailer and so forth and

5736
01:35:19,910 --> 01:35:19,920
with a 53 foot trailer and so forth and
 

5737
01:35:19,920 --> 01:35:21,350
with a 53 foot trailer and so forth and
then obviously the platform itself is

5738
01:35:21,350 --> 01:35:21,360
then obviously the platform itself is
 

5739
01:35:21,360 --> 01:35:22,629
then obviously the platform itself is
very different where you have different

5740
01:35:22,629 --> 01:35:22,639
very different where you have different
 

5741
01:35:22,639 --> 01:35:24,629
very different where you have different
numbers of sensors sometimes types of

5742
01:35:24,629 --> 01:35:24,639
numbers of sensors sometimes types of
 

5743
01:35:24,639 --> 01:35:26,229
numbers of sensors sometimes types of
sensors and you also have unique blind

5744
01:35:26,229 --> 01:35:26,239
sensors and you also have unique blind
 

5745
01:35:26,239 --> 01:35:27,350
sensors and you also have unique blind
spots that you have because of the

5746
01:35:27,350 --> 01:35:27,360
spots that you have because of the
 

5747
01:35:27,360 --> 01:35:28,629
spots that you have because of the
trailer which you have to think about

5748
01:35:28,629 --> 01:35:28,639
trailer which you have to think about
 

5749
01:35:28,639 --> 01:35:30,070
trailer which you have to think about
and so it's a really interesting

5750
01:35:30,070 --> 01:35:30,080
and so it's a really interesting
 

5751
01:35:30,080 --> 01:35:32,149
and so it's a really interesting
spectrum and in the end

5752
01:35:32,149 --> 01:35:32,159
spectrum and in the end
 

5753
01:35:32,159 --> 01:35:34,709
spectrum and in the end
you try to capture these special cases

5754
01:35:34,709 --> 01:35:34,719
you try to capture these special cases
 

5755
01:35:34,719 --> 01:35:37,590
you try to capture these special cases
in a way that is cleanly augmentations

5756
01:35:37,590 --> 01:35:37,600
in a way that is cleanly augmentations
 

5757
01:35:37,600 --> 01:35:39,590
in a way that is cleanly augmentations
of the existing tech stack

5758
01:35:39,590 --> 01:35:39,600
of the existing tech stack
 

5759
01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:42,229
of the existing tech stack
because a majority of what we're solving

5760
01:35:42,229 --> 01:35:42,239
because a majority of what we're solving
 

5761
01:35:42,239 --> 01:35:44,149
because a majority of what we're solving
is actually generalizable to freeway

5762
01:35:44,149 --> 01:35:44,159
is actually generalizable to freeway
 

5763
01:35:44,159 --> 01:35:46,950
is actually generalizable to freeway
driving um and different platforms and

5764
01:35:46,950 --> 01:35:46,960
driving um and different platforms and
 

5765
01:35:46,960 --> 01:35:48,070
driving um and different platforms and
over time

5766
01:35:48,070 --> 01:35:48,080
over time
 

5767
01:35:48,080 --> 01:35:50,709
over time
they all start to kind of merge ideally

5768
01:35:50,709 --> 01:35:50,719
they all start to kind of merge ideally
 

5769
01:35:50,719 --> 01:35:52,950
they all start to kind of merge ideally
where the things that are unique are as

5770
01:35:52,950 --> 01:35:52,960
where the things that are unique are as
 

5771
01:35:52,960 --> 01:35:55,109
where the things that are unique are as
as minimal as possible and that's where

5772
01:35:55,109 --> 01:35:55,119
as minimal as possible and that's where
 

5773
01:35:55,119 --> 01:35:57,030
as minimal as possible and that's where
you get the most leverage and that's why

5774
01:35:57,030 --> 01:35:57,040
you get the most leverage and that's why
 

5775
01:35:57,040 --> 01:35:58,390
you get the most leverage and that's why
waymo can do

5776
01:35:58,390 --> 01:35:58,400
waymo can do
 

5777
01:35:58,400 --> 01:35:59,910
waymo can do
you know take on two trillion dollar

5778
01:35:59,910 --> 01:35:59,920
you know take on two trillion dollar
 

5779
01:35:59,920 --> 01:36:01,830
you know take on two trillion dollar
opportunities um and

5780
01:36:01,830 --> 01:36:01,840
opportunities um and
 

5781
01:36:01,840 --> 01:36:04,550
opportunities um and
have been nowhere near 2x the cost or

5782
01:36:04,550 --> 01:36:04,560
have been nowhere near 2x the cost or
 

5783
01:36:04,560 --> 01:36:05,990
have been nowhere near 2x the cost or
investment or size in fact it's much

5784
01:36:05,990 --> 01:36:06,000
investment or size in fact it's much
 

5785
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:07,430
investment or size in fact it's much
much smaller than that

5786
01:36:07,430 --> 01:36:07,440
much smaller than that
 

5787
01:36:07,440 --> 01:36:10,229
much smaller than that
because of the high degree of leverage

5788
01:36:10,229 --> 01:36:10,239
because of the high degree of leverage
 

5789
01:36:10,239 --> 01:36:12,310
because of the high degree of leverage
so what kind of sensor suite

5790
01:36:12,310 --> 01:36:12,320
so what kind of sensor suite
 

5791
01:36:12,320 --> 01:36:15,030
so what kind of sensor suite
they can speak to that uh that a long

5792
01:36:15,030 --> 01:36:15,040
they can speak to that uh that a long
 

5793
01:36:15,040 --> 01:36:18,629
they can speak to that uh that a long
haul truck needs to have lidar vision

5794
01:36:18,629 --> 01:36:18,639
haul truck needs to have lidar vision
 

5795
01:36:18,639 --> 01:36:21,109
haul truck needs to have lidar vision
how many what are we talking about here

5796
01:36:21,109 --> 01:36:21,119
how many what are we talking about here
 

5797
01:36:21,119 --> 01:36:23,669
how many what are we talking about here
yeah so it's um more than the cars so

5798
01:36:23,669 --> 01:36:23,679
yeah so it's um more than the cars so
 

5799
01:36:23,679 --> 01:36:25,430
yeah so it's um more than the cars so
very loosely you can think of as like 2x

5800
01:36:25,430 --> 01:36:25,440
very loosely you can think of as like 2x
 

5801
01:36:25,440 --> 01:36:27,590
very loosely you can think of as like 2x
but it varies depending on the sensor

5802
01:36:27,590 --> 01:36:27,600
but it varies depending on the sensor
 

5803
01:36:27,600 --> 01:36:30,229
but it varies depending on the sensor
and so we have like dozens of cameras

5804
01:36:30,229 --> 01:36:30,239
and so we have like dozens of cameras
 

5805
01:36:30,239 --> 01:36:32,950
and so we have like dozens of cameras
radar and then multiple lidar as well

5806
01:36:32,950 --> 01:36:32,960
radar and then multiple lidar as well
 

5807
01:36:32,960 --> 01:36:35,350
radar and then multiple lidar as well
you'll see one difference where the cars

5808
01:36:35,350 --> 01:36:35,360
you'll see one difference where the cars
 

5809
01:36:35,360 --> 01:36:37,510
you'll see one difference where the cars
have a central main sensor pod on the

5810
01:36:37,510 --> 01:36:37,520
have a central main sensor pod on the
 

5811
01:36:37,520 --> 01:36:39,830
have a central main sensor pod on the
roof in the middle and then a some kind

5812
01:36:39,830 --> 01:36:39,840
roof in the middle and then a some kind
 

5813
01:36:39,840 --> 01:36:42,149
roof in the middle and then a some kind
of hood sensors for blind spots the

5814
01:36:42,149 --> 01:36:42,159
of hood sensors for blind spots the
 

5815
01:36:42,159 --> 01:36:44,390
of hood sensors for blind spots the
truck moves to two main sensor pods on

5816
01:36:44,390 --> 01:36:44,400
truck moves to two main sensor pods on
 

5817
01:36:44,400 --> 01:36:45,830
truck moves to two main sensor pods on
the outsides where you would typically

5818
01:36:45,830 --> 01:36:45,840
the outsides where you would typically
 

5819
01:36:45,840 --> 01:36:48,790
the outsides where you would typically
have the mirrors next to the driver

5820
01:36:48,790 --> 01:36:48,800
have the mirrors next to the driver
 

5821
01:36:48,800 --> 01:36:50,149
have the mirrors next to the driver
they effectively go as far out as

5822
01:36:50,149 --> 01:36:50,159
they effectively go as far out as
 

5823
01:36:50,159 --> 01:36:52,390
they effectively go as far out as
possible um kind of up to

5824
01:36:52,390 --> 01:36:52,400
possible um kind of up to
 

5825
01:36:52,400 --> 01:36:54,390
possible um kind of up to
the understanding of the front

5826
01:36:54,390 --> 01:36:54,400
the understanding of the front
 

5827
01:36:54,400 --> 01:36:56,470
the understanding of the front
kind of on the cabin not all the way in

5828
01:36:56,470 --> 01:36:56,480
kind of on the cabin not all the way in
 

5829
01:36:56,480 --> 01:36:57,830
kind of on the cabin not all the way in
the front but like kind of where the

5830
01:36:57,830 --> 01:36:57,840
the front but like kind of where the
 

5831
01:36:57,840 --> 01:36:59,590
the front but like kind of where the
mirrors for the driver would be and so

5832
01:36:59,590 --> 01:36:59,600
mirrors for the driver would be and so
 

5833
01:36:59,600 --> 01:37:01,030
mirrors for the driver would be and so
those are the main sensor pods and the

5834
01:37:01,030 --> 01:37:01,040
those are the main sensor pods and the
 

5835
01:37:01,040 --> 01:37:02,629
those are the main sensor pods and the
reason they're there is because if you

5836
01:37:02,629 --> 01:37:02,639
reason they're there is because if you
 

5837
01:37:02,639 --> 01:37:04,550
reason they're there is because if you
had one in the middle the trailer is

5838
01:37:04,550 --> 01:37:04,560
had one in the middle the trailer is
 

5839
01:37:04,560 --> 01:37:05,910
had one in the middle the trailer is
higher than the cabin and you would be

5840
01:37:05,910 --> 01:37:05,920
higher than the cabin and you would be
 

5841
01:37:05,920 --> 01:37:07,910
higher than the cabin and you would be
included with this like awkward wedge

5842
01:37:07,910 --> 01:37:07,920
included with this like awkward wedge
 

5843
01:37:07,920 --> 01:37:09,430
included with this like awkward wedge
too much occlusion too much occlusion

5844
01:37:09,430 --> 01:37:09,440
too much occlusion too much occlusion
 

5845
01:37:09,440 --> 01:37:10,470
too much occlusion too much occlusion
and so then you would add a lot of

5846
01:37:10,470 --> 01:37:10,480
and so then you would add a lot of
 

5847
01:37:10,480 --> 01:37:12,390
and so then you would add a lot of
complexity to the software yeah to make

5848
01:37:12,390 --> 01:37:12,400
complexity to the software yeah to make
 

5849
01:37:12,400 --> 01:37:14,470
complexity to the software yeah to make
up for that and and just unnecessary

5850
01:37:14,470 --> 01:37:14,480
up for that and and just unnecessary
 

5851
01:37:14,480 --> 01:37:16,709
up for that and and just unnecessary
components so many probably fascinating

5852
01:37:16,709 --> 01:37:16,719
components so many probably fascinating
 

5853
01:37:16,719 --> 01:37:18,310
components so many probably fascinating
design choices really cool because you

5854
01:37:18,310 --> 01:37:18,320
design choices really cool because you
 

5855
01:37:18,320 --> 01:37:19,990
design choices really cool because you
can probably bring up light or higher

5856
01:37:19,990 --> 01:37:20,000
can probably bring up light or higher
 

5857
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:21,350
can probably bring up light or higher
and have it in the center or something

5858
01:37:21,350 --> 01:37:21,360
and have it in the center or something
 

5859
01:37:21,360 --> 01:37:23,030
and have it in the center or something
you could have all kinds of choices you

5860
01:37:23,030 --> 01:37:23,040
you could have all kinds of choices you
 

5861
01:37:23,040 --> 01:37:24,870
you could have all kinds of choices you
have to make the decisions here yeah

5862
01:37:24,870 --> 01:37:24,880
have to make the decisions here yeah
 

5863
01:37:24,880 --> 01:37:26,870
have to make the decisions here yeah
that ultimately probably will define the

5864
01:37:26,870 --> 01:37:26,880
that ultimately probably will define the
 

5865
01:37:26,880 --> 01:37:28,950
that ultimately probably will define the
industry right but by having two on the

5866
01:37:28,950 --> 01:37:28,960
industry right but by having two on the
 

5867
01:37:28,960 --> 01:37:30,390
industry right but by having two on the
side there's actually multiple benefits

5868
01:37:30,390 --> 01:37:30,400
side there's actually multiple benefits
 

5869
01:37:30,400 --> 01:37:33,510
side there's actually multiple benefits
so one is like um you're just beyond the

5870
01:37:33,510 --> 01:37:33,520
so one is like um you're just beyond the
 

5871
01:37:33,520 --> 01:37:35,510
so one is like um you're just beyond the
trailer so you can see fully flush with

5872
01:37:35,510 --> 01:37:35,520
trailer so you can see fully flush with
 

5873
01:37:35,520 --> 01:37:37,189
trailer so you can see fully flush with
the trailer and so you eliminate most of

5874
01:37:37,189 --> 01:37:37,199
the trailer and so you eliminate most of
 

5875
01:37:37,199 --> 01:37:38,550
the trailer and so you eliminate most of
your blind spot except for right behind

5876
01:37:38,550 --> 01:37:38,560
your blind spot except for right behind
 

5877
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:40,870
your blind spot except for right behind
the trailer um which is which is great

5878
01:37:40,870 --> 01:37:40,880
the trailer um which is which is great
 

5879
01:37:40,880 --> 01:37:42,390
the trailer um which is which is great
because now the software carries over

5880
01:37:42,390 --> 01:37:42,400
because now the software carries over
 

5881
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:44,070
because now the software carries over
really well and the same perception

5882
01:37:44,070 --> 01:37:44,080
really well and the same perception
 

5883
01:37:44,080 --> 01:37:45,990
really well and the same perception
system you use on the car side largely

5884
01:37:45,990 --> 01:37:46,000
system you use on the car side largely
 

5885
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,310
system you use on the car side largely
that architecture can carry over and you

5886
01:37:48,310 --> 01:37:48,320
that architecture can carry over and you
 

5887
01:37:48,320 --> 01:37:49,910
that architecture can carry over and you
can retrain some models and so forth but

5888
01:37:49,910 --> 01:37:49,920
can retrain some models and so forth but
 

5889
01:37:49,920 --> 01:37:51,750
can retrain some models and so forth but
you leverage it a lot it also actually

5890
01:37:51,750 --> 01:37:51,760
you leverage it a lot it also actually
 

5891
01:37:51,760 --> 01:37:53,590
you leverage it a lot it also actually
helps with redundancy where

5892
01:37:53,590 --> 01:37:53,600
helps with redundancy where
 

5893
01:37:53,600 --> 01:37:55,189
helps with redundancy where
there's a really nice built-in

5894
01:37:55,189 --> 01:37:55,199
there's a really nice built-in
 

5895
01:37:55,199 --> 01:37:57,109
there's a really nice built-in
redundancy for all the lidar cameras and

5896
01:37:57,109 --> 01:37:57,119
redundancy for all the lidar cameras and
 

5897
01:37:57,119 --> 01:37:58,950
redundancy for all the lidar cameras and
radar where you can afford to have any

5898
01:37:58,950 --> 01:37:58,960
radar where you can afford to have any
 

5899
01:37:58,960 --> 01:38:01,590
radar where you can afford to have any
one of them fail and you're still okay

5900
01:38:01,590 --> 01:38:01,600
one of them fail and you're still okay
 

5901
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:03,830
one of them fail and you're still okay
and at scale every one of them will fail

5902
01:38:03,830 --> 01:38:03,840
and at scale every one of them will fail
 

5903
01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:04,629
and at scale every one of them will fail
um

5904
01:38:04,629 --> 01:38:04,639
um
 

5905
01:38:04,639 --> 01:38:06,470
um
and you will be able to detect when one

5906
01:38:06,470 --> 01:38:06,480
and you will be able to detect when one
 

5907
01:38:06,480 --> 01:38:08,470
and you will be able to detect when one
of them fails because they don't uh

5908
01:38:08,470 --> 01:38:08,480
of them fails because they don't uh
 

5909
01:38:08,480 --> 01:38:10,550
of them fails because they don't uh
because the redundancy

5910
01:38:10,550 --> 01:38:10,560
because the redundancy
 

5911
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:12,070
because the redundancy
they're giving you the data that's

5912
01:38:12,070 --> 01:38:12,080
they're giving you the data that's
 

5913
01:38:12,080 --> 01:38:13,510
they're giving you the data that's
inconsistent with the rest of that's

5914
01:38:13,510 --> 01:38:13,520
inconsistent with the rest of that's
 

5915
01:38:13,520 --> 01:38:14,870
inconsistent with the rest of that's
right and it's not just like they no

5916
01:38:14,870 --> 01:38:14,880
right and it's not just like they no
 

5917
01:38:14,880 --> 01:38:16,229
right and it's not just like they no
longer give data it could be like

5918
01:38:16,229 --> 01:38:16,239
longer give data it could be like
 

5919
01:38:16,239 --> 01:38:18,629
longer give data it could be like
they're fouled or they stop giving data

5920
01:38:18,629 --> 01:38:18,639
they're fouled or they stop giving data
 

5921
01:38:18,639 --> 01:38:19,590
they're fouled or they stop giving data
where the

5922
01:38:19,590 --> 01:38:19,600
where the
 

5923
01:38:19,600 --> 01:38:21,830
where the
some electrical thing gets cut or you

5924
01:38:21,830 --> 01:38:21,840
some electrical thing gets cut or you
 

5925
01:38:21,840 --> 01:38:23,750
some electrical thing gets cut or you
know part of your compute goes down so

5926
01:38:23,750 --> 01:38:23,760
know part of your compute goes down so
 

5927
01:38:23,760 --> 01:38:24,870
know part of your compute goes down so
what's neat is that like you have way

5928
01:38:24,870 --> 01:38:24,880
what's neat is that like you have way
 

5929
01:38:24,880 --> 01:38:26,470
what's neat is that like you have way
more sensors part of his field of view

5930
01:38:26,470 --> 01:38:26,480
more sensors part of his field of view
 

5931
01:38:26,480 --> 01:38:28,470
more sensors part of his field of view
and occlusions part of its redundancy

5932
01:38:28,470 --> 01:38:28,480
and occlusions part of its redundancy
 

5933
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:30,629
and occlusions part of its redundancy
and part of it is new use cases so

5934
01:38:30,629 --> 01:38:30,639
and part of it is new use cases so
 

5935
01:38:30,639 --> 01:38:33,830
and part of it is new use cases so
there's um uh new types of sensors uh to

5936
01:38:33,830 --> 01:38:33,840
there's um uh new types of sensors uh to
 

5937
01:38:33,840 --> 01:38:36,229
there's um uh new types of sensors uh to
optimize for long range and uh kind of

5938
01:38:36,229 --> 01:38:36,239
optimize for long range and uh kind of
 

5939
01:38:36,239 --> 01:38:38,470
optimize for long range and uh kind of
the the the sensing horizon that we look

5940
01:38:38,470 --> 01:38:38,480
the the the sensing horizon that we look
 

5941
01:38:38,480 --> 01:38:41,750
the the the sensing horizon that we look
for on our vehicles um that is unique to

5942
01:38:41,750 --> 01:38:41,760
for on our vehicles um that is unique to
 

5943
01:38:41,760 --> 01:38:43,350
for on our vehicles um that is unique to
trucks because it actually is like kind

5944
01:38:43,350 --> 01:38:43,360
trucks because it actually is like kind
 

5945
01:38:43,360 --> 01:38:46,070
trucks because it actually is like kind
of much like further out than um than a

5946
01:38:46,070 --> 01:38:46,080
of much like further out than um than a
 

5947
01:38:46,080 --> 01:38:48,229
of much like further out than um than a
car but a majority are actually used

5948
01:38:48,229 --> 01:38:48,239
car but a majority are actually used
 

5949
01:38:48,239 --> 01:38:49,590
car but a majority are actually used
across both cars and trucks and so we

5950
01:38:49,590 --> 01:38:49,600
across both cars and trucks and so we
 

5951
01:38:49,600 --> 01:38:51,830
across both cars and trucks and so we
use the same compute the same uh

5952
01:38:51,830 --> 01:38:51,840
use the same compute the same uh
 

5953
01:38:51,840 --> 01:38:54,790
use the same compute the same uh
fundamental baseline sensors cameras uh

5954
01:38:54,790 --> 01:38:54,800
fundamental baseline sensors cameras uh
 

5955
01:38:54,800 --> 01:38:58,310
fundamental baseline sensors cameras uh
radar um imus and so you get a great

5956
01:38:58,310 --> 01:38:58,320
radar um imus and so you get a great
 

5957
01:38:58,320 --> 01:39:00,070
radar um imus and so you get a great
leverage from all of the infrastructure

5958
01:39:00,070 --> 01:39:00,080
leverage from all of the infrastructure
 

5959
01:39:00,080 --> 01:39:01,590
leverage from all of the infrastructure
and the hardware development as a result

5960
01:39:01,590 --> 01:39:01,600
and the hardware development as a result
 

5961
01:39:01,600 --> 01:39:04,229
and the hardware development as a result
so what about cameras what role does so

5962
01:39:04,229 --> 01:39:04,239
so what about cameras what role does so
 

5963
01:39:04,239 --> 01:39:06,870
so what about cameras what role does so
lidar is this rich set of information

what role does lidar play what role does

5974
01:39:19,189 --> 01:39:19,199
what role does lidar play what role does
 

5975
01:39:19,199 --> 01:39:20,950
what role does lidar play what role does
vision

5976

01:39:26,070 --> 01:39:26,080
problem of autonomous trucking ah it is
 

5983
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:27,510
problem of autonomous trucking ah it is
beautiful there's like so much that

5984
01:39:27,510 --> 01:39:27,520
beautiful there's like so much that
 

5985
01:39:27,520 --> 01:39:28,709
beautiful there's like so much that
comes together

5986
01:39:28,709 --> 01:39:28,719
comes together
 

5987
01:39:28,719 --> 01:39:31,109
comes together
and how much yeah at which point do they

5988
01:39:31,109 --> 01:39:31,119
and how much yeah at which point do they
 

5989
01:39:31,119 --> 01:39:32,629
and how much yeah at which point do they
come together yeah

5990
01:39:32,629 --> 01:39:32,639
come together yeah
 

5991
01:39:32,639 --> 01:39:34,550
come together yeah
so let's start with lidar so lidar has

5992
01:39:34,550 --> 01:39:34,560
so let's start with lidar so lidar has
 

5993
01:39:34,560 --> 01:39:37,350
so let's start with lidar so lidar has
been like waymo's um uh one of waymo's

5994
01:39:37,350 --> 01:39:37,360
been like waymo's um uh one of waymo's
 

5995
01:39:37,360 --> 01:39:39,750
been like waymo's um uh one of waymo's
big strengths and advantages where uh we

5996
01:39:39,750 --> 01:39:39,760
big strengths and advantages where uh we
 

5997
01:39:39,760 --> 01:39:42,149
big strengths and advantages where uh we
developed our own lidar uh in-house

5998
01:39:42,149 --> 01:39:42,159
developed our own lidar uh in-house
 

5999
01:39:42,159 --> 01:39:44,550
developed our own lidar uh in-house
where many generations in both in cost

6000
01:39:44,550 --> 01:39:44,560
where many generations in both in cost
 

6001
01:39:44,560 --> 01:39:47,669
where many generations in both in cost
and functionality it is um uh the best

6002
01:39:47,669 --> 01:39:47,679
and functionality it is um uh the best
 

6003
01:39:47,679 --> 01:39:49,910
and functionality it is um uh the best
and you know in this in the space which

6004
01:39:49,910 --> 01:39:49,920
and you know in this in the space which
 

6005
01:39:49,920 --> 01:39:51,990
and you know in this in the space which
generation because i know there's this

6006
01:39:51,990 --> 01:39:52,000
generation because i know there's this
 

6007
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,149
generation because i know there's this
there's uh this cool i mean i love

6008
01:39:54,149 --> 01:39:54,159
there's uh this cool i mean i love
 

6009
01:39:54,159 --> 01:39:56,310
there's uh this cool i mean i love
versions that are increasing uh which

6010
01:39:56,310 --> 01:39:56,320
versions that are increasing uh which
 

6011
01:39:56,320 --> 01:39:58,229
versions that are increasing uh which
version of the hardware stack is at

6012
01:39:58,229 --> 01:39:58,239
version of the hardware stack is at
 

6013
01:39:58,239 --> 01:40:02,229
version of the hardware stack is at
currently uh officially publicly uh so

6014
01:40:02,229 --> 01:40:02,239
currently uh officially publicly uh so
 

6015
01:40:02,239 --> 01:40:03,910
currently uh officially publicly uh so
uh so some parts iterate more than

6016
01:40:03,910 --> 01:40:03,920
uh so some parts iterate more than
 

6017
01:40:03,920 --> 01:40:05,189
uh so some parts iterate more than
others i'm trying to remember on the

6018
01:40:05,189 --> 01:40:05,199
others i'm trying to remember on the
 

6019
01:40:05,199 --> 01:40:06,790
others i'm trying to remember on the
sensor side so this the entire

6020
01:40:06,790 --> 01:40:06,800
sensor side so this the entire
 

6021
01:40:06,800 --> 01:40:08,149
sensor side so this the entire
self-driving system which includes

6022
01:40:08,149 --> 01:40:08,159
self-driving system which includes
 

6023
01:40:08,159 --> 01:40:10,070
self-driving system which includes
sensors and compute is fifth generation

6024
01:40:10,070 --> 01:40:10,080
sensors and compute is fifth generation
 

6025
01:40:10,080 --> 01:40:12,790
sensors and compute is fifth generation
yes um i can't wait until there's like

6026
01:40:12,790 --> 01:40:12,800
yes um i can't wait until there's like
 

6027
01:40:12,800 --> 01:40:15,990
yes um i can't wait until there's like
iphone style like announcements yeah for

6028
01:40:15,990 --> 01:40:16,000
iphone style like announcements yeah for
 

6029
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:17,990
iphone style like announcements yeah for
like new versions of the weymouth

6030
01:40:17,990 --> 01:40:18,000
like new versions of the weymouth
 

6031
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:19,669
like new versions of the weymouth
hardware yeah well we try to be careful

6032
01:40:19,669 --> 01:40:19,679
hardware yeah well we try to be careful
 

6033
01:40:19,679 --> 01:40:20,950
hardware yeah well we try to be careful
because man when you change the hardware

6034
01:40:20,950 --> 01:40:20,960
because man when you change the hardware
 

6035
01:40:20,960 --> 01:40:22,390
because man when you change the hardware
it takes a lot to like retrain the

6036
01:40:22,390 --> 01:40:22,400
it takes a lot to like retrain the
 

6037
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:24,390
it takes a lot to like retrain the
models and uh and everything so we just

6038
01:40:24,390 --> 01:40:24,400
models and uh and everything so we just
 

6039
01:40:24,400 --> 01:40:25,590
models and uh and everything so we just
went through that and going from the

6040
01:40:25,590 --> 01:40:25,600
went through that and going from the
 

6041
01:40:25,600 --> 01:40:27,590
went through that and going from the
pacificas to the jaguars and so the

6042
01:40:27,590 --> 01:40:27,600
pacificas to the jaguars and so the
 

6043
01:40:27,600 --> 01:40:29,590
pacificas to the jaguars and so the
jaguars and then the trucks are you know

6044
01:40:29,590 --> 01:40:29,600
jaguars and then the trucks are you know
 

6045
01:40:29,600 --> 01:40:32,149
jaguars and then the trucks are you know
have the same generation now um but yeah

6046
01:40:32,149 --> 01:40:32,159
have the same generation now um but yeah
 

6047
01:40:32,159 --> 01:40:33,910
have the same generation now um but yeah
the lidar is uh it's incredible and so

6048
01:40:33,910 --> 01:40:33,920
the lidar is uh it's incredible and so
 

6049
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:36,310
the lidar is uh it's incredible and so
waymo has um leaned into that as a

6050
01:40:36,310 --> 01:40:36,320
waymo has um leaned into that as a
 

6051
01:40:36,320 --> 01:40:37,910
waymo has um leaned into that as a
strength and so a lot of the near-range

6052
01:40:37,910 --> 01:40:37,920
strength and so a lot of the near-range
 

6053
01:40:37,920 --> 01:40:39,990
strength and so a lot of the near-range
perception system

6054
01:40:39,990 --> 01:40:40,000
perception system
 

6055
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:41,830
perception system
that obviously kind of carries over a

6056
01:40:41,830 --> 01:40:41,840
that obviously kind of carries over a
 

6057
01:40:41,840 --> 01:40:44,310
that obviously kind of carries over a
lot from the car side uh uses lidar as a

6058
01:40:44,310 --> 01:40:44,320
lot from the car side uh uses lidar as a
 

6059
01:40:44,320 --> 01:40:45,750
lot from the car side uh uses lidar as a
very prominent kind of like primary

6060
01:40:45,750 --> 01:40:45,760
very prominent kind of like primary
 

6061
01:40:45,760 --> 01:40:47,910
very prominent kind of like primary
sensor but then obviously

6062
01:40:47,910 --> 01:40:47,920
sensor but then obviously
 

6063
01:40:47,920 --> 01:40:48,790
sensor but then obviously
everything has its strengths and

6064
01:40:48,790 --> 01:40:48,800
everything has its strengths and
 

6065
01:40:48,800 --> 01:40:51,350
everything has its strengths and
weaknesses and so in the near range

6066
01:40:51,350 --> 01:40:51,360
weaknesses and so in the near range
 

6067
01:40:51,360 --> 01:40:54,149
weaknesses and so in the near range
lidar is a gigantic advantage um and it

6068
01:40:54,149 --> 01:40:54,159
lidar is a gigantic advantage um and it
 

6069
01:40:54,159 --> 01:40:56,229
lidar is a gigantic advantage um and it
has its weaknesses on you know when it

6070
01:40:56,229 --> 01:40:56,239
has its weaknesses on you know when it
 

6071
01:40:56,239 --> 01:40:58,790
has its weaknesses on you know when it
comes to occlusions in certain areas

6072
01:40:58,790 --> 01:40:58,800
comes to occlusions in certain areas
 

6073
01:40:58,800 --> 01:41:00,470
comes to occlusions in certain areas
rain and weather like you know things

6074
01:41:00,470 --> 01:41:00,480
rain and weather like you know things
 

6075
01:41:00,480 --> 01:41:02,470
rain and weather like you know things
like that but it's an incredible sensor

6076
01:41:02,470 --> 01:41:02,480
like that but it's an incredible sensor
 

6077
01:41:02,480 --> 01:41:04,709
like that but it's an incredible sensor
and it gives you incredible density

6078
01:41:04,709 --> 01:41:04,719
and it gives you incredible density
 

6079
01:41:04,719 --> 01:41:06,950
and it gives you incredible density
perfect location precision and

6080
01:41:06,950 --> 01:41:06,960
perfect location precision and
 

6081
01:41:06,960 --> 01:41:09,350
perfect location precision and
consistency which is a very valuable

6082
01:41:09,350 --> 01:41:09,360
consistency which is a very valuable
 

6083
01:41:09,360 --> 01:41:12,470
consistency which is a very valuable
property um to be able to uh to kind of

6084
01:41:12,470 --> 01:41:12,480
property um to be able to uh to kind of
 

6085
01:41:12,480 --> 01:41:14,070
property um to be able to uh to kind of
apply a mel approach can you elaborate

6086
01:41:14,070 --> 01:41:14,080
apply a mel approach can you elaborate
 

6087
01:41:14,080 --> 01:41:17,030
apply a mel approach can you elaborate
consistency yeah when you have a camera

6088
01:41:17,030 --> 01:41:17,040
consistency yeah when you have a camera
 

6089
01:41:17,040 --> 01:41:19,350
consistency yeah when you have a camera
the position of the sun the time of the

6090
01:41:19,350 --> 01:41:19,360
the position of the sun the time of the
 

6091
01:41:19,360 --> 01:41:22,149
the position of the sun the time of the
day uh um various of the properties can

6092
01:41:22,149 --> 01:41:22,159
day uh um various of the properties can
 

6093
01:41:22,159 --> 01:41:23,990
day uh um various of the properties can
have a big impact uh whether there's

6094
01:41:23,990 --> 01:41:24,000
have a big impact uh whether there's
 

6095
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,149
have a big impact uh whether there's
glare the field of view things like that

6096
01:41:26,149 --> 01:41:26,159
glare the field of view things like that
 

6097
01:41:26,159 --> 01:41:26,870
glare the field of view things like that
um

6098
01:41:26,870 --> 01:41:26,880
um
 

6099
01:41:26,880 --> 01:41:30,870
um
so consistent the signal with uh

6100
01:41:30,870 --> 01:41:30,880
so consistent the signal with uh
 

6101
01:41:30,880 --> 01:41:32,629
so consistent the signal with uh
in the face of a changing external

6102
01:41:32,629 --> 01:41:32,639
in the face of a changing external
 

6103
01:41:32,639 --> 01:41:34,950
in the face of a changing external
environment the signal yeah daytime

6104
01:41:34,950 --> 01:41:34,960
environment the signal yeah daytime
 

6105
01:41:34,960 --> 01:41:36,070
environment the signal yeah daytime
night time

6106
01:41:36,070 --> 01:41:36,080
night time
 

6107
01:41:36,080 --> 01:41:38,390
night time
it's about 3d um

6108
01:41:38,390 --> 01:41:38,400
it's about 3d um
 

6109
01:41:38,400 --> 01:41:40,629
it's about 3d um
physical existence in effect like you're

6110
01:41:40,629 --> 01:41:40,639
physical existence in effect like you're
 

6111
01:41:40,639 --> 01:41:41,669
physical existence in effect like you're
you're seeing

6112
01:41:41,669 --> 01:41:41,679
you're seeing
 

6113
01:41:41,679 --> 01:41:43,270
you're seeing
beams of light that bounce physically

6114
01:41:43,270 --> 01:41:43,280
beams of light that bounce physically
 

6115
01:41:43,280 --> 01:41:44,870
beams of light that bounce physically
bounce off of something and come back

6116
01:41:44,870 --> 01:41:44,880
bounce off of something and come back
 

6117
01:41:44,880 --> 01:41:46,790
bounce off of something and come back
and so whatever the conditional

6118
01:41:46,790 --> 01:41:46,800
and so whatever the conditional
 

6119
01:41:46,800 --> 01:41:49,990
and so whatever the conditional
conditions are like the shape of a

6120
01:41:49,990 --> 01:41:50,000
conditions are like the shape of a
 

6121
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:50,870
conditions are like the shape of a
human

6122
01:41:50,870 --> 01:41:50,880
human
 

6123
01:41:50,880 --> 01:41:52,390

6125
01:41:52,400 --> 01:41:55,350
sensor reading from a human or from a
car or from an animal like you have um a

6126
01:41:55,350 --> 01:41:55,360
car or from an animal like you have um a
 

6127
01:41:55,360 --> 01:41:57,270
car or from an animal like you have um a
reliability there which ends up being

6128
01:41:57,270 --> 01:41:57,280
reliability there which ends up being
 

6129
01:41:57,280 --> 01:41:58,709
reliability there which ends up being
valuable for kind of like the long tail

6130
01:41:58,709 --> 01:41:58,719
valuable for kind of like the long tail
 

6131
01:41:58,719 --> 01:42:00,390
valuable for kind of like the long tail
of challenges yeah now

6132
01:42:00,390 --> 01:42:00,400
of challenges yeah now
 

6133
01:42:00,400 --> 01:42:02,070
of challenges yeah now
lidar is the first sensor to drop off in

6134
01:42:02,070 --> 01:42:02,080
lidar is the first sensor to drop off in
 

6135
01:42:02,080 --> 01:42:03,270
lidar is the first sensor to drop off in
terms of range and ours has a really

6136
01:42:03,270 --> 01:42:03,280
terms of range and ours has a really
 

6137
01:42:03,280 --> 01:42:05,030
terms of range and ours has a really
good range but at the end of the day um

6138
01:42:05,030 --> 01:42:05,040
good range but at the end of the day um
 

6139
01:42:05,040 --> 01:42:07,430
good range but at the end of the day um
it drops off and so particularly for um

6140
01:42:07,430 --> 01:42:07,440
it drops off and so particularly for um
 

6141
01:42:07,440 --> 01:42:09,270
it drops off and so particularly for um
for trucks on top of the general

6142
01:42:09,270 --> 01:42:09,280
for trucks on top of the general
 

6143
01:42:09,280 --> 01:42:10,790
for trucks on top of the general
redundancy that you want for near range

6144
01:42:10,790 --> 01:42:10,800
redundancy that you want for near range
 

6145
01:42:10,800 --> 01:42:12,790
redundancy that you want for near range
with and complements through cameras and

6146
01:42:12,790 --> 01:42:12,800
with and complements through cameras and
 

6147
01:42:12,800 --> 01:42:14,550
with and complements through cameras and
radar for occlusions and for

6148
01:42:14,550 --> 01:42:14,560
radar for occlusions and for
 

6149
01:42:14,560 --> 01:42:16,310
radar for occlusions and for
complementary information and so forth

6150
01:42:16,310 --> 01:42:16,320
complementary information and so forth
 

6151
01:42:16,320 --> 01:42:18,070
complementary information and so forth
when you get to long range you have to

6152
01:42:18,070 --> 01:42:18,080
when you get to long range you have to
 

6153
01:42:18,080 --> 01:42:21,030
when you get to long range you have to
be radar and camera primary because your

6154
01:42:21,030 --> 01:42:21,040
be radar and camera primary because your
 

6155
01:42:21,040 --> 01:42:22,790
be radar and camera primary because your
lidar data will fundamentally drop off

6156
01:42:22,790 --> 01:42:22,800
lidar data will fundamentally drop off
 

6157
01:42:22,800 --> 01:42:24,709
lidar data will fundamentally drop off
after a period of time and you have to

6158
01:42:24,709 --> 01:42:24,719
after a period of time and you have to
 

6159
01:42:24,719 --> 01:42:26,390
after a period of time and you have to
be able to see um kind of objects

6160
01:42:26,390 --> 01:42:26,400
be able to see um kind of objects
 

6161
01:42:26,400 --> 01:42:30,229
be able to see um kind of objects
further out now uh cameras have uh

6162
01:42:30,229 --> 01:42:30,239
further out now uh cameras have uh
 

6163
01:42:30,239 --> 01:42:33,189
further out now uh cameras have uh
the the incredible range um where you

6164
01:42:33,189 --> 01:42:33,199
the the incredible range um where you
 

6165
01:42:33,199 --> 01:42:34,790
the the incredible range um where you
get a high density high resolution

6166
01:42:34,790 --> 01:42:34,800
get a high density high resolution
 

6167
01:42:34,800 --> 01:42:36,550
get a high density high resolution
camera you can get data you know well

6168
01:42:36,550 --> 01:42:36,560
camera you can get data you know well
 

6169
01:42:36,560 --> 01:42:38,870
camera you can get data you know well
past a kilometer and it's like really um

6170
01:42:38,870 --> 01:42:38,880
past a kilometer and it's like really um
 

6171
01:42:38,880 --> 01:42:41,109
past a kilometer and it's like really um
potentially a huge value now the signal

6172
01:42:41,109 --> 01:42:41,119
potentially a huge value now the signal
 

6173
01:42:41,119 --> 01:42:43,350
potentially a huge value now the signal
drops off the noise is higher detecting

6174
01:42:43,350 --> 01:42:43,360
drops off the noise is higher detecting
 

6175
01:42:43,360 --> 01:42:46,550
drops off the noise is higher detecting
is harder classifying is harder and one

6176
01:42:46,550 --> 01:42:46,560
is harder classifying is harder and one
 

6177
01:42:46,560 --> 01:42:47,990
is harder classifying is harder and one
that you might think about localizing

6178
01:42:47,990 --> 01:42:48,000
that you might think about localizing
 

6179
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,310
that you might think about localizing
it's harder because you can be off by

6180
01:42:50,310 --> 01:42:50,320
it's harder because you can be off by
 

6181
01:42:50,320 --> 01:42:51,189
it's harder because you can be off by
like

6182
01:42:51,189 --> 01:42:51,199
like
 

6183
01:42:51,199 --> 01:42:53,030
like
two meters and where something's located

6184
01:42:53,030 --> 01:42:53,040
two meters and where something's located
 

6185
01:42:53,040 --> 01:42:54,790
two meters and where something's located
a kilometer away and that's the

6186
01:42:54,790 --> 01:42:54,800
a kilometer away and that's the
 

6187
01:42:54,800 --> 01:42:55,990
a kilometer away and that's the
difference between being on the shoulder

6188
01:42:55,990 --> 01:42:56,000
difference between being on the shoulder
 

6189
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:57,350
difference between being on the shoulder
and being in your lane and so you have

6190
01:42:57,350 --> 01:42:57,360
and being in your lane and so you have
 

6191
01:42:57,360 --> 01:42:58,709
and being in your lane and so you have
like interesting challenges there that

6192
01:42:58,709 --> 01:42:58,719
like interesting challenges there that
 

6193
01:42:58,719 --> 01:42:59,910
like interesting challenges there that
you have to solve which have a bunch of

6194
01:42:59,910 --> 01:42:59,920
you have to solve which have a bunch of
 

6195
01:42:59,920 --> 01:43:02,070
you have to solve which have a bunch of
approaches that come into it um radar is

6196
01:43:02,070 --> 01:43:02,080
approaches that come into it um radar is
 

6197
01:43:02,080 --> 01:43:03,990
approaches that come into it um radar is
interesting because um

6198
01:43:03,990 --> 01:43:04,000
interesting because um
 

6199
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:05,030
interesting because um
uh

6200
01:43:05,030 --> 01:43:05,040
uh
 

6201
01:43:05,040 --> 01:43:07,910
uh
uh because it also has longer range than

6202
01:43:07,910 --> 01:43:07,920
uh because it also has longer range than
 

6203
01:43:07,920 --> 01:43:11,109
uh because it also has longer range than
um than lidar uh and it gives you speed

6204
01:43:11,109 --> 01:43:11,119
um than lidar uh and it gives you speed
 

6205
01:43:11,119 --> 01:43:13,030
um than lidar uh and it gives you speed
information so it becomes very very

6206
01:43:13,030 --> 01:43:13,040
information so it becomes very very
 

6207
01:43:13,040 --> 01:43:15,590
information so it becomes very very
useful for dynamic information of

6208
01:43:15,590 --> 01:43:15,600
useful for dynamic information of
 

6209
01:43:15,600 --> 01:43:19,270
useful for dynamic information of
traffic flow uh vehicle motions animals

6210
01:43:19,270 --> 01:43:19,280
traffic flow uh vehicle motions animals
 

6211
01:43:19,280 --> 01:43:21,830
traffic flow uh vehicle motions animals
pedestrians like uh just things that

6212
01:43:21,830 --> 01:43:21,840
pedestrians like uh just things that
 

6213
01:43:21,840 --> 01:43:25,910
pedestrians like uh just things that
might be um useful signals um and uh

6214
01:43:25,910 --> 01:43:25,920
might be um useful signals um and uh
 

6215
01:43:25,920 --> 01:43:27,109
might be um useful signals um and uh
it helps with weather conditions where

6216
01:43:27,109 --> 01:43:27,119
it helps with weather conditions where
 

6217
01:43:27,119 --> 01:43:28,390
it helps with weather conditions where
radar actually penetrates weather

6218
01:43:28,390 --> 01:43:28,400
radar actually penetrates weather
 

6219
01:43:28,400 --> 01:43:30,149
radar actually penetrates weather
conditions in a better way than um other

6220
01:43:30,149 --> 01:43:30,159
conditions in a better way than um other
 

6221
01:43:30,159 --> 01:43:32,229
conditions in a better way than um other
sensors and so it's just it's kind of

6222
01:43:32,229 --> 01:43:32,239
sensors and so it's just it's kind of
 

6223
01:43:32,239 --> 01:43:33,990
sensors and so it's just it's kind of
interesting where we've kind of started

6224
01:43:33,990 --> 01:43:34,000
interesting where we've kind of started
 

6225
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:35,910
interesting where we've kind of started
to converge towards not thinking about a

6226
01:43:35,910 --> 01:43:35,920
to converge towards not thinking about a
 

6227
01:43:35,920 --> 01:43:37,590
to converge towards not thinking about a
problem as a lidar problem or a camera

6228
01:43:37,590 --> 01:43:37,600
problem as a lidar problem or a camera
 

6229
01:43:37,600 --> 01:43:39,430
problem as a lidar problem or a camera
problem or radar problem but it's a

6230
01:43:39,430 --> 01:43:39,440
problem or radar problem but it's a
 

6231
01:43:39,440 --> 01:43:41,430
problem or radar problem but it's a
fusion problem where

6232
01:43:41,430 --> 01:43:41,440
fusion problem where
 

6233
01:43:41,440 --> 01:43:43,590
fusion problem where
these are all like large scale ml

6234
01:43:43,590 --> 01:43:43,600
these are all like large scale ml
 

6235
01:43:43,600 --> 01:43:45,350
these are all like large scale ml
problems where you put data into the

6236
01:43:45,350 --> 01:43:45,360
problems where you put data into the
 

6237
01:43:45,360 --> 01:43:48,470
problems where you put data into the
system and in many cases you just look

6238
01:43:48,470 --> 01:43:48,480
system and in many cases you just look
 

6239
01:43:48,480 --> 01:43:50,790
system and in many cases you just look
for the signals that might be present in

6240
01:43:50,790 --> 01:43:50,800
for the signals that might be present in
 

6241
01:43:50,800 --> 01:43:52,709
for the signals that might be present in
the union of all of these and

6242
01:43:52,709 --> 01:43:52,719
the union of all of these and
 

6243
01:43:52,719 --> 01:43:54,310
the union of all of these and
leave it to the system as much as

6244
01:43:54,310 --> 01:43:54,320
leave it to the system as much as
 

6245
01:43:54,320 --> 01:43:56,709
leave it to the system as much as
possible to start to really identify how

6246
01:43:56,709 --> 01:43:56,719
possible to start to really identify how
 

6247
01:43:56,719 --> 01:43:58,390
possible to start to really identify how
to um how to extract that and then

6248
01:43:58,390 --> 01:43:58,400
to um how to extract that and then
 

6249
01:43:58,400 --> 01:43:59,669
to um how to extract that and then
there's places we have to intervene and

6250
01:43:59,669 --> 01:43:59,679
there's places we have to intervene and
 

6251
01:43:59,679 --> 01:44:00,629
there's places we have to intervene and
actually

6252
01:44:00,629 --> 01:44:00,639
actually
 

6253
01:44:00,639 --> 01:44:02,310
actually
include more but um

6254
01:44:02,310 --> 01:44:02,320
include more but um
 

6255
01:44:02,320 --> 01:44:03,910
include more but um
no single sensor is in a great position

6256
01:44:03,910 --> 01:44:03,920
no single sensor is in a great position
 

6257
01:44:03,920 --> 01:44:05,350
no single sensor is in a great position
to like really solve this problem and

6258
01:44:05,350 --> 01:44:05,360
to like really solve this problem and
 

6259
01:44:05,360 --> 01:44:08,149
to like really solve this problem and
then without a huge extra challenge

6260
01:44:08,149 --> 01:44:08,159
then without a huge extra challenge
 

6261
01:44:08,159 --> 01:44:10,149
then without a huge extra challenge
that's fascinating um

6262
01:44:10,149 --> 01:44:10,159
that's fascinating um
 

6263
01:44:10,159 --> 01:44:11,910
that's fascinating um
there's a question that's probably still

6264
01:44:11,910 --> 01:44:11,920
there's a question that's probably still
 

6265
01:44:11,920 --> 01:44:13,990
there's a question that's probably still
an open question is at which point do

6266
01:44:13,990 --> 01:44:14,000
an open question is at which point do
 

6267
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:15,350
an open question is at which point do
you fuse them

6268
01:44:15,350 --> 01:44:15,360
you fuse them
 

6269
01:44:15,360 --> 01:44:16,470
you fuse them
do you

6270
01:44:16,470 --> 01:44:16,480
do you
 

6271
01:44:16,480 --> 01:44:17,189
do you
do

6272
01:44:17,189 --> 01:44:17,199
do
 

6273
01:44:17,199 --> 01:44:19,669
do
do you solve the perception problem for

6274
01:44:19,669 --> 01:44:19,679
do you solve the perception problem for
 

6275
01:44:19,679 --> 01:44:22,310
do you solve the perception problem for
each sensor suite individually the

6276
01:44:22,310 --> 01:44:22,320
each sensor suite individually the
 

6277
01:44:22,320 --> 01:44:24,870
each sensor suite individually the
lighter suite and the camera suite or do

6278
01:44:24,870 --> 01:44:24,880
lighter suite and the camera suite or do
 

6279
01:44:24,880 --> 01:44:25,590
lighter suite and the camera suite or do
you

6280
01:44:25,590 --> 01:44:25,600
you
 

6281
01:44:25,600 --> 01:44:28,149
you
do some kind of heterogeneous fusion or

6282
01:44:28,149 --> 01:44:28,159
do some kind of heterogeneous fusion or
 

6283
01:44:28,159 --> 01:44:32,070
do some kind of heterogeneous fusion or
do you fuse at the very beginning

6284
01:44:32,070 --> 01:44:32,080

 

6285
01:44:32,080 --> 01:44:33,669

is there a good answer or at least an

6286
01:44:33,669 --> 01:44:33,679
is there a good answer or at least an
 

6287
01:44:33,679 --> 01:44:35,350
is there a good answer or at least an
inkling of intuitions you can accomplish

6288
01:44:35,350 --> 01:44:35,360
inkling of intuitions you can accomplish
 

6289
01:44:35,360 --> 01:44:37,430
inkling of intuitions you can accomplish
yeah so people refer to this as like um

6290
01:44:37,430 --> 01:44:37,440
yeah so people refer to this as like um
 

6291
01:44:37,440 --> 01:44:39,270
yeah so people refer to this as like um
early fusion or late fusion so late

6292
01:44:39,270 --> 01:44:39,280
early fusion or late fusion so late
 

6293
01:44:39,280 --> 01:44:41,270
early fusion or late fusion so late
fusion might be that you have like the

6294
01:44:41,270 --> 01:44:41,280
fusion might be that you have like the
 

6295
01:44:41,280 --> 01:44:43,430
fusion might be that you have like the
the camera pipeline the lidar pipeline

6296
01:44:43,430 --> 01:44:43,440
the camera pipeline the lidar pipeline
 

6297
01:44:43,440 --> 01:44:45,750
the camera pipeline the lidar pipeline
and then you like fuse them and like

6298
01:44:45,750 --> 01:44:45,760
and then you like fuse them and like
 

6299
01:44:45,760 --> 01:44:47,430
and then you like fuse them and like
when it gets to like final

6300
01:44:47,430 --> 01:44:47,440
when it gets to like final
 

6301
01:44:47,440 --> 01:44:49,189
when it gets to like final
you know semantics and classification

6302
01:44:49,189 --> 01:44:49,199
you know semantics and classification
 

6303
01:44:49,199 --> 01:44:50,709
you know semantics and classification
and tracking you like kind of fuse them

6304
01:44:50,709 --> 01:44:50,719
and tracking you like kind of fuse them
 

6305
01:44:50,719 --> 01:44:52,390
and tracking you like kind of fuse them
together and and figure out which one's

6306
01:44:52,390 --> 01:44:52,400
together and and figure out which one's
 

6307
01:44:52,400 --> 01:44:54,950
together and and figure out which one's
best um there's more and more evidence

6308
01:44:54,950 --> 01:44:54,960
best um there's more and more evidence
 

6309
01:44:54,960 --> 01:44:57,910
best um there's more and more evidence
that um uh that early fusion is

6310
01:44:57,910 --> 01:44:57,920
that um uh that early fusion is
 

6311
01:44:57,920 --> 01:45:01,750
that um uh that early fusion is
important um and that is because uh

6312
01:45:01,750 --> 01:45:01,760
important um and that is because uh
 

6313
01:45:01,760 --> 01:45:04,149
important um and that is because uh
weight fusion does not allow you to pick

6314
01:45:04,149 --> 01:45:04,159
weight fusion does not allow you to pick
 

6315
01:45:04,159 --> 01:45:06,070
weight fusion does not allow you to pick
up on the complementary strengths and

6316
01:45:06,070 --> 01:45:06,080
up on the complementary strengths and
 

6317
01:45:06,080 --> 01:45:08,310
up on the complementary strengths and
weaknesses of the sensors um weather is

6318
01:45:08,310 --> 01:45:08,320
weaknesses of the sensors um weather is
 

6319
01:45:08,320 --> 01:45:10,870
weaknesses of the sensors um weather is
a great example where um if you do early

6320
01:45:10,870 --> 01:45:10,880
a great example where um if you do early
 

6321
01:45:10,880 --> 01:45:12,470
a great example where um if you do early
fusion you have an incredibly hard

6322
01:45:12,470 --> 01:45:12,480
fusion you have an incredibly hard
 

6323
01:45:12,480 --> 01:45:14,709
fusion you have an incredibly hard
problem for any single sensor in rain to

6324
01:45:14,709 --> 01:45:14,719
problem for any single sensor in rain to
 

6325
01:45:14,719 --> 01:45:17,669
problem for any single sensor in rain to
solve that problem um because you have

6326
01:45:17,669 --> 01:45:17,679
solve that problem um because you have
 

6327
01:45:17,679 --> 01:45:20,229
solve that problem um because you have
reflections from the lidar um you have

6328
01:45:20,229 --> 01:45:20,239
reflections from the lidar um you have
 

6329
01:45:20,239 --> 01:45:21,350
reflections from the lidar um you have
uh

6330
01:45:21,350 --> 01:45:21,360
uh
 

6331
01:45:21,360 --> 01:45:22,950
uh
you know weird kind of noise from the

6332
01:45:22,950 --> 01:45:22,960
you know weird kind of noise from the
 

6333
01:45:22,960 --> 01:45:25,189
you know weird kind of noise from the
camera blah blah blah right but the

6334
01:45:25,189 --> 01:45:25,199
camera blah blah blah right but the
 

6335
01:45:25,199 --> 01:45:26,709
camera blah blah blah right but the
combination of all of them can help you

6336
01:45:26,709 --> 01:45:26,719
combination of all of them can help you
 

6337
01:45:26,719 --> 01:45:28,229
combination of all of them can help you
filter and help you get to the real

6338
01:45:28,229 --> 01:45:28,239
filter and help you get to the real
 

6339
01:45:28,239 --> 01:45:30,390
filter and help you get to the real
signal that then gets you as close as

6340
01:45:30,390 --> 01:45:30,400
signal that then gets you as close as
 

6341
01:45:30,400 --> 01:45:32,390
signal that then gets you as close as
possible to the original stack

6342
01:45:32,390 --> 01:45:32,400
possible to the original stack
 

6343
01:45:32,400 --> 01:45:34,390
possible to the original stack
and be much more fluid about the

6344
01:45:34,390 --> 01:45:34,400
and be much more fluid about the
 

6345
01:45:34,400 --> 01:45:36,310
and be much more fluid about the
strengths and weaknesses where

6346
01:45:36,310 --> 01:45:36,320
strengths and weaknesses where
 

6347
01:45:36,320 --> 01:45:38,070
strengths and weaknesses where
um you know your camera is much more

6348
01:45:38,070 --> 01:45:38,080
um you know your camera is much more
 

6349
01:45:38,080 --> 01:45:40,390
um you know your camera is much more
susceptible to like kind of uh fouling

6350
01:45:40,390 --> 01:45:40,400
susceptible to like kind of uh fouling
 

6351
01:45:40,400 --> 01:45:43,109
susceptible to like kind of uh fouling
on the on the actual lens from

01:45:43,109 --> 01:45:43,119
on the on the actual lens from
 

6353
01:45:43,119 --> 01:45:45,270
on the on the actual lens from
you know like rain or random stuff

6354
01:45:45,270 --> 01:45:45,280
you know like rain or random stuff
 

6355
01:45:45,280 --> 01:45:46,470
you know like rain or random stuff
whereas like you might be a little bit

6356
01:45:46,470 --> 01:45:46,480
whereas like you might be a little bit
 

6357
01:45:46,480 --> 01:45:48,149
whereas like you might be a little bit
more resilient than other sensors and so

6358
01:45:48,149 --> 01:45:48,159
more resilient than other sensors and so
 

6359
01:45:48,159 --> 01:45:50,070
more resilient than other sensors and so
there's an element of

6360
01:45:50,070 --> 01:45:50,080
there's an element of
 

6361
01:45:50,080 --> 01:45:51,510
there's an element of
logic that always happens late in the

6362
01:45:51,510 --> 01:45:51,520
logic that always happens late in the
 

6363
01:45:51,520 --> 01:45:53,990
logic that always happens late in the
game but that fusion early on actually

6364
01:45:53,990 --> 01:45:54,000
game but that fusion early on actually
 

6365
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:55,830
game but that fusion early on actually
especially as you move towards ml and

6366
01:45:55,830 --> 01:45:55,840

6453
01:47:18,480 --> 01:47:20,790

01:47:24,159 --> 01:47:26,709
you know is a little bit kind of like

01:47:28,800 --> 01:47:30,310
you have modules but enough ability to
think about long tail problems and so

6464
01:47:30,310 --> 01:47:30,320
think about long tail problems and so
 

6465
01:47:30,320 --> 01:47:33,030

01:48:29,600 --> 01:48:32,310
is the data required for the trucking
problem so we uh we we use all the same

6528
01:48:32,310 --> 01:48:32,320
problem so we uh we we use all the same
 

6529
01:48:32,320 --> 01:48:34,550
problem so we uh we we use all the same
infrastructure um so labeling workflows

6530
01:48:34,550 --> 01:48:34,560
infrastructure um so labeling workflows
 

6531
01:48:34,560 --> 01:48:36,149
infrastructure um so labeling workflows
ml workflows everything so that actually

6532
01:48:36,149 --> 01:48:36,159
ml workflows everything so that actually
 

6533
01:48:36,159 --> 01:48:38,390
ml workflows everything so that actually
carries over quite well um

6534
01:48:38,390 --> 01:48:38,400
carries over quite well um
 

6535
01:48:38,400 --> 01:48:41,189
carries over quite well um
we heavily reuse the data even where

6536
01:48:41,189 --> 01:48:41,199
we heavily reuse the data even where
 

6537
01:48:41,199 --> 01:48:42,709
we heavily reuse the data even where
almost every model that we have on a

6538
01:48:42,709 --> 01:48:42,719
almost every model that we have on a
 

6539
01:48:42,719 --> 01:48:45,030
almost every model that we have on a
truck we started with the latest car

6540
01:48:45,030 --> 01:48:45,040
truck we started with the latest car
 

6541
01:48:45,040 --> 01:48:47,750
truck we started with the latest car
model cool and um so it's almost like a

6542
01:48:47,750 --> 01:48:47,760
model cool and um so it's almost like a
 

6543
01:48:47,760 --> 01:48:49,830
model cool and um so it's almost like a
good background model yeah it's like you

6544
01:48:49,830 --> 01:48:49,840
good background model yeah it's like you
 

6545
01:48:49,840 --> 01:48:51,669
good background model yeah it's like you
can think of like you despite the

6546
01:48:51,669 --> 01:48:51,679
can think of like you despite the
 

6547
01:48:51,679 --> 01:48:52,950
can think of like you despite the
different domain and different numbers

6548
01:48:52,950 --> 01:48:52,960
different domain and different numbers
 

6549
01:48:52,960 --> 01:48:54,550
different domain and different numbers
of sensors and position of sensors

6550
01:48:54,550 --> 01:48:54,560
of sensors and position of sensors
 

6551
01:48:54,560 --> 01:48:56,229
of sensors and position of sensors
there's a lot of signals that carry over

6552
01:48:56,229 --> 01:48:56,239
there's a lot of signals that carry over
 

6553
01:48:56,239 --> 01:48:58,310
there's a lot of signals that carry over
across driving and so it's almost like

6554
01:48:58,310 --> 01:48:58,320
across driving and so it's almost like
 

6555
01:48:58,320 --> 01:48:59,750
across driving and so it's almost like
pre-training and getting a big boost out

6556
01:48:59,750 --> 01:48:59,760
pre-training and getting a big boost out
 

6557
01:48:59,760 --> 01:49:00,950
pre-training and getting a big boost out
of the gate where you can reduce the

6558
01:49:00,950 --> 01:49:00,960
of the gate where you can reduce the
 

6559
01:49:00,960 --> 01:49:02,790
of the gate where you can reduce the
amount of data you need by a lot

6560
01:49:02,790 --> 01:49:02,800
amount of data you need by a lot
 

6561
01:49:02,800 --> 01:49:04,149
amount of data you need by a lot
and it goes both ways actually and so

6562
01:49:04,149 --> 01:49:04,159
and it goes both ways actually and so
 

6563
01:49:04,159 --> 01:49:05,350
and it goes both ways actually and so
we're increasingly thinking about our

6564
01:49:05,350 --> 01:49:05,360
we're increasingly thinking about our
 

6565
01:49:05,360 --> 01:49:06,229
we're increasingly thinking about our
data

6566
01:49:06,229 --> 01:49:06,239
data
 

6567
01:49:06,239 --> 01:49:08,070
data
strategy on how we leverage both of

6568
01:49:08,070 --> 01:49:08,080
strategy on how we leverage both of
 

6569
01:49:08,080 --> 01:49:09,030
strategy on how we leverage both of
these

6570
01:49:09,030 --> 01:49:09,040
these
 

6571
01:49:09,040 --> 01:49:11,590
these
so you think about um you know how other

6572
01:49:11,590 --> 01:49:11,600
so you think about um you know how other
 

6573
01:49:11,600 --> 01:49:13,189
so you think about um you know how other
agents react to a truck yeah it's a

6574
01:49:13,189 --> 01:49:13,199
agents react to a truck yeah it's a
 

6575
01:49:13,199 --> 01:49:14,149
agents react to a truck yeah it's a
little bit different but the

6576
01:49:14,149 --> 01:49:14,159
little bit different but the
 

6577
01:49:14,159 --> 01:49:16,149
little bit different but the
fundamentals are actually like what will

6578
01:49:16,149 --> 01:49:16,159
fundamentals are actually like what will
 

6579
01:49:16,159 --> 01:49:18,310
fundamentals are actually like what will
other vehicles in the road do there's a

6580
01:49:18,310 --> 01:49:18,320
other vehicles in the road do there's a
 

6581
01:49:18,320 --> 01:49:19,750
other vehicles in the road do there's a
lot of carryover that's possible and in

6582
01:49:19,750 --> 01:49:19,760
lot of carryover that's possible and in
 

6583
01:49:19,760 --> 01:49:20,709
lot of carryover that's possible and in
fact

6584
01:49:20,709 --> 01:49:20,719
fact
 

6585
01:49:20,719 --> 01:49:23,109
fact
just to give you an example uh we're

6586
01:49:23,109 --> 01:49:23,119
just to give you an example uh we're
 

6587
01:49:23,119 --> 01:49:24,790
just to give you an example uh we're
constantly kind of like adding more data

6588
01:49:24,790 --> 01:49:24,800
constantly kind of like adding more data
 

6589
01:49:24,800 --> 01:49:26,470
constantly kind of like adding more data
from the trucking side but as of right

6590
01:49:26,470 --> 01:49:26,480
from the trucking side but as of right
 

6591
01:49:26,480 --> 01:49:27,430
from the trucking side but as of right
now

6592
01:49:27,430 --> 01:49:27,440
now
 

6593
01:49:27,440 --> 01:49:29,189
now
when we think of our like one of our

6594
01:49:29,189 --> 01:49:29,199
when we think of our like one of our
 

6595
01:49:29,199 --> 01:49:31,669
when we think of our like one of our
models behavior prediction for other

6596
01:49:31,669 --> 01:49:31,679
models behavior prediction for other
 

6597
01:49:31,679 --> 01:49:34,390
models behavior prediction for other
agents on the road like vehicles

6598
01:49:34,390 --> 01:49:34,400
agents on the road like vehicles
 

6599
01:49:34,400 --> 01:49:38,550
agents on the road like vehicles
85 percent of that data comes from cars

6600
01:49:38,550 --> 01:49:38,560
85 percent of that data comes from cars
 

6601
01:49:38,560 --> 01:49:40,390
85 percent of that data comes from cars
and a lot of that 85 comes from surface

6602
01:49:40,390 --> 01:49:40,400
and a lot of that 85 comes from surface
 

6603
01:49:40,400 --> 01:49:41,510
and a lot of that 85 comes from surface
streets

6604
01:49:41,510 --> 01:49:41,520
streets
 

6605
01:49:41,520 --> 01:49:43,189
streets
because we just had so much of it and it

6606
01:49:43,189 --> 01:49:43,199
because we just had so much of it and it
 

6607
01:49:43,199 --> 01:49:45,589
because we just had so much of it and it
was really valuable and so we're adding

6608
01:49:45,589 --> 01:49:45,599
was really valuable and so we're adding
 

6609
01:49:45,599 --> 01:49:46,870
was really valuable and so we're adding
in more and more particularly in the

6610
01:49:46,870 --> 01:49:46,880
in more and more particularly in the
 

6611
01:49:46,880 --> 01:49:49,189
in more and more particularly in the
areas where we need more data but you

6612
01:49:49,189 --> 01:49:49,199
areas where we need more data but you
 

6613
01:49:49,199 --> 01:49:50,790
areas where we need more data but you
get a huge boost out of the gate just

6614
01:49:50,790 --> 01:49:50,800
get a huge boost out of the gate just
 

6615
01:49:50,800 --> 01:49:52,790
get a huge boost out of the gate just
all different visual characteristics of

6616
01:49:52,790 --> 01:49:52,800
all different visual characteristics of
 

6617
01:49:52,800 --> 01:49:55,189
all different visual characteristics of
roads lane markings pedestrians all that

6618
01:49:55,189 --> 01:49:55,199
roads lane markings pedestrians all that
 

6619
01:49:55,199 --> 01:49:57,030
roads lane markings pedestrians all that
that's still relevant it's all still

6620
01:49:57,030 --> 01:49:57,040
that's still relevant it's all still
 

6621
01:49:57,040 --> 01:49:58,470
that's still relevant it's all still
relevant and then just the fundamentals

6622
01:49:58,470 --> 01:49:58,480
relevant and then just the fundamentals
 

6623
01:49:58,480 --> 01:50:01,189
relevant and then just the fundamentals
of how you know you detect the car

6624
01:50:01,189 --> 01:50:01,199
of how you know you detect the car
 

6625
01:50:01,199 --> 01:50:02,870
of how you know you detect the car
does it really change that much whether

6626
01:50:02,870 --> 01:50:02,880
does it really change that much whether
 

6627
01:50:02,880 --> 01:50:04,229
does it really change that much whether
you're detecting it from a car or a

6628
01:50:04,229 --> 01:50:04,239
you're detecting it from a car or a
 

6629
01:50:04,239 --> 01:50:06,390
you're detecting it from a car or a
truck um the fundamentals of how a

6630
01:50:06,390 --> 01:50:06,400
truck um the fundamentals of how a
 

6631
01:50:06,400 --> 01:50:08,550
truck um the fundamentals of how a
person will walk around your vehicle is

6632
01:50:08,550 --> 01:50:08,560
person will walk around your vehicle is
 

6633
01:50:08,560 --> 01:50:10,709
person will walk around your vehicle is
it it'll change a little bit but the

6634
01:50:10,709 --> 01:50:10,719
it it'll change a little bit but the
 

6635
01:50:10,719 --> 01:50:12,229
it it'll change a little bit but the
basics like there's a lot of signal in

6636
01:50:12,229 --> 01:50:12,239
basics like there's a lot of signal in
 

6637
01:50:12,239 --> 01:50:14,149
basics like there's a lot of signal in
there that as a starting point to a

6638
01:50:14,149 --> 01:50:14,159
there that as a starting point to a
 

6639
01:50:14,159 --> 01:50:16,070
there that as a starting point to a
network can actually be very valuable

6640
01:50:16,070 --> 01:50:16,080
network can actually be very valuable
 

6641
01:50:16,080 --> 01:50:17,430
network can actually be very valuable
now we do have some very unique

6642
01:50:17,430 --> 01:50:17,440
now we do have some very unique
 

6643
01:50:17,440 --> 01:50:18,870
now we do have some very unique
challenges where there's a sparsity of

6644
01:50:18,870 --> 01:50:18,880
challenges where there's a sparsity of
 

6645
01:50:18,880 --> 01:50:21,430
challenges where there's a sparsity of
events on a freeway um the frequency of

6646
01:50:21,430 --> 01:50:21,440
events on a freeway um the frequency of
 

6647
01:50:21,440 --> 01:50:23,030
events on a freeway um the frequency of
events happening on a freeway whether

6648
01:50:23,030 --> 01:50:23,040
events happening on a freeway whether
 

6649
01:50:23,040 --> 01:50:25,350
events happening on a freeway whether
it's you know interesting

6650
01:50:25,350 --> 01:50:25,360
it's you know interesting
 

6651
01:50:25,360 --> 01:50:26,790
it's you know interesting
you know objects in the road or

6652
01:50:26,790 --> 01:50:26,800
you know objects in the road or
 

6653
01:50:26,800 --> 01:50:29,109
you know objects in the road or
incidents or or even like from a human

6654
01:50:29,109 --> 01:50:29,119
incidents or or even like from a human
 

6655
01:50:29,119 --> 01:50:30,950
incidents or or even like from a human
benchmark like how often does a human

6656
01:50:30,950 --> 01:50:30,960
benchmark like how often does a human
 

6657
01:50:30,960 --> 01:50:33,910
benchmark like how often does a human
have an accident on a freeway is far

6658
01:50:33,910 --> 01:50:33,920
have an accident on a freeway is far
 

6659
01:50:33,920 --> 01:50:35,589
have an accident on a freeway is far
more sparse than on a surface street and

6660
01:50:35,589 --> 01:50:35,599
more sparse than on a surface street and
 

6661
01:50:35,599 --> 01:50:37,350
more sparse than on a surface street and
so that leads to really interesting data

6662
01:50:37,350 --> 01:50:37,360
so that leads to really interesting data
 

6663
01:50:37,360 --> 01:50:38,709
so that leads to really interesting data
problems where

6664
01:50:38,709 --> 01:50:38,719
problems where
 

6665
01:50:38,719 --> 01:50:40,870
problems where
you can't just drive infinitely to

6666
01:50:40,870 --> 01:50:40,880
you can't just drive infinitely to
 

6667
01:50:40,880 --> 01:50:42,390
you can't just drive infinitely to
encounter all the different permutations

6668
01:50:42,390 --> 01:50:42,400
encounter all the different permutations
 

6669
01:50:42,400 --> 01:50:43,830
encounter all the different permutations
of things you might encounter and so

6670
01:50:43,830 --> 01:50:43,840
of things you might encounter and so
 

6671
01:50:43,840 --> 01:50:45,510
of things you might encounter and so
there you get into interesting

6672
01:50:45,510 --> 01:50:45,520
there you get into interesting
 

6673
01:50:45,520 --> 01:50:47,830
there you get into interesting
tools like structured testing and data

6674
01:50:47,830 --> 01:50:47,840
tools like structured testing and data
 

6675
01:50:47,840 --> 01:50:50,390
tools like structured testing and data
collection data augmentation and so

6676
01:50:50,390 --> 01:50:50,400
collection data augmentation and so
 

6677
01:50:50,400 --> 01:50:52,390
collection data augmentation and so
forth and so there's really interesting

6678
01:50:52,390 --> 01:50:52,400
forth and so there's really interesting
 

6679
01:50:52,400 --> 01:50:55,109
forth and so there's really interesting
kind of technical challenges that

6680
01:50:55,109 --> 01:50:55,119
kind of technical challenges that
 

6681
01:50:55,119 --> 01:50:57,189
kind of technical challenges that
push some of the research um that

6682
01:50:57,189 --> 01:50:57,199
push some of the research um that
 

6683
01:50:57,199 --> 01:50:59,030
push some of the research um that
enables um these new suites of

6684
01:50:59,030 --> 01:50:59,040
enables um these new suites of
 

6685
01:50:59,040 --> 01:51:01,109
enables um these new suites of
approaches what role does simulation

6686
01:51:01,109 --> 01:51:01,119
approaches what role does simulation
 

6687
01:51:01,119 --> 01:51:02,070
approaches what role does simulation
play

6688
01:51:02,070 --> 01:51:02,080
play
 

6689
01:51:02,080 --> 01:51:04,390
play
really good question so waymo simulates

6690
01:51:04,390 --> 01:51:04,400
really good question so waymo simulates
 

6691
01:51:04,400 --> 01:51:05,990
really good question so waymo simulates
about a thousand miles for every mile it

6692
01:51:05,990 --> 01:51:06,000
about a thousand miles for every mile it
 

6693
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:09,270
about a thousand miles for every mile it
drives um so you think of in both so

6694
01:51:09,270 --> 01:51:09,280
drives um so you think of in both so
 

6695
01:51:09,280 --> 01:51:11,109
drives um so you think of in both so
across the board across the board yeah

6696
01:51:11,109 --> 01:51:11,119
across the board across the board yeah
 

6697
01:51:11,119 --> 01:51:14,070
across the board across the board yeah
uh so you think of for example well if

6698
01:51:14,070 --> 01:51:14,080
uh so you think of for example well if
 

6699
01:51:14,080 --> 01:51:15,910
uh so you think of for example well if
we've driven you know over 20 million

6700
01:51:15,910 --> 01:51:15,920
we've driven you know over 20 million
 

6701
01:51:15,920 --> 01:51:17,589
we've driven you know over 20 million
miles that's over 20 billion miles in

6702
01:51:17,589 --> 01:51:17,599
miles that's over 20 billion miles in
 

6703
01:51:17,599 --> 01:51:19,589
miles that's over 20 billion miles in
simulation now how do you use simulation

6704
01:51:19,589 --> 01:51:19,599
simulation now how do you use simulation
 

6705
01:51:19,599 --> 01:51:20,470
simulation now how do you use simulation
um

6706
01:51:20,470 --> 01:51:20,480
um
 

6707
01:51:20,480 --> 01:51:23,030
um
it's a multi-purpose so

6708
01:51:23,030 --> 01:51:23,040
it's a multi-purpose so
 

6709
01:51:23,040 --> 01:51:25,750
it's a multi-purpose so
uh you use it for basic development so

6710
01:51:25,750 --> 01:51:25,760
uh you use it for basic development so
 

6711
01:51:25,760 --> 01:51:26,950
uh you use it for basic development so
you want to do make sure you have

6712
01:51:26,950 --> 01:51:26,960
you want to do make sure you have
 

6713
01:51:26,960 --> 01:51:28,629
you want to do make sure you have
regression prevention and protection of

6714
01:51:28,629 --> 01:51:28,639
regression prevention and protection of
 

6715
01:51:28,639 --> 01:51:30,550
regression prevention and protection of
everything you're doing right um that

6716
01:51:30,550 --> 01:51:30,560
everything you're doing right um that
 

6717
01:51:30,560 --> 01:51:32,629
everything you're doing right um that
that's an easy one

6718
01:51:32,629 --> 01:51:32,639
that's an easy one
 

6719
01:51:32,639 --> 01:51:33,990
that's an easy one
when you encounter something interesting

6720
01:51:33,990 --> 01:51:34,000
when you encounter something interesting
 

6721
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:35,109
when you encounter something interesting
in the world let's say there was an

6722
01:51:35,109 --> 01:51:35,119
in the world let's say there was an
 

6723
01:51:35,119 --> 01:51:36,709
in the world let's say there was an
issue with how the vehicle behaved

6724
01:51:36,709 --> 01:51:36,719
issue with how the vehicle behaved
 

6725
01:51:36,719 --> 01:51:38,870
issue with how the vehicle behaved
versus an ideal human um you can play

6726
01:51:38,870 --> 01:51:38,880
versus an ideal human um you can play
 

6727
01:51:38,880 --> 01:51:40,629
versus an ideal human um you can play
that back in simulation and start

6728
01:51:40,629 --> 01:51:40,639
that back in simulation and start
 

6729
01:51:40,639 --> 01:51:43,109
that back in simulation and start
augmenting your system and seeing how

6730
01:51:43,109 --> 01:51:43,119
augmenting your system and seeing how
 

6731
01:51:43,119 --> 01:51:44,629
augmenting your system and seeing how
you would have reacted to that scenario

6732
01:51:44,629 --> 01:51:44,639
you would have reacted to that scenario
 

6733
01:51:44,639 --> 01:51:46,709
you would have reacted to that scenario
with this improvement or this new area

6734
01:51:46,709 --> 01:51:46,719
with this improvement or this new area
 

6735
01:51:46,719 --> 01:51:48,149
with this improvement or this new area
you can create scenarios that become

6736
01:51:48,149 --> 01:51:48,159
you can create scenarios that become
 

6737
01:51:48,159 --> 01:51:49,990
you can create scenarios that become
part of your regression set after that

6738
01:51:49,990 --> 01:51:50,000
part of your regression set after that
 

6739
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:52,070
part of your regression set after that
point right um then you start getting

6740
01:51:52,070 --> 01:51:52,080
point right um then you start getting
 

6741
01:51:52,080 --> 01:51:53,830

01:51:58,229 --> 01:51:58,239
need to improve this system i have these
 

6747
01:51:58,239 --> 01:51:59,510
need to improve this system i have these

01:52:07,109 --> 01:52:07,119
is the least efficient form of testing
 

6757
01:52:07,119 --> 01:52:09,030
is the least efficient form of testing
and it's expensive it's time consuming

are today you can do that far more

6770
01:52:23,669 --> 01:52:23,679
are today you can do that far more
 

6771
01:52:23,679 --> 01:52:24,950
are today you can do that far more
efficiently in simulation than just

01:52:28,070 --> 01:52:28,080
right
 

6777
01:52:28,080 --> 01:52:29,430
right
and then you go all the way to the

6778
01:52:29,430 --> 01:52:29,440
and then you go all the way to the
 

6779
01:52:29,440 --> 01:52:32,390
and then you go all the way to the
validation phase where to actually see

01:52:32,390 --> 01:52:32,400
validation phase where to actually see
 

6781
01:52:32,400 --> 01:52:34,950

01:52:34,950 --> 01:52:34,960
your human relative safety of like how
 

6783
01:52:34,960 --> 01:52:36,629
your human relative safety of like how
well you're performing on the car side

6784
01:52:36,629 --> 01:52:36,639
well you're performing on the car side
 

6785
01:52:36,639 --> 01:52:38,790
well you're performing on the car side
or the trucking side relative to a human

6786
01:52:38,790 --> 01:52:38,800
or the trucking side relative to a human
 

6787
01:52:38,800 --> 01:52:39,750
or the trucking side relative to a human
um

6788
01:52:39,750 --> 01:52:39,760
um
 

6789
01:52:39,760 --> 01:52:41,910
um
a lot of that safety case is actually

6790
01:52:41,910 --> 01:52:41,920
a lot of that safety case is actually
 

6791
01:52:41,920 --> 01:52:43,109
a lot of that safety case is actually
driven by

6792
01:52:43,109 --> 01:52:43,119
driven by
 

6793
01:52:43,119 --> 01:52:45,189
driven by
uh taking all of the physical

6794
01:52:45,189 --> 01:52:45,199
uh taking all of the physical
 

6795
01:52:45,199 --> 01:52:47,109
uh taking all of the physical
operational driving which probably

6796
01:52:47,109 --> 01:52:47,119
operational driving which probably
 

6797
01:52:47,119 --> 01:52:48,870
operational driving which probably
includes a lot of interventions where

6798
01:52:48,870 --> 01:52:48,880
includes a lot of interventions where
 

6799
01:52:48,880 --> 01:52:51,430
includes a lot of interventions where
like where the operate the driver took

6800
01:52:51,430 --> 01:52:51,440
like where the operate the driver took
 

6801
01:52:51,440 --> 01:52:53,990
like where the operate the driver took
over just in case um

6802
01:52:53,990 --> 01:52:54,000
over just in case um
 

6803
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,149
over just in case um
and then you simulate those forward

6804
01:52:56,149 --> 01:52:56,159
and then you simulate those forward
 

6805
01:52:56,159 --> 01:52:57,910
and then you simulate those forward
and see if would anything have happened

6806
01:52:57,910 --> 01:52:57,920
and see if would anything have happened
 

6807
01:52:57,920 --> 01:52:59,750
and see if would anything have happened
and in most cases the answer is no but

6808
01:52:59,750 --> 01:52:59,760
and in most cases the answer is no but
 

6809
01:52:59,760 --> 01:53:01,510
and in most cases the answer is no but
you you can simulate it forward and you

6810
01:53:01,510 --> 01:53:01,520
you you can simulate it forward and you
 

6811
01:53:01,520 --> 01:53:02,790
you you can simulate it forward and you
can even start to do really interesting

6812
01:53:02,790 --> 01:53:02,800
can even start to do really interesting
 

6813
01:53:02,800 --> 01:53:04,310
can even start to do really interesting
things where you

6814
01:53:04,310 --> 01:53:04,320
things where you
 

6815
01:53:04,320 --> 01:53:06,629
things where you
add virtual agents to create harder

6816
01:53:06,629 --> 01:53:06,639
add virtual agents to create harder
 

6817
01:53:06,639 --> 01:53:08,790
add virtual agents to create harder
environments you can fuzz the locations

6818
01:53:08,790 --> 01:53:08,800
environments you can fuzz the locations
 

6819
01:53:08,800 --> 01:53:10,950
environments you can fuzz the locations
of physical agents you can muck with the

6820
01:53:10,950 --> 01:53:10,960
of physical agents you can muck with the
 

6821
01:53:10,960 --> 01:53:13,270
of physical agents you can muck with the
scene and stress test the scenario from

6822
01:53:13,270 --> 01:53:13,280
scene and stress test the scenario from
 

6823
01:53:13,280 --> 01:53:14,870
scene and stress test the scenario from
a whole bunch of different dimensions

6824
01:53:14,870 --> 01:53:14,880
a whole bunch of different dimensions
 

6825
01:53:14,880 --> 01:53:16,709
a whole bunch of different dimensions
and effectively you're trying to like

6826
01:53:16,709 --> 01:53:16,719
and effectively you're trying to like
 

6827
01:53:16,719 --> 01:53:18,629
and effectively you're trying to like
more efficiently sample this like

6828
01:53:18,629 --> 01:53:18,639
more efficiently sample this like
 

6829
01:53:18,639 --> 01:53:20,790
more efficiently sample this like
infinite dimensional space but try to

6830
01:53:20,790 --> 01:53:20,800
infinite dimensional space but try to
 

6831
01:53:20,800 --> 01:53:22,390
infinite dimensional space but try to
encounter the problems as fast as

6832
01:53:22,390 --> 01:53:22,400
encounter the problems as fast as
 

6833
01:53:22,400 --> 01:53:24,310
encounter the problems as fast as
possible because what most people don't

6834
01:53:24,310 --> 01:53:24,320
possible because what most people don't
 

6835
01:53:24,320 --> 01:53:26,470
possible because what most people don't
realize is the hardest problem in

6836
01:53:26,470 --> 01:53:26,480
realize is the hardest problem in
 

6837
01:53:26,480 --> 01:53:28,310
realize is the hardest problem in
autonomous driving is actually the

6838
01:53:28,310 --> 01:53:28,320
autonomous driving is actually the
 

6839
01:53:28,320 --> 01:53:30,149
autonomous driving is actually the
evaluation problem in many ways not the

6840
01:53:30,149 --> 01:53:30,159
evaluation problem in many ways not the
 

6841
01:53:30,159 --> 01:53:32,709
evaluation problem in many ways not the
actual autonomy problem and so if you

6842
01:53:32,709 --> 01:53:32,719
actual autonomy problem and so if you
 

6843
01:53:32,719 --> 01:53:34,390
actual autonomy problem and so if you
could in theory evaluate perfectly and

6844
01:53:34,390 --> 01:53:34,400

to being able to go driverless
 

6887
01:54:14,239 --> 01:54:16,629
to being able to go driverless
can be deceptively long even when that

6891
01:54:18,239 --> 01:54:19,990

and the difference is is that
 

6893
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:21,189
and the difference is is that
the thing that keeps you from going

the thing that keeps you from going
 

6895
01:54:21,199 --> 01:54:22,870
the thing that keeps you from going
driverless is not the stuff you

6896
01:54:22,870 --> 01:54:22,880
driverless is not the stuff you
 

6897
01:54:22,880 --> 01:54:24,229
driverless is not the stuff you
encounter on a demo it's the stuff that

6898
01:54:24,229 --> 01:54:24,239
encounter on a demo it's the stuff that
 

6899
01:54:24,239 --> 01:54:25,669
encounter on a demo it's the stuff that
you encounter once in a hundred thousand

6900
01:54:25,669 --> 01:54:25,679
you encounter once in a hundred thousand
 

6901
01:54:25,679 --> 01:54:28,709

6903
01:54:28,719 --> 01:54:31,030

that is at the root of what it what is

01:55:53,840 --> 01:55:54,870
if i brought you a truck how would you
test it

6988

01:55:54,880 --> 01:55:58,070
test it
okay alan turing came along and you said

6990
01:55:58,070 --> 01:55:58,080
okay alan turing came along and you said
 

6991
01:55:58,080 --> 01:55:59,589
okay alan turing came along and you said
this one's can't tell if it's a human

6992
01:55:59,589 --> 01:55:59,599
this one's can't tell if it's a human
 

6993
01:55:59,599 --> 01:56:01,270
this one's can't tell if it's a human
driver or yeah exactly

6994
01:56:01,270 --> 01:56:01,280
driver or yeah exactly
 

6995
01:56:01,280 --> 01:56:02,790
driver or yeah exactly
yeah but

6996
01:56:02,790 --> 01:56:02,800
yeah but
 

6997
01:56:02,800 --> 01:56:04,310
yeah but
not the human because

6998
01:56:04,310 --> 01:56:04,320
not the human because
 

6999
01:56:04,320 --> 01:56:06,149
not the human because
because you know humans are flawed but

7000
01:56:06,149 --> 01:56:06,159
because you know humans are flawed but
 

7001
01:56:06,159 --> 01:56:07,510
because you know humans are flawed but
yeah how do you actually know you're

7002
01:56:07,510 --> 01:56:07,520
yeah how do you actually know you're
 

7003
01:56:07,520 --> 01:56:08,950
yeah how do you actually know you're
ready basically how do you know it's

7004
01:56:08,950 --> 01:56:08,960
ready basically how do you know it's
 

7005
01:56:08,960 --> 01:56:10,629
ready basically how do you know it's
good enough um

7006
01:56:10,629 --> 01:56:10,639
good enough um
 

7007
01:56:10,639 --> 01:56:12,070
good enough um
yeah and by the way this is the reason

7008
01:56:12,070 --> 01:56:12,080
yeah and by the way this is the reason
 

7009
01:56:12,080 --> 01:56:13,350
yeah and by the way this is the reason
why like um

7010
01:56:13,350 --> 01:56:13,360
why like um
 

7011
01:56:13,360 --> 01:56:14,709
why like um
weymouth released the safety framework

7012
01:56:14,709 --> 01:56:14,719
weymouth released the safety framework
 

7013
01:56:14,719 --> 01:56:16,550
weymouth released the safety framework
for the car side because like

7014
01:56:16,550 --> 01:56:16,560
for the car side because like
 

7015
01:56:16,560 --> 01:56:18,629
for the car side because like
one it sets the bar so nobody cuts below

7016
01:56:18,629 --> 01:56:18,639
one it sets the bar so nobody cuts below
 

7017
01:56:18,639 --> 01:56:20,149
one it sets the bar so nobody cuts below
it um and does something bad for the

7018
01:56:20,149 --> 01:56:20,159
it um and does something bad for the
 

7019
01:56:20,159 --> 01:56:22,229
it um and does something bad for the
field that and that causes an accident

7020
01:56:22,229 --> 01:56:22,239
field that and that causes an accident
 

7021
01:56:22,239 --> 01:56:24,709
field that and that causes an accident
two it's to start the conversation on

01:56:35,589 --> 01:56:35,599
portfolio of approaches there's easy
 

7035
01:56:35,599 --> 01:56:37,669
portfolio of approaches there's easy
things like are you compliant with all

7036
01:56:37,669 --> 01:56:37,679
things like are you compliant with all
 

7037
01:56:37,679 --> 01:56:39,430
things like are you compliant with all
these like fundamental rules of the road

7038
01:56:39,430 --> 01:56:39,440
these like fundamental rules of the road
 

7039
01:56:39,440 --> 01:56:40,709
these like fundamental rules of the road
like you never drive above the speed

7040
01:56:40,709 --> 01:56:40,719
like you never drive above the speed
 

7041
01:56:40,719 --> 01:56:42,470
like you never drive above the speed
limit that's actually pretty easy like

7042
01:56:42,470 --> 01:56:42,480
limit that's actually pretty easy like
 

7043
01:56:42,480 --> 01:56:43,910
limit that's actually pretty easy like
you can fundamentally prove that it's

7044
01:56:43,910 --> 01:56:43,920
you can fundamentally prove that it's
 

7045
01:56:43,920 --> 01:56:45,669
you can fundamentally prove that it's
either impossible to violate that rule

7046
01:56:45,669 --> 01:56:45,679
either impossible to violate that rule
 

7047
01:56:45,679 --> 01:56:49,350
either impossible to violate that rule
or that in these like you can um

7048
01:56:49,350 --> 01:56:49,360
or that in these like you can um
 

7049
01:56:49,360 --> 01:56:50,870
or that in these like you can um
itemize the scenarios where that comes

7050
01:56:50,870 --> 01:56:50,880
itemize the scenarios where that comes
 

7051
01:56:50,880 --> 01:56:53,030
itemize the scenarios where that comes
up and you can do a test and show that

7052
01:56:53,030 --> 01:56:53,040
up and you can do a test and show that
 

7053
01:56:53,040 --> 01:56:55,109
up and you can do a test and show that
you you know you pass that test and

7054
01:56:55,109 --> 01:56:55,119
you you know you pass that test and
 

7055
01:56:55,119 --> 01:56:57,830
you you know you pass that test and
therefore you can handle that scenario

7056
01:56:57,830 --> 01:56:57,840
therefore you can handle that scenario
 

7057
01:56:57,840 --> 01:57:00,390
therefore you can handle that scenario
and so those are like traditional

7058
01:57:00,390 --> 01:57:00,400
and so those are like traditional
 

7059
01:57:00,400 --> 01:57:01,990
and so those are like traditional

pass the turing test pretty quickly even
 

7105
01:57:41,679 --> 01:57:43,189
pass the turing test pretty quickly even
if you're not like completely ready for

01:57:45,440 --> 01:57:46,310
driverless because the events that are

01:57:46,320 --> 01:57:48,550
really
kind of like hard will not happen that

7112
01:57:48,550 --> 01:57:48,560
kind of like hard will not happen that
 

7113
01:57:48,560 --> 01:57:50,950
kind of like hard will not happen that
often just to give you a perspective

7114
01:57:50,950 --> 01:57:50,960
often just to give you a perspective
 

7115
01:57:50,960 --> 01:57:53,510
often just to give you a perspective
uh a human has a serious accident on a

7116
01:57:53,510 --> 01:57:53,520
uh a human has a serious accident on a
 

7117
01:57:53,520 --> 01:57:55,350
uh a human has a serious accident on a
freeway uh like a truck driver on a

7118
01:57:55,350 --> 01:57:55,360
freeway uh like a truck driver on a
 

7119
01:57:55,360 --> 01:57:57,669
freeway uh like a truck driver on a
freeway has uh there's a serious event

7120
01:57:57,669 --> 01:57:57,679
freeway has uh there's a serious event
 

7121
01:57:57,679 --> 01:58:00,790
freeway has uh there's a serious event
happens once every 1.3 million miles and

7122
01:58:00,790 --> 01:58:00,800
happens once every 1.3 million miles and
 

7123
01:58:00,800 --> 01:58:01,910
happens once every 1.3 million miles and
something that actually has like a

7124
01:58:01,910 --> 01:58:01,920
something that actually has like a
 

7125
01:58:01,920 --> 01:58:03,430
something that actually has like a
really serious injury is 28 million

7126
01:58:03,430 --> 01:58:03,440
really serious injury is 28 million
 

7127
01:58:03,440 --> 01:58:05,270
really serious injury is 28 million
miles and so those are really rare and

7128
01:58:05,270 --> 01:58:05,280
miles and so those are really rare and
 

7129
01:58:05,280 --> 01:58:06,790
miles and so those are really rare and
so you could have a driver that looks

7130
01:58:06,790 --> 01:58:06,800
so you could have a driver that looks
 

7131
01:58:06,800 --> 01:58:09,189
so you could have a driver that looks
like it's ready to go but you have no

7132
01:58:09,189 --> 01:58:09,199
like it's ready to go but you have no
 

7133
01:58:09,199 --> 01:58:11,270
like it's ready to go but you have no
signal on on what happens there and so

7134
01:58:11,270 --> 01:58:11,280
signal on on what happens there and so
 

7135
01:58:11,280 --> 01:58:13,030
signal on on what happens there and so
that's where you start to get creative

7136
01:58:13,030 --> 01:58:13,040
that's where you start to get creative
 

7137
01:58:13,040 --> 01:58:15,270
that's where you start to get creative
on combinations of

7138
01:58:15,270 --> 01:58:15,280
on combinations of
 

7139
01:58:15,280 --> 01:58:17,910
on combinations of
sampling and statistical arguments

7140
01:58:17,910 --> 01:58:17,920
sampling and statistical arguments
 

7141
01:58:17,920 --> 01:58:19,830
sampling and statistical arguments
focused structured arguments where you

7142
01:58:19,830 --> 01:58:19,840
focused structured arguments where you
 

7143
01:58:19,840 --> 01:58:21,510
focused structured arguments where you
can kind of

7144
01:58:21,510 --> 01:58:21,520
can kind of
 

7145
01:58:21,520 --> 01:58:23,589
can kind of
simulate those scenarios and show that

7146
01:58:23,589 --> 01:58:23,599
simulate those scenarios and show that
 

7147
01:58:23,599 --> 01:58:25,830
simulate those scenarios and show that
you can handle them and

7148
01:58:25,830 --> 01:58:25,840
you can handle them and
 

7149
01:58:25,840 --> 01:58:27,510
you can handle them and
metrics that are correlated with what

7150
01:58:27,510 --> 01:58:27,520
metrics that are correlated with what
 

7151
01:58:27,520 --> 01:58:29,189
metrics that are correlated with what
you care about but you can measure much

7152
01:58:29,189 --> 01:58:29,199
you care about but you can measure much
 

7153
01:58:29,199 --> 01:58:31,910
you care about but you can measure much
more quickly and get to a right answer

7154
01:58:31,910 --> 01:58:31,920
more quickly and get to a right answer
 

7155
01:58:31,920 --> 01:58:33,669
more quickly and get to a right answer
and that's what makes it pretty hard and

7156
01:58:33,669 --> 01:58:33,679
and that's what makes it pretty hard and
 

7157
01:58:33,679 --> 01:58:35,750
and that's what makes it pretty hard and
in the end um you end up borrowing a lot

7158
01:58:35,750 --> 01:58:35,760
in the end um you end up borrowing a lot
 

7159
01:58:35,760 --> 01:58:37,750
in the end um you end up borrowing a lot
of properties um from

7160
01:58:37,750 --> 01:58:37,760
of properties um from
 

7161
01:58:37,760 --> 01:58:40,310
of properties um from
uh aerospace and like space shuttles and

7162
01:58:40,310 --> 01:58:40,320
uh aerospace and like space shuttles and
 

7163
01:58:40,320 --> 01:58:41,990
uh aerospace and like space shuttles and
so forth where you don't get the chance

7164
01:58:41,990 --> 01:58:42,000
so forth where you don't get the chance
 

7165
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:43,669
so forth where you don't get the chance
to launch it a million times just to say

7166
01:58:43,669 --> 01:58:43,679
to launch it a million times just to say
 

7167
01:58:43,679 --> 01:58:45,350
to launch it a million times just to say
you're ready because it's too expensive

7168
01:58:45,350 --> 01:58:45,360
you're ready because it's too expensive
 

7169
01:58:45,360 --> 01:58:49,109
you're ready because it's too expensive
to fail um and so you go through

7170
01:58:49,109 --> 01:58:49,119
to fail um and so you go through
 

7171
01:58:49,119 --> 01:58:50,870
to fail um and so you go through
a huge amount of kind of structured

7172
01:58:50,870 --> 01:58:50,880
a huge amount of kind of structured
 

7173
01:58:50,880 --> 01:58:53,270
a huge amount of kind of structured
approaches in order to validate it and

7174
01:58:53,270 --> 01:58:53,280
approaches in order to validate it and
 

7175
01:58:53,280 --> 01:58:54,550
approaches in order to validate it and
then by

7176
01:58:54,550 --> 01:58:54,560
then by
 

7177
01:58:54,560 --> 01:58:56,149
then by
by thoroughness you can make a strong

7178
01:58:56,149 --> 01:58:56,159
by thoroughness you can make a strong
 

7179
01:58:56,159 --> 01:58:58,149
by thoroughness you can make a strong
argument that you're ready to go

7180
01:58:58,149 --> 01:58:58,159
argument that you're ready to go
 

7181
01:58:58,159 --> 01:58:59,589
argument that you're ready to go
this is actually a harder problem in a

7182
01:58:59,589 --> 01:58:59,599
this is actually a harder problem in a
 

7183
01:58:59,599 --> 01:59:00,870
this is actually a harder problem in a
lot of ways though because you can think

7184
01:59:00,870 --> 01:59:00,880
lot of ways though because you can think
 

7185
01:59:00,880 --> 01:59:02,629
lot of ways though because you can think
of a space shuttle as um

7186
01:59:02,629 --> 01:59:02,639
of a space shuttle as um
 

7187
01:59:02,639 --> 01:59:03,910
of a space shuttle as um
getting to a fixed point and then you

7188
01:59:03,910 --> 01:59:03,920
getting to a fixed point and then you
 

7189
01:59:03,920 --> 01:59:05,589
getting to a fixed point and then you
kind of like or an airplane and you like

7190
01:59:05,589 --> 01:59:05,599
kind of like or an airplane and you like
 

7191
01:59:05,599 --> 01:59:07,030
kind of like or an airplane and you like
freeze the software and then you like

7192
01:59:07,030 --> 01:59:07,040
freeze the software and then you like
 

7193
01:59:07,040 --> 01:59:08,950
freeze the software and then you like
prove it and you're good to go here you

7194
01:59:08,950 --> 01:59:08,960
prove it and you're good to go here you
 

7195
01:59:08,960 --> 01:59:10,950
prove it and you're good to go here you
have to get to a driver's quality bar

7196
01:59:10,950 --> 01:59:10,960
have to get to a driver's quality bar
 

7197
01:59:10,960 --> 01:59:13,030
have to get to a driver's quality bar
but then continue to aggressively change

7198
01:59:13,030 --> 01:59:13,040
but then continue to aggressively change
 

7199
01:59:13,040 --> 01:59:14,629
but then continue to aggressively change
the software even while you're

7200
01:59:14,629 --> 01:59:14,639
the software even while you're
 

7201
01:59:14,639 --> 01:59:16,870
the software even while you're
driverless and so and also the full

7202
01:59:16,870 --> 01:59:16,880
driverless and so and also the full
 

7203
01:59:16,880 --> 01:59:18,870
driverless and so and also the full
range of environment that you there's

7204
01:59:18,870 --> 01:59:18,880
range of environment that you there's
 

7205
01:59:18,880 --> 01:59:20,229
range of environment that you there's
there's an external environment where

7206
01:59:20,229 --> 01:59:20,239
there's an external environment where
 

7207
01:59:20,239 --> 01:59:21,990
there's an external environment where
the shuttle is you're basically testing

7208
01:59:21,990 --> 01:59:22,000
the shuttle is you're basically testing
 

7209
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:22,950
the shuttle is you're basically testing
the

7210
01:59:22,950 --> 01:59:22,960
the
 

7211
01:59:22,960 --> 01:59:25,830
the
like the systems the internal stuff yeah

7212
01:59:25,830 --> 01:59:25,840
like the systems the internal stuff yeah
 

7213
01:59:25,840 --> 01:59:27,750
like the systems the internal stuff yeah
uh and you have a lot of control on the

7214
01:59:27,750 --> 01:59:27,760
uh and you have a lot of control on the
 

7215
01:59:27,760 --> 01:59:29,910
uh and you have a lot of control on the
external stuff yeah and the hard part is

7216
01:59:29,910 --> 01:59:29,920
external stuff yeah and the hard part is
 

7217
01:59:29,920 --> 01:59:31,669
external stuff yeah and the hard part is
how do you know you didn't get worse in

7218
01:59:31,669 --> 01:59:31,679
how do you know you didn't get worse in
 

7219
01:59:31,679 --> 01:59:33,589
how do you know you didn't get worse in
something that you just changed yes

7220
01:59:33,589 --> 01:59:33,599
something that you just changed yes
 

7221
01:59:33,599 --> 01:59:36,470
something that you just changed yes
and so uh so in a lot of ways like

7222
01:59:36,470 --> 01:59:36,480
and so uh so in a lot of ways like
 

7223
01:59:36,480 --> 01:59:38,229
and so uh so in a lot of ways like
the turing test starts to fail pretty

7224
01:59:38,229 --> 01:59:38,239
the turing test starts to fail pretty
 

7225
01:59:38,239 --> 01:59:39,669
the turing test starts to fail pretty
quickly because you start to feel

7226
01:59:39,669 --> 01:59:39,679
quickly because you start to feel
 

7227
01:59:39,679 --> 01:59:41,830
quickly because you start to feel
driverless quality pretty early in that

7228
01:59:41,830 --> 01:59:41,840
driverless quality pretty early in that
 

7229
01:59:41,840 --> 01:59:43,109
driverless quality pretty early in that
curve

7230
01:59:43,109 --> 01:59:43,119
curve
 

7231
01:59:43,119 --> 01:59:45,270
curve
if you think about it right like in most

7232
01:59:45,270 --> 01:59:45,280
if you think about it right like in most
 

7233
01:59:45,280 --> 01:59:46,390
if you think about it right like in most
um

7234
01:59:46,390 --> 01:59:46,400
um
 

7235
01:59:46,400 --> 01:59:48,709
um
most uh kind of you know really good av

7236
01:59:48,709 --> 01:59:48,719
most uh kind of you know really good av
 

7237
01:59:48,719 --> 01:59:49,990
most uh kind of you know really good av
demos maybe you'll sit there for 30

7238
01:59:49,990 --> 01:59:50,000
demos maybe you'll sit there for 30
 

7239
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,390
demos maybe you'll sit there for 30
minutes right yeah so you've driven you

7240
01:59:52,390 --> 01:59:52,400
minutes right yeah so you've driven you
 

7241
01:59:52,400 --> 01:59:55,830
minutes right yeah so you've driven you
know 15 miles or something like that um

7242
01:59:55,830 --> 01:59:55,840
know 15 miles or something like that um
 

7243
01:59:55,840 --> 01:59:58,310
know 15 miles or something like that um
to go driverless uh like what's the sort

7244
01:59:58,310 --> 01:59:58,320
to go driverless uh like what's the sort
 

7245
01:59:58,320 --> 01:59:59,990
to go driverless uh like what's the sort
of rate of issues that you need to have

7246
01:59:59,990 --> 02:00:00,000
of rate of issues that you need to have
 

7247
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:01,750
of rate of issues that you need to have
you won't even encounter so let's try

7248
02:00:01,750 --> 02:00:01,760
you won't even encounter so let's try
 

7249
02:00:01,760 --> 02:00:04,229
you won't even encounter so let's try
something different then let's try

7250
02:00:04,229 --> 02:00:04,239
something different then let's try
 

7251
02:00:04,239 --> 02:00:05,589
something different then let's try
a different version of the touring test

7252
02:00:05,589 --> 02:00:05,599
a different version of the touring test
 

7253
02:00:05,599 --> 02:00:07,830
a different version of the touring test
which is like an iq test

7254
02:00:07,830 --> 02:00:07,840
which is like an iq test
 

7255
02:00:07,840 --> 02:00:09,109
which is like an iq test
so there's these

7256
02:00:09,109 --> 02:00:09,119
so there's these
 

7257
02:00:09,119 --> 02:00:10,870
so there's these
difficult questions of increasing

7258
02:00:10,870 --> 02:00:10,880
difficult questions of increasing
 

7259
02:00:10,880 --> 02:00:13,350
difficult questions of increasing
difficulty they're very they're they're

7260
02:00:13,350 --> 02:00:13,360
difficulty they're very they're they're
 

7261
02:00:13,360 --> 02:00:15,189
difficulty they're very they're they're
designed you don't know them ahead of

7262
02:00:15,189 --> 02:00:15,199
designed you don't know them ahead of
 

7263
02:00:15,199 --> 02:00:15,990
designed you don't know them ahead of
time

7264
02:00:15,990 --> 02:00:16,000
time
 

7265
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:18,470
time
nobody knows the answer to them right

7266
02:00:18,470 --> 02:00:18,480
nobody knows the answer to them right
 

7267
02:00:18,480 --> 02:00:21,430
nobody knows the answer to them right
and so is it possible to in the future

7268
02:00:21,430 --> 02:00:21,440
and so is it possible to in the future
 

7269
02:00:21,440 --> 02:00:23,270
and so is it possible to in the future
orchestrate yeah basically really

7270
02:00:23,270 --> 02:00:23,280
orchestrate yeah basically really
 

7271
02:00:23,280 --> 02:00:27,030
orchestrate yeah basically really
obstacle course almost of like yeah that

7272
02:00:27,030 --> 02:00:27,040
obstacle course almost of like yeah that
 

7273
02:00:27,040 --> 02:00:28,950
obstacle course almost of like yeah that
maybe change every year

7274
02:00:28,950 --> 02:00:28,960
maybe change every year
 

7275
02:00:28,960 --> 02:00:31,510
maybe change every year
and that represent if you can pass these

7276
02:00:31,510 --> 02:00:31,520
and that represent if you can pass these
 

7277
02:00:31,520 --> 02:00:33,109
and that represent if you can pass these
it they don't necessarily represent the

7278
02:00:33,109 --> 02:00:33,119
it they don't necessarily represent the
 

7279
02:00:33,119 --> 02:00:35,030
it they don't necessarily represent the
full spectrum that's it yeah they won't

7280
02:00:35,030 --> 02:00:35,040
full spectrum that's it yeah they won't
 

7281
02:00:35,040 --> 02:00:36,629
full spectrum that's it yeah they won't
be conclusive but you can at least get a

7282
02:00:36,629 --> 02:00:36,639
be conclusive but you can at least get a
 

7283
02:00:36,639 --> 02:00:38,390
be conclusive but you can at least get a
really quick read and filter yeah like

7284
02:00:38,390 --> 02:00:38,400
really quick read and filter yeah like
 

7285
02:00:38,400 --> 02:00:39,990
really quick read and filter yeah like
you're able to yeah because you didn't

7286
02:00:39,990 --> 02:00:40,000
you're able to yeah because you didn't
 

7287
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:41,750
you're able to yeah because you didn't
know them ahead of time like i don't

7288
02:00:41,750 --> 02:00:41,760
know them ahead of time like i don't
 

7289
02:00:41,760 --> 02:00:42,629
know them ahead of time like i don't
know

02:00:42,629 --> 02:00:42,639
know
 

7291
02:00:42,639 --> 02:00:43,830
know
probably

7292
02:00:43,830 --> 02:00:43,840
probably
 

7293
02:00:43,840 --> 02:00:46,550
probably
like construction zones uh failures or

02:00:46,550 --> 02:00:46,560
like construction zones uh failures or
 

7295
02:00:46,560 --> 02:00:48,390
like construction zones uh failures or

02:01:15,910 --> 02:01:15,920
extreme uh
 

7323
02:01:15,920 --> 02:01:17,669
extreme uh
conditions where like you have a nasty

7324
02:01:17,669 --> 02:01:17,679
conditions where like you have a nasty
 

7325
02:01:17,679 --> 02:01:19,189
conditions where like you have a nasty
construction zone where everything shuts

7326
02:01:19,189 --> 02:01:19,199
construction zone where everything shuts
 

7327
02:01:19,199 --> 02:01:21,350
construction zone where everything shuts
down and you have to like you know get

7328
02:01:21,350 --> 02:01:21,360
down and you have to like you know get
 

7329
02:01:21,360 --> 02:01:22,629
down and you have to like you know get
pulled to the other side of the freeway

7330
02:01:22,629 --> 02:01:22,639
pulled to the other side of the freeway
 

7331
02:01:22,639 --> 02:01:24,790
pulled to the other side of the freeway
with a temporary lane like that right

7332
02:01:24,790 --> 02:01:24,800
with a temporary lane like that right
 

7333
02:01:24,800 --> 02:01:27,030
with a temporary lane like that right
those are sort of conditions where we do

7334
02:01:27,030 --> 02:01:27,040
those are sort of conditions where we do
 

7335
02:01:27,040 --> 02:01:28,629
those are sort of conditions where we do
that to ourselves right we itemize

7336
02:01:28,629 --> 02:01:28,639
that to ourselves right we itemize
 

7337
02:01:28,639 --> 02:01:30,310
that to ourselves right we itemize
everything that could possibly happen to

7338
02:01:30,310 --> 02:01:30,320
everything that could possibly happen to
 

7339
02:01:30,320 --> 02:01:31,669
everything that could possibly happen to
give you a starting point to how to

7340
02:01:31,669 --> 02:01:31,679
give you a starting point to how to
 

7341
02:01:31,679 --> 02:01:32,870
give you a starting point to how to
think about

7342
02:01:32,870 --> 02:01:32,880
think about
 

7343
02:01:32,880 --> 02:01:34,070
think about
what you need to develop and at the end

7344
02:01:34,070 --> 02:01:34,080
what you need to develop and at the end
 

7345
02:01:34,080 --> 02:01:35,350
what you need to develop and at the end
of the day there's no substitute for

7346
02:01:35,350 --> 02:01:35,360
of the day there's no substitute for
 

7347
02:01:35,360 --> 02:01:37,030
of the day there's no substitute for
real miles like if you think of

7348
02:01:37,030 --> 02:01:37,040
real miles like if you think of
 

7349
02:01:37,040 --> 02:01:38,550
real miles like if you think of
traditional ml like you know how there's

7350
02:01:38,550 --> 02:01:38,560
traditional ml like you know how there's
 

7351
02:01:38,560 --> 02:01:39,990
traditional ml like you know how there's
like a validation set where you hold out

7352
02:01:39,990 --> 02:01:40,000
like a validation set where you hold out
 

7353
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:42,870
like a validation set where you hold out
some data and uh like real-world driving

7354
02:01:42,870 --> 02:01:42,880
some data and uh like real-world driving
 

7355
02:01:42,880 --> 02:01:44,390
some data and uh like real-world driving
is the ultimate validation set that's

7356
02:01:44,390 --> 02:01:44,400
is the ultimate validation set that's
 

7357
02:01:44,400 --> 02:01:47,350
is the ultimate validation set that's
the in the end like the cleanest signal

7358
02:01:47,350 --> 02:01:47,360
the in the end like the cleanest signal
 

7359
02:01:47,360 --> 02:01:48,790
the in the end like the cleanest signal
but you can do a really good job on

7360
02:01:48,790 --> 02:01:48,800
but you can do a really good job on
 

7361
02:01:48,800 --> 02:01:49,990
but you can do a really good job on
creating an obstacle course and you're

7362
02:01:49,990 --> 02:01:50,000
creating an obstacle course and you're
 

7363
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:51,990
creating an obstacle course and you're
absolutely right like at the end um

7364
02:01:51,990 --> 02:01:52,000
absolutely right like at the end um
 

7365
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:54,149
absolutely right like at the end um
if there was such a thing as automating

7366
02:01:54,149 --> 02:01:54,159
if there was such a thing as automating
 

7367
02:01:54,159 --> 02:01:56,390
if there was such a thing as automating
uh and kind of a readiness

7368
02:01:56,390 --> 02:01:56,400
uh and kind of a readiness
 

7369
02:01:56,400 --> 02:01:59,030
uh and kind of a readiness
um it would be these extreme conditions

7370
02:01:59,030 --> 02:01:59,040
um it would be these extreme conditions
 

7371
02:01:59,040 --> 02:02:01,750
um it would be these extreme conditions
like a red light runner right a um

7372
02:02:01,750 --> 02:02:01,760
like a red light runner right a um
 

7373
02:02:01,760 --> 02:02:03,109
like a red light runner right a um
really reckless pedestrian that's

7374
02:02:03,109 --> 02:02:03,119
really reckless pedestrian that's
 

7375
02:02:03,119 --> 02:02:05,830
really reckless pedestrian that's
jaywalking a cyclist that you know makes

7376
02:02:05,830 --> 02:02:05,840
jaywalking a cyclist that you know makes
 

7377
02:02:05,840 --> 02:02:07,589
jaywalking a cyclist that you know makes
like a really awkward maneuver that's

7378
02:02:07,589 --> 02:02:07,599
like a really awkward maneuver that's
 

7379
02:02:07,599 --> 02:02:08,629
like a really awkward maneuver that's
actually what keeps you from going

7380
02:02:08,629 --> 02:02:08,639
actually what keeps you from going
 

7381
02:02:08,639 --> 02:02:09,990
actually what keeps you from going
driverless like in the end that is the

7382
02:02:09,990 --> 02:02:10,000
driverless like in the end that is the
 

7383
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:11,270
driverless like in the end that is the
long tail

7384
02:02:11,270 --> 02:02:11,280
long tail
 

7385
02:02:11,280 --> 02:02:12,870
long tail
yeah and it's interesting to think about

7386
02:02:12,870 --> 02:02:12,880
yeah and it's interesting to think about
 

7387
02:02:12,880 --> 02:02:14,470
yeah and it's interesting to think about
the that to me is the touring test

7388
02:02:14,470 --> 02:02:14,480
the that to me is the touring test
 

7389
02:02:14,480 --> 02:02:15,990
the that to me is the touring test
stereotest means a lot of things but to

7390
02:02:15,990 --> 02:02:16,000
stereotest means a lot of things but to
 

7391
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:18,629
stereotest means a lot of things but to
me in driving the touring test

7392
02:02:18,629 --> 02:02:18,639
me in driving the touring test
 

7393
02:02:18,639 --> 02:02:22,229
me in driving the touring test
is exactly this validation set that is

7394
02:02:22,229 --> 02:02:22,239
is exactly this validation set that is
 

7395
02:02:22,239 --> 02:02:23,830
is exactly this validation set that is
handcrafted there's a i don't know if

7396
02:02:23,830 --> 02:02:23,840
handcrafted there's a i don't know if
 

7397
02:02:23,840 --> 02:02:24,790
handcrafted there's a i don't know if
you know

7398
02:02:24,790 --> 02:02:24,800
you know
 

7399
02:02:24,800 --> 02:02:29,109
you know
him there's a guy named francoise he um

7400
02:02:29,109 --> 02:02:29,119
him there's a guy named francoise he um
 

7401
02:02:29,119 --> 02:02:30,950
him there's a guy named francoise he um
he decides he thinks about like how

7402
02:02:30,950 --> 02:02:30,960
he decides he thinks about like how
 

7403
02:02:30,960 --> 02:02:32,229
he decides he thinks about like how
designed to test for general

7404
02:02:32,229 --> 02:02:32,239
designed to test for general
 

7405
02:02:32,239 --> 02:02:33,990
designed to test for general
intelligence he designs these iq tests

7406
02:02:33,990 --> 02:02:34,000
intelligence he designs these iq tests
 

7407
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:35,109
intelligence he designs these iq tests
for machines

7408
02:02:35,109 --> 02:02:35,119
for machines
 

7409
02:02:35,119 --> 02:02:37,750
for machines
and the validation set for him is

7410
02:02:37,750 --> 02:02:37,760
and the validation set for him is
 

7411
02:02:37,760 --> 02:02:40,390
and the validation set for him is
handcrafted yeah and that it requires

7412
02:02:40,390 --> 02:02:40,400
handcrafted yeah and that it requires
 

7413
02:02:40,400 --> 02:02:43,910
handcrafted yeah and that it requires
like human genius or ingenuity to create

7414
02:02:43,910 --> 02:02:43,920
like human genius or ingenuity to create
 

7415
02:02:43,920 --> 02:02:46,310
like human genius or ingenuity to create
a really good test yeah and you hold you

7416
02:02:46,310 --> 02:02:46,320
a really good test yeah and you hold you
 

7417
02:02:46,320 --> 02:02:47,830
a really good test yeah and you hold you
truly hold it up it's an interesting

7418
02:02:47,830 --> 02:02:47,840
truly hold it up it's an interesting
 

7419
02:02:47,840 --> 02:02:50,550
truly hold it up it's an interesting
perspective on the validation set which

7420
02:02:50,550 --> 02:02:50,560
perspective on the validation set which
 

7421
02:02:50,560 --> 02:02:51,830
perspective on the validation set which
is like

7422
02:02:51,830 --> 02:02:51,840
is like
 

7423
02:02:51,840 --> 02:02:54,790
is like
make that as hard as possible right not

7424
02:02:54,790 --> 02:02:54,800
make that as hard as possible right not
 

7425
02:02:54,800 --> 02:02:57,669
make that as hard as possible right not
a generic representation of the data but

7426
02:02:57,669 --> 02:02:57,679
a generic representation of the data but
 

7427
02:02:57,679 --> 02:03:00,149
a generic representation of the data but
this is the hardest the hardest stuff

7428
02:03:00,149 --> 02:03:00,159
this is the hardest the hardest stuff
 

7429
02:03:00,159 --> 02:03:01,669
this is the hardest the hardest stuff
yeah you know it's like go like you'll

7430
02:03:01,669 --> 02:03:01,679
yeah you know it's like go like you'll
 

7431
02:03:01,679 --> 02:03:03,510
yeah you know it's like go like you'll
never fully itemize like all the world

7432
02:03:03,510 --> 02:03:03,520
never fully itemize like all the world
 

7433
02:03:03,520 --> 02:03:05,510
never fully itemize like all the world
states that you'll you'll expand and so

7434
02:03:05,510 --> 02:03:05,520
states that you'll you'll expand and so
 

7435
02:03:05,520 --> 02:03:06,550
states that you'll you'll expand and so
you have to come up with different

7436
02:03:06,550 --> 02:03:06,560
you have to come up with different
 

7437
02:03:06,560 --> 02:03:07,910
you have to come up with different
approaches and this is where you start

7438
02:03:07,910 --> 02:03:07,920
approaches and this is where you start
 

7439
02:03:07,920 --> 02:03:10,310
approaches and this is where you start
hitting the struggles of ml where ml is

7440
02:03:10,310 --> 02:03:10,320
hitting the struggles of ml where ml is
 

7441
02:03:10,320 --> 02:03:12,870
hitting the struggles of ml where ml is
fantastic at optimizing the average case

7442
02:03:12,870 --> 02:03:12,880
fantastic at optimizing the average case
 

7443
02:03:12,880 --> 02:03:14,950
fantastic at optimizing the average case
it's a really unique craft to think

7444
02:03:14,950 --> 02:03:14,960
it's a really unique craft to think
 

7445
02:03:14,960 --> 02:03:16,629
it's a really unique craft to think
about how you deal with the worst case

7446
02:03:16,629 --> 02:03:16,639
about how you deal with the worst case
 

7447
02:03:16,639 --> 02:03:18,550
about how you deal with the worst case
which is what we care about in in av

7448
02:03:18,550 --> 02:03:18,560
which is what we care about in in av
 

7449
02:03:18,560 --> 02:03:21,350
which is what we care about in in av
space um when using an ml system on

7450
02:03:21,350 --> 02:03:21,360
space um when using an ml system on
 

7451
02:03:21,360 --> 02:03:22,870
space um when using an ml system on
something that that occurs like super

7452
02:03:22,870 --> 02:03:22,880
something that that occurs like super
 

7453
02:03:22,880 --> 02:03:24,149
something that that occurs like super
infrequently

7454
02:03:24,149 --> 02:03:24,159
infrequently
 

7455
02:03:24,159 --> 02:03:25,430
infrequently
so like you don't care about the worst

7456
02:03:25,430 --> 02:03:25,440
so like you don't care about the worst
 

7457
02:03:25,440 --> 02:03:27,830
so like you don't care about the worst
case really on ads because if you miss a

7458
02:03:27,830 --> 02:03:27,840
case really on ads because if you miss a
 

7459
02:03:27,840 --> 02:03:29,830
case really on ads because if you miss a
few it's not a big deal but you do care

7460
02:03:29,830 --> 02:03:29,840
few it's not a big deal but you do care
 

7461
02:03:29,840 --> 02:03:32,310
few it's not a big deal but you do care
about it on the driving side and so um

7462
02:03:32,310 --> 02:03:32,320
about it on the driving side and so um
 

7463
02:03:32,320 --> 02:03:34,629
about it on the driving side and so um
and so typically like you'll never fully

7464
02:03:34,629 --> 02:03:34,639
and so typically like you'll never fully
 

7465
02:03:34,639 --> 02:03:36,629
and so typically like you'll never fully
enumerate the world and so you have to

7466
02:03:36,629 --> 02:03:36,639
enumerate the world and so you have to
 

7467
02:03:36,639 --> 02:03:38,390
enumerate the world and so you have to
take a step back and abstract away what

7468
02:03:38,390 --> 02:03:38,400
take a step back and abstract away what
 

7469
02:03:38,400 --> 02:03:40,470
take a step back and abstract away what
are the signals that you care about and

7470
02:03:40,470 --> 02:03:40,480
are the signals that you care about and
 

7471
02:03:40,480 --> 02:03:42,470
are the signals that you care about and
the properties of a driver

7472
02:03:42,470 --> 02:03:42,480
the properties of a driver
 

7473
02:03:42,480 --> 02:03:46,790
the properties of a driver
that correlate to defensive driving and

7474
02:03:46,790 --> 02:03:46,800
that correlate to defensive driving and
 

7475
02:03:46,800 --> 02:03:50,629
that correlate to defensive driving and
avoiding nasty situations that um

7476
02:03:50,629 --> 02:03:50,639
avoiding nasty situations that um
 

7477
02:03:50,639 --> 02:03:51,910
avoiding nasty situations that um
even though you'll always be surprised

7478
02:03:51,910 --> 02:03:51,920
even though you'll always be surprised
 

7479
02:03:51,920 --> 02:03:53,990
even though you'll always be surprised
by things you'll encounter you feel good

7480
02:03:53,990 --> 02:03:54,000
by things you'll encounter you feel good
 

7481
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:56,069
by things you'll encounter you feel good
about your ability to generalize from

7482
02:03:56,069 --> 02:03:56,079
about your ability to generalize from
 

7483
02:03:56,079 --> 02:03:58,069
about your ability to generalize from
what you've learned

7484
02:03:58,069 --> 02:03:58,079
what you've learned
 

7485
02:03:58,079 --> 02:03:59,750
what you've learned
all right let me ask you a tricky

7486
02:03:59,750 --> 02:03:59,760
all right let me ask you a tricky
 

7487
02:03:59,760 --> 02:04:01,270
all right let me ask you a tricky
question

7488
02:04:01,270 --> 02:04:01,280
question
 

7489
02:04:01,280 --> 02:04:03,350
question
so to me

7490
02:04:03,350 --> 02:04:03,360
so to me
 

7491
02:04:03,360 --> 02:04:05,030
so to me
the two companies

7492
02:04:05,030 --> 02:04:05,040
the two companies
 

7493
02:04:05,040 --> 02:04:06,069
the two companies
that

7494
02:04:06,069 --> 02:04:06,079
that
 

7495
02:04:06,079 --> 02:04:08,790
that
are building at scale some of the most

7496
02:04:08,790 --> 02:04:08,800
are building at scale some of the most
 

7497
02:04:08,800 --> 02:04:11,430
are building at scale some of the most
incredible robots ever built

7498
02:04:11,430 --> 02:04:11,440
incredible robots ever built
 

7499
02:04:11,440 --> 02:04:15,430
incredible robots ever built
is waymo and tesla

7500
02:04:15,430 --> 02:04:15,440

 

7501
02:04:15,440 --> 02:04:16,310

so

7502
02:04:16,310 --> 02:04:16,320
so
 

7503
02:04:16,320 --> 02:04:19,109
so
there's very distinct approaches

7504
02:04:19,109 --> 02:04:19,119
there's very distinct approaches
 

7505
02:04:19,119 --> 02:04:21,990
there's very distinct approaches
technically philosophically in these two

7506
02:04:21,990 --> 02:04:22,000
technically philosophically in these two
 

7507
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:23,430
technically philosophically in these two
systems

7508
02:04:23,430 --> 02:04:23,440
systems
 

7509
02:04:23,440 --> 02:04:26,069
systems
let me ask you to play sort of devil's

7510
02:04:26,069 --> 02:04:26,079
let me ask you to play sort of devil's
 

7511
02:04:26,079 --> 02:04:27,430
let me ask you to play sort of devil's
advocate

7512
02:04:27,430 --> 02:04:27,440
advocate
 

7513
02:04:27,440 --> 02:04:29,350
advocate
and then the devil's advocate to the

7514
02:04:29,350 --> 02:04:29,360
and then the devil's advocate to the
 

7515
02:04:29,360 --> 02:04:31,510
and then the devil's advocate to the
devil's advocate

7516
02:04:31,510 --> 02:04:31,520
devil's advocate
 

7517
02:04:31,520 --> 02:04:33,350
devil's advocate
it's it's a bit of a race of course

7518
02:04:33,350 --> 02:04:33,360
it's it's a bit of a race of course
 

7519
02:04:33,360 --> 02:04:35,990
it's it's a bit of a race of course
everyone can win

7520
02:04:35,990 --> 02:04:36,000
everyone can win
 

7521
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:37,109
everyone can win
but

7522
02:04:37,109 --> 02:04:37,119
but
 

7523
02:04:37,119 --> 02:04:40,950
but
if waymo wins this race to level four

7524
02:04:40,950 --> 02:04:40,960
if waymo wins this race to level four
 

7525
02:04:40,960 --> 02:04:42,310
if waymo wins this race to level four
uh which

7526
02:04:42,310 --> 02:04:42,320
uh which
 

7527
02:04:42,320 --> 02:04:44,550
uh which
why would they win what aspect of the

7528
02:04:44,550 --> 02:04:44,560
why would they win what aspect of the
 

7529
02:04:44,560 --> 02:04:45,910
why would they win what aspect of the
approach do you think would be the

7530
02:04:45,910 --> 02:04:45,920
approach do you think would be the
 

7531
02:04:45,920 --> 02:04:49,910
approach do you think would be the
winning aspect and if tesla wins

7532
02:04:49,910 --> 02:04:49,920
winning aspect and if tesla wins
 

7533
02:04:49,920 --> 02:04:53,669
winning aspect and if tesla wins
why would they win and uh which aspect

7534
02:04:53,669 --> 02:04:53,679
why would they win and uh which aspect
 

7535
02:04:53,679 --> 02:04:55,669
why would they win and uh which aspect
of their approach would be the reason

7536
02:04:55,669 --> 02:04:55,679
of their approach would be the reason
 

7537
02:04:55,679 --> 02:04:57,750
of their approach would be the reason
just just building some intuition almost

7538
02:04:57,750 --> 02:04:57,760
just just building some intuition almost
 

7539
02:04:57,760 --> 02:04:59,750
just just building some intuition almost
not from a business perspective from any

7540
02:04:59,750 --> 02:04:59,760
not from a business perspective from any
 

7541
02:04:59,760 --> 02:05:01,430
not from a business perspective from any
of that just technically

7542
02:05:01,430 --> 02:05:01,440
of that just technically
 

7543
02:05:01,440 --> 02:05:03,589
of that just technically
yeah yeah and we could summarize

7544
02:05:03,589 --> 02:05:03,599
yeah yeah and we could summarize
 

7545
02:05:03,599 --> 02:05:05,830
yeah yeah and we could summarize
i think maybe you can correct me what

7546
02:05:05,830 --> 02:05:05,840
i think maybe you can correct me what
 

7547
02:05:05,840 --> 02:05:07,270
i think maybe you can correct me what
one of the more

7548
02:05:07,270 --> 02:05:07,280
one of the more
 

7549
02:05:07,280 --> 02:05:08,709
one of the more
distinct

7550
02:05:08,709 --> 02:05:08,719
distinct
 

7551
02:05:08,719 --> 02:05:10,229
distinct
aspects is

7552
02:05:10,229 --> 02:05:10,239
aspects is
 

7553
02:05:10,239 --> 02:05:13,830
aspects is
uh waymo has a richer suite of sensors

7554
02:05:13,830 --> 02:05:13,840
uh waymo has a richer suite of sensors
 

7555
02:05:13,840 --> 02:05:15,750
uh waymo has a richer suite of sensors
as lidar and vision

7556
02:05:15,750 --> 02:05:15,760
as lidar and vision
 

7557
02:05:15,760 --> 02:05:18,870
as lidar and vision
tesla now removed radar they do vision

7558
02:05:18,870 --> 02:05:18,880
tesla now removed radar they do vision
 

7559
02:05:18,880 --> 02:05:22,629
tesla now removed radar they do vision
only tesla has a larger fleet of

7560
02:05:22,629 --> 02:05:22,639
only tesla has a larger fleet of
 

7561
02:05:22,639 --> 02:05:24,550
only tesla has a larger fleet of
vehicles operated by humans so it's

7562
02:05:24,550 --> 02:05:24,560
vehicles operated by humans so it's
 

7563
02:05:24,560 --> 02:05:28,390
vehicles operated by humans so it's
already deployed on the field in its uh

7564
02:05:28,390 --> 02:05:28,400
already deployed on the field in its uh
 

7565
02:05:28,400 --> 02:05:30,870
already deployed on the field in its uh
larger what do you call it operational

7566
02:05:30,870 --> 02:05:30,880
larger what do you call it operational
 

7567
02:05:30,880 --> 02:05:32,229
larger what do you call it operational
domain

7568
02:05:32,229 --> 02:05:32,239
domain
 

7569
02:05:32,239 --> 02:05:34,950
domain
and then waymo is more focused on a

7570
02:05:34,950 --> 02:05:34,960
and then waymo is more focused on a
 

7571
02:05:34,960 --> 02:05:37,189
and then waymo is more focused on a
specific domain and growing it

7572
02:05:37,189 --> 02:05:37,199
specific domain and growing it
 

7573
02:05:37,199 --> 02:05:39,669
specific domain and growing it
with fewer vehicles so that's the both

7574
02:05:39,669 --> 02:05:39,679
with fewer vehicles so that's the both
 

7575
02:05:39,679 --> 02:05:41,510
with fewer vehicles so that's the both
are fascinating approaches both are i

7576
02:05:41,510 --> 02:05:41,520
are fascinating approaches both are i
 

7577
02:05:41,520 --> 02:05:43,430
are fascinating approaches both are i
think there's a lot of brilliant ideas

7578
02:05:43,430 --> 02:05:43,440
think there's a lot of brilliant ideas
 

7579
02:05:43,440 --> 02:05:45,910
think there's a lot of brilliant ideas
nobody knows the answer so i'd love to

7580
02:05:45,910 --> 02:05:45,920
nobody knows the answer so i'd love to
 

7581
02:05:45,920 --> 02:05:47,990
nobody knows the answer so i'd love to
get your comments on this lay of the

7582
02:05:47,990 --> 02:05:48,000
get your comments on this lay of the
 

7583
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:50,310
get your comments on this lay of the
land yeah for sure so maybe i'll um i'll

7584
02:05:50,310 --> 02:05:50,320
land yeah for sure so maybe i'll um i'll
 

7585
02:05:50,320 --> 02:05:51,750
land yeah for sure so maybe i'll um i'll
start with waymo

7586
02:05:51,750 --> 02:05:51,760
start with waymo
 

7587
02:05:51,760 --> 02:05:53,270
start with waymo
and you're right like both incredible

7588
02:05:53,270 --> 02:05:53,280
and you're right like both incredible
 

7589
02:05:53,280 --> 02:05:55,350
and you're right like both incredible
companies and just a gigantic respect to

7590
02:05:55,350 --> 02:05:55,360
companies and just a gigantic respect to
 

7591
02:05:55,360 --> 02:05:57,270
companies and just a gigantic respect to
like everything tesla's accomplished and

7592
02:05:57,270 --> 02:05:57,280
like everything tesla's accomplished and
 

7593
02:05:57,280 --> 02:05:59,270
like everything tesla's accomplished and
uh how they push the field forward as

7594
02:05:59,270 --> 02:05:59,280
uh how they push the field forward as
 

7595
02:05:59,280 --> 02:06:01,350
uh how they push the field forward as
well so on the weymouth side there is a

7596
02:06:01,350 --> 02:06:01,360
well so on the weymouth side there is a
 

7597
02:06:01,360 --> 02:06:04,790
well so on the weymouth side there is a
fundamental advantage in the fact that

7598
02:06:04,790 --> 02:06:04,800
fundamental advantage in the fact that
 

7599
02:06:04,800 --> 02:06:07,430
fundamental advantage in the fact that
it is focused and geared towards l4 from

7600
02:06:07,430 --> 02:06:07,440
it is focused and geared towards l4 from
 

7601
02:06:07,440 --> 02:06:09,350
it is focused and geared towards l4 from
the very beginning we've customized the

7602
02:06:09,350 --> 02:06:09,360
the very beginning we've customized the
 

7603
02:06:09,360 --> 02:06:11,350
the very beginning we've customized the
sensor suite for it the hardware the

7604
02:06:11,350 --> 02:06:11,360
sensor suite for it the hardware the
 

7605
02:06:11,360 --> 02:06:14,069
sensor suite for it the hardware the
compute the infrastructure the tech

7606
02:06:14,069 --> 02:06:14,079
compute the infrastructure the tech
 

7607
02:06:14,079 --> 02:06:15,669
compute the infrastructure the tech
stack and all of the investment inside

7608
02:06:15,669 --> 02:06:15,679
stack and all of the investment inside
 

7609
02:06:15,679 --> 02:06:17,430
stack and all of the investment inside
the company um

7610
02:06:17,430 --> 02:06:17,440
the company um
 

7611
02:06:17,440 --> 02:06:19,270
the company um
that's deceptively important because

7612
02:06:19,270 --> 02:06:19,280
that's deceptively important because
 

7613
02:06:19,280 --> 02:06:20,870
that's deceptively important because
there's like a giant spectrum of

7614
02:06:20,870 --> 02:06:20,880
there's like a giant spectrum of
 

7615
02:06:20,880 --> 02:06:22,149
there's like a giant spectrum of
problems you have to solve in order to

7616
02:06:22,149 --> 02:06:22,159
problems you have to solve in order to
 

7617
02:06:22,159 --> 02:06:23,750
problems you have to solve in order to
like really do this from

7618
02:06:23,750 --> 02:06:23,760
like really do this from
 

7619
02:06:23,760 --> 02:06:26,149
like really do this from
infrastructure to hardware to autonomy

7620
02:06:26,149 --> 02:06:26,159
infrastructure to hardware to autonomy
 

7621
02:06:26,159 --> 02:06:28,870
infrastructure to hardware to autonomy
stack to the safety framework and that's

7622
02:06:28,870 --> 02:06:28,880
stack to the safety framework and that's
 

7623
02:06:28,880 --> 02:06:30,310
stack to the safety framework and that's
an advantage because there's a reason

7624
02:06:30,310 --> 02:06:30,320
an advantage because there's a reason
 

7625
02:06:30,320 --> 02:06:32,149
an advantage because there's a reason
why it's the fifth generation hardware

7626
02:06:32,149 --> 02:06:32,159
why it's the fifth generation hardware
 

7627
02:06:32,159 --> 02:06:33,109
why it's the fifth generation hardware
and

7628
02:06:33,109 --> 02:06:33,119
and
 

7629
02:06:33,119 --> 02:06:34,709
and
why all of those learnings went into the

7630
02:06:34,709 --> 02:06:34,719
why all of those learnings went into the
 

7631
02:06:34,719 --> 02:06:37,589
why all of those learnings went into the
dymor program um it becomes such an

7632
02:06:37,589 --> 02:06:37,599
dymor program um it becomes such an
 

7633
02:06:37,599 --> 02:06:39,830
dymor program um it becomes such an
advantage because you learn a lot as you

7634
02:06:39,830 --> 02:06:39,840
advantage because you learn a lot as you
 

7635
02:06:39,840 --> 02:06:42,229
advantage because you learn a lot as you
drive and you optimize for the best

7636
02:06:42,229 --> 02:06:42,239
drive and you optimize for the best
 

7637
02:06:42,239 --> 02:06:44,310
drive and you optimize for the best
information you have but fundamentally

7638
02:06:44,310 --> 02:06:44,320
information you have but fundamentally
 

7639
02:06:44,320 --> 02:06:47,669
information you have but fundamentally
like there's a big big jump um uh

7640
02:06:47,669 --> 02:06:47,679
like there's a big big jump um uh
 

7641
02:06:47,679 --> 02:06:49,270
like there's a big big jump um uh
like every order of magnitude that you

7642
02:06:49,270 --> 02:06:49,280
like every order of magnitude that you
 

7643
02:06:49,280 --> 02:06:50,950
like every order of magnitude that you
drive uh in numbers of miles and what

7644
02:06:50,950 --> 02:06:50,960
drive uh in numbers of miles and what
 

7645
02:06:50,960 --> 02:06:54,390
drive uh in numbers of miles and what
you earn and the gap from really kind of

7646
02:06:54,390 --> 02:06:54,400
you earn and the gap from really kind of
 

7647
02:06:54,400 --> 02:06:56,149
you earn and the gap from really kind of
like decent progress or l2 and so forth

7648
02:06:56,149 --> 02:06:56,159
like decent progress or l2 and so forth
 

7649
02:06:56,159 --> 02:06:57,750
like decent progress or l2 and so forth
to what it takes to actually go all for

7650
02:06:57,750 --> 02:06:57,760
to what it takes to actually go all for
 

7651
02:06:57,760 --> 02:06:59,990
to what it takes to actually go all for
and at the end of the day um

7652
02:06:59,990 --> 02:07:00,000
and at the end of the day um
 

7653
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:02,470
and at the end of the day um
there's a feeling that waymo has

7654
02:07:02,470 --> 02:07:02,480
there's a feeling that waymo has
 

7655
02:07:02,480 --> 02:07:05,030
there's a feeling that waymo has
uh there's a long way to go uh nobody's

7656
02:07:05,030 --> 02:07:05,040
uh there's a long way to go uh nobody's
 

7657
02:07:05,040 --> 02:07:07,430
uh there's a long way to go uh nobody's
won um but

7658
02:07:07,430 --> 02:07:07,440
won um but
 

7659
02:07:07,440 --> 02:07:10,390
won um but
there's a lot of advantages um in all of

7660
02:07:10,390 --> 02:07:10,400
there's a lot of advantages um in all of
 

7661
02:07:10,400 --> 02:07:12,470
there's a lot of advantages um in all of

you could see the steps
 

7683
02:07:30,400 --> 02:07:33,109

7691
02:07:38,560 --> 02:07:40,229

getting into like huge kind of scaling
 

7719
02:08:07,599 --> 02:08:09,669
getting into like huge kind of scaling
pains and so those learnings you just

7720
02:08:09,669 --> 02:08:09,679
pains and so those learnings you just
 

7721
02:08:09,679 --> 02:08:10,950
pains and so those learnings you just
can't shortcut and so that's an

7722
02:08:10,950 --> 02:08:10,960
can't shortcut and so that's an
 

7723
02:08:10,960 --> 02:08:13,189
can't shortcut and so that's an
advantage and so uh there's a lot of

7724
02:08:13,189 --> 02:08:13,199
advantage and so uh there's a lot of
 

7725
02:08:13,199 --> 02:08:14,470
advantage and so uh there's a lot of
open challenges to kind of get through

7726
02:08:14,470 --> 02:08:14,480
open challenges to kind of get through

02:08:14,480 --> 02:08:16,390
open challenges to kind of get through
technical organizational like how do you

7728

solve problems that are increasingly
 

7731
02:08:18,079 --> 02:08:19,589
solve problems that are increasingly
broad and complex like this work on

7732
02:08:19,589 --> 02:08:19,599
broad and complex like this work on
 

7733
02:08:19,599 --> 02:08:21,030
broad and complex like this work on
multiple products but

7734
02:08:21,030 --> 02:08:21,040
multiple products but

02:08:23,589 --> 02:08:23,599
in our court
 

7739
02:08:23,599 --> 02:08:25,589
in our court
there's a head start there now we got to

02:08:25,589 --> 02:08:25,599
there's a head start there now we got to
 

7741
02:08:25,599 --> 02:08:27,030
there's a head start there now we got to
go and solve it and i think that focus

7742
02:08:27,030 --> 02:08:27,040
go and solve it and i think that focus
 

7743
02:08:27,040 --> 02:08:28,470
go and solve it and i think that focus
on l4 it's a fundamentally different

7744
02:08:28,470 --> 02:08:28,480
on l4 it's a fundamentally different
 

7745
02:08:28,480 --> 02:08:30,629
on l4 it's a fundamentally different
problem if you think about it like um

7746
02:08:30,629 --> 02:08:30,639
problem if you think about it like um
 

7747
02:08:30,639 --> 02:08:32,629
problem if you think about it like um
let's say we were designing an l2 truck

02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:45,910
already have today just packaged up in a
good product but

good product but
 

7763
02:08:45,920 --> 02:08:48,390
good product but
you would take a huge risk in having a

you would take a huge risk in having a
 

7765
02:08:48,400 --> 02:08:51,270
you would take a huge risk in having a
gap from even like compute and sensors

jump from that system to an l4 system so

7770
02:08:54,870 --> 02:08:54,880
jump from that system to an l4 system so
 

7771
02:08:54,880 --> 02:08:57,109
jump from that system to an l4 system so
it's a huge risk basically so i can let

7772
02:08:57,109 --> 02:08:57,119
it's a huge risk basically so i can let
 

7773
02:08:57,119 --> 02:08:59,189
it's a huge risk basically so i can let
me allow me to be the person that plays

02:08:59,189 --> 02:08:59,199
me allow me to be the person that plays
 

7775
02:08:59,199 --> 02:09:01,270
me allow me to be the person that plays
the devil's advocate and let's argue for

7776
02:09:01,270 --> 02:09:01,280
the devil's advocate and let's argue for
 

7777
02:09:01,280 --> 02:09:03,270
the devil's advocate and let's argue for
the tesla approach so

7778
02:09:03,270 --> 02:09:03,280
the tesla approach so
 

7779
02:09:03,280 --> 02:09:05,189
the tesla approach so
that the what you just laid out makes

7780
02:09:05,189 --> 02:09:05,199
that the what you just laid out makes
 

7781
02:09:05,199 --> 02:09:07,589
that the what you just laid out makes
perfect sense and is exactly right there

perfect sense and is exactly right there
 

7783
02:09:07,599 --> 02:09:10,709
perfect sense and is exactly right there
are some open questions here which is

it's possible
that

that
 

7789

the sensor suite doesn't matter
 

7799
02:09:24,719 --> 02:09:28,149
the sensor suite doesn't matter
yeah as much and machine learning can do

7800
02:09:28,149 --> 02:09:28,159
yeah as much and machine learning can do
 

7801
02:09:28,159 --> 02:09:29,669
yeah as much and machine learning can do
a lot of the work this is the open

7802
02:09:29,669 --> 02:09:29,679
a lot of the work this is the open
 

7803
02:09:29,679 --> 02:09:30,870
a lot of the work this is the open
question is

7804
02:09:30,870 --> 02:09:30,880
question is
 

7805
02:09:30,880 --> 02:09:32,870
question is
how much is is the thing you mentioned

7806
02:09:32,870 --> 02:09:32,880
how much is is the thing you mentioned
 

7807
02:09:32,880 --> 02:09:35,990
how much is is the thing you mentioned
before how much of driving can be end to

7808
02:09:35,990 --> 02:09:36,000
before how much of driving can be end to
 

7809
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:37,430
before how much of driving can be end to
and learned

7810
02:09:37,430 --> 02:09:37,440
and learned
 

7811
02:09:37,440 --> 02:09:40,069
and learned
that's the open question obviously

7812
02:09:40,069 --> 02:09:40,079
that's the open question obviously
 

7813
02:09:40,079 --> 02:09:42,709
that's the open question obviously
the waymo and the vision only machine

7814
02:09:42,709 --> 02:09:42,719
the waymo and the vision only machine
 

7815
02:09:42,719 --> 02:09:44,390
the waymo and the vision only machine
learning approach

7816
02:09:44,390 --> 02:09:44,400
learning approach
 

7817
02:09:44,400 --> 02:09:45,270
learning approach
will

7818
02:09:45,270 --> 02:09:45,280
will
 

7819
02:09:45,280 --> 02:09:47,910
will
solve driving eventually both yeah the

7820
02:09:47,910 --> 02:09:47,920
solve driving eventually both yeah the
 

7821
02:09:47,920 --> 02:09:50,069
solve driving eventually both yeah the
question is of timeline what's faster

7822
02:09:50,069 --> 02:09:50,079
question is of timeline what's faster
 

7823
02:09:50,079 --> 02:09:51,430
question is of timeline what's faster
that's right and what you mentioned like

7824
02:09:51,430 --> 02:09:51,440
that's right and what you mentioned like
 

7825
02:09:51,440 --> 02:09:52,950
that's right and what you mentioned like
if i were to make the opposite argument

7826
02:09:52,950 --> 02:09:52,960
if i were to make the opposite argument
 

7827
02:09:52,960 --> 02:09:55,430
if i were to make the opposite argument
like what what puts tesla uh in the

7828
02:09:55,430 --> 02:09:55,440
like what what puts tesla uh in the
 

7829
02:09:55,440 --> 02:09:57,350
like what what puts tesla uh in the
strongest position it's data that is

7830
02:09:57,350 --> 02:09:57,360
strongest position it's data that is
 

7831
02:09:57,360 --> 02:09:59,589
strongest position it's data that is
their like superpower where they have an

7832
02:09:59,589 --> 02:09:59,599
their like superpower where they have an
 

7833
02:09:59,599 --> 02:10:02,069
their like superpower where they have an
access to real-world

7834
02:10:02,069 --> 02:10:02,079
access to real-world
 

7835
02:10:02,079 --> 02:10:03,990
access to real-world
data effectively with like

7836
02:10:03,990 --> 02:10:04,000
data effectively with like
 

7837
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:06,790
data effectively with like
a safety driver uh and uh you know like

7838
02:10:06,790 --> 02:10:06,800
a safety driver uh and uh you know like
 

7839
02:10:06,800 --> 02:10:09,030
a safety driver uh and uh you know like
they've they found a way to like um get

7840
02:10:09,030 --> 02:10:09,040
they've they found a way to like um get
 

7841
02:10:09,040 --> 02:10:10,550
they've they found a way to like um get
paid by safety drivers versus paper

7842
02:10:10,550 --> 02:10:10,560
paid by safety drivers versus paper
 

7843
02:10:10,560 --> 02:10:11,910
paid by safety drivers versus paper
safety drivers

7844
02:10:11,910 --> 02:10:11,920
safety drivers
 

7845
02:10:11,920 --> 02:10:14,870
safety drivers
it's uh it's brilliant right yeah but

7846
02:10:14,870 --> 02:10:14,880
it's uh it's brilliant right yeah but
 

7847
02:10:14,880 --> 02:10:17,270
it's uh it's brilliant right yeah but
you know all joking aside like um one it

7848
02:10:17,270 --> 02:10:17,280
you know all joking aside like um one it
 

7849
02:10:17,280 --> 02:10:18,390
you know all joking aside like um one it
is incredible that they've built a

7850
02:10:18,390 --> 02:10:18,400
is incredible that they've built a
 

7851
02:10:18,400 --> 02:10:20,149
is incredible that they've built a
business that's incredibly successful

7852
02:10:20,149 --> 02:10:20,159
business that's incredibly successful
 

7853
02:10:20,159 --> 02:10:21,350
business that's incredibly successful
they can now be a foundation and

7854
02:10:21,350 --> 02:10:21,360
they can now be a foundation and
 

7855
02:10:21,360 --> 02:10:23,189
they can now be a foundation and
bootstrap kind of like really aggressive

7856
02:10:23,189 --> 02:10:23,199
bootstrap kind of like really aggressive
 

7857
02:10:23,199 --> 02:10:25,589
bootstrap kind of like really aggressive
investment in autonomy space uh if you

7858
02:10:25,589 --> 02:10:25,599
investment in autonomy space uh if you
 

7859
02:10:25,599 --> 02:10:26,790
investment in autonomy space uh if you
can do it that's always like an

7860
02:10:26,790 --> 02:10:26,800
can do it that's always like an
 

7861
02:10:26,800 --> 02:10:28,550
can do it that's always like an
incredible kind of advantage and then

7862
02:10:28,550 --> 02:10:28,560
incredible kind of advantage and then
 

7863
02:10:28,560 --> 02:10:31,189
incredible kind of advantage and then
the data aspect of it um it is a giant

7864
02:10:31,189 --> 02:10:31,199
the data aspect of it um it is a giant
 

7865
02:10:31,199 --> 02:10:32,470
the data aspect of it um it is a giant
amount of data if you can use it the

7866
02:10:32,470 --> 02:10:32,480
amount of data if you can use it the
 

7867
02:10:32,480 --> 02:10:34,310
amount of data if you can use it the
right way to then solve the problem but

7868
02:10:34,310 --> 02:10:34,320
right way to then solve the problem but
 

7869
02:10:34,320 --> 02:10:36,390
right way to then solve the problem but
the ability to collect um

7870
02:10:36,390 --> 02:10:36,400
the ability to collect um
 

7871
02:10:36,400 --> 02:10:37,990
the ability to collect um
and filter through the things that to

7872
02:10:37,990 --> 02:10:38,000
and filter through the things that to
 

7873
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:39,750
and filter through the things that to
the things that matter at real-world

7874
02:10:39,750 --> 02:10:39,760
the things that matter at real-world
 

7875
02:10:39,760 --> 02:10:42,390
the things that matter at real-world
scale like a large distribution that is

7876
02:10:42,390 --> 02:10:42,400
scale like a large distribution that is
 

7877
02:10:42,400 --> 02:10:44,790
scale like a large distribution that is
a that is huge like it's a big advantage

7878
02:10:44,790 --> 02:10:44,800
a that is huge like it's a big advantage
 

7879
02:10:44,800 --> 02:10:47,109
a that is huge like it's a big advantage
um and so then the question becomes can

7880
02:10:47,109 --> 02:10:47,119
um and so then the question becomes can
 

7881
02:10:47,119 --> 02:10:48,709
um and so then the question becomes can
you use it in our right way and do you

7882
02:10:48,709 --> 02:10:48,719
you use it in our right way and do you
 

7883
02:10:48,719 --> 02:10:50,709
you use it in our right way and do you
have the right software systems and

7884
02:10:50,709 --> 02:10:50,719
have the right software systems and
 

7885
02:10:50,719 --> 02:10:52,229
have the right software systems and
hardware systems in order to solve the

7886
02:10:52,229 --> 02:10:52,239
hardware systems in order to solve the
 

7887
02:10:52,239 --> 02:10:53,830
hardware systems in order to solve the
problem and

7888
02:10:53,830 --> 02:10:53,840
problem and
 

7889
02:10:53,840 --> 02:10:55,830
problem and
you're right that in the long term

7890
02:10:55,830 --> 02:10:55,840
you're right that in the long term
 

7891
02:10:55,840 --> 02:10:57,910
you're right that in the long term
there's no reason to believe that pure

7892
02:10:57,910 --> 02:10:57,920
there's no reason to believe that pure
 

7893
02:10:57,920 --> 02:10:59,910
there's no reason to believe that pure
camera systems can't solve the problem

7894
02:10:59,910 --> 02:10:59,920
camera systems can't solve the problem
 

7895
02:10:59,920 --> 02:11:01,510
camera systems can't solve the problem
that humans obviously are solving with

7896
02:11:01,510 --> 02:11:01,520
that humans obviously are solving with
 

7897
02:11:01,520 --> 02:11:03,270
that humans obviously are solving with
you know with vision systems

7898
02:11:03,270 --> 02:11:03,280
you know with vision systems
 

7899
02:11:03,280 --> 02:11:04,069
you know with vision systems
but

7900
02:11:04,069 --> 02:11:04,079
but
 

7901
02:11:04,079 --> 02:11:06,149
but
the question is when it's a risk it's a

7902
02:11:06,149 --> 02:11:06,159
the question is when it's a risk it's a
 

7903
02:11:06,159 --> 02:11:08,149
the question is when it's a risk it's a
big so there's no argument that it's not

7904
02:11:08,149 --> 02:11:08,159
big so there's no argument that it's not
 

7905
02:11:08,159 --> 02:11:10,870
big so there's no argument that it's not
a risk right like and it's already such

7906
02:11:10,870 --> 02:11:10,880
a risk right like and it's already such
 

7907
02:11:10,880 --> 02:11:12,790
a risk right like and it's already such
a hard problem and so much of that

7908
02:11:12,790 --> 02:11:12,800
a hard problem and so much of that
 

7909
02:11:12,800 --> 02:11:14,709
a hard problem and so much of that
problem by the way is um

7910
02:11:14,709 --> 02:11:14,719
problem by the way is um
 

7911
02:11:14,719 --> 02:11:16,709
problem by the way is um
uh you know even beyond the perception

7912
02:11:16,709 --> 02:11:16,719
uh you know even beyond the perception
 

7913
02:11:16,719 --> 02:11:17,990
uh you know even beyond the perception
side some of the hardest elements of the

7914
02:11:17,990 --> 02:11:18,000
side some of the hardest elements of the
 

7915
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:19,910
side some of the hardest elements of the
problem on behavioral side and decision

7916
02:11:19,910 --> 02:11:19,920
problem on behavioral side and decision
 

7917
02:11:19,920 --> 02:11:22,629
problem on behavioral side and decision
making and the long tail safety case

7918
02:11:22,629 --> 02:11:22,639
making and the long tail safety case
 

7919
02:11:22,639 --> 02:11:25,510
making and the long tail safety case
if you are adding risk and complexity

7920
02:11:25,510 --> 02:11:25,520
if you are adding risk and complexity
 

7921
02:11:25,520 --> 02:11:27,750
if you are adding risk and complexity
on the input side from perception you're

7922
02:11:27,750 --> 02:11:27,760
on the input side from perception you're
 

7923
02:11:27,760 --> 02:11:29,830
on the input side from perception you're
now making a really really hard problem

7924
02:11:29,830 --> 02:11:29,840
now making a really really hard problem
 

7925
02:11:29,840 --> 02:11:30,629
now making a really really hard problem
like

7926
02:11:30,629 --> 02:11:30,639
like
 

7927
02:11:30,639 --> 02:11:32,790
like
which is on its own is still like almost

7928
02:11:32,790 --> 02:11:32,800
which is on its own is still like almost
 

7929
02:11:32,800 --> 02:11:34,870
which is on its own is still like almost
insurmountably hard even harder and so

7930
02:11:34,870 --> 02:11:34,880
insurmountably hard even harder and so
 

7931
02:11:34,880 --> 02:11:36,950
insurmountably hard even harder and so
the question is just how much and this

7932
02:11:36,950 --> 02:11:36,960
the question is just how much and this
 

7933
02:11:36,960 --> 02:11:38,629
the question is just how much and this
is where like you can

7934
02:11:38,629 --> 02:11:38,639
is where like you can
 

7935
02:11:38,639 --> 02:11:40,870
is where like you can
easily get into a little bit of a

7936
02:11:40,870 --> 02:11:40,880
easily get into a little bit of a
 

7937
02:11:40,880 --> 02:11:43,350
easily get into a little bit of a
kind of a trap where similar to how you

7938
02:11:43,350 --> 02:11:43,360
kind of a trap where similar to how you
 

7939
02:11:43,360 --> 02:11:44,870
kind of a trap where similar to how you
how do you evaluate how good an av

7940
02:11:44,870 --> 02:11:44,880
how do you evaluate how good an av
 

7941
02:11:44,880 --> 02:11:47,030
how do you evaluate how good an av
company's product is like you go and you

7942
02:11:47,030 --> 02:11:47,040
company's product is like you go and you
 

7943
02:11:47,040 --> 02:11:47,910
company's product is like you go and you
do a

7944
02:11:47,910 --> 02:11:47,920
do a
 

7945
02:11:47,920 --> 02:11:49,589
do a
trial kind of a test run with them a

7946
02:11:49,589 --> 02:11:49,599
trial kind of a test run with them a
 

7947
02:11:49,599 --> 02:11:51,510
trial kind of a test run with them a
demo run which they've kind of optimized

7948
02:11:51,510 --> 02:11:51,520
demo run which they've kind of optimized
 

7949
02:11:51,520 --> 02:11:52,950
demo run which they've kind of optimized
like crazy and so forth and like and it

7950
02:11:52,950 --> 02:11:52,960
like crazy and so forth and like and it
 

7951
02:11:52,960 --> 02:11:54,709
like crazy and so forth and like and it
feels good do you do you put any weight

7952
02:11:54,709 --> 02:11:54,719
feels good do you do you put any weight
 

7953
02:11:54,719 --> 02:11:56,709
feels good do you do you put any weight
in that right you know that that gap is

7954
02:11:56,709 --> 02:11:56,719
in that right you know that that gap is
 

7955
02:11:56,719 --> 02:11:58,790
in that right you know that that gap is
kind of like you know pretty large still

7956
02:11:58,790 --> 02:11:58,800
kind of like you know pretty large still
 

7957
02:11:58,800 --> 02:12:01,189
kind of like you know pretty large still
um same thing on the like perception

7958
02:12:01,189 --> 02:12:01,199
um same thing on the like perception
 

7959
02:12:01,199 --> 02:12:03,030
um same thing on the like perception
case like the long tail of computer

7960
02:12:03,030 --> 02:12:03,040
case like the long tail of computer
 

7961
02:12:03,040 --> 02:12:05,510
case like the long tail of computer
vision is really really hard and there's

7962
02:12:05,510 --> 02:12:05,520
vision is really really hard and there's
 

7963
02:12:05,520 --> 02:12:08,069
vision is really really hard and there's
a lot of ways that that can come up and

7964
02:12:08,069 --> 02:12:08,079
a lot of ways that that can come up and
 

7965
02:12:08,079 --> 02:12:09,669
a lot of ways that that can come up and
even if it doesn't happen that often at

7966
02:12:09,669 --> 02:12:09,679
even if it doesn't happen that often at
 

7967
02:12:09,679 --> 02:12:11,910
even if it doesn't happen that often at
all when you think about the safety bar

7968
02:12:11,910 --> 02:12:11,920
all when you think about the safety bar
 

7969
02:12:11,920 --> 02:12:13,510
all when you think about the safety bar
and what it takes to actually go full

7970
02:12:13,510 --> 02:12:13,520
and what it takes to actually go full
 

7971
02:12:13,520 --> 02:12:15,430
and what it takes to actually go full
driverless not like incredible

7972
02:12:15,430 --> 02:12:15,440
driverless not like incredible
 

7973
02:12:15,440 --> 02:12:16,709
driverless not like incredible
assistance driverless but full

7974
02:12:16,709 --> 02:12:16,719
assistance driverless but full
 

7975
02:12:16,719 --> 02:12:18,870
assistance driverless but full
driverless

7976
02:12:18,870 --> 02:12:18,880
driverless
 

7977
02:12:18,880 --> 02:12:21,350
driverless
that bar gets crazy high and not only do

7978
02:12:21,350 --> 02:12:21,360
that bar gets crazy high and not only do
 

7979
02:12:21,360 --> 02:12:22,709
that bar gets crazy high and not only do
you have to solve it on the behavioral

7980
02:12:22,709 --> 02:12:22,719
you have to solve it on the behavioral
 

7981
02:12:22,719 --> 02:12:25,270
you have to solve it on the behavioral
side but now you have to

7982
02:12:25,270 --> 02:12:25,280
side but now you have to
 

7983
02:12:25,280 --> 02:12:27,270
side but now you have to
push computer vision beyond arguably

7984
02:12:27,270 --> 02:12:27,280
push computer vision beyond arguably
 

7985
02:12:27,280 --> 02:12:29,030
push computer vision beyond arguably
where it's ever been pushed and so you

7986
02:12:29,030 --> 02:12:29,040
where it's ever been pushed and so you
 

7987
02:12:29,040 --> 02:12:30,870
where it's ever been pushed and so you
now on top of the broader av challenge

7988
02:12:30,870 --> 02:12:30,880
now on top of the broader av challenge
 

7989
02:12:30,880 --> 02:12:32,069
now on top of the broader av challenge
you have a really hard perception

7990
02:12:32,069 --> 02:12:32,079
you have a really hard perception
 

7991
02:12:32,079 --> 02:12:33,910
you have a really hard perception
challenge as well so there's perception

7992
02:12:33,910 --> 02:12:33,920
challenge as well so there's perception
 

7993
02:12:33,920 --> 02:12:35,510
challenge as well so there's perception
there's planning there's human robot

7994
02:12:35,510 --> 02:12:35,520
there's planning there's human robot
 

7995
02:12:35,520 --> 02:12:37,189
there's planning there's human robot
interaction to me what's fascinating

7996
02:12:37,189 --> 02:12:37,199
interaction to me what's fascinating
 

7997
02:12:37,199 --> 02:12:38,390
interaction to me what's fascinating
about

7998
02:12:38,390 --> 02:12:38,400
about
 

7999
02:12:38,400 --> 02:12:39,990
about
what tesla is doing

8000
02:12:39,990 --> 02:12:40,000
what tesla is doing
 

8001
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:43,030
what tesla is doing
is in this march towards level four

8002
02:12:43,030 --> 02:12:43,040
is in this march towards level four
 

8003
02:12:43,040 --> 02:12:44,390
is in this march towards level four
because it's in the hands of so many

8004
02:12:44,390 --> 02:12:44,400
because it's in the hands of so many
 

8005
02:12:44,400 --> 02:12:45,589
because it's in the hands of so many
humans

8006
02:12:45,589 --> 02:12:45,599
humans
 

8007
02:12:45,599 --> 02:12:47,510
humans
you get to see video you get to see

8008
02:12:47,510 --> 02:12:47,520
you get to see video you get to see
 

8009
02:12:47,520 --> 02:12:48,390
you get to see video you get to see
humans

8010
02:12:48,390 --> 02:12:48,400
humans
 

8011
02:12:48,400 --> 02:12:50,790
humans
i mean forget forget companies forget

8012
02:12:50,790 --> 02:12:50,800
i mean forget forget companies forget
 

8013
02:12:50,800 --> 02:12:51,910
i mean forget forget companies forget
businesses

8014
02:12:51,910 --> 02:12:51,920
businesses
 

8015
02:12:51,920 --> 02:12:54,229
businesses
it's fascinating for humans to be

8016
02:12:54,229 --> 02:12:54,239
it's fascinating for humans to be
 

8017
02:12:54,239 --> 02:12:55,510
it's fascinating for humans to be
interacting with robots that's

8018
02:12:55,510 --> 02:12:55,520
interacting with robots that's
 

8019
02:12:55,520 --> 02:12:56,950
interacting with robots that's
incredible and they're actually helping

8020
02:12:56,950 --> 02:12:56,960
incredible and they're actually helping
 

8021
02:12:56,960 --> 02:12:58,470
incredible and they're actually helping
kind of push it forward and yeah and

8022
02:12:58,470 --> 02:12:58,480
kind of push it forward and yeah and
 

8023
02:12:58,480 --> 02:12:59,990
kind of push it forward and yeah and
that is valuable by the way where even

8024
02:12:59,990 --> 02:13:00,000
that is valuable by the way where even
 

8025
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:02,629
that is valuable by the way where even
for us a decent percentage of our data

8026
02:13:02,629 --> 02:13:02,639
for us a decent percentage of our data
 

8027
02:13:02,639 --> 02:13:05,109
for us a decent percentage of our data
is human driving yes um we intentionally

8028
02:13:05,109 --> 02:13:05,119
is human driving yes um we intentionally
 

8029
02:13:05,119 --> 02:13:07,350
is human driving yes um we intentionally
have humans drive higher percentage than

8030
02:13:07,350 --> 02:13:07,360
have humans drive higher percentage than
 

8031
02:13:07,360 --> 02:13:08,870
have humans drive higher percentage than
you might expect because that creates

8032
02:13:08,870 --> 02:13:08,880
you might expect because that creates
 

8033
02:13:08,880 --> 02:13:10,229
you might expect because that creates
some of the best signals to train the

8034
02:13:10,229 --> 02:13:10,239
some of the best signals to train the
 

8035
02:13:10,239 --> 02:13:12,069
some of the best signals to train the
autonomy and so

8036
02:13:12,069 --> 02:13:12,079
autonomy and so
 

8037
02:13:12,079 --> 02:13:14,950
autonomy and so
that is uh on its own value so together

8038
02:13:14,950 --> 02:13:14,960
that is uh on its own value so together
 

8039
02:13:14,960 --> 02:13:17,189
that is uh on its own value so together
we're kind of learning about this

8040
02:13:17,189 --> 02:13:17,199
we're kind of learning about this
 

8041
02:13:17,199 --> 02:13:19,109
we're kind of learning about this
problem in an applied sense just like

8042
02:13:19,109 --> 02:13:19,119
problem in an applied sense just like
 

8043
02:13:19,119 --> 02:13:21,910
problem in an applied sense just like
you had with cosmo like once when when

8044
02:13:21,910 --> 02:13:21,920
you had with cosmo like once when when
 

8045
02:13:21,920 --> 02:13:24,149
you had with cosmo like once when when
you're chasing an actual product that

8046
02:13:24,149 --> 02:13:24,159
you're chasing an actual product that
 

8047
02:13:24,159 --> 02:13:26,069
you're chasing an actual product that
people are going to use

8048
02:13:26,069 --> 02:13:26,079
people are going to use
 

8049
02:13:26,079 --> 02:13:27,830
people are going to use
robot based product that people are

8050
02:13:27,830 --> 02:13:27,840
robot based product that people are
 

8051
02:13:27,840 --> 02:13:29,830
robot based product that people are
going to use you have to contend with

8052
02:13:29,830 --> 02:13:29,840
going to use you have to contend with
 

8053
02:13:29,840 --> 02:13:31,990
going to use you have to contend with
the reality of

8054
02:13:31,990 --> 02:13:32,000
the reality of
 

8055
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:33,270
the reality of
what it takes to build a robot that

8056
02:13:33,270 --> 02:13:33,280
what it takes to build a robot that
 

8057
02:13:33,280 --> 02:13:34,629
what it takes to build a robot that
successfully perceives the world and

8058
02:13:34,629 --> 02:13:34,639
successfully perceives the world and
 

8059
02:13:34,639 --> 02:13:36,229
successfully perceives the world and
operates in the world and what it takes

8060
02:13:36,229 --> 02:13:36,239
operates in the world and what it takes
 

8061
02:13:36,239 --> 02:13:37,589
operates in the world and what it takes
to have a robot that interacts with

8062
02:13:37,589 --> 02:13:37,599
to have a robot that interacts with
 

8063
02:13:37,599 --> 02:13:39,350
to have a robot that interacts with
other humans in the world and that

8064
02:13:39,350 --> 02:13:39,360
other humans in the world and that
 

8065
02:13:39,360 --> 02:13:40,790
other humans in the world and that
that's like to me one of the most

8066
02:13:40,790 --> 02:13:40,800
that's like to me one of the most
 

8067
02:13:40,800 --> 02:13:42,950
that's like to me one of the most
interesting problems humans have ever

8068
02:13:42,950 --> 02:13:42,960
interesting problems humans have ever
 

8069
02:13:42,960 --> 02:13:44,790
interesting problems humans have ever
undertaken because

8070
02:13:44,790 --> 02:13:44,800
undertaken because
 

8071
02:13:44,800 --> 02:13:45,750
undertaken because
you're

8072
02:13:45,750 --> 02:13:45,760
you're
 

8073
02:13:45,760 --> 02:13:47,669
you're
in trying to create an intelligent agent

8074
02:13:47,669 --> 02:13:47,679
in trying to create an intelligent agent
 

8075
02:13:47,679 --> 02:13:49,830
in trying to create an intelligent agent
that operates in a human world you're

8076
02:13:49,830 --> 02:13:49,840
that operates in a human world you're
 

8077
02:13:49,840 --> 02:13:51,350
that operates in a human world you're
also

8078
02:13:51,350 --> 02:13:51,360
also
 

8079
02:13:51,360 --> 02:13:53,109
also
understanding the nature of intelligence

8080
02:13:53,109 --> 02:13:53,119
understanding the nature of intelligence
 

8081
02:13:53,119 --> 02:13:53,990
understanding the nature of intelligence
itself

8082
02:13:53,990 --> 02:13:54,000
itself
 

8083
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:54,950
itself
like

8084
02:13:54,950 --> 02:13:54,960
like
 

8085
02:13:54,960 --> 02:13:58,149
like
how hard is driving it's still not

8086
02:13:58,149 --> 02:13:58,159
how hard is driving it's still not
 

8087
02:13:58,159 --> 02:14:00,069
how hard is driving it's still not
answered to me yeah i still don't

8088
02:14:00,069 --> 02:14:00,079
answered to me yeah i still don't
 

8089
02:14:00,079 --> 02:14:01,270
answered to me yeah i still don't
understand

8090
02:14:01,270 --> 02:14:01,280
understand
 

8091
02:14:01,280 --> 02:14:03,350
understand
like all the subtle cues like even

8092
02:14:03,350 --> 02:14:03,360
like all the subtle cues like even
 

8093
02:14:03,360 --> 02:14:05,109
like all the subtle cues like even
little things like um

8094
02:14:05,109 --> 02:14:05,119
little things like um
 

8095
02:14:05,119 --> 02:14:06,470
little things like um
your interaction with a pedestrian where

8096
02:14:06,470 --> 02:14:06,480
your interaction with a pedestrian where
 

8097
02:14:06,480 --> 02:14:07,910
your interaction with a pedestrian where
you look at each other and just go okay

8098
02:14:07,910 --> 02:14:07,920
you look at each other and just go okay
 

8099
02:14:07,920 --> 02:14:10,790
you look at each other and just go okay
go right like that's hard to do without

8100
02:14:10,790 --> 02:14:10,800
go right like that's hard to do without
 

8101
02:14:10,800 --> 02:14:12,550
go right like that's hard to do without
a human driver right and you're missing

8102
02:14:12,550 --> 02:14:12,560
a human driver right and you're missing
 

8103
02:14:12,560 --> 02:14:14,149
a human driver right and you're missing
that dimension how do you communicate

8104
02:14:14,149 --> 02:14:14,159
that dimension how do you communicate
 

8105
02:14:14,159 --> 02:14:15,750
that dimension how do you communicate
that so there's like really really

8106
02:14:15,750 --> 02:14:15,760
that so there's like really really
 

8107
02:14:15,760 --> 02:14:17,830
that so there's like really really
interesting kind of like elements here

8108
02:14:17,830 --> 02:14:17,840
interesting kind of like elements here
 

8109
02:14:17,840 --> 02:14:18,950
interesting kind of like elements here
now here's what's beautiful can you

8110
02:14:18,950 --> 02:14:18,960
now here's what's beautiful can you
 

8111
02:14:18,960 --> 02:14:21,109
now here's what's beautiful can you
imagine that like when autonomous

8112
02:14:21,109 --> 02:14:21,119
imagine that like when autonomous
 

8113
02:14:21,119 --> 02:14:23,030
imagine that like when autonomous
driving is solved

8114
02:14:23,030 --> 02:14:23,040
driving is solved
 

8115
02:14:23,040 --> 02:14:25,109
driving is solved
how much of the technology foundation of

02:14:25,109 --> 02:14:25,119
how much of the technology foundation of
 

8117
02:14:25,119 --> 02:14:28,390
how much of the technology foundation of
that like space can go and have like

8118
02:14:28,390 --> 02:14:28,400
that like space can go and have like
 

8119
02:14:28,400 --> 02:14:30,550
that like space can go and have like
tremendous just transformative impacts

8120
02:14:30,550 --> 02:14:30,560
tremendous just transformative impacts
 

8121
02:14:30,560 --> 02:14:32,709
tremendous just transformative impacts
on on other problem areas and other

8122
02:14:32,709 --> 02:14:32,719
on on other problem areas and other
 

8123
02:14:32,719 --> 02:14:34,390
on on other problem areas and other
other spaces that have

8124
02:14:34,390 --> 02:14:34,400
other spaces that have
 

8125
02:14:34,400 --> 02:14:36,709
other spaces that have
subsets of the these same problems like

8126
02:14:36,709 --> 02:14:36,719
subsets of the these same problems like
 

8127
02:14:36,719 --> 02:14:38,310
subsets of the these same problems like
it's just incredible

8128
02:14:38,310 --> 02:14:38,320
it's just incredible
 

8129
02:14:38,320 --> 02:14:41,430
it's just incredible
it's it's both a pro and a con is uh

8130
02:14:41,430 --> 02:14:41,440
it's it's both a pro and a con is uh
 

8131
02:14:41,440 --> 02:14:44,470
it's it's both a pro and a con is uh
with autonomous driving is so

8132
02:14:44,470 --> 02:14:44,480
with autonomous driving is so
 

8133
02:14:44,480 --> 02:14:46,629
with autonomous driving is so
um safety critical

8134
02:14:46,629 --> 02:14:46,639
um safety critical
 

8135
02:14:46,639 --> 02:14:49,109
um safety critical
it's so so once you solve it it's

8136
02:14:49,109 --> 02:14:49,119
it's so so once you solve it it's
 

8137
02:14:49,119 --> 02:14:50,629
it's so so once you solve it it's
beautiful because there's so many

8138
02:14:50,629 --> 02:14:50,639
beautiful because there's so many
 

8139
02:14:50,639 --> 02:14:52,310
beautiful because there's so many
applications that are a lot less safety

8140
02:14:52,310 --> 02:14:52,320
applications that are a lot less safety
 

8141
02:14:52,320 --> 02:14:53,350
applications that are a lot less safety
critical

8142
02:14:53,350 --> 02:14:53,360
critical
 

8143
02:14:53,360 --> 02:14:55,589
critical
but it's also the the con of that is

8144
02:14:55,589 --> 02:14:55,599
but it's also the the con of that is
 

8145
02:14:55,599 --> 02:14:58,149
but it's also the the con of that is
it's so safe it's so hard to solve and

8146
02:14:58,149 --> 02:14:58,159
it's so safe it's so hard to solve and
 

8147
02:14:58,159 --> 02:14:59,750
it's so safe it's so hard to solve and
the same journalists that you mentioned

the same journalists that you mentioned
 

8149
02:14:59,760 --> 02:15:02,149
the same journalists that you mentioned
and get excited for a demo are the ones

who
write long articles about the failure of

write long articles about the failure of
 

8157
02:15:07,280 --> 02:15:08,950
write long articles about the failure of
your company if there's

your company if there's
 

8159

one accident
 

8161
02:15:11,040 --> 02:15:13,430
one accident
that's based on a robot and it's it's

8162
02:15:13,430 --> 02:15:13,440
that's based on a robot and it's it's
 

8163
02:15:13,440 --> 02:15:16,390
that's based on a robot and it's it's
it's just society's so tense and

8164
02:15:16,390 --> 02:15:16,400
it's just society's so tense and
 

8165
02:15:16,400 --> 02:15:18,390
it's just society's so tense and
waiting for failure robots you're in

8166
02:15:18,390 --> 02:15:18,400
waiting for failure robots you're in
 

8167
02:15:18,400 --> 02:15:20,870
waiting for failure robots you're in
such a high stake environment failure

such a high stake environment failure
 

8169
02:15:20,880 --> 02:15:22,870
such a high stake environment failure
has such a high cost and it slows down

8170
02:15:22,870 --> 02:15:22,880
has such a high cost and it slows down
 

8171
02:15:22,880 --> 02:15:24,790
has such a high cost and it slows down
development it slows down development

8172
02:15:24,790 --> 02:15:24,800
development it slows down development
 

8173
02:15:24,800 --> 02:15:26,069
development it slows down development
yeah like the team like definitely

8174
02:15:26,069 --> 02:15:26,079
yeah like the team like definitely
 

8175
02:15:26,079 --> 02:15:27,910
yeah like the team like definitely
noticed that like once you go driverless

8176
02:15:27,910 --> 02:15:27,920
noticed that like once you go driverless
 

8177
02:15:27,920 --> 02:15:29,510
noticed that like once you go driverless
like we're driving from phoenix and you

8178
02:15:29,510 --> 02:15:29,520
like we're driving from phoenix and you
 

8179
02:15:29,520 --> 02:15:31,030
like we're driving from phoenix and you
continue to iterate

8180
02:15:31,030 --> 02:15:31,040
continue to iterate
 

8181
02:15:31,040 --> 02:15:33,189
continue to iterate
your iteration pace slows down um

8182
02:15:33,189 --> 02:15:33,199
your iteration pace slows down um
 

8183
02:15:33,199 --> 02:15:35,430
your iteration pace slows down um
because your fear

8184
02:15:35,430 --> 02:15:35,440
because your fear
 

8185
02:15:35,440 --> 02:15:36,870
because your fear
of regression

8186
02:15:36,870 --> 02:15:36,880
of regression
 

8187
02:15:36,880 --> 02:15:37,910
of regression
forces

8188
02:15:37,910 --> 02:15:37,920
forces
 

8189
02:15:37,920 --> 02:15:40,069
forces
so much more rigor that you know

8190
02:15:40,069 --> 02:15:40,079
so much more rigor that you know
 

8191
02:15:40,079 --> 02:15:42,069
so much more rigor that you know
obviously you know you have to find a

8192
02:15:42,069 --> 02:15:42,079
obviously you know you have to find a
 

8193
02:15:42,079 --> 02:15:43,510
obviously you know you have to find a
compromise on like okay well how often

8194
02:15:43,510 --> 02:15:43,520
compromise on like okay well how often
 

8195
02:15:43,520 --> 02:15:45,350
compromise on like okay well how often
do we release driverless builds because

8196
02:15:45,350 --> 02:15:45,360
do we release driverless builds because
 

8197
02:15:45,360 --> 02:15:46,629
do we release driverless builds because
every time you release a driver's build

8198
02:15:46,629 --> 02:15:46,639
every time you release a driver's build
 

8199
02:15:46,639 --> 02:15:47,430
every time you release a driver's build
you have to go through this like

8200
02:15:47,430 --> 02:15:47,440
you have to go through this like
 

8201
02:15:47,440 --> 02:15:49,109
you have to go through this like
validation process which is very

8202
02:15:49,109 --> 02:15:49,119
validation process which is very
 

8203
02:15:49,119 --> 02:15:51,750
validation process which is very
expensive so far so um it is interesting

8204
02:15:51,750 --> 02:15:51,760
expensive so far so um it is interesting
 

8205
02:15:51,760 --> 02:15:53,669
expensive so far so um it is interesting
it's like it is just one of the hardest

8206
02:15:53,669 --> 02:15:53,679
it's like it is just one of the hardest
 

8207
02:15:53,679 --> 02:15:54,870
it's like it is just one of the hardest
things there's no other industry where

8208
02:15:54,870 --> 02:15:54,880
things there's no other industry where
 

8209
02:15:54,880 --> 02:15:57,189
things there's no other industry where
like uh you would not like you wouldn't

8210
02:15:57,189 --> 02:15:57,199
like uh you would not like you wouldn't
 

8211
02:15:57,199 --> 02:15:59,109
like uh you would not like you wouldn't
release products way way quicker when

8212
02:15:59,109 --> 02:15:59,119
release products way way quicker when
 

8213
02:15:59,119 --> 02:16:00,629
release products way way quicker when
you start to kind of provide

8214
02:16:00,629 --> 02:16:00,639
you start to kind of provide
 

8215
02:16:00,639 --> 02:16:02,390
you start to kind of provide
even portions of the value that you

8216
02:16:02,390 --> 02:16:02,400
even portions of the value that you
 

8217
02:16:02,400 --> 02:16:03,910
even portions of the value that you
provide healthcare maybe is the other

8218
02:16:03,910 --> 02:16:03,920
provide healthcare maybe is the other
 

8219
02:16:03,920 --> 02:16:04,870
provide healthcare maybe is the other
one

8220
02:16:04,870 --> 02:16:04,880
one
 

8221
02:16:04,880 --> 02:16:06,229
one
that's right but at the same time right

8222
02:16:06,229 --> 02:16:06,239
that's right but at the same time right
 

8223
02:16:06,239 --> 02:16:07,750
that's right but at the same time right
like we've gotten there where you think

8224
02:16:07,750 --> 02:16:07,760
like we've gotten there where you think
 

8225
02:16:07,760 --> 02:16:09,189
like we've gotten there where you think
of like surgery right like you have

8226
02:16:09,189 --> 02:16:09,199
of like surgery right like you have
 

8227
02:16:09,199 --> 02:16:11,750
of like surgery right like you have
surgery there's always a risk but like

8228
02:16:11,750 --> 02:16:11,760
surgery there's always a risk but like
 

8229
02:16:11,760 --> 02:16:14,069
surgery there's always a risk but like
it's really really bounded you know that

8230
02:16:14,069 --> 02:16:14,079
it's really really bounded you know that
 

8231
02:16:14,079 --> 02:16:15,270
it's really really bounded you know that
there's an accident rate when you go out

8232
02:16:15,270 --> 02:16:15,280
there's an accident rate when you go out
 

8233
02:16:15,280 --> 02:16:17,430
there's an accident rate when you go out
and drive your car today right like

8234
02:16:17,430 --> 02:16:17,440
and drive your car today right like
 

8235
02:16:17,440 --> 02:16:18,709
and drive your car today right like
and you know what the fatality rate in

8236
02:16:18,709 --> 02:16:18,719
and you know what the fatality rate in
 

8237
02:16:18,719 --> 02:16:20,870
and you know what the fatality rate in
the u.s is per year we're not banning

8238
02:16:20,870 --> 02:16:20,880
the u.s is per year we're not banning
 

8239
02:16:20,880 --> 02:16:23,189
the u.s is per year we're not banning
driving because there was a car accident

8240
02:16:23,189 --> 02:16:23,199
driving because there was a car accident
 

8241
02:16:23,199 --> 02:16:24,870
driving because there was a car accident
but the bar for us is way higher and we

8242
02:16:24,870 --> 02:16:24,880
but the bar for us is way higher and we
 

8243
02:16:24,880 --> 02:16:27,109
but the bar for us is way higher and we
hold ourselves very serious to it where

8244
02:16:27,109 --> 02:16:27,119
hold ourselves very serious to it where
 

8245
02:16:27,119 --> 02:16:28,629
hold ourselves very serious to it where
you have to not only be better than a

8246
02:16:28,629 --> 02:16:28,639
you have to not only be better than a
 

8247
02:16:28,639 --> 02:16:31,030
you have to not only be better than a
human but you probably have to like at

8248
02:16:31,030 --> 02:16:31,040
human but you probably have to like at
 

8249
02:16:31,040 --> 02:16:32,790
human but you probably have to like at
scale be far better than a human by a

8250
02:16:32,790 --> 02:16:32,800
scale be far better than a human by a
 

8251
02:16:32,800 --> 02:16:34,709
scale be far better than a human by a
big margin and you have to be able to

8252
02:16:34,709 --> 02:16:34,719
big margin and you have to be able to
 

8253
02:16:34,719 --> 02:16:37,190
big margin and you have to be able to
like really really thoughtfully explain

8254
02:16:37,190 --> 02:16:37,200
like really really thoughtfully explain
 

8255
02:16:37,200 --> 02:16:39,990
like really really thoughtfully explain
um all of the ways that we validate that

8256
02:16:39,990 --> 02:16:40,000
um all of the ways that we validate that
 

8257
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:42,150
um all of the ways that we validate that
becomes very comfortable for humans to

8258
02:16:42,150 --> 02:16:42,160
becomes very comfortable for humans to
 

8259
02:16:42,160 --> 02:16:43,589
becomes very comfortable for humans to
understand because a bunch of jargon

8260
02:16:43,589 --> 02:16:43,599
understand because a bunch of jargon
 

8261
02:16:43,599 --> 02:16:45,429
understand because a bunch of jargon
that we use internally just doesn't

8262
02:16:45,429 --> 02:16:45,439
that we use internally just doesn't
 

8263
02:16:45,439 --> 02:16:47,190

compute at the end of the day we have to

8264
02:16:47,190 --> 02:16:47,200
compute at the end of the day we have to
 

8265
02:16:47,200 --> 02:16:49,429
compute at the end of the day we have to
be able to explain to society how do we

8266
02:16:49,429 --> 02:16:49,439
be able to explain to society how do we
 

8267
02:16:49,439 --> 02:16:51,030
be able to explain to society how do we
quantify the risk

8268
02:16:51,030 --> 02:16:51,040
quantify the risk
 

8269
02:16:51,040 --> 02:16:53,030
quantify the risk
and acknowledge that there is some

8270
02:16:53,030 --> 02:16:53,040
and acknowledge that there is some
 

8271
02:16:53,040 --> 02:16:55,990
and acknowledge that there is some
non-zero risk but it's far above a human

8272
02:16:55,990 --> 02:16:56,000
non-zero risk but it's far above a human
 

8273
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:57,589
non-zero risk but it's far above a human
you know relative safety here's the

8274
02:16:57,589 --> 02:16:57,599
you know relative safety here's the
 

8275
02:16:57,599 --> 02:16:58,790
you know relative safety here's the
thing

8276
02:16:58,790 --> 02:16:58,800
thing
 

8277
02:16:58,800 --> 02:17:00,709
thing
to push back a little bit

8278
02:17:00,709 --> 02:17:00,719
to push back a little bit
 

8279
02:17:00,719 --> 02:17:02,549
to push back a little bit
uh and bring cosmo back in the

8280
02:17:02,549 --> 02:17:02,559
uh and bring cosmo back in the
 

8281
02:17:02,559 --> 02:17:03,830
uh and bring cosmo back in the
conversation he said something quite

8282
02:17:03,830 --> 02:17:03,840
conversation he said something quite
 

8283
02:17:03,840 --> 02:17:04,790
conversation he said something quite
brilliant at the beginning of this

8284
02:17:04,790 --> 02:17:04,800
brilliant at the beginning of this
 

8285
02:17:04,800 --> 02:17:05,910
brilliant at the beginning of this
conversation that i think probably

8286
02:17:05,910 --> 02:17:05,920
conversation that i think probably
 

8287
02:17:05,920 --> 02:17:07,190
conversation that i think probably
applies for

8288
02:17:07,190 --> 02:17:07,200
applies for
 

8289
02:17:07,200 --> 02:17:09,589
applies for
autonomous driving which is

8290
02:17:09,589 --> 02:17:09,599
autonomous driving which is
 

8291
02:17:09,599 --> 02:17:11,190
autonomous driving which is
you know there's this desire to make

8292
02:17:11,190 --> 02:17:11,200
you know there's this desire to make
 

8293
02:17:11,200 --> 02:17:13,110
you know there's this desire to make
autonomous cars much safer than human

8294
02:17:13,110 --> 02:17:13,120
autonomous cars much safer than human
 

8295
02:17:13,120 --> 02:17:14,709
autonomous cars much safer than human
driven cars

8296
02:17:14,709 --> 02:17:14,719
driven cars
 

8297
02:17:14,719 --> 02:17:15,830
driven cars
but

8298
02:17:15,830 --> 02:17:15,840
but
 

8299
02:17:15,840 --> 02:17:17,509
but
if you create a product that's really

8300
02:17:17,509 --> 02:17:17,519
if you create a product that's really
 

8301
02:17:17,519 --> 02:17:19,990
if you create a product that's really
compelling and is able to explain both

8302
02:17:19,990 --> 02:17:20,000
compelling and is able to explain both
 

8303
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:22,150
compelling and is able to explain both
the leadership and the engineers and the

8304
02:17:22,150 --> 02:17:22,160
the leadership and the engineers and the
 

8305
02:17:22,160 --> 02:17:23,830
the leadership and the engineers and the
product itself

8306
02:17:23,830 --> 02:17:23,840
product itself
 

8307
02:17:23,840 --> 02:17:26,469
product itself
can communicate intent

8308
02:17:26,469 --> 02:17:26,479
can communicate intent
 

8309
02:17:26,479 --> 02:17:29,030
can communicate intent
then i think people may be able to be

8310
02:17:29,030 --> 02:17:29,040
then i think people may be able to be
 

8311
02:17:29,040 --> 02:17:30,790
then i think people may be able to be
willing to put up with the thing that

8312
02:17:30,790 --> 02:17:30,800
willing to put up with the thing that
 

8313
02:17:30,800 --> 02:17:33,270
willing to put up with the thing that
might be even riskier than humans

8314
02:17:33,270 --> 02:17:33,280
might be even riskier than humans
 

8315
02:17:33,280 --> 02:17:34,230
might be even riskier than humans
because

8316
02:17:34,230 --> 02:17:34,240
because
 

8317
02:17:34,240 --> 02:17:36,389
because
they understand the value of taking

8318
02:17:36,389 --> 02:17:36,399
they understand the value of taking
 

8319
02:17:36,399 --> 02:17:38,469
they understand the value of taking
risks you mentioned the speed limit

8320
02:17:38,469 --> 02:17:38,479
risks you mentioned the speed limit
 

8321
02:17:38,479 --> 02:17:40,150
risks you mentioned the speed limit
humans understand the value of going

8322
02:17:40,150 --> 02:17:40,160
humans understand the value of going
 

8323
02:17:40,160 --> 02:17:41,830
humans understand the value of going
over the speed limit yeah humans

8324
02:17:41,830 --> 02:17:41,840
over the speed limit yeah humans
 

8325
02:17:41,840 --> 02:17:44,870
over the speed limit yeah humans
understand the value of like

8326
02:17:44,870 --> 02:17:44,880
understand the value of like
 

8327
02:17:44,880 --> 02:17:47,429
understand the value of like
going fast through a for through a

8328
02:17:47,429 --> 02:17:47,439
going fast through a for through a
 

8329
02:17:47,439 --> 02:17:49,509
going fast through a for through a
yellow light yeah to take in when you're

8330
02:17:49,509 --> 02:17:49,519
yellow light yeah to take in when you're
 

8331
02:17:49,519 --> 02:17:52,150
yellow light yeah to take in when you're
in manhattan streets pushing through uh

8332
02:17:52,150 --> 02:17:52,160
in manhattan streets pushing through uh
 

8333
02:17:52,160 --> 02:17:54,469
in manhattan streets pushing through uh
uh crossing pedestrians they understand

8334
02:17:54,469 --> 02:17:54,479
uh crossing pedestrians they understand
 

8335
02:17:54,479 --> 02:17:56,549
uh crossing pedestrians they understand
that i mean this is a much more tense

8336
02:17:56,549 --> 02:17:56,559
that i mean this is a much more tense
 

8337
02:17:56,559 --> 02:17:58,389
that i mean this is a much more tense
topic of discussion so this is just me

8338
02:17:58,389 --> 02:17:58,399
topic of discussion so this is just me
 

8339
02:17:58,399 --> 02:18:01,190
topic of discussion so this is just me
talking so in with cosmo's case there

8340
02:18:01,190 --> 02:18:01,200
talking so in with cosmo's case there
 

8341
02:18:01,200 --> 02:18:03,349
talking so in with cosmo's case there
was something about the way

8342
02:18:03,349 --> 02:18:03,359
was something about the way
 

8343
02:18:03,359 --> 02:18:05,429
was something about the way
this particular robot communicated the

8344
02:18:05,429 --> 02:18:05,439
this particular robot communicated the
 

8345
02:18:05,439 --> 02:18:07,190
this particular robot communicated the
energy it brought the intent it was able

8346
02:18:07,190 --> 02:18:07,200
energy it brought the intent it was able
 

8347
02:18:07,200 --> 02:18:09,349
energy it brought the intent it was able
to communicate to the humans that you

8348
02:18:09,349 --> 02:18:09,359
to communicate to the humans that you
 

8349
02:18:09,359 --> 02:18:10,709
to communicate to the humans that you
understood

8350
02:18:10,709 --> 02:18:10,719
understood
 

8351
02:18:10,719 --> 02:18:12,950
understood
that of course he needs to have a camera

8352
02:18:12,950 --> 02:18:12,960
that of course he needs to have a camera
 

8353
02:18:12,960 --> 02:18:14,389
that of course he needs to have a camera
yeah of course he needs to have this

8354
02:18:14,389 --> 02:18:14,399
yeah of course he needs to have this
 

8355
02:18:14,399 --> 02:18:17,509
yeah of course he needs to have this
information and in that same way to me

8356
02:18:17,509 --> 02:18:17,519
information and in that same way to me
 

8357
02:18:17,519 --> 02:18:20,230
information and in that same way to me
of course a car needs to take risks of

8358
02:18:20,230 --> 02:18:20,240
of course a car needs to take risks of
 

8359
02:18:20,240 --> 02:18:22,790
of course a car needs to take risks of
course there's going to be accidents

8360
02:18:22,790 --> 02:18:22,800
course there's going to be accidents
 

8361
02:18:22,800 --> 02:18:25,270
course there's going to be accidents
that's what like that's

8362
02:18:25,270 --> 02:18:25,280
that's what like that's
 

8363
02:18:25,280 --> 02:18:27,110
that's what like that's
you know if you want a car that never

8364
02:18:27,110 --> 02:18:27,120
you know if you want a car that never
 

8365
02:18:27,120 --> 02:18:28,469
you know if you want a car that never
has an accident

8366
02:18:28,469 --> 02:18:28,479
has an accident
 

8367
02:18:28,479 --> 02:18:30,389
has an accident
have a car that just doesn't go anywhere

8368
02:18:30,389 --> 02:18:30,399
have a car that just doesn't go anywhere
 

8369
02:18:30,399 --> 02:18:31,270
have a car that just doesn't go anywhere
yeah

8370
02:18:31,270 --> 02:18:31,280
yeah
 

8371
02:18:31,280 --> 02:18:32,709
yeah
and so that

8372
02:18:32,709 --> 02:18:32,719
and so that
 

8373
02:18:32,719 --> 02:18:35,669
and so that
but that's tricky because that's not a

8374
02:18:35,669 --> 02:18:35,679
but that's tricky because that's not a
 

8375
02:18:35,679 --> 02:18:37,750
but that's tricky because that's not a
robotics problem

8376
02:18:37,750 --> 02:18:37,760
robotics problem
 

8377
02:18:37,760 --> 02:18:39,750
robotics problem
like are not even under like due to you

8378
02:18:39,750 --> 02:18:39,760
like are not even under like due to you
 

8379
02:18:39,760 --> 02:18:40,870
like are not even under like due to you
right obviously

8380
02:18:40,870 --> 02:18:40,880
right obviously
 

8381
02:18:40,880 --> 02:18:43,349
right obviously
so there's a big difference though um

8382
02:18:43,349 --> 02:18:43,359
so there's a big difference though um
 

8383
02:18:43,359 --> 02:18:45,190
so there's a big difference though um
yeah you are

8384
02:18:45,190 --> 02:18:45,200
yeah you are
 

8385
02:18:45,200 --> 02:18:46,870
yeah you are
that's not a personal decision you're

8386
02:18:46,870 --> 02:18:46,880
that's not a personal decision you're
 

8387
02:18:46,880 --> 02:18:48,790
that's not a personal decision you're
also impacting obviously kind of the

8388
02:18:48,790 --> 02:18:48,800
also impacting obviously kind of the
 

8389
02:18:48,800 --> 02:18:51,030
also impacting obviously kind of the
rest of the road um and we're

8390
02:18:51,030 --> 02:18:51,040
rest of the road um and we're
 

8391
02:18:51,040 --> 02:18:53,750
rest of the road um and we're
facilitating it right and so there's a

8392
02:18:53,750 --> 02:18:53,760
facilitating it right and so there's a
 

8393
02:18:53,760 --> 02:18:55,910
facilitating it right and so there's a
higher kind of you know kind of ethical

8394
02:18:55,910 --> 02:18:55,920
higher kind of you know kind of ethical
 

8395
02:18:55,920 --> 02:18:57,830
higher kind of you know kind of ethical
and moral bar which obviously then you

8396
02:18:57,830 --> 02:18:57,840
and moral bar which obviously then you
 

8397
02:18:57,840 --> 02:19:00,230
and moral bar which obviously then you
know translates into as a society and

8398
02:19:00,230 --> 02:19:00,240
know translates into as a society and
 

8399
02:19:00,240 --> 02:19:01,509
know translates into as a society and
from a regulatory standpoint kind of

8400
02:19:01,509 --> 02:19:01,519
from a regulatory standpoint kind of
 

8401
02:19:01,519 --> 02:19:03,589
from a regulatory standpoint kind of
like what what comes out of it where

8402
02:19:03,589 --> 02:19:03,599
like what what comes out of it where
 

8403
02:19:03,599 --> 02:19:06,950
like what what comes out of it where
it's hard for us to ever see this even

8404
02:19:06,950 --> 02:19:06,960
it's hard for us to ever see this even
 

8405
02:19:06,960 --> 02:19:08,549
it's hard for us to ever see this even
being a

8406
02:19:08,549 --> 02:19:08,559
being a
 

8407
02:19:08,559 --> 02:19:11,509
being a
debate in the sense that like

8408
02:19:11,509 --> 02:19:11,519
debate in the sense that like
 

8409
02:19:11,519 --> 02:19:13,110
debate in the sense that like
you have to be beyond reproach from a

8410
02:19:13,110 --> 02:19:13,120
you have to be beyond reproach from a
 

8411
02:19:13,120 --> 02:19:14,389
you have to be beyond reproach from a
safety standpoint because if you're

8412
02:19:14,389 --> 02:19:14,399
safety standpoint because if you're
 

8413
02:19:14,399 --> 02:19:15,509
safety standpoint because if you're
wrong about this you could set the

8414
02:19:15,509 --> 02:19:15,519
wrong about this you could set the
 

8415
02:19:15,519 --> 02:19:18,150
wrong about this you could set the
entire field back a decade right see i i

8416
02:19:18,150 --> 02:19:18,160
entire field back a decade right see i i
 

8417
02:19:18,160 --> 02:19:20,389
entire field back a decade right see i i
this is me speaking i think if we look

8418
02:19:20,389 --> 02:19:20,399
this is me speaking i think if we look
 

8419
02:19:20,399 --> 02:19:22,070
this is me speaking i think if we look
into the future

8420
02:19:22,070 --> 02:19:22,080
into the future
 

8421
02:19:22,080 --> 02:19:23,750
into the future
there will be

8422
02:19:23,750 --> 02:19:23,760
there will be
 

8423
02:19:23,760 --> 02:19:25,990
there will be
i personally believe

8424
02:19:25,990 --> 02:19:26,000
i personally believe
 

8425
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:27,990
i personally believe
this is me speaking yeah

8426
02:19:27,990 --> 02:19:28,000
this is me speaking yeah
 

8427
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:29,910
this is me speaking yeah
that there will be less and less focus

8428
02:19:29,910 --> 02:19:29,920
that there will be less and less focus
 

8429
02:19:29,920 --> 02:19:33,190
that there will be less and less focus
on safety still very very high yeah

8430
02:19:33,190 --> 02:19:33,200
on safety still very very high yeah
 

8431
02:19:33,200 --> 02:19:34,629
on safety still very very high yeah
meaning like after autonomy is very

8432
02:19:34,629 --> 02:19:34,639
meaning like after autonomy is very
 

8433
02:19:34,639 --> 02:19:37,589
meaning like after autonomy is very
common and accepted it's not not not so

8434
02:19:37,589 --> 02:19:37,599
common and accepted it's not not not so
 

8435
02:19:37,599 --> 02:19:39,669
common and accepted it's not not not so
common as everywhere but there has to be

8436
02:19:39,669 --> 02:19:39,679
common as everywhere but there has to be
 

8437
02:19:39,679 --> 02:19:41,190
common as everywhere but there has to be
a transition because

8438
02:19:41,190 --> 02:19:41,200
a transition because
 

8439
02:19:41,200 --> 02:19:43,349
a transition because
i think for innovation just like you

8440
02:19:43,349 --> 02:19:43,359
i think for innovation just like you
 

8441
02:19:43,359 --> 02:19:45,750
i think for innovation just like you
were saying to explore ideas you have to

8442
02:19:45,750 --> 02:19:45,760
were saying to explore ideas you have to
 

8443
02:19:45,760 --> 02:19:49,830
were saying to explore ideas you have to
take risks and i think if autonomy

8444
02:19:49,830 --> 02:19:49,840
take risks and i think if autonomy
 

8445
02:19:49,840 --> 02:19:51,750
take risks and i think if autonomy
in the near term is to become prevalent

8446
02:19:51,750 --> 02:19:51,760
in the near term is to become prevalent
 

8447
02:19:51,760 --> 02:19:53,270
in the near term is to become prevalent
in society

8448
02:19:53,270 --> 02:19:53,280
in society
 

8449
02:19:53,280 --> 02:19:55,750
in society
i think people need to be more willing

8450
02:19:55,750 --> 02:19:55,760
i think people need to be more willing
 

8451
02:19:55,760 --> 02:19:58,150
i think people need to be more willing
to understand the nature of risk

8452
02:19:58,150 --> 02:19:58,160
to understand the nature of risk
 

8453
02:19:58,160 --> 02:20:00,710
to understand the nature of risk
the value of risk

8454
02:20:00,710 --> 02:20:00,720
the value of risk
 

8455
02:20:00,720 --> 02:20:02,389
the value of risk
it's very difficult you're right of

8456
02:20:02,389 --> 02:20:02,399
it's very difficult you're right of
 

8457
02:20:02,399 --> 02:20:04,070
it's very difficult you're right of
course with driving

8458
02:20:04,070 --> 02:20:04,080
course with driving
 

8459
02:20:04,080 --> 02:20:05,910
course with driving
but that that's the fascinating nature

8460
02:20:05,910 --> 02:20:05,920
but that that's the fascinating nature
 

8461
02:20:05,920 --> 02:20:07,270
but that that's the fascinating nature
of it this

8462
02:20:07,270 --> 02:20:07,280
of it this
 

8463
02:20:07,280 --> 02:20:08,230

it's a life-and-death situation that
 

8467
02:20:10,880 --> 02:20:13,270
it's a life-and-death situation that
brings value to millions of people so

8468
02:20:13,270 --> 02:20:13,280
brings value to millions of people so
 

8469
02:20:13,280 --> 02:20:15,110
brings value to millions of people so
you have to figure out what what do we

8470
02:20:15,110 --> 02:20:15,120
you have to figure out what what do we
 

8471
02:20:15,120 --> 02:20:17,590
you have to figure out what what do we
value about this world how much do we

8472
02:20:17,590 --> 02:20:17,600
value about this world how much do we
 

8473
02:20:17,600 --> 02:20:18,870
value about this world how much do we

value
how deeply do we want to avoid

8476
02:20:21,830 --> 02:20:21,840
how deeply do we want to avoid
 

8477
02:20:21,840 --> 02:20:24,469
how deeply do we want to avoid
hurting other humans that's right and

8478
02:20:24,469 --> 02:20:24,479
hurting other humans that's right and
 

8479
02:20:24,479 --> 02:20:26,389
hurting other humans that's right and
there is a point where like

8480
02:20:26,389 --> 02:20:26,399
there is a point where like
 

8481
02:20:26,399 --> 02:20:28,070
there is a point where like
you can imagine a scenario where waymo

8482
02:20:28,070 --> 02:20:28,080
you can imagine a scenario where waymo
 

8483
02:20:28,080 --> 02:20:29,429
you can imagine a scenario where waymo
has a system

8484
02:20:29,429 --> 02:20:29,439
has a system
 

8485
02:20:29,439 --> 02:20:32,550
has a system
that is uh even when it's like uh kind

8486
02:20:32,550 --> 02:20:32,560
that is uh even when it's like uh kind
 

8487
02:20:32,560 --> 02:20:34,230
that is uh even when it's like uh kind
of beyond a you know human relative

02:20:34,230 --> 02:20:34,240
of beyond a you know human relative
 

8489
02:20:34,240 --> 02:20:36,630
of beyond a you know human relative

safety um and
 

8491
02:20:36,640 --> 02:20:38,550
safety um and
provably statistically

02:20:38,550 --> 02:20:38,560
provably statistically
 

8493
02:20:38,560 --> 02:20:40,469
provably statistically
will save lives

8494
02:20:40,469 --> 02:20:40,479
will save lives
 

8495
02:20:40,479 --> 02:20:41,910
will save lives
there is a

8496
02:20:41,910 --> 02:20:41,920
there is a
 

8497
02:20:41,920 --> 02:20:44,389
there is a
thoughtful navigation of

8498
02:20:44,389 --> 02:20:44,399
thoughtful navigation of
 

8499
02:20:44,399 --> 02:20:48,070
thoughtful navigation of
you know the that fact versus just

8500
02:20:48,070 --> 02:20:48,080
you know the that fact versus just
 

8501
02:20:48,080 --> 02:20:49,510
you know the that fact versus just
kind of

8502
02:20:49,510 --> 02:20:49,520
kind of
 

8503
02:20:49,520 --> 02:20:51,590
kind of
society readiness and perception

8504
02:20:51,590 --> 02:20:51,600
society readiness and perception
 

8505
02:20:51,600 --> 02:20:52,389
society readiness and perception
and

8506
02:20:52,389 --> 02:20:52,399
and
 

8507
02:20:52,399 --> 02:20:55,030
and
education of um

8508
02:20:55,030 --> 02:20:55,040
education of um
 

8509
02:20:55,040 --> 02:20:56,710
education of um
society and regulators and everything

8510
02:20:56,710 --> 02:20:56,720
society and regulators and everything
 

8511
02:20:56,720 --> 02:20:58,389
society and regulators and everything
else where like

8512
02:20:58,389 --> 02:20:58,399
else where like
 

8513
02:20:58,399 --> 02:21:01,190
else where like
it's it's multi-dimensional um and it's

8514
02:21:01,190 --> 02:21:01,200
it's it's multi-dimensional um and it's
 

8515
02:21:01,200 --> 02:21:05,429
it's it's multi-dimensional um and it's
not a purely logical uh argument but um

8516
02:21:05,429 --> 02:21:05,439
not a purely logical uh argument but um
 

8517
02:21:05,439 --> 02:21:06,950
not a purely logical uh argument but um
ironically the logic can actually help

8518
02:21:06,950 --> 02:21:06,960
ironically the logic can actually help
 

8519
02:21:06,960 --> 02:21:09,270
ironically the logic can actually help
with the emotions

8520
02:21:09,270 --> 02:21:09,280
with the emotions
 

8521
02:21:09,280 --> 02:21:11,030
with the emotions
and just like any technology there's

8522
02:21:11,030 --> 02:21:11,040
and just like any technology there's
 

8523
02:21:11,040 --> 02:21:12,230
and just like any technology there's
early adopters and then there's kind of

8524
02:21:12,230 --> 02:21:12,240
early adopters and then there's kind of
 

8525
02:21:12,240 --> 02:21:14,550
early adopters and then there's kind of
like a curve that um happens after it

8526
02:21:14,550 --> 02:21:14,560
like a curve that um happens after it
 

8527
02:21:14,560 --> 02:21:16,389
like a curve that um happens after it
but eventually celebrities you get the

8528
02:21:16,389 --> 02:21:16,399
but eventually celebrities you get the
 

8529
02:21:16,399 --> 02:21:18,150
but eventually celebrities you get the
rock in a way more vehicle and then

8530
02:21:18,150 --> 02:21:18,160
rock in a way more vehicle and then
 

8531
02:21:18,160 --> 02:21:19,830
rock in a way more vehicle and then
everybody just comes and everybody calms

8532
02:21:19,830 --> 02:21:19,840
everybody just comes and everybody calms
 

8533
02:21:19,840 --> 02:21:23,190
everybody just comes and everybody calms
down because the rock likes it yeah

8534
02:21:23,190 --> 02:21:23,200

 

8535
02:21:23,200 --> 02:21:25,750

if you post uh yeah and it's like it's

8536
02:21:25,750 --> 02:21:25,760
if you post uh yeah and it's like it's
 

8537
02:21:25,760 --> 02:21:27,190
if you post uh yeah and it's like it's
an open question on how this plays out i

8538
02:21:27,190 --> 02:21:27,200
an open question on how this plays out i
 

8539
02:21:27,200 --> 02:21:28,550
an open question on how this plays out i
mean maybe we're presently surprised and

8540
02:21:28,550 --> 02:21:28,560
mean maybe we're presently surprised and
 

8541
02:21:28,560 --> 02:21:30,070
mean maybe we're presently surprised and
it just like people just realize that

8542
02:21:30,070 --> 02:21:30,080
it just like people just realize that
 

8543
02:21:30,080 --> 02:21:33,349
it just like people just realize that
this is such a enabler of life and like

8544
02:21:33,349 --> 02:21:33,359
this is such a enabler of life and like
 

8545
02:21:33,359 --> 02:21:35,670
this is such a enabler of life and like
efficiency and cost and everything that

8546
02:21:35,670 --> 02:21:35,680
efficiency and cost and everything that
 

8547
02:21:35,680 --> 02:21:38,070
efficiency and cost and everything that
um there's a pull like at some point i

8548
02:21:38,070 --> 02:21:38,080
um there's a pull like at some point i
 

8549
02:21:38,080 --> 02:21:39,830
um there's a pull like at some point i
should fully believe that this will go

8550
02:21:39,830 --> 02:21:39,840
should fully believe that this will go
 

8551
02:21:39,840 --> 02:21:40,950
should fully believe that this will go
from a

8552
02:21:40,950 --> 02:21:40,960
from a
 

8553
02:21:40,960 --> 02:21:43,190
from a
thoughtful kind of you know

8554
02:21:43,190 --> 02:21:43,200
thoughtful kind of you know
 

8555
02:21:43,200 --> 02:21:44,950
thoughtful kind of you know
you know movement and tiptoeing and like

8556
02:21:44,950 --> 02:21:44,960
you know movement and tiptoeing and like
 

8557
02:21:44,960 --> 02:21:47,429
you know movement and tiptoeing and like
kind of like a push to society realizes

8558
02:21:47,429 --> 02:21:47,439
kind of like a push to society realizes
 

8559
02:21:47,439 --> 02:21:48,150
kind of like a push to society realizes
how

8560
02:21:48,150 --> 02:21:48,160
how
 

8561
02:21:48,160 --> 02:21:49,990
how
wonderful of an enabler this could

8562
02:21:49,990 --> 02:21:50,000
wonderful of an enabler this could
 

8563
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:51,750
wonderful of an enabler this could
become and it becomes more of a pull and

8564
02:21:51,750 --> 02:21:51,760
become and it becomes more of a pull and
 

8565
02:21:51,760 --> 02:21:53,349
become and it becomes more of a pull and
um hard to know exactly how that will

8566
02:21:53,349 --> 02:21:53,359
um hard to know exactly how that will
 

8567
02:21:53,359 --> 02:21:54,710
um hard to know exactly how that will
play out but at the end of the day like

8568
02:21:54,710 --> 02:21:54,720
play out but at the end of the day like
 

8569
02:21:54,720 --> 02:21:55,510
play out but at the end of the day like
both

8570
02:21:55,510 --> 02:21:55,520
both
 

8571
02:21:55,520 --> 02:21:57,270
both
the goods transportation and the people

8572
02:21:57,270 --> 02:21:57,280
the goods transportation and the people
 

8573
02:21:57,280 --> 02:21:58,550
the goods transportation and the people
transportation side of it has that

8574
02:21:58,550 --> 02:21:58,560
transportation side of it has that
 

8575
02:21:58,560 --> 02:22:00,469
transportation side of it has that
property where it's not easy there's a

8576
02:22:00,469 --> 02:22:00,479
property where it's not easy there's a
 

8577
02:22:00,479 --> 02:22:02,150
property where it's not easy there's a
lot of open questions and challenges to

8578
02:22:02,150 --> 02:22:02,160
lot of open questions and challenges to
 

8579
02:22:02,160 --> 02:22:03,670
lot of open questions and challenges to
navigate and there's obviously the

8580
02:22:03,670 --> 02:22:03,680
navigate and there's obviously the
 

8581
02:22:03,680 --> 02:22:06,230
navigate and there's obviously the
technical problems to solve uh as a you

8582
02:22:06,230 --> 02:22:06,240
technical problems to solve uh as a you
 

8583
02:22:06,240 --> 02:22:08,870
technical problems to solve uh as a you
know kind of prerequisite but um

8584
02:22:08,870 --> 02:22:08,880
know kind of prerequisite but um
 

8585
02:22:08,880 --> 02:22:10,950
know kind of prerequisite but um
they they have such an opportunity that

8586
02:22:10,950 --> 02:22:10,960
they they have such an opportunity that
 

8587
02:22:10,960 --> 02:22:12,150
they they have such an opportunity that
is um

8588
02:22:12,150 --> 02:22:12,160
is um
 

8589
02:22:12,160 --> 02:22:14,070
is um
on a scale that very few industries in

8590
02:22:14,070 --> 02:22:14,080
on a scale that very few industries in
 

8591
02:22:14,080 --> 02:22:15,830
on a scale that very few industries in
the last 20 30 years have even had a

8592
02:22:15,830 --> 02:22:15,840
the last 20 30 years have even had a
 

8593
02:22:15,840 --> 02:22:17,990
the last 20 30 years have even had a
chance to tackle that

8594
02:22:17,990 --> 02:22:18,000
chance to tackle that
 

8595
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:19,030
chance to tackle that
i

8596
02:22:19,030 --> 02:22:19,040
i
 

8597
02:22:19,040 --> 02:22:20,790
i
maybe were pleasantly surprised by how

8598
02:22:20,790 --> 02:22:20,800
maybe were pleasantly surprised by how
 

8599
02:22:20,800 --> 02:22:22,950
maybe were pleasantly surprised by how
much how much that tipping point like in

8600
02:22:22,950 --> 02:22:22,960
much how much that tipping point like in
 

8601
02:22:22,960 --> 02:22:24,469
much how much that tipping point like in
a really short amount of time actually

8602
02:22:24,469 --> 02:22:24,479
a really short amount of time actually
 

8603
02:22:24,479 --> 02:22:26,710
a really short amount of time actually
turns into a societal pull to kind of

8604
02:22:26,710 --> 02:22:26,720
turns into a societal pull to kind of
 

8605
02:22:26,720 --> 02:22:28,550
turns into a societal pull to kind of
embrace the benefits of this yeah i i

8606
02:22:28,550 --> 02:22:28,560
embrace the benefits of this yeah i i
 

8607
02:22:28,560 --> 02:22:30,469
embrace the benefits of this yeah i i
hope so it seems like in the recent few

8608
02:22:30,469 --> 02:22:30,479
hope so it seems like in the recent few
 

8609
02:22:30,479 --> 02:22:32,230
hope so it seems like in the recent few
decades there's been tipping points for

8610
02:22:32,230 --> 02:22:32,240
decades there's been tipping points for
 

8611
02:22:32,240 --> 02:22:34,150
decades there's been tipping points for
technologies where like overnight things

8612
02:22:34,150 --> 02:22:34,160
technologies where like overnight things
 

8613
02:22:34,160 --> 02:22:36,870
technologies where like overnight things
change it's uh like uh

8614
02:22:36,870 --> 02:22:36,880
change it's uh like uh
 

8615
02:22:36,880 --> 02:22:39,190
change it's uh like uh
from taxis to ride sharing services all

8616
02:22:39,190 --> 02:22:39,200
from taxis to ride sharing services all
 

8617
02:22:39,200 --> 02:22:41,270
from taxis to ride sharing services all
that that shift i mean there's just

8618
02:22:41,270 --> 02:22:41,280
that that shift i mean there's just
 

8619
02:22:41,280 --> 02:22:42,870
that that shift i mean there's just
shift after shift after shift that

8620
02:22:42,870 --> 02:22:42,880
shift after shift after shift that
 

8621
02:22:42,880 --> 02:22:45,429
shift after shift after shift that
requires digitization and technology i'm

8622
02:22:45,429 --> 02:22:45,439
requires digitization and technology i'm
 

8623
02:22:45,439 --> 02:22:46,790
requires digitization and technology i'm
i hope we're pleasantly surprised in

8624
02:22:46,790 --> 02:22:46,800
i hope we're pleasantly surprised in
 

8625
02:22:46,800 --> 02:22:49,190
i hope we're pleasantly surprised in
this so there's millions of long-haul

8626
02:22:49,190 --> 02:22:49,200
this so there's millions of long-haul
 

8627
02:22:49,200 --> 02:22:51,590
this so there's millions of long-haul
trucks now in the united states

8628
02:22:51,590 --> 02:22:51,600
trucks now in the united states
 

8629
02:22:51,600 --> 02:22:54,469
trucks now in the united states
do you see a future where

8630
02:22:54,469 --> 02:22:54,479
do you see a future where
 

8631
02:22:54,479 --> 02:22:57,270
do you see a future where
there's millions of waymo trucks and

8632
02:22:57,270 --> 02:22:57,280
there's millions of waymo trucks and
 

8633
02:22:57,280 --> 02:22:59,270
there's millions of waymo trucks and
maybe just broadly speaking way more

8634
02:22:59,270 --> 02:22:59,280
maybe just broadly speaking way more
 

8635
02:22:59,280 --> 02:23:01,030
maybe just broadly speaking way more
vehicles just

8636
02:23:01,030 --> 02:23:01,040
vehicles just
 

8637
02:23:01,040 --> 02:23:03,830
vehicles just
like like ants running around the united

8638
02:23:03,830 --> 02:23:03,840
like like ants running around the united
 

8639
02:23:03,840 --> 02:23:05,510
like like ants running around the united
states uh

8640
02:23:05,510 --> 02:23:05,520
states uh
 

8641
02:23:05,520 --> 02:23:08,070
states uh
freeways and local roads yeah in other

8642
02:23:08,070 --> 02:23:08,080
freeways and local roads yeah in other
 

8643
02:23:08,080 --> 02:23:09,670
freeways and local roads yeah in other
countries too like uh

8644
02:23:09,670 --> 02:23:09,680
countries too like uh
 

8645
02:23:09,680 --> 02:23:12,710
countries too like uh
you look back decades from now and

8646
02:23:12,710 --> 02:23:12,720
you look back decades from now and
 

8647
02:23:12,720 --> 02:23:13,910
you look back decades from now and
it might be one of those things that

8648
02:23:13,910 --> 02:23:13,920
it might be one of those things that
 

8649
02:23:13,920 --> 02:23:15,349
it might be one of those things that
just feels so natural and then it

8650
02:23:15,349 --> 02:23:15,359
just feels so natural and then it
 

8651
02:23:15,359 --> 02:23:16,950
just feels so natural and then it
becomes almost like a kind of

8652
02:23:16,950 --> 02:23:16,960
becomes almost like a kind of
 

8653
02:23:16,960 --> 02:23:18,870
becomes almost like a kind of
interesting kind of oddity that we had

8654
02:23:18,870 --> 02:23:18,880
interesting kind of oddity that we had
 

8655
02:23:18,880 --> 02:23:20,550
interesting kind of oddity that we had
none of it like uh you know kind of

8656
02:23:20,550 --> 02:23:20,560
none of it like uh you know kind of
 

8657
02:23:20,560 --> 02:23:22,309
none of it like uh you know kind of
decades earlier

8658
02:23:22,309 --> 02:23:22,319
decades earlier
 

8659
02:23:22,319 --> 02:23:23,190
decades earlier
and

8660
02:23:23,190 --> 02:23:23,200
and
 

8661
02:23:23,200 --> 02:23:25,429
and
it'll take a long time to grow and scale

8662
02:23:25,429 --> 02:23:25,439
it'll take a long time to grow and scale
 

8663
02:23:25,439 --> 02:23:27,190
it'll take a long time to grow and scale
very different challenges appear at

8664
02:23:27,190 --> 02:23:27,200
very different challenges appear at
 

8665
02:23:27,200 --> 02:23:28,790
very different challenges appear at
every stage but

8666
02:23:28,790 --> 02:23:28,800
every stage but
 

8667
02:23:28,800 --> 02:23:30,309
every stage but
over time like

8668
02:23:30,309 --> 02:23:30,319
over time like
 

8669
02:23:30,319 --> 02:23:31,429
over time like
this is one of the most enabling

8670
02:23:31,429 --> 02:23:31,439
this is one of the most enabling
 

8671
02:23:31,439 --> 02:23:33,670
this is one of the most enabling
technologies that um that we have in the

8672
02:23:33,670 --> 02:23:33,680
technologies that um that we have in the
 

8673
02:23:33,680 --> 02:23:37,349
technologies that um that we have in the
world uh today um it'll feel like

8674
02:23:37,349 --> 02:23:37,359
world uh today um it'll feel like
 

8675
02:23:37,359 --> 02:23:38,630
world uh today um it'll feel like
you know how was the world before the

8676
02:23:38,630 --> 02:23:38,640
you know how was the world before the
 

8677
02:23:38,640 --> 02:23:39,830
you know how was the world before the
internet how's the world before mobile

8678
02:23:39,830 --> 02:23:39,840
internet how's the world before mobile
 

8679
02:23:39,840 --> 02:23:41,030
internet how's the world before mobile
phones like it's gonna have that sort of

8680
02:23:41,030 --> 02:23:41,040
phones like it's gonna have that sort of
 

8681
02:23:41,040 --> 02:23:42,550
phones like it's gonna have that sort of
a feeling to it on both sides it's hard

8682
02:23:42,550 --> 02:23:42,560
a feeling to it on both sides it's hard
 

8683
02:23:42,560 --> 02:23:44,309
a feeling to it on both sides it's hard
to predict the future but

8684
02:23:44,309 --> 02:23:44,319
to predict the future but
 

8685
02:23:44,319 --> 02:23:46,550
to predict the future but
do you sometimes

8686
02:23:46,550 --> 02:23:46,560
do you sometimes
 

8687
02:23:46,560 --> 02:23:48,389
do you sometimes
uh think about weird ways it might

8688
02:23:48,389 --> 02:23:48,399
uh think about weird ways it might
 

8689
02:23:48,399 --> 02:23:50,790
uh think about weird ways it might
change the world like surprising ways so

8690
02:23:50,790 --> 02:23:50,800
change the world like surprising ways so
 

8691
02:23:50,800 --> 02:23:51,910
change the world like surprising ways so
obviously

8692
02:23:51,910 --> 02:23:51,920
obviously
 

8693
02:23:51,920 --> 02:23:53,910
obviously
there's more direct ways where like

8694
02:23:53,910 --> 02:23:53,920
there's more direct ways where like
 

8695
02:23:53,920 --> 02:23:55,910
there's more direct ways where like
there's increases efficiency it'll

8696
02:23:55,910 --> 02:23:55,920
there's increases efficiency it'll
 

8697
02:23:55,920 --> 02:23:57,990
there's increases efficiency it'll
enable a lot of kind of logistics

8698
02:23:57,990 --> 02:23:58,000
enable a lot of kind of logistics
 

8699
02:23:58,000 --> 02:24:00,950
enable a lot of kind of logistics
optimizations kind of things

8700
02:24:00,950 --> 02:24:00,960
optimizations kind of things
 

8701
02:24:00,960 --> 02:24:03,190
optimizations kind of things
it will change

8702
02:24:03,190 --> 02:24:03,200
it will change
 

8703
02:24:03,200 --> 02:24:05,830
it will change
our uh probably our roadways and all

8704
02:24:05,830 --> 02:24:05,840
our uh probably our roadways and all
 

8705
02:24:05,840 --> 02:24:08,309
our uh probably our roadways and all
that kind of stuff but it could also

8706
02:24:08,309 --> 02:24:08,319
that kind of stuff but it could also
 

8707
02:24:08,319 --> 02:24:10,309
that kind of stuff but it could also
change society in some kind of

8708
02:24:10,309 --> 02:24:10,319
change society in some kind of
 

8709
02:24:10,319 --> 02:24:12,150
change society in some kind of
interesting ways do you ever think about

8710
02:24:12,150 --> 02:24:12,160
interesting ways do you ever think about
 

8711
02:24:12,160 --> 02:24:13,910
interesting ways do you ever think about
how might change cities how might change

8712
02:24:13,910 --> 02:24:13,920
how might change cities how might change
 

8713
02:24:13,920 --> 02:24:15,910
how might change cities how might change
their lives all that kind of yeah

8714
02:24:15,910 --> 02:24:15,920
their lives all that kind of yeah
 

8715
02:24:15,920 --> 02:24:17,990
their lives all that kind of yeah
you can imagine city uh where people

8716
02:24:17,990 --> 02:24:18,000
you can imagine city uh where people
 

8717
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:19,590
you can imagine city uh where people
live versus work becoming more

8718
02:24:19,590 --> 02:24:19,600
live versus work becoming more
 

8719
02:24:19,600 --> 02:24:20,950
live versus work becoming more
distributed because the pain of

8720
02:24:20,950 --> 02:24:20,960
distributed because the pain of
 

8721
02:24:20,960 --> 02:24:23,429
distributed because the pain of
commuting becomes different just easier

8722
02:24:23,429 --> 02:24:23,439
commuting becomes different just easier
 

8723
02:24:23,439 --> 02:24:24,870
commuting becomes different just easier
uh and i don't know there's a lot of

8724
02:24:24,870 --> 02:24:24,880
uh and i don't know there's a lot of
 

8725
02:24:24,880 --> 02:24:26,230
uh and i don't know there's a lot of
options that open up

8726
02:24:26,230 --> 02:24:26,240
options that open up
 

8727
02:24:26,240 --> 02:24:28,790
options that open up
the way out of cities themselves and how

8728
02:24:28,790 --> 02:24:28,800
the way out of cities themselves and how
 

8729
02:24:28,800 --> 02:24:30,230
the way out of cities themselves and how
you think about

8730
02:24:30,230 --> 02:24:30,240
you think about
 

8731
02:24:30,240 --> 02:24:33,590
you think about
car storage and parking obviously uh

8732
02:24:33,590 --> 02:24:33,600
car storage and parking obviously uh
 

8733
02:24:33,600 --> 02:24:35,349
car storage and parking obviously uh
just enables a completely different type

8734
02:24:35,349 --> 02:24:35,359
just enables a completely different type
 

8735
02:24:35,359 --> 02:24:37,510
just enables a completely different type
of uh uh

8736
02:24:37,510 --> 02:24:37,520
of uh uh
 

8737
02:24:37,520 --> 02:24:39,030
of uh uh
type of experience in urban environments

8738
02:24:39,030 --> 02:24:39,040
type of experience in urban environments
 

8739
02:24:39,040 --> 02:24:40,469
type of experience in urban environments
i i think there was like a statistic

8740
02:24:40,469 --> 02:24:40,479
i i think there was like a statistic
 

8741
02:24:40,479 --> 02:24:41,510
i i think there was like a statistic
that uh

8742
02:24:41,510 --> 02:24:41,520
that uh
 

8743
02:24:41,520 --> 02:24:42,950
that uh
something like

8744
02:24:42,950 --> 02:24:42,960
something like
 

8745
02:24:42,960 --> 02:24:45,910
something like
30 of the traffic uh in cities

8746
02:24:45,910 --> 02:24:45,920
30 of the traffic uh in cities
 

8747
02:24:45,920 --> 02:24:48,230
30 of the traffic uh in cities
during rush hour is caused by a pursuit

8748
02:24:48,230 --> 02:24:48,240
during rush hour is caused by a pursuit
 

8749
02:24:48,240 --> 02:24:50,309
during rush hour is caused by a pursuit
of parking uh or some like some really

8750
02:24:50,309 --> 02:24:50,319
of parking uh or some like some really
 

8751
02:24:50,319 --> 02:24:51,590
of parking uh or some like some really
high stats so

8752
02:24:51,590 --> 02:24:51,600
high stats so
 

8753
02:24:51,600 --> 02:24:53,270
high stats so
those obviously kind of open up a lot of

8754
02:24:53,270 --> 02:24:53,280
those obviously kind of open up a lot of
 

8755
02:24:53,280 --> 02:24:54,630
those obviously kind of open up a lot of
options um

8756
02:24:54,630 --> 02:24:54,640
options um
 

8757
02:24:54,640 --> 02:24:57,750
options um
flexibility on goods will enable

8758
02:24:57,750 --> 02:24:57,760
flexibility on goods will enable
 

8759
02:24:57,760 --> 02:24:59,429
flexibility on goods will enable
new industries and businesses that never

8760
02:24:59,429 --> 02:24:59,439
new industries and businesses that never
 

8761
02:24:59,439 --> 02:25:00,630
new industries and businesses that never
existed before because now the

8762
02:25:00,630 --> 02:25:00,640
existed before because now the
 

8763
02:25:00,640 --> 02:25:02,550
existed before because now the
efficiency becomes

8764
02:25:02,550 --> 02:25:02,560
efficiency becomes
 

8765
02:25:02,560 --> 02:25:04,870
efficiency becomes
more palatable good delivery timing

8766
02:25:04,870 --> 02:25:04,880
more palatable good delivery timing
 

8767
02:25:04,880 --> 02:25:06,790
more palatable good delivery timing
consistency and flexibility is going to

8768
02:25:06,790 --> 02:25:06,800
consistency and flexibility is going to
 

8769
02:25:06,800 --> 02:25:07,670
consistency and flexibility is going to
change

8770
02:25:07,670 --> 02:25:07,680
change
 

8771
02:25:07,680 --> 02:25:09,429
change
the way we distribute the logistics

8772
02:25:09,429 --> 02:25:09,439
the way we distribute the logistics
 

8773
02:25:09,439 --> 02:25:11,910
the way we distribute the logistics
network will change the way we then can

8774
02:25:11,910 --> 02:25:11,920
network will change the way we then can
 

8775
02:25:11,920 --> 02:25:14,710
network will change the way we then can
integrate with warehousing with

8776
02:25:14,710 --> 02:25:14,720
integrate with warehousing with
 

8777
02:25:14,720 --> 02:25:17,190
integrate with warehousing with
shipping ports you can start to think

8778
02:25:17,190 --> 02:25:17,200
shipping ports you can start to think
 

8779
02:25:17,200 --> 02:25:19,190
shipping ports you can start to think
about greater automation through the

8780
02:25:19,190 --> 02:25:19,200
about greater automation through the
 

8781
02:25:19,200 --> 02:25:21,110
about greater automation through the
whole kind of stack

8782
02:25:21,110 --> 02:25:21,120
whole kind of stack
 

8783
02:25:21,120 --> 02:25:23,110
whole kind of stack
and how that supply chain the ripples

8784
02:25:23,110 --> 02:25:23,120
and how that supply chain the ripples
 

8785
02:25:23,120 --> 02:25:26,790
and how that supply chain the ripples
become much more uh agile versus like

8786
02:25:26,790 --> 02:25:26,800
become much more uh agile versus like
 

8787
02:25:26,800 --> 02:25:28,070
become much more uh agile versus like
very

8788
02:25:28,070 --> 02:25:28,080
very
 

8789
02:25:28,080 --> 02:25:30,070
very
grindy the way they are

8790
02:25:30,070 --> 02:25:30,080
grindy the way they are
 

8791
02:25:30,080 --> 02:25:32,230
grindy the way they are
today where just the adaptation is like

8792
02:25:32,230 --> 02:25:32,240
today where just the adaptation is like
 

8793
02:25:32,240 --> 02:25:33,349
today where just the adaptation is like
very tough and there's a lot of

8794
02:25:33,349 --> 02:25:33,359
very tough and there's a lot of
 

8795
02:25:33,359 --> 02:25:35,110
very tough and there's a lot of
constraints that we have i think it'll

8796
02:25:35,110 --> 02:25:35,120
constraints that we have i think it'll
 

8797
02:25:35,120 --> 02:25:36,550
constraints that we have i think it'll
be great for the environment it'll be

8798
02:25:36,550 --> 02:25:36,560
be great for the environment it'll be
 

8799
02:25:36,560 --> 02:25:38,870
be great for the environment it'll be
great for safety where like probably

8800
02:25:38,870 --> 02:25:38,880
great for safety where like probably
 

8801
02:25:38,880 --> 02:25:42,150
great for safety where like probably
about 95 of accidents today um

8802
02:25:42,150 --> 02:25:42,160
about 95 of accidents today um
 

8803
02:25:42,160 --> 02:25:45,110
about 95 of accidents today um
statistically are due to just uh

8804
02:25:45,110 --> 02:25:45,120
statistically are due to just uh
 

8805
02:25:45,120 --> 02:25:46,710
statistically are due to just uh
attention or things that are preventable

8806
02:25:46,710 --> 02:25:46,720
attention or things that are preventable
 

8807
02:25:46,720 --> 02:25:47,910
attention or things that are preventable
with uh

8808
02:25:47,910 --> 02:25:47,920
with uh
 

8809
02:25:47,920 --> 02:25:49,670
with uh
with the strengths of automation

8810
02:25:49,670 --> 02:25:49,680
with the strengths of automation
 

8811
02:25:49,680 --> 02:25:50,950
with the strengths of automation
yeah and it'll be one of those things

8812
02:25:50,950 --> 02:25:50,960
yeah and it'll be one of those things
 

8813
02:25:50,960 --> 02:25:53,750
yeah and it'll be one of those things
where like industries will shift but the

8814
02:25:53,750 --> 02:25:53,760
where like industries will shift but the
 

8815
02:25:53,760 --> 02:25:55,510
where like industries will shift but the
net creation is going to be massively

8816
02:25:55,510 --> 02:25:55,520
net creation is going to be massively
 

8817
02:25:55,520 --> 02:25:57,190
net creation is going to be massively
positive and then we just have to be

8818
02:25:57,190 --> 02:25:57,200
positive and then we just have to be
 

8819
02:25:57,200 --> 02:25:58,550
positive and then we just have to be
thoughtful about the negative

8820
02:25:58,550 --> 02:25:58,560
thoughtful about the negative
 

8821
02:25:58,560 --> 02:26:00,389
thoughtful about the negative
implications that will happen in local

8822
02:26:00,389 --> 02:26:00,399
implications that will happen in local
 

8823
02:26:00,399 --> 02:26:03,349
implications that will happen in local
area places um and adjust for those but

8824
02:26:03,349 --> 02:26:03,359
area places um and adjust for those but
 

8825
02:26:03,359 --> 02:26:04,630
area places um and adjust for those but
i'm an optimist in general for the

8826
02:26:04,630 --> 02:26:04,640
i'm an optimist in general for the
 

8827
02:26:04,640 --> 02:26:05,830
i'm an optimist in general for the
technology where you could argue a

8828
02:26:05,830 --> 02:26:05,840
technology where you could argue a
 

8829
02:26:05,840 --> 02:26:08,150
technology where you could argue a
negative on any new technology but you

8830
02:26:08,150 --> 02:26:08,160
negative on any new technology but you
 

8831
02:26:08,160 --> 02:26:09,830
negative on any new technology but you
start to kind of

8832
02:26:09,830 --> 02:26:09,840
start to kind of
 

8833
02:26:09,840 --> 02:26:11,910
start to kind of
see that if there is a big demand for

8834
02:26:11,910 --> 02:26:11,920
see that if there is a big demand for
 

8835
02:26:11,920 --> 02:26:13,830
see that if there is a big demand for
something like this the in almost all

8836
02:26:13,830 --> 02:26:13,840
something like this the in almost all
 

8837
02:26:13,840 --> 02:26:15,990
something like this the in almost all
cases the like it's an enabling factor

8838
02:26:15,990 --> 02:26:16,000
cases the like it's an enabling factor
 

8839
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:17,590
cases the like it's an enabling factor
that's gonna kind of propagate through

8840
02:26:17,590 --> 02:26:17,600
that's gonna kind of propagate through
 

8841
02:26:17,600 --> 02:26:20,309
that's gonna kind of propagate through
the um you know through society and

8842
02:26:20,309 --> 02:26:20,319
the um you know through society and
 

8843
02:26:20,319 --> 02:26:21,990
the um you know through society and
particularly as life expectancies get

8844
02:26:21,990 --> 02:26:22,000
particularly as life expectancies get
 

8845
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:24,070
particularly as life expectancies get
longer and you know and so forth like

8846
02:26:24,070 --> 02:26:24,080
longer and you know and so forth like
 

8847
02:26:24,080 --> 02:26:27,270
longer and you know and so forth like
there's a just a lot more need for um a

8848
02:26:27,270 --> 02:26:27,280
there's a just a lot more need for um a
 

8849
02:26:27,280 --> 02:26:28,870
there's a just a lot more need for um a
greater percentage of the population to

8850
02:26:28,870 --> 02:26:28,880
greater percentage of the population to
 

8851
02:26:28,880 --> 02:26:30,710
greater percentage of the population to
kind of just be serviced with a high

8852
02:26:30,710 --> 02:26:30,720
kind of just be serviced with a high
 

8853
02:26:30,720 --> 02:26:32,150
kind of just be serviced with a high
level of efficiency

8854
02:26:32,150 --> 02:26:32,160
level of efficiency
 

8855
02:26:32,160 --> 02:26:33,190
level of efficiency
because otherwise we can have a really

8856
02:26:33,190 --> 02:26:33,200
because otherwise we can have a really
 

8857
02:26:33,200 --> 02:26:34,630
because otherwise we can have a really
hard time kind of scaling to what's

8858
02:26:34,630 --> 02:26:34,640
hard time kind of scaling to what's
 

8859
02:26:34,640 --> 02:26:36,710
hard time kind of scaling to what's
ahead in the next 50 years um

8860
02:26:36,710 --> 02:26:36,720
ahead in the next 50 years um
 

8861
02:26:36,720 --> 02:26:38,150
ahead in the next 50 years um
yeah and you're absolutely right every

8862
02:26:38,150 --> 02:26:38,160
yeah and you're absolutely right every
 

8863
02:26:38,160 --> 02:26:41,030
yeah and you're absolutely right every
technology has uh negative consequences

8864
02:26:41,030 --> 02:26:41,040
technology has uh negative consequences
 

8865
02:26:41,040 --> 02:26:43,270
technology has uh negative consequences
of positive consequences and we tend to

8866
02:26:43,270 --> 02:26:43,280
of positive consequences and we tend to
 

8867
02:26:43,280 --> 02:26:44,710
of positive consequences and we tend to
focus on the negative a little bit too

8868
02:26:44,710 --> 02:26:44,720
focus on the negative a little bit too
 

8869
02:26:44,720 --> 02:26:46,870
focus on the negative a little bit too
much

8870
02:26:46,870 --> 02:26:46,880
much
 

8871
02:26:46,880 --> 02:26:49,030
much
in fact autonomous trucks are

8872
02:26:49,030 --> 02:26:49,040
in fact autonomous trucks are
 

8873
02:26:49,040 --> 02:26:52,870
in fact autonomous trucks are
often brought up as an example of uh

8874
02:26:52,870 --> 02:26:52,880
often brought up as an example of uh
 

8875
02:26:52,880 --> 02:26:54,630
often brought up as an example of uh
artificial intelligence and robots in

8876
02:26:54,630 --> 02:26:54,640
artificial intelligence and robots in
 

8877
02:26:54,640 --> 02:26:57,190
artificial intelligence and robots in
general taking our jobs

8878
02:26:57,190 --> 02:26:57,200
general taking our jobs
 

8879
02:26:57,200 --> 02:26:59,030
general taking our jobs
and as we've talked about briefly here

8880
02:26:59,030 --> 02:26:59,040
and as we've talked about briefly here
 

8881
02:26:59,040 --> 02:27:01,429
and as we've talked about briefly here
we talk a lot with steve you know

8882
02:27:01,429 --> 02:27:01,439
we talk a lot with steve you know
 

8883
02:27:01,439 --> 02:27:02,790
we talk a lot with steve you know
that's

8884
02:27:02,790 --> 02:27:02,800
that's
 

8885
02:27:02,800 --> 02:27:05,590
that's
it is a concern that automation

8886
02:27:05,590 --> 02:27:05,600
it is a concern that automation
 

8887
02:27:05,600 --> 02:27:07,670
it is a concern that automation
will take away certain jobs it will

8888
02:27:07,670 --> 02:27:07,680
will take away certain jobs it will
 

8889
02:27:07,680 --> 02:27:09,750
will take away certain jobs it will
create other jobs so there's temporary

8890
02:27:09,750 --> 02:27:09,760
create other jobs so there's temporary
 

8891
02:27:09,760 --> 02:27:10,790
create other jobs so there's temporary
pain

8892
02:27:10,790 --> 02:27:10,800
pain
 

8893
02:27:10,800 --> 02:27:13,110
pain
uh hopefully temporary but pain is pain

8894
02:27:13,110 --> 02:27:13,120
uh hopefully temporary but pain is pain
 

8895
02:27:13,120 --> 02:27:15,429
uh hopefully temporary but pain is pain
and all people suffer and that human

8896
02:27:15,429 --> 02:27:15,439
and all people suffer and that human
 

8897
02:27:15,439 --> 02:27:16,870
and all people suffer and that human
suffering is really important to think

8898
02:27:16,870 --> 02:27:16,880
suffering is really important to think
 

8899
02:27:16,880 --> 02:27:17,830
suffering is really important to think
about

8900
02:27:17,830 --> 02:27:17,840
about
 

8901
02:27:17,840 --> 02:27:19,510
about
how uh but

8902
02:27:19,510 --> 02:27:19,520
how uh but
 

8903
02:27:19,520 --> 02:27:20,710
how uh but
trucking is

8904
02:27:20,710 --> 02:27:20,720
trucking is
 

8905
02:27:20,720 --> 02:27:22,710
trucking is
ver i mean there's a lot written on this

8906
02:27:22,710 --> 02:27:22,720
ver i mean there's a lot written on this
 

8907
02:27:22,720 --> 02:27:25,750
ver i mean there's a lot written on this
is i would say far from the the thing

8908
02:27:25,750 --> 02:27:25,760
is i would say far from the the thing
 

8909
02:27:25,760 --> 02:27:28,790
is i would say far from the the thing
that that would cause the most pain yeah

8910
02:27:28,790 --> 02:27:28,800
that that would cause the most pain yeah
 

8911
02:27:28,800 --> 02:27:30,150
that that would cause the most pain yeah
there's even more positive properties

8912
02:27:30,150 --> 02:27:30,160
there's even more positive properties
 

8913
02:27:30,160 --> 02:27:31,590
there's even more positive properties
about trucking where not only is there

8914
02:27:31,590 --> 02:27:31,600
about trucking where not only is there
 

8915
02:27:31,600 --> 02:27:33,190
about trucking where not only is there
just a you know huge shortage which is

8916
02:27:33,190 --> 02:27:33,200
just a you know huge shortage which is
 

8917
02:27:33,200 --> 02:27:35,030
just a you know huge shortage which is
going to increase the average age of

8918
02:27:35,030 --> 02:27:35,040
going to increase the average age of
 

8919
02:27:35,040 --> 02:27:36,790
going to increase the average age of
truck drivers is getting closer to 50

8920
02:27:36,790 --> 02:27:36,800
truck drivers is getting closer to 50
 

8921
02:27:36,800 --> 02:27:37,990
truck drivers is getting closer to 50
because the younger people aren't

8922
02:27:37,990 --> 02:27:38,000
because the younger people aren't
 

8923
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:39,830
because the younger people aren't
wanting to come into it they're trying

8924
02:27:39,830 --> 02:27:39,840
wanting to come into it they're trying
 

8925
02:27:39,840 --> 02:27:42,389
wanting to come into it they're trying
to like incentivize lower the age limit

8926
02:27:42,389 --> 02:27:42,399
to like incentivize lower the age limit
 

8927
02:27:42,399 --> 02:27:44,630
to like incentivize lower the age limit
like all these sort of things um and the

8928
02:27:44,630 --> 02:27:44,640
like all these sort of things um and the
 

8929
02:27:44,640 --> 02:27:46,550
like all these sort of things um and the
demand is just going to increase and the

8930
02:27:46,550 --> 02:27:46,560
demand is just going to increase and the
 

8931
02:27:46,560 --> 02:27:48,550
demand is just going to increase and the
least favorable like it depends on the

8932
02:27:48,550 --> 02:27:48,560
least favorable like it depends on the
 

8933
02:27:48,560 --> 02:27:49,910
least favorable like it depends on the
person but in most cases the least

8934
02:27:49,910 --> 02:27:49,920
person but in most cases the least
 

8935
02:27:49,920 --> 02:27:51,670
person but in most cases the least
favorable types of routes are the

8936
02:27:51,670 --> 02:27:51,680
favorable types of routes are the
 

8937
02:27:51,680 --> 02:27:53,349
favorable types of routes are the
massive long-haul routes where you're on

8938
02:27:53,349 --> 02:27:53,359
massive long-haul routes where you're on
 

8939
02:27:53,359 --> 02:27:55,190
massive long-haul routes where you're on
the road away from your family 300 plus

8940
02:27:55,190 --> 02:27:55,200
the road away from your family 300 plus
 

8941
02:27:55,200 --> 02:27:57,429
the road away from your family 300 plus
stations steve talked about the pain of

8942
02:27:57,429 --> 02:27:57,439
stations steve talked about the pain of
 

8943
02:27:57,439 --> 02:27:59,349
stations steve talked about the pain of
those kind of routes from a family

8944
02:27:59,349 --> 02:27:59,359
those kind of routes from a family
 

8945
02:27:59,359 --> 02:28:01,670
those kind of routes from a family
perspective you're

8946
02:28:01,670 --> 02:28:01,680
perspective you're
 

8947
02:28:01,680 --> 02:28:03,190
perspective you're
you're basically away from family it's

8948
02:28:03,190 --> 02:28:03,200
you're basically away from family it's
 

8949
02:28:03,200 --> 02:28:06,710
you're basically away from family it's
not just hours you work insane hours but

8950
02:28:06,710 --> 02:28:06,720
not just hours you work insane hours but
 

8951
02:28:06,720 --> 02:28:08,550
not just hours you work insane hours but
it's also just time away from family

8952
02:28:08,550 --> 02:28:08,560
it's also just time away from family
 

8953
02:28:08,560 --> 02:28:09,910
it's also just time away from family
right and just obesity rate is through

8954
02:28:09,910 --> 02:28:09,920
right and just obesity rate is through
 

8955
02:28:09,920 --> 02:28:11,270
right and just obesity rate is through
the roof because you're just sitting all

8956
02:28:11,270 --> 02:28:11,280
the roof because you're just sitting all
 

8957
02:28:11,280 --> 02:28:12,790
the roof because you're just sitting all
day like

8958
02:28:12,790 --> 02:28:12,800
day like
 

8959
02:28:12,800 --> 02:28:14,790
day like
it's really really tough and um

8960
02:28:14,790 --> 02:28:14,800
it's really really tough and um
 

8961
02:28:14,800 --> 02:28:16,070
it's really really tough and um
and that's also where like the biggest

8962
02:28:16,070 --> 02:28:16,080
and that's also where like the biggest
 

8963
02:28:16,080 --> 02:28:17,349
and that's also where like the biggest
kind of safety risk is because of

8964
02:28:17,349 --> 02:28:17,359
kind of safety risk is because of
 

8965
02:28:17,359 --> 02:28:18,790
kind of safety risk is because of
fatigue and um

8966
02:28:18,790 --> 02:28:18,800
fatigue and um
 

8967
02:28:18,800 --> 02:28:20,790
fatigue and um
and so when you think of the gradual

8968
02:28:20,790 --> 02:28:20,800
and so when you think of the gradual
 

8969
02:28:20,800 --> 02:28:22,469
and so when you think of the gradual
evolution of how trucking comes in first

8970
02:28:22,469 --> 02:28:22,479
evolution of how trucking comes in first
 

8971
02:28:22,479 --> 02:28:24,070
evolution of how trucking comes in first
of all it's not overnight it's gonna

8972
02:28:24,070 --> 02:28:24,080
of all it's not overnight it's gonna
 

8973
02:28:24,080 --> 02:28:26,309
of all it's not overnight it's gonna
take decades to kind of phase in all the

8974
02:28:26,309 --> 02:28:26,319
take decades to kind of phase in all the
 

8975
02:28:26,319 --> 02:28:28,230
take decades to kind of phase in all the
like there's just a long long long road

8976
02:28:28,230 --> 02:28:28,240
like there's just a long long long road
 

8977
02:28:28,240 --> 02:28:29,110
like there's just a long long long road
ahead

8978
02:28:29,110 --> 02:28:29,120
ahead
 

8979
02:28:29,120 --> 02:28:29,990
ahead
but

8980
02:28:29,990 --> 02:28:30,000
but
 

8981
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:32,309
but
the the routes and the portions of

8982
02:28:32,309 --> 02:28:32,319
the the routes and the portions of
 

8983
02:28:32,319 --> 02:28:34,389
the the routes and the portions of
trucking that are going to require

8984
02:28:34,389 --> 02:28:34,399
trucking that are going to require
 

8985
02:28:34,399 --> 02:28:36,150
trucking that are going to require
humans the longest and benefit the most

8986
02:28:36,150 --> 02:28:36,160
humans the longest and benefit the most
 

8987
02:28:36,160 --> 02:28:38,309
humans the longest and benefit the most
from humans are the short-haul and most

8988
02:28:38,309 --> 02:28:38,319
from humans are the short-haul and most
 

8989
02:28:38,319 --> 02:28:40,469
from humans are the short-haul and most
complicated kind of more urban routes

8990
02:28:40,469 --> 02:28:40,479
complicated kind of more urban routes
 

8991
02:28:40,479 --> 02:28:42,150
complicated kind of more urban routes
which are also the more more pleasant

8992
02:28:42,150 --> 02:28:42,160
which are also the more more pleasant
 

8993
02:28:42,160 --> 02:28:44,870
which are also the more more pleasant
ones which are um you know less

8994
02:28:44,870 --> 02:28:44,880
ones which are um you know less
 

8995
02:28:44,880 --> 02:28:48,309
ones which are um you know less
continual driving time more um uh

8996
02:28:48,309 --> 02:28:48,319
continual driving time more um uh
 

8997
02:28:48,319 --> 02:28:49,830
continual driving time more um uh
more flexibility on like you know

8998
02:28:49,830 --> 02:28:49,840
more flexibility on like you know
 

8999
02:28:49,840 --> 02:28:51,990
more flexibility on like you know
geography and location and you get to

9000
02:28:51,990 --> 02:28:52,000
geography and location and you get to
 

9001
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:53,670
geography and location and you get to
kind of sleep with the at home with you

9002
02:28:53,670 --> 02:28:53,680
kind of sleep with the at home with you
 

9003
02:28:53,680 --> 02:28:55,590
kind of sleep with the at home with you
at your own home and very importantly if

9004
02:28:55,590 --> 02:28:55,600
at your own home and very importantly if
 

9005
02:28:55,600 --> 02:28:57,270
at your own home and very importantly if
you optimize the logistics you're going

9006
02:28:57,270 --> 02:28:57,280
you optimize the logistics you're going
 

9007
02:28:57,280 --> 02:28:59,349
you optimize the logistics you're going
to use human

9008
02:28:59,349 --> 02:28:59,359
to use human
 

9009
02:28:59,359 --> 02:29:02,150
to use human
you're going to use humans much better

9010
02:29:02,150 --> 02:29:02,160
you're going to use humans much better
 

9011
02:29:02,160 --> 02:29:04,309
you're going to use humans much better
that's right and and thereby pay them

9012
02:29:04,309 --> 02:29:04,319
that's right and and thereby pay them
 

9013
02:29:04,319 --> 02:29:05,910
that's right and and thereby pay them
much better because like one one of the

9014
02:29:05,910 --> 02:29:05,920
much better because like one one of the
 

9015
02:29:05,920 --> 02:29:08,309
much better because like one one of the
biggest problems is truck drivers

9016
02:29:08,309 --> 02:29:08,319
biggest problems is truck drivers
 

9017
02:29:08,319 --> 02:29:10,389
biggest problems is truck drivers
currently are paid by like how much they

9018
02:29:10,389 --> 02:29:10,399
currently are paid by like how much they
 

9019
02:29:10,399 --> 02:29:13,270
currently are paid by like how much they
drive so you they really feel the pain

9020
02:29:13,270 --> 02:29:13,280
drive so you they really feel the pain
 

9021
02:29:13,280 --> 02:29:15,429
drive so you they really feel the pain
of it inefficient logistics yeah because

9022
02:29:15,429 --> 02:29:15,439
of it inefficient logistics yeah because
 

9023
02:29:15,439 --> 02:29:17,270
of it inefficient logistics yeah because
like if they're just sitting around for

9024
02:29:17,270 --> 02:29:17,280
like if they're just sitting around for
 

9025
02:29:17,280 --> 02:29:19,270
like if they're just sitting around for
hours which they often do not driving

9026
02:29:19,270 --> 02:29:19,280
hours which they often do not driving
 

9027
02:29:19,280 --> 02:29:21,030
hours which they often do not driving
waiting yeah they're not getting paid

9028
02:29:21,030 --> 02:29:21,040
waiting yeah they're not getting paid
 

9029
02:29:21,040 --> 02:29:23,110
waiting yeah they're not getting paid
for that time that's right and that so

9030
02:29:23,110 --> 02:29:23,120
for that time that's right and that so
 

9031
02:29:23,120 --> 02:29:25,270
for that time that's right and that so
like logistics has a significant impact

9032
02:29:25,270 --> 02:29:25,280
like logistics has a significant impact
 

9033
02:29:25,280 --> 02:29:26,950
like logistics has a significant impact
on the quality of life of a truck driver

9034
02:29:26,950 --> 02:29:26,960
on the quality of life of a truck driver
 

9035
02:29:26,960 --> 02:29:28,550
on the quality of life of a truck driver
and high percentage of trucks are like

9036
02:29:28,550 --> 02:29:28,560
and high percentage of trucks are like
 

9037
02:29:28,560 --> 02:29:30,389
and high percentage of trucks are like
uh empty because of inefficiencies in

9038
02:29:30,389 --> 02:29:30,399
uh empty because of inefficiencies in
 

9039
02:29:30,399 --> 02:29:32,309
uh empty because of inefficiencies in
the system um yeah it's one of those

9040
02:29:32,309 --> 02:29:32,319
the system um yeah it's one of those
 

9041
02:29:32,319 --> 02:29:33,750
the system um yeah it's one of those
things where like um

9042
02:29:33,750 --> 02:29:33,760
things where like um
 

9043
02:29:33,760 --> 02:29:34,790
things where like um
and the other thing is when you increase

9044
02:29:34,790 --> 02:29:34,800
and the other thing is when you increase
 

9045
02:29:34,800 --> 02:29:36,870
and the other thing is when you increase
the efficiency of a system like this the

9046
02:29:36,870 --> 02:29:36,880
the efficiency of a system like this the
 

9047
02:29:36,880 --> 02:29:39,429
the efficiency of a system like this the
overall net like volume of the system

9048
02:29:39,429 --> 02:29:39,439
overall net like volume of the system
 

9049
02:29:39,439 --> 02:29:41,349
overall net like volume of the system
tends to increase right like the

9050
02:29:41,349 --> 02:29:41,359
tends to increase right like the
 

9051
02:29:41,359 --> 02:29:42,950
tends to increase right like the
the entire market cap of trucking is

9052
02:29:42,950 --> 02:29:42,960
the entire market cap of trucking is
 

9053
02:29:42,960 --> 02:29:45,270
the entire market cap of trucking is
going to go up um when the efficiency

9054
02:29:45,270 --> 02:29:45,280
going to go up um when the efficiency
 

9055
02:29:45,280 --> 02:29:48,230
going to go up um when the efficiency
improves uh and facilitates both growth

9056
02:29:48,230 --> 02:29:48,240
improves uh and facilitates both growth
 

9057
02:29:48,240 --> 02:29:49,910
improves uh and facilitates both growth
and industries and better utilization of

9058
02:29:49,910 --> 02:29:49,920
and industries and better utilization of
 

9059
02:29:49,920 --> 02:29:52,150
and industries and better utilization of
trucking um and so that on its own just

9060
02:29:52,150 --> 02:29:52,160
trucking um and so that on its own just
 

9061
02:29:52,160 --> 02:29:54,469
trucking um and so that on its own just
creates more and more demand which um

9062
02:29:54,469 --> 02:29:54,479
creates more and more demand which um
 

9063
02:29:54,479 --> 02:29:56,950
creates more and more demand which um
uh of all the places where ai comes in

9064
02:29:56,950 --> 02:29:56,960
uh of all the places where ai comes in
 

9065
02:29:56,960 --> 02:29:59,429
uh of all the places where ai comes in
and starts to really um

9066
02:29:59,429 --> 02:29:59,439
and starts to really um
 

9067
02:29:59,439 --> 02:30:00,389
and starts to really um
uh

9068
02:30:00,389 --> 02:30:00,399
uh
 

9069
02:30:00,399 --> 02:30:02,230
uh
kind of reshape an industry this is one

9070
02:30:02,230 --> 02:30:02,240
kind of reshape an industry this is one
 

9071
02:30:02,240 --> 02:30:03,670
kind of reshape an industry this is one
of those where like there's just a lot

9072
02:30:03,670 --> 02:30:03,680
of those where like there's just a lot
 

9073
02:30:03,680 --> 02:30:06,150
of those where like there's just a lot
of positives that for at least any time

9074
02:30:06,150 --> 02:30:06,160
of positives that for at least any time
 

9075
02:30:06,160 --> 02:30:07,590
of positives that for at least any time
in the foreseeable future seem really

9076
02:30:07,590 --> 02:30:07,600
in the foreseeable future seem really
 

9077
02:30:07,600 --> 02:30:11,030
in the foreseeable future seem really
lined up in a good way um to um

9078
02:30:11,030 --> 02:30:11,040
lined up in a good way um to um
 

9079
02:30:11,040 --> 02:30:12,550
lined up in a good way um to um
kind of come in and help with the

9080
02:30:12,550 --> 02:30:12,560
kind of come in and help with the
 

9081
02:30:12,560 --> 02:30:15,190
kind of come in and help with the
shortage and start to kind of optimize

9082
02:30:15,190 --> 02:30:15,200
shortage and start to kind of optimize
 

9083
02:30:15,200 --> 02:30:17,429
shortage and start to kind of optimize
for the routes that are most dangerous

9084
02:30:17,429 --> 02:30:17,439
for the routes that are most dangerous
 

9085
02:30:17,439 --> 02:30:19,510
for the routes that are most dangerous
and most painful

9086
02:30:19,510 --> 02:30:19,520
and most painful
 

9087
02:30:19,520 --> 02:30:20,469
and most painful
yeah so

9088
02:30:20,469 --> 02:30:20,479
yeah so
 

9089
02:30:20,479 --> 02:30:22,150
yeah so
this is true for trucking but if we zoom

9090
02:30:22,150 --> 02:30:22,160
this is true for trucking but if we zoom
 

9091
02:30:22,160 --> 02:30:24,630
this is true for trucking but if we zoom
out broader you know automation and ai

9092
02:30:24,630 --> 02:30:24,640
out broader you know automation and ai
 

9093
02:30:24,640 --> 02:30:25,429
out broader you know automation and ai
does

9094
02:30:25,429 --> 02:30:25,439
does
 

9095
02:30:25,439 --> 02:30:27,349
does
technology broadly i would say but you

9096
02:30:27,349 --> 02:30:27,359
technology broadly i would say but you
 

9097
02:30:27,359 --> 02:30:28,710
technology broadly i would say but you
know automation

9098
02:30:28,710 --> 02:30:28,720
know automation
 

9099
02:30:28,720 --> 02:30:30,630
know automation
is a thing that

9100
02:30:30,630 --> 02:30:30,640
is a thing that
 

9101
02:30:30,640 --> 02:30:32,150
is a thing that
has a potential in the next couple of

9102
02:30:32,150 --> 02:30:32,160
has a potential in the next couple of
 

9103
02:30:32,160 --> 02:30:34,550
has a potential in the next couple of
decades to shift the kind of jobs

9104
02:30:34,550 --> 02:30:34,560
decades to shift the kind of jobs
 

9105
02:30:34,560 --> 02:30:37,429
decades to shift the kind of jobs
available to humans yes and

9106
02:30:37,429 --> 02:30:37,439
available to humans yes and
 

9107
02:30:37,439 --> 02:30:39,510
available to humans yes and
so that results in

9108
02:30:39,510 --> 02:30:39,520
so that results in
 

9109
02:30:39,520 --> 02:30:41,190
so that results in
like i said human suffering because

9110
02:30:41,190 --> 02:30:41,200
like i said human suffering because
 

9111
02:30:41,200 --> 02:30:43,110
like i said human suffering because
people lose their jobs there's economic

9112
02:30:43,110 --> 02:30:43,120
people lose their jobs there's economic
 

9113
02:30:43,120 --> 02:30:44,070
people lose their jobs there's economic
pain there

9114
02:30:44,070 --> 02:30:44,080
pain there
 

9115
02:30:44,080 --> 02:30:47,110
pain there
and there's also a pain of meaning so

9116
02:30:47,110 --> 02:30:47,120
and there's also a pain of meaning so
 

9117
02:30:47,120 --> 02:30:49,590
and there's also a pain of meaning so
for a lot of people

9118
02:30:49,590 --> 02:30:49,600
for a lot of people
 

9119
02:30:49,600 --> 02:30:50,950
for a lot of people
work is a

of you know
 

9129
02:30:58,560 --> 02:31:01,030
of you know
pride in getting good at the job pride

9130
02:31:01,030 --> 02:31:01,040
pride in getting good at the job pride
 

9131
02:31:01,040 --> 02:31:03,510
pride in getting good at the job pride
in craftsmanship and excellence which is

9132
02:31:03,510 --> 02:31:03,520
in craftsmanship and excellence which is
 

9133
02:31:03,520 --> 02:31:05,830
in craftsmanship and excellence which is
what truck drivers talk about yeah but

9134
02:31:05,830 --> 02:31:05,840
what truck drivers talk about yeah but
 

9135
02:31:05,840 --> 02:31:08,150
what truck drivers talk about yeah but
but that this is true for a lot of jobs

9136
02:31:08,150 --> 02:31:08,160
but that this is true for a lot of jobs
 

9137
02:31:08,160 --> 02:31:10,389
but that this is true for a lot of jobs
and is that something you think about as

9138
02:31:10,389 --> 02:31:10,399
and is that something you think about as
 

9139
02:31:10,399 --> 02:31:12,389
and is that something you think about as
a sort of a roboticist zooming out from

9140
02:31:12,389 --> 02:31:12,399
a sort of a roboticist zooming out from
 

9141
02:31:12,399 --> 02:31:14,870
a sort of a roboticist zooming out from
the trucking thing um

9142
02:31:14,870 --> 02:31:14,880
the trucking thing um
 

9143
02:31:14,880 --> 02:31:16,230
the trucking thing um
like where

9144
02:31:16,230 --> 02:31:16,240
like where
 

9145
02:31:16,240 --> 02:31:18,469
like where
do you think it would be harder

9146
02:31:18,469 --> 02:31:18,479
do you think it would be harder
 

9147
02:31:18,479 --> 02:31:21,429
do you think it would be harder
to find activity and work that's a

9148
02:31:21,429 --> 02:31:21,439
to find activity and work that's a
 

9149
02:31:21,439 --> 02:31:23,270
to find activity and work that's a
source of identity and source of meaning

9150
02:31:23,270 --> 02:31:23,280
source of identity and source of meaning
 

9151
02:31:23,280 --> 02:31:24,550
source of identity and source of meaning
in the future

9152
02:31:24,550 --> 02:31:24,560
in the future
 

9153
02:31:24,560 --> 02:31:26,150
in the future
like i do think about it because you

9154
02:31:26,150 --> 02:31:26,160
like i do think about it because you
 

9155
02:31:26,160 --> 02:31:28,469
like i do think about it because you
want to make sure that you you worry

9156
02:31:28,469 --> 02:31:28,479
want to make sure that you you worry
 

9157
02:31:28,479 --> 02:31:30,710
want to make sure that you you worry
about the entire system like not just

9158
02:31:30,710 --> 02:31:30,720
about the entire system like not just
 

9159
02:31:30,720 --> 02:31:32,950
about the entire system like not just
like the party economy plays in it but

9160
02:31:32,950 --> 02:31:32,960
like the party economy plays in it but
 

9161
02:31:32,960 --> 02:31:34,309
like the party economy plays in it but
what are the ripple effects of it down

9162
02:31:34,309 --> 02:31:34,319
what are the ripple effects of it down
 

9163
02:31:34,319 --> 02:31:36,309
what are the ripple effects of it down
the road and um

9164
02:31:36,309 --> 02:31:36,319
the road and um
 

9165
02:31:36,319 --> 02:31:37,670

on enough of a time window there's a lot
 

9167
02:31:37,680 --> 02:31:39,349
on enough of a time window there's a lot
of opportunity to put in the right

the amazon facilities where you've
 

9201
02:32:10,880 --> 02:32:13,110
the amazon facilities where you've
probably seen the kiva systems robots uh

9202
02:32:13,110 --> 02:32:13,120
probably seen the kiva systems robots uh
 

9203
02:32:13,120 --> 02:32:14,309
probably seen the kiva systems robots uh
where you have these orange robots that

uh you know like i think it kind of came

9218
02:32:27,670 --> 02:32:27,680
uh you know like i think it kind of came
 

9219
02:32:27,680 --> 02:32:29,429
uh you know like i think it kind of came
across a company like 2006 was just

9220
02:32:29,429 --> 02:32:29,439
across a company like 2006 was just
 

9221
02:32:29,439 --> 02:32:31,190
across a company like 2006 was just
amazing and

9222
02:32:31,190 --> 02:32:31,200
amazing and
 

9223
02:32:31,200 --> 02:32:32,550
amazing and
what was the warehouse or was the

9224

what was the warehouse or was the
 

9225
02:32:32,560 --> 02:32:34,150
what was the warehouse or was the
transport little thing so basically

9226
02:32:34,150 --> 02:32:34,160
transport little thing so basically
 

9227
02:32:34,160 --> 02:32:35,750
transport little thing so basically
instead of a person going and walking

9228
02:32:35,750 --> 02:32:35,760
instead of a person going and walking
 

9229
02:32:35,760 --> 02:32:37,110
instead of a person going and walking
around and picking the seven items in

02:32:37,110 --> 02:32:37,120
around and picking the seven items in
 

9231
02:32:37,120 --> 02:32:38,950
around and picking the seven items in
your order um

9232

items are lined up and a

9240
02:32:46,630 --> 02:32:46,640
items are lined up and a
 

9241
02:32:46,640 --> 02:32:47,990
items are lined up and a
you know laser or whatever points to

9242
02:32:47,990 --> 02:32:48,000
you know laser or whatever points to
 

9243
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:49,270
you know laser or whatever points to
what you need to get and you go and pick

9244
02:32:49,270 --> 02:32:49,280
what you need to get and you go and pick
 

9245
02:32:49,280 --> 02:32:50,790
what you need to get and you go and pick
it and you place it to fill the order

9246
02:32:50,790 --> 02:32:50,800
it and you place it to fill the order
 

9247
02:32:50,800 --> 02:32:52,150
it and you place it to fill the order
and so the people were fulfilling the

9248
02:32:52,150 --> 02:32:52,160
and so the people were fulfilling the
 

9249
02:32:52,160 --> 02:32:54,230
and so the people were fulfilling the
final orders what was interesting about

9250
02:32:54,230 --> 02:32:54,240
final orders what was interesting about
 

9251
02:32:54,240 --> 02:32:56,070
final orders what was interesting about
that is that when i was asking them

9252
02:32:56,070 --> 02:32:56,080
that is that when i was asking them
 

9253
02:32:56,080 --> 02:32:57,510
that is that when i was asking them
about like kind of the impact on labor

9254
02:32:57,510 --> 02:32:57,520
about like kind of the impact on labor
 

9255
02:32:57,520 --> 02:32:59,190
about like kind of the impact on labor
when they transitioned that warehouse

9256
02:32:59,190 --> 02:32:59,200
when they transitioned that warehouse
 

9257
02:32:59,200 --> 02:33:01,590
when they transitioned that warehouse
the throughput increased so much that

9258
02:33:01,590 --> 02:33:01,600
the throughput increased so much that
 

9259
02:33:01,600 --> 02:33:03,510
the throughput increased so much that
the jobs shifted towards the final

9260
02:33:03,510 --> 02:33:03,520
the jobs shifted towards the final
 

9261
02:33:03,520 --> 02:33:05,030
the jobs shifted towards the final
fulfillment

9262
02:33:05,030 --> 02:33:05,040
fulfillment
 

9263
02:33:05,040 --> 02:33:06,710
fulfillment
even though the robots took over

9264
02:33:06,710 --> 02:33:06,720
even though the robots took over
 

9265
02:33:06,720 --> 02:33:08,550
even though the robots took over
entirely the the search of the items

9266
02:33:08,550 --> 02:33:08,560
entirely the the search of the items
 

9267
02:33:08,560 --> 02:33:11,110
entirely the the search of the items
themselves and the labor

9268
02:33:11,110 --> 02:33:11,120
themselves and the labor
 

9269
02:33:11,120 --> 02:33:13,270
themselves and the labor
the job stayed like nobody like that was

9270
02:33:13,270 --> 02:33:13,280
the job stayed like nobody like that was
 

9271
02:33:13,280 --> 02:33:15,030
the job stayed like nobody like that was
actually the same amount of jobs uh

9272
02:33:15,030 --> 02:33:15,040
actually the same amount of jobs uh
 

9273
02:33:15,040 --> 02:33:16,550
actually the same amount of jobs uh
roughly they were necessary but the

9274
02:33:16,550 --> 02:33:16,560
roughly they were necessary but the
 

9275
02:33:16,560 --> 02:33:18,389
roughly they were necessary but the
throughput increased by i think over 2x

9276
02:33:18,389 --> 02:33:18,399
throughput increased by i think over 2x
 

9277
02:33:18,399 --> 02:33:20,389
throughput increased by i think over 2x
or some some amount right like so

9278
02:33:20,389 --> 02:33:20,399
or some some amount right like so
 

9279
02:33:20,399 --> 02:33:22,150
or some some amount right like so
um you have these situations that are

9280
02:33:22,150 --> 02:33:22,160
um you have these situations that are
 

9281
02:33:22,160 --> 02:33:23,590
um you have these situations that are
not zero-sum games in this really

9282
02:33:23,590 --> 02:33:23,600
not zero-sum games in this really
 

9283
02:33:23,600 --> 02:33:25,270
not zero-sum games in this really
interesting way and the optimist to me

9284
02:33:25,270 --> 02:33:25,280
interesting way and the optimist to me
 

9285
02:33:25,280 --> 02:33:26,230
interesting way and the optimist to me
thinks that there's these types of

9286
02:33:26,230 --> 02:33:26,240
thinks that there's these types of
 

9287
02:33:26,240 --> 02:33:28,550
thinks that there's these types of
solutions in almost any industry where

9288
02:33:28,550 --> 02:33:28,560
solutions in almost any industry where
 

9289
02:33:28,560 --> 02:33:30,230
solutions in almost any industry where
the growth that's enabled creates

9290
02:33:30,230 --> 02:33:30,240
the growth that's enabled creates
 

9291
02:33:30,240 --> 02:33:32,150
the growth that's enabled creates
opportunities that you can then leverage

9292
02:33:32,150 --> 02:33:32,160
opportunities that you can then leverage
 

9293
02:33:32,160 --> 02:33:33,750
opportunities that you can then leverage
but you got to be intentional about

9294
02:33:33,750 --> 02:33:33,760
but you got to be intentional about
 

9295
02:33:33,760 --> 02:33:35,830
but you got to be intentional about
finding those and really helping make

9296
02:33:35,830 --> 02:33:35,840
finding those and really helping make
 

9297
02:33:35,840 --> 02:33:37,349
finding those and really helping make
those links because

9298
02:33:37,349 --> 02:33:37,359
those links because
 

9299
02:33:37,359 --> 02:33:39,110
those links because
any even if you make the argument that

9300
02:33:39,110 --> 02:33:39,120
any even if you make the argument that
 

9301
02:33:39,120 --> 02:33:41,190
any even if you make the argument that
like there's a net positive

9302
02:33:41,190 --> 02:33:41,200
like there's a net positive
 

9303
02:33:41,200 --> 02:33:43,190
like there's a net positive
locally there's always tough hits that

9304
02:33:43,190 --> 02:33:43,200
locally there's always tough hits that
 

9305
02:33:43,200 --> 02:33:44,630
locally there's always tough hits that
you got to be very careful about that's

9306
02:33:44,630 --> 02:33:44,640
you got to be very careful about that's
 

9307
02:33:44,640 --> 02:33:46,630
you got to be very careful about that's
right you have to have an understanding

9308
02:33:46,630 --> 02:33:46,640
right you have to have an understanding
 

9309
02:33:46,640 --> 02:33:48,469
right you have to have an understanding
of that link because there's a short

9310
02:33:48,469 --> 02:33:48,479
of that link because there's a short
 

9311
02:33:48,479 --> 02:33:50,469
of that link because there's a short
period of time

9312
02:33:50,469 --> 02:33:50,479
period of time
 

9313
02:33:50,479 --> 02:33:52,389
period of time
whether training is required or just

9314
02:33:52,389 --> 02:33:52,399
whether training is required or just
 

9315
02:33:52,399 --> 02:33:54,150
whether training is required or just
mental transition or physical or

whatever is required
 

9319
02:33:55,760 --> 02:33:57,830
whatever is required
that's still going to be short-term pain

9320
02:33:57,830 --> 02:33:57,840
that's still going to be short-term pain
 

9321
02:33:57,840 --> 02:33:59,990
that's still going to be short-term pain
the uncertainty of it there's families

9322
02:33:59,990 --> 02:34:00,000
the uncertainty of it there's families
 

9323
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:02,870
the uncertainty of it there's families
involved you know it

9324
02:34:02,870 --> 02:34:02,880
involved you know it
 

9325
02:34:02,880 --> 02:34:05,349
involved you know it
it's i mean it's exceptionally

9326
02:34:05,349 --> 02:34:05,359
it's i mean it's exceptionally
 

9327
02:34:05,359 --> 02:34:07,349
it's i mean it's exceptionally
it's difficult on a human level and you

9328
02:34:07,349 --> 02:34:07,359
it's difficult on a human level and you
 

9329
02:34:07,359 --> 02:34:09,750
it's difficult on a human level and you
have to really think about that even you

9330
02:34:09,750 --> 02:34:09,760
have to really think about that even you
 

9331
02:34:09,760 --> 02:34:11,510
have to really think about that even you
can't just look at economic metrics

9332
02:34:11,510 --> 02:34:11,520
can't just look at economic metrics
 

9333
02:34:11,520 --> 02:34:13,510
can't just look at economic metrics
always it's human beings that's right

9334
02:34:13,510 --> 02:34:13,520
always it's human beings that's right
 

9335
02:34:13,520 --> 02:34:15,429
always it's human beings that's right
and you can't even just uh take it as

9336
02:34:15,429 --> 02:34:15,439
and you can't even just uh take it as
 

9337
02:34:15,439 --> 02:34:17,270
and you can't even just uh take it as
like okay well we need to like subsidize

9338
02:34:17,270 --> 02:34:17,280
like okay well we need to like subsidize
 

9339
02:34:17,280 --> 02:34:18,469
like okay well we need to like subsidize
or whatever because like there is an

9340
02:34:18,469 --> 02:34:18,479
or whatever because like there is an
 

9341
02:34:18,479 --> 02:34:20,870
or whatever because like there is an
element of just personal pride where

9342
02:34:20,870 --> 02:34:20,880
element of just personal pride where
 

9343
02:34:20,880 --> 02:34:21,750
element of just personal pride where
right

9344
02:34:21,750 --> 02:34:21,760
right
 

9345
02:34:21,760 --> 02:34:23,429
right
majority of people like people don't

9346
02:34:23,429 --> 02:34:23,439
majority of people like people don't
 

9347
02:34:23,439 --> 02:34:25,110
majority of people like people don't
want to just be okay but like they want

9348
02:34:25,110 --> 02:34:25,120
want to just be okay but like they want
 

9349
02:34:25,120 --> 02:34:26,630
want to just be okay but like they want
to actually like have a craft like you

9350
02:34:26,630 --> 02:34:26,640
to actually like have a craft like you
 

9351
02:34:26,640 --> 02:34:28,870
to actually like have a craft like you
said and have a mission and

9352
02:34:28,870 --> 02:34:28,880
said and have a mission and
 

9353
02:34:28,880 --> 02:34:29,910
said and have a mission and
feel like they're having a really

9354
02:34:29,910 --> 02:34:29,920
feel like they're having a really
 

9355
02:34:29,920 --> 02:34:32,309
feel like they're having a really
positive impact and so um

9356
02:34:32,309 --> 02:34:32,319
positive impact and so um
 

9357
02:34:32,319 --> 02:34:33,910
positive impact and so um
my personal belief is that there's a lot

9358
02:34:33,910 --> 02:34:33,920
my personal belief is that there's a lot
 

9359
02:34:33,920 --> 02:34:36,710
my personal belief is that there's a lot
of transferability and skill set um

9360
02:34:36,710 --> 02:34:36,720
of transferability and skill set um
 

9361
02:34:36,720 --> 02:34:38,950
of transferability and skill set um
that is possible especially if you

9362
02:34:38,950 --> 02:34:38,960
that is possible especially if you
 

9363
02:34:38,960 --> 02:34:41,830
that is possible especially if you
create a bridge and an investment um to

9364
02:34:41,830 --> 02:34:41,840
create a bridge and an investment um to
 

9365
02:34:41,840 --> 02:34:44,870
create a bridge and an investment um to
enable it um and to some degree that's

9366
02:34:44,870 --> 02:34:44,880
enable it um and to some degree that's
 

9367
02:34:44,880 --> 02:34:46,389
enable it um and to some degree that's
our responsibility as well

9368
02:34:46,389 --> 02:34:46,399
our responsibility as well
 

9369
02:34:46,399 --> 02:34:47,750
our responsibility as well
this process

9370
02:34:47,750 --> 02:34:47,760
this process
 

9371
02:34:47,760 --> 02:34:51,110
this process
uh you mentioned kiva robots amazon

9372
02:34:51,110 --> 02:34:51,120
uh you mentioned kiva robots amazon
 

9373
02:34:51,120 --> 02:34:53,110
uh you mentioned kiva robots amazon
let me ask you about

9374

let me ask you about
 

9375
02:34:53,120 --> 02:34:55,590
let me ask you about
the astro robot which is i don't know if

9376
02:34:55,590 --> 02:34:55,600
the astro robot which is i don't know if
 

9377
02:34:55,600 --> 02:34:57,910
the astro robot which is i don't know if
you've seen it it's amazon's announced

9378
02:34:57,910 --> 02:34:57,920
you've seen it it's amazon's announced
 

9379
02:34:57,920 --> 02:35:00,070
you've seen it it's amazon's announced
that

9380
02:35:00,070 --> 02:35:00,080
that
 

9381
02:35:00,080 --> 02:35:02,389
that
it's a home robot that they have a

9382
02:35:02,389 --> 02:35:02,399
it's a home robot that they have a
 

9383
02:35:02,399 --> 02:35:03,349
it's a home robot that they have a
screen

9384
02:35:03,349 --> 02:35:03,359
screen
 

9385
02:35:03,359 --> 02:35:05,270
screen
looks awfully a lot like

9386
02:35:05,270 --> 02:35:05,280
looks awfully a lot like
 

9387
02:35:05,280 --> 02:35:07,190
looks awfully a lot like
cosmo has

9388
02:35:07,190 --> 02:35:07,200
cosmo has
 

9389
02:35:07,200 --> 02:35:09,910
cosmo has
i think different vision probably

9390
02:35:09,910 --> 02:35:09,920
i think different vision probably
 

9391
02:35:09,920 --> 02:35:11,429
i think different vision probably
what are your thoughts about like home

9392
02:35:11,429 --> 02:35:11,439
what are your thoughts about like home
 

9393
02:35:11,439 --> 02:35:13,190
what are your thoughts about like home
robotics in this kind of space there's

9394
02:35:13,190 --> 02:35:13,200
robotics in this kind of space there's
 

9395
02:35:13,200 --> 02:35:14,230
robotics in this kind of space there's
been a

9396
02:35:14,230 --> 02:35:14,240
been a
 

9397
02:35:14,240 --> 02:35:16,230
been a
quite a bunch of home robots social

9398
02:35:16,230 --> 02:35:16,240
quite a bunch of home robots social
 

9399
02:35:16,240 --> 02:35:19,590
quite a bunch of home robots social
robots that very unfortunately have

9400
02:35:19,590 --> 02:35:19,600
robots that very unfortunately have
 

9401
02:35:19,600 --> 02:35:22,389
robots that very unfortunately have
closed their doors that um for various

9402
02:35:22,389 --> 02:35:22,399
closed their doors that um for various
 

9403
02:35:22,399 --> 02:35:24,150
closed their doors that um for various
reasons perhaps they were too expensive

9404
02:35:24,150 --> 02:35:24,160
reasons perhaps they were too expensive
 

9405
02:35:24,160 --> 02:35:25,910
reasons perhaps they were too expensive
there's manufacturing challenges all

9406
02:35:25,910 --> 02:35:25,920
there's manufacturing challenges all
 

9407
02:35:25,920 --> 02:35:27,349
there's manufacturing challenges all
that kind of stuff what are your

9408
02:35:27,349 --> 02:35:27,359
that kind of stuff what are your
 

9409
02:35:27,359 --> 02:35:29,030
that kind of stuff what are your
thoughts about amazon getting into this

9410
02:35:29,030 --> 02:35:29,040
thoughts about amazon getting into this
 

9411
02:35:29,040 --> 02:35:29,990
thoughts about amazon getting into this
space

9412
02:35:29,990 --> 02:35:30,000
space
 

9413
02:35:30,000 --> 02:35:31,830
space
yeah we had some signs that they were

9414
02:35:31,830 --> 02:35:31,840
yeah we had some signs that they were
 

9415
02:35:31,840 --> 02:35:33,590
yeah we had some signs that they were
getting into like long long long long

9416
02:35:33,590 --> 02:35:33,600
getting into like long long long long
 

9417
02:35:33,600 --> 02:35:35,750
getting into like long long long long
ago maybe they're a little

9418
02:35:35,750 --> 02:35:35,760
ago maybe they're a little
 

9419
02:35:35,760 --> 02:35:37,670
ago maybe they're a little
too interested in cosmo and uh yeah

9420
02:35:37,670 --> 02:35:37,680
too interested in cosmo and uh yeah
 

9421
02:35:37,680 --> 02:35:39,349
too interested in cosmo and uh yeah
during our conversations but they're

9422
02:35:39,349 --> 02:35:39,359
during our conversations but they're
 

9423
02:35:39,359 --> 02:35:41,190
during our conversations but they're
also very good partners actually for us

9424
02:35:41,190 --> 02:35:41,200
also very good partners actually for us
 

9425
02:35:41,200 --> 02:35:42,710
also very good partners actually for us
as we kind of disintegrated a lot of

9426
02:35:42,710 --> 02:35:42,720
as we kind of disintegrated a lot of
 

9427
02:35:42,720 --> 02:35:45,510
as we kind of disintegrated a lot of
shared technology but if i could also

9428
02:35:45,510 --> 02:35:45,520
shared technology but if i could also
 

9429
02:35:45,520 --> 02:35:47,190
shared technology but if i could also
get your thoughts on

9430
02:35:47,190 --> 02:35:47,200
get your thoughts on
 

9431
02:35:47,200 --> 02:35:48,710
get your thoughts on
you know you could think of

9432
02:35:48,710 --> 02:35:48,720
you know you could think of
 

9433
02:35:48,720 --> 02:35:53,510
you know you could think of
alexa as a robot as well yeah echo

9434
02:35:53,510 --> 02:35:53,520
alexa as a robot as well yeah echo
 

9435
02:35:53,520 --> 02:35:54,790
alexa as a robot as well yeah echo
do you see those as fundamentally

9436
02:35:54,790 --> 02:35:54,800
do you see those as fundamentally
 

9437
02:35:54,800 --> 02:35:56,790
do you see those as fundamentally
different just because you can move and

9438
02:35:56,790 --> 02:35:56,800
different just because you can move and
 

9439
02:35:56,800 --> 02:35:58,469
different just because you can move and
look around is that fundamentally

9440
02:35:58,469 --> 02:35:58,479
look around is that fundamentally
 

9441
02:35:58,479 --> 02:35:59,750
look around is that fundamentally
different than the thing that just sits

9442
02:35:59,750 --> 02:35:59,760
different than the thing that just sits
 

9443
02:35:59,760 --> 02:36:02,950
different than the thing that just sits
in place uh it opens up options um but

9444
02:36:02,950 --> 02:36:02,960
in place uh it opens up options um but
 

9445
02:36:02,960 --> 02:36:03,910
in place uh it opens up options um but
uh

9446
02:36:03,910 --> 02:36:03,920
uh
 

9447
02:36:03,920 --> 02:36:05,429
uh
you know my first reaction is i think

9448
02:36:05,429 --> 02:36:05,439
you know my first reaction is i think
 

9449
02:36:05,439 --> 02:36:07,110
you know my first reaction is i think
like

9450
02:36:07,110 --> 02:36:07,120
like
 

9451
02:36:07,120 --> 02:36:08,150
like
i have my doubts that this one's going

9452
02:36:08,150 --> 02:36:08,160
i have my doubts that this one's going
 

9453
02:36:08,160 --> 02:36:09,670
i have my doubts that this one's going
to hit the mark because i think for the

9454
02:36:09,670 --> 02:36:09,680
to hit the mark because i think for the
 

9455
02:36:09,680 --> 02:36:11,349
to hit the mark because i think for the
price point that it's at

9456
02:36:11,349 --> 02:36:11,359
price point that it's at
 

9457
02:36:11,359 --> 02:36:12,790
price point that it's at
and the like kind of functionality and

9458
02:36:12,790 --> 02:36:12,800
and the like kind of functionality and
 

9459
02:36:12,800 --> 02:36:14,469
and the like kind of functionality and
value propositions that they're i'm

9460
02:36:14,469 --> 02:36:14,479
value propositions that they're i'm
 

9461
02:36:14,479 --> 02:36:16,710
value propositions that they're i'm
trying to put out it's uh uh it's still

9462
02:36:16,710 --> 02:36:16,720
trying to put out it's uh uh it's still
 

9463
02:36:16,720 --> 02:36:17,830
trying to put out it's uh uh it's still
searching for like the killer

9464
02:36:17,830 --> 02:36:17,840
searching for like the killer
 

9465
02:36:17,840 --> 02:36:19,830
searching for like the killer
application that like justifies i think

9466
02:36:19,830 --> 02:36:19,840
application that like justifies i think
 

9467
02:36:19,840 --> 02:36:21,990
application that like justifies i think
it was like a 1500 price point or kind

9468
02:36:21,990 --> 02:36:22,000
it was like a 1500 price point or kind
 

9469
02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:23,429
it was like a 1500 price point or kind
of somewhere around there that's a

9470
02:36:23,429 --> 02:36:23,439
of somewhere around there that's a
 

9471
02:36:23,439 --> 02:36:25,270
of somewhere around there that's a
really high bar so

9472
02:36:25,270 --> 02:36:25,280
really high bar so
 

9473
02:36:25,280 --> 02:36:27,110
really high bar so
there's enthusiasts an early adopters

9474
02:36:27,110 --> 02:36:27,120
there's enthusiasts an early adopters
 

9475
02:36:27,120 --> 02:36:29,270
there's enthusiasts an early adopters
will obviously kind of pursue it but you

9476
02:36:29,270 --> 02:36:29,280
will obviously kind of pursue it but you
 

9477
02:36:29,280 --> 02:36:30,870
will obviously kind of pursue it but you
have to like really really hit a high

9478
02:36:30,870 --> 02:36:30,880
have to like really really hit a high
 

9479
02:36:30,880 --> 02:36:32,630
have to like really really hit a high
mark at that price point which we always

9480
02:36:32,630 --> 02:36:32,640
mark at that price point which we always
 

9481
02:36:32,640 --> 02:36:34,469
mark at that price point which we always
tried to we were always very cautious

9482
02:36:34,469 --> 02:36:34,479
tried to we were always very cautious
 

9483
02:36:34,479 --> 02:36:36,070
tried to we were always very cautious
about jumping too quickly to the more

9484
02:36:36,070 --> 02:36:36,080
about jumping too quickly to the more
 

9485
02:36:36,080 --> 02:36:37,830
about jumping too quickly to the more
advanced systems that we really wanted

9486
02:36:37,830 --> 02:36:37,840
advanced systems that we really wanted
 

9487
02:36:37,840 --> 02:36:40,309
advanced systems that we really wanted
to make but would have

9488
02:36:40,309 --> 02:36:40,319
to make but would have
 

9489
02:36:40,319 --> 02:36:41,750
to make but would have
raised the bar so much you have to be

9490
02:36:41,750 --> 02:36:41,760
raised the bar so much you have to be
 

9491
02:36:41,760 --> 02:36:42,790
raised the bar so much you have to be
able to hit it

9492
02:36:42,790 --> 02:36:42,800
able to hit it
 

9493
02:36:42,800 --> 02:36:44,230
able to hit it
in today's cost structures and

9494
02:36:44,230 --> 02:36:44,240
in today's cost structures and
 

9495
02:36:44,240 --> 02:36:45,429
in today's cost structures and
technologies

9496
02:36:45,429 --> 02:36:45,439
technologies
 

9497
02:36:45,439 --> 02:36:48,070
technologies
the mobility is an angle that hasn't

9498
02:36:48,070 --> 02:36:48,080
the mobility is an angle that hasn't
 

9499
02:36:48,080 --> 02:36:49,510
the mobility is an angle that hasn't
been utilized

9500
02:36:49,510 --> 02:36:49,520
been utilized
 

9501
02:36:49,520 --> 02:36:50,469
been utilized
but

9502
02:36:50,469 --> 02:36:50,479
but
 

9503
02:36:50,479 --> 02:36:52,309
but
it has to be utilized in the right way

9504
02:36:52,309 --> 02:36:52,319
it has to be utilized in the right way
 

9505
02:36:52,319 --> 02:36:53,590
it has to be utilized in the right way
um and so that's going to be the biggest

9506
02:36:53,590 --> 02:36:53,600
um and so that's going to be the biggest
 

9507
02:36:53,600 --> 02:36:55,110
um and so that's going to be the biggest
challenge is like can you

9508
02:36:55,110 --> 02:36:55,120
challenge is like can you
 

9509
02:36:55,120 --> 02:36:57,510
challenge is like can you
meet the bar of what a con what the mass

9510
02:36:57,510 --> 02:36:57,520
meet the bar of what a con what the mass
 

9511
02:36:57,520 --> 02:37:00,070
meet the bar of what a con what the mass
market consumer like you know think like

9512
02:37:00,070 --> 02:37:00,080
market consumer like you know think like
 

9513
02:37:00,080 --> 02:37:01,590
market consumer like you know think like
you know our

9514
02:37:01,590 --> 02:37:01,600
you know our
 

9515
02:37:01,600 --> 02:37:03,750
you know our
uh our neighbors our friend parents like

9516
02:37:03,750 --> 02:37:03,760
uh our neighbors our friend parents like
 

9517
02:37:03,760 --> 02:37:06,070
uh our neighbors our friend parents like
would they find a deep deep value like

9518
02:37:06,070 --> 02:37:06,080
would they find a deep deep value like
 

9519
02:37:06,080 --> 02:37:08,710
would they find a deep deep value like
in you know fi in this at a mass scale

9520
02:37:08,710 --> 02:37:08,720
in you know fi in this at a mass scale
 

9521
02:37:08,720 --> 02:37:10,070
in you know fi in this at a mass scale
that you know that justifies the price

9522
02:37:10,070 --> 02:37:10,080
that you know that justifies the price
 

9523
02:37:10,080 --> 02:37:11,349
that you know that justifies the price
point i think that's in the end one of

9524
02:37:11,349 --> 02:37:11,359
point i think that's in the end one of
 

9525
02:37:11,359 --> 02:37:12,950
point i think that's in the end one of
the biggest challenges for robotics

9526
02:37:12,950 --> 02:37:12,960
the biggest challenges for robotics
 

9527
02:37:12,960 --> 02:37:14,870
the biggest challenges for robotics
especially consumer robotics

9528
02:37:14,870 --> 02:37:14,880
especially consumer robotics
 

9529
02:37:14,880 --> 02:37:17,110
especially consumer robotics
where you have to kind of meet that bar

9530
02:37:17,110 --> 02:37:17,120
where you have to kind of meet that bar
 

9531
02:37:17,120 --> 02:37:19,910
where you have to kind of meet that bar
uh it becomes very very hard um and

9532
02:37:19,910 --> 02:37:19,920
uh it becomes very very hard um and
 

9533
02:37:19,920 --> 02:37:22,389
uh it becomes very very hard um and
there's also the higher bar just like

9534
02:37:22,389 --> 02:37:22,399
there's also the higher bar just like
 

9535
02:37:22,399 --> 02:37:24,550
there's also the higher bar just like
you were saying with cosmo of

9536
02:37:24,550 --> 02:37:24,560
you were saying with cosmo of
 

9537
02:37:24,560 --> 02:37:26,710
you were saying with cosmo of
you know a thing that can

9538
02:37:26,710 --> 02:37:26,720
you know a thing that can
 

9539
02:37:26,720 --> 02:37:28,550
you know a thing that can
look one way and then turn around and

9540
02:37:28,550 --> 02:37:28,560
look one way and then turn around and
 

9541
02:37:28,560 --> 02:37:30,230
look one way and then turn around and
look at you

9542
02:37:30,230 --> 02:37:30,240
look at you
 

9543
02:37:30,240 --> 02:37:32,630
look at you
there's that's either a super desirable

9544
02:37:32,630 --> 02:37:32,640
there's that's either a super desirable
 

9545
02:37:32,640 --> 02:37:35,590
there's that's either a super desirable
quality or super undesirable quality

9546
02:37:35,590 --> 02:37:35,600
quality or super undesirable quality
 

9547
02:37:35,600 --> 02:37:37,030
quality or super undesirable quality
depending on how much you trust the

9548
02:37:37,030 --> 02:37:37,040
depending on how much you trust the
 

9549
02:37:37,040 --> 02:37:39,190
depending on how much you trust the
thing that's right and so there's uh

9550
02:37:39,190 --> 02:37:39,200
thing that's right and so there's uh
 

9551
02:37:39,200 --> 02:37:41,110
thing that's right and so there's uh
there's a problem of trust to solve

9552
02:37:41,110 --> 02:37:41,120
there's a problem of trust to solve
 

9553
02:37:41,120 --> 02:37:42,630
there's a problem of trust to solve
there there's a problem of personalities

9554
02:37:42,630 --> 02:37:42,640
there there's a problem of personalities
 

9555
02:37:42,640 --> 02:37:44,710
there there's a problem of personalities
the thing is the quote-unquote problem

9556
02:37:44,710 --> 02:37:44,720
the thing is the quote-unquote problem
 

9557
02:37:44,720 --> 02:37:47,110
the thing is the quote-unquote problem
that cosmos solved so well yeah is that

9558
02:37:47,110 --> 02:37:47,120
that cosmos solved so well yeah is that
 

9559
02:37:47,120 --> 02:37:49,270
that cosmos solved so well yeah is that
there you trust the thing yeah and that

9560
02:37:49,270 --> 02:37:49,280
there you trust the thing yeah and that
 

9561
02:37:49,280 --> 02:37:50,630
there you trust the thing yeah and that
has to do with the company with the

9562
02:37:50,630 --> 02:37:50,640
has to do with the company with the
 

9563
02:37:50,640 --> 02:37:52,790
has to do with the company with the
leadership with the intent that's

9564
02:37:52,790 --> 02:37:52,800
leadership with the intent that's
 

9565
02:37:52,800 --> 02:37:54,230
leadership with the intent that's
communicated by the device and the

9566
02:37:54,230 --> 02:37:54,240
communicated by the device and the
 

9567
02:37:54,240 --> 02:37:56,389
communicated by the device and the
company and everything together yeah

9568
02:37:56,389 --> 02:37:56,399
company and everything together yeah
 

9569
02:37:56,399 --> 02:37:59,270
company and everything together yeah
exactly right uh and so um and i think

9570
02:37:59,270 --> 02:37:59,280
exactly right uh and so um and i think
 

9571
02:37:59,280 --> 02:38:01,030
exactly right uh and so um and i think
they also have to retrace some of the

9572
02:38:01,030 --> 02:38:01,040
they also have to retrace some of the
 

9573
02:38:01,040 --> 02:38:02,469
they also have to retrace some of the
like learnings on the character side

9574
02:38:02,469 --> 02:38:02,479
like learnings on the character side
 

9575
02:38:02,479 --> 02:38:04,469
like learnings on the character side
where like as usual i think that's the

9576
02:38:04,469 --> 02:38:04,479
where like as usual i think that's the
 

9577
02:38:04,479 --> 02:38:06,950
where like as usual i think that's the
place where it's uh a lot of companies

9578
02:38:06,950 --> 02:38:06,960
place where it's uh a lot of companies
 

9579
02:38:06,960 --> 02:38:08,469
place where it's uh a lot of companies
are great at the hardware side of it and

9580
02:38:08,469 --> 02:38:08,479
are great at the hardware side of it and
 

9581
02:38:08,479 --> 02:38:09,910
are great at the hardware side of it and
can you know think about those elements

9582
02:38:09,910 --> 02:38:09,920
can you know think about those elements
 

9583
02:38:09,920 --> 02:38:11,429
can you know think about those elements
and then there's like you know the

9584
02:38:11,429 --> 02:38:11,439
and then there's like you know the
 

9585
02:38:11,439 --> 02:38:12,710
and then there's like you know the
thinking about the ai challenges

9586
02:38:12,710 --> 02:38:12,720
thinking about the ai challenges
 

9587
02:38:12,720 --> 02:38:14,550
thinking about the ai challenges
particularly the advantage of alexa is a

9588
02:38:14,550 --> 02:38:14,560
particularly the advantage of alexa is a
 

9589
02:38:14,560 --> 02:38:16,309
particularly the advantage of alexa is a
pretty huge boost for them um the

9590
02:38:16,309 --> 02:38:16,319
pretty huge boost for them um the
 

9591
02:38:16,319 --> 02:38:18,230
pretty huge boost for them um the
character side of it for technology

9592
02:38:18,230 --> 02:38:18,240
character side of it for technology
 

9593
02:38:18,240 --> 02:38:20,469
character side of it for technology
companies is pretty new novel territory

9594
02:38:20,469 --> 02:38:20,479
companies is pretty new novel territory
 

9595
02:38:20,479 --> 02:38:23,190
companies is pretty new novel territory
and so that will take some iterations

9596
02:38:23,190 --> 02:38:23,200
and so that will take some iterations
 

9597
02:38:23,200 --> 02:38:25,429
and so that will take some iterations
but um yeah i mean i hope

9598
02:38:25,429 --> 02:38:25,439
but um yeah i mean i hope
 

9599
02:38:25,439 --> 02:38:26,790
but um yeah i mean i hope
i hope there's continued progress in the

9600
02:38:26,790 --> 02:38:26,800
i hope there's continued progress in the
 

9601
02:38:26,800 --> 02:38:28,950
i hope there's continued progress in the
space and that threat doesn't kind of go

9602
02:38:28,950 --> 02:38:28,960
space and that threat doesn't kind of go
 

9603
02:38:28,960 --> 02:38:30,550
space and that threat doesn't kind of go
dormant for too long

9604
02:38:30,550 --> 02:38:30,560
dormant for too long
 

9605
02:38:30,560 --> 02:38:31,910
dormant for too long
and it's not you know it's going to take

9606
02:38:31,910 --> 02:38:31,920
and it's not you know it's going to take
 

9607
02:38:31,920 --> 02:38:33,750
and it's not you know it's going to take
a while to kind of

9608
02:38:33,750 --> 02:38:33,760
a while to kind of
 

9609
02:38:33,760 --> 02:38:35,910
a while to kind of
evolve into like the ideal applications

9610
02:38:35,910 --> 02:38:35,920
evolve into like the ideal applications
 

9611
02:38:35,920 --> 02:38:37,270
evolve into like the ideal applications
but you know

9612
02:38:37,270 --> 02:38:37,280
but you know
 

9613
02:38:37,280 --> 02:38:40,309
but you know
this is one of um amazon's i guess like

9614
02:38:40,309 --> 02:38:40,319
this is one of um amazon's i guess like
 

9615
02:38:40,319 --> 02:38:41,670
this is one of um amazon's i guess like
you could call it it's definitely like

9616
02:38:41,670 --> 02:38:41,680
you could call it it's definitely like
 

9617
02:38:41,680 --> 02:38:43,910
you could call it it's definitely like
part of their dna but in many cases it's

9618
02:38:43,910 --> 02:38:43,920
part of their dna but in many cases it's
 

9619
02:38:43,920 --> 02:38:45,349
part of their dna but in many cases it's
also strength where they're very willing

9620
02:38:45,349 --> 02:38:45,359
also strength where they're very willing
 

9621
02:38:45,359 --> 02:38:47,910
also strength where they're very willing
to like iterate uh kind of aggressively

9622
02:38:47,910 --> 02:38:47,920
to like iterate uh kind of aggressively
 

9623
02:38:47,920 --> 02:38:51,030
to like iterate uh kind of aggressively
and um and move quickly not take risks

9624
02:38:51,030 --> 02:38:51,040
and um and move quickly not take risks
 

9625
02:38:51,040 --> 02:38:52,710
and um and move quickly not take risks
and take risks you have deep pockets so

9626
02:38:52,710 --> 02:38:52,720
and take risks you have deep pockets so
 

9627
02:38:52,720 --> 02:38:54,630
and take risks you have deep pockets so
you can yeah and they'll maybe have more

9628
02:38:54,630 --> 02:38:54,640
you can yeah and they'll maybe have more
 

9629
02:38:54,640 --> 02:38:57,670
you can yeah and they'll maybe have more
misfires than an apple would um but uh

9630
02:38:57,670 --> 02:38:57,680
misfires than an apple would um but uh
 

9631
02:38:57,680 --> 02:38:58,710
misfires than an apple would um but uh
you know it's different styles and

9632
02:38:58,710 --> 02:38:58,720
you know it's different styles and
 

9633
02:38:58,720 --> 02:39:01,349
you know it's different styles and
different approaches and um you know

9634
02:39:01,349 --> 02:39:01,359
different approaches and um you know
 

9635
02:39:01,359 --> 02:39:02,710
different approaches and um you know
at the end of the day it's like there's

9636
02:39:02,710 --> 02:39:02,720
at the end of the day it's like there's
 

9637
02:39:02,720 --> 02:39:04,790
at the end of the day it's like there's
a few familiar uh kind of elements there

9638
02:39:04,790 --> 02:39:04,800
a few familiar uh kind of elements there
 

9639
02:39:04,800 --> 02:39:07,510
a few familiar uh kind of elements there
for sure which was uh you know kind of

9640
02:39:07,510 --> 02:39:07,520
for sure which was uh you know kind of
 

9641
02:39:07,520 --> 02:39:10,469
for sure which was uh you know kind of
you know homage

9642
02:39:10,469 --> 02:39:10,479
you know homage
 

9643
02:39:10,479 --> 02:39:12,790
you know homage
is one way to put it yeah uh so why is

9644
02:39:12,790 --> 02:39:12,800
is one way to put it yeah uh so why is
 

9645
02:39:12,800 --> 02:39:15,830
is one way to put it yeah uh so why is
it so hard

9646
02:39:15,830 --> 02:39:15,840

 

9647
02:39:15,840 --> 02:39:17,190

at a high level

9648
02:39:17,190 --> 02:39:17,200
at a high level
 

9649
02:39:17,200 --> 02:39:20,070
at a high level
um to build a robotics company a

9650
02:39:20,070 --> 02:39:20,080
um to build a robotics company a
 

9651
02:39:20,080 --> 02:39:21,990
um to build a robotics company a
robotics company that

9652
02:39:21,990 --> 02:39:22,000
robotics company that
 

9653
02:39:22,000 --> 02:39:24,870
robotics company that
lives for a long time so if you look at

9654
02:39:24,870 --> 02:39:24,880
lives for a long time so if you look at
 

9655
02:39:24,880 --> 02:39:27,590
lives for a long time so if you look at
so i thought cosmo for sure would live

9656
02:39:27,590 --> 02:39:27,600
so i thought cosmo for sure would live
 

9657
02:39:27,600 --> 02:39:29,990
so i thought cosmo for sure would live
for a very long time that to me was

9658
02:39:29,990 --> 02:39:30,000
for a very long time that to me was
 

9659
02:39:30,000 --> 02:39:32,070
for a very long time that to me was
exceptionally successful vision and idea

9660
02:39:32,070 --> 02:39:32,080
exceptionally successful vision and idea
 

9661
02:39:32,080 --> 02:39:34,309
exceptionally successful vision and idea
and implementation

9662
02:39:34,309 --> 02:39:34,319
and implementation
 

9663
02:39:34,319 --> 02:39:37,270
and implementation
irobot is an example of a company that

9664
02:39:37,270 --> 02:39:37,280
irobot is an example of a company that
 

9665
02:39:37,280 --> 02:39:38,710
irobot is an example of a company that
has

9666
02:39:38,710 --> 02:39:38,720
has
 

9667
02:39:38,720 --> 02:39:41,750
has
pivoted in all the right ways to survive

9668
02:39:41,750 --> 02:39:41,760
pivoted in all the right ways to survive
 

9669
02:39:41,760 --> 02:39:42,630
pivoted in all the right ways to survive
and

9670
02:39:42,630 --> 02:39:42,640
and
 

9671
02:39:42,640 --> 02:39:44,389
and
arguably thrive

9672
02:39:44,389 --> 02:39:44,399
arguably thrive
 

9673
02:39:44,399 --> 02:39:46,309
arguably thrive
by focusing on the

9674
02:39:46,309 --> 02:39:46,319
by focusing on the
 

9675
02:39:46,319 --> 02:39:48,309
by focusing on the
having like a

9676
02:39:48,309 --> 02:39:48,319
having like a
 

9677
02:39:48,319 --> 02:39:50,469
having like a
have a driver that constantly provides

9678
02:39:50,469 --> 02:39:50,479
have a driver that constantly provides
 

9679
02:39:50,479 --> 02:39:53,270
have a driver that constantly provides
profit which is the vacuum cleaner

9680
02:39:53,270 --> 02:39:53,280
profit which is the vacuum cleaner
 

9681
02:39:53,280 --> 02:39:54,870
profit which is the vacuum cleaner
and of course there's like amazon what

9682
02:39:54,870 --> 02:39:54,880
and of course there's like amazon what
 

9683
02:39:54,880 --> 02:39:57,190
and of course there's like amazon what
they're what they're doing is they're

9684
02:39:57,190 --> 02:39:57,200
they're what they're doing is they're
 

9685
02:39:57,200 --> 02:39:58,550
they're what they're doing is they're
almost like taking risks so they can

9686
02:39:58,550 --> 02:39:58,560
almost like taking risks so they can
 

9687
02:39:58,560 --> 02:40:00,150
almost like taking risks so they can
afford it because they have other

9688
02:40:00,150 --> 02:40:00,160
afford it because they have other
 

9689
02:40:00,160 --> 02:40:03,429
afford it because they have other
sources of revenue right but outside of

9690
02:40:03,429 --> 02:40:03,439
sources of revenue right but outside of
 

9691
02:40:03,439 --> 02:40:05,510
sources of revenue right but outside of
those examples

9692
02:40:05,510 --> 02:40:05,520
those examples
 

9693
02:40:05,520 --> 02:40:08,389
those examples
most robotics companies fail yeah

9694
02:40:08,389 --> 02:40:08,399
most robotics companies fail yeah
 

9695
02:40:08,399 --> 02:40:10,870
most robotics companies fail yeah
why why do they fail why is it so hard

9696
02:40:10,870 --> 02:40:10,880
why why do they fail why is it so hard
 

9697
02:40:10,880 --> 02:40:13,030
why why do they fail why is it so hard
to run a robotics company our robot's

9698
02:40:13,030 --> 02:40:13,040
to run a robotics company our robot's
 

9699
02:40:13,040 --> 02:40:15,190
to run a robotics company our robot's
impressive because they found a really

9700
02:40:15,190 --> 02:40:15,200
impressive because they found a really
 

9701
02:40:15,200 --> 02:40:16,710
impressive because they found a really
really great

9702
02:40:16,710 --> 02:40:16,720
really great
 

9703
02:40:16,720 --> 02:40:18,309
really great
fit of where the technology could

9704
02:40:18,309 --> 02:40:18,319
fit of where the technology could
 

9705
02:40:18,319 --> 02:40:21,190
fit of where the technology could
satisfy a really clear used case in need

9706
02:40:21,190 --> 02:40:21,200
satisfy a really clear used case in need
 

9707
02:40:21,200 --> 02:40:22,309
satisfy a really clear used case in need
and

9708
02:40:22,309 --> 02:40:22,319
and
 

9709
02:40:22,319 --> 02:40:24,309
and
they did it well and they didn't try to

9710
02:40:24,309 --> 02:40:24,319
they did it well and they didn't try to
 

9711
02:40:24,319 --> 02:40:27,190
they did it well and they didn't try to
overshoot from a cost-to-benefit

standpoint
 

9715
02:40:29,279 --> 02:40:30,950
standpoint
robotics is hard because it like tends

9716
02:40:30,950 --> 02:40:30,960
robotics is hard because it like tends
 

9717
02:40:30,960 --> 02:40:32,469
robotics is hard because it like tends
to be more expensive it combines way

9718
02:40:32,469 --> 02:40:32,479
to be more expensive it combines way
 

9719
02:40:32,479 --> 02:40:34,150
to be more expensive it combines way
more technologies than a lot of other

9720
02:40:34,150 --> 02:40:34,160
more technologies than a lot of other
 

9721
02:40:34,160 --> 02:40:36,309
more technologies than a lot of other
types of companies do if i were to like

9722
02:40:36,309 --> 02:40:36,319
types of companies do if i were to like
 

9723
02:40:36,319 --> 02:40:38,870
types of companies do if i were to like
say one thing that is maybe the biggest

9724
02:40:38,870 --> 02:40:38,880
say one thing that is maybe the biggest
 

9725
02:40:38,880 --> 02:40:40,950
say one thing that is maybe the biggest
risk and like a robotics company failing

9726
02:40:40,950 --> 02:40:40,960
risk and like a robotics company failing
 

9727
02:40:40,960 --> 02:40:41,830
risk and like a robotics company failing
is that

9728
02:40:41,830 --> 02:40:41,840
is that
 

9729
02:40:41,840 --> 02:40:43,510
is that
it can be either a

9730
02:40:43,510 --> 02:40:43,520
it can be either a
 

9731
02:40:43,520 --> 02:40:46,230
it can be either a
technology in search of a application

9732
02:40:46,230 --> 02:40:46,240
technology in search of a application
 

9733
02:40:46,240 --> 02:40:47,269
technology in search of a application
or

9734
02:40:47,269 --> 02:40:47,279
or
 

9735
02:40:47,279 --> 02:40:50,469
or
they try to bite off a

9736
02:40:50,469 --> 02:40:50,479
they try to bite off a
 

9737
02:40:50,479 --> 02:40:52,469
they try to bite off a
kind of an offering that has

9738
02:40:52,469 --> 02:40:52,479
kind of an offering that has
 

9739
02:40:52,479 --> 02:40:55,510
kind of an offering that has
a mismatch and kind of price to function

9740
02:40:55,510 --> 02:40:55,520
a mismatch and kind of price to function
 

9741
02:40:55,520 --> 02:40:57,269
a mismatch and kind of price to function
um and uh

9742
02:40:57,269 --> 02:40:57,279
um and uh
 

9743
02:40:57,279 --> 02:40:59,190
um and uh
just the mass market appeal isn't there

9744
02:40:59,190 --> 02:40:59,200
just the mass market appeal isn't there
 

9745
02:40:59,200 --> 02:41:01,830
just the mass market appeal isn't there
and um consumer products are just hard

9746
02:41:01,830 --> 02:41:01,840
and um consumer products are just hard
 

9747
02:41:01,840 --> 02:41:03,990
and um consumer products are just hard
it's just i mean after all the years and

9748
02:41:03,990 --> 02:41:04,000
it's just i mean after all the years and
 

9749
02:41:04,000 --> 02:41:06,070
it's just i mean after all the years and
it like definitely kind of feel a lot of

9750
02:41:06,070 --> 02:41:06,080
it like definitely kind of feel a lot of
 

9751
02:41:06,080 --> 02:41:09,110
it like definitely kind of feel a lot of
the battle scars because you have um you

9752
02:41:09,110 --> 02:41:09,120
the battle scars because you have um you
 

9753
02:41:09,120 --> 02:41:10,230
the battle scars because you have um you
know you not only do you have to like

9754
02:41:10,230 --> 02:41:10,240
know you not only do you have to like
 

9755
02:41:10,240 --> 02:41:11,750
know you not only do you have to like
hit the function but you have to educate

9756
02:41:11,750 --> 02:41:11,760
hit the function but you have to educate
 

9757
02:41:11,760 --> 02:41:13,910
hit the function but you have to educate
and explain get awareness up deal with

9758
02:41:13,910 --> 02:41:13,920
and explain get awareness up deal with
 

9759
02:41:13,920 --> 02:41:16,630
and explain get awareness up deal with
different conductive consumers like uh

9760
02:41:16,630 --> 02:41:16,640
different conductive consumers like uh
 

9761
02:41:16,640 --> 02:41:18,070
different conductive consumers like uh
you know there's um there's a reason why

9762
02:41:18,070 --> 02:41:18,080
you know there's um there's a reason why
 

9763
02:41:18,080 --> 02:41:19,510
you know there's um there's a reason why
a lot of technology sometimes start in

9764
02:41:19,510 --> 02:41:19,520
a lot of technology sometimes start in
 

9765
02:41:19,520 --> 02:41:21,030
a lot of technology sometimes start in
the enterprise space and then kind of

9766
02:41:21,030 --> 02:41:21,040
the enterprise space and then kind of
 

9767
02:41:21,040 --> 02:41:22,870
the enterprise space and then kind of
continue forward in the consumer space

9768
02:41:22,870 --> 02:41:22,880
continue forward in the consumer space
 

9769
02:41:22,880 --> 02:41:25,510
continue forward in the consumer space
even like you know you see ar like

9770
02:41:25,510 --> 02:41:25,520
even like you know you see ar like
 

9771
02:41:25,520 --> 02:41:26,950
even like you know you see ar like
starting to kind of make that shift with

9772
02:41:26,950 --> 02:41:26,960
starting to kind of make that shift with
 

9773
02:41:26,960 --> 02:41:29,349
starting to kind of make that shift with
hololens and so forth in some ways

9774
02:41:29,349 --> 02:41:29,359
hololens and so forth in some ways
 

9775
02:41:29,359 --> 02:41:31,030
hololens and so forth in some ways
consumers and price points that they're

9776
02:41:31,030 --> 02:41:31,040
consumers and price points that they're
 

9777
02:41:31,040 --> 02:41:33,510
consumers and price points that they're
willing to kind of uh be attracted in a

9778
02:41:33,510 --> 02:41:33,520
willing to kind of uh be attracted in a
 

9779
02:41:33,520 --> 02:41:35,269
willing to kind of uh be attracted in a
mass market way and i don't mean like

9780
02:41:35,269 --> 02:41:35,279
mass market way and i don't mean like
 

9781
02:41:35,279 --> 02:41:36,790
mass market way and i don't mean like
you know 10 000 enthusiasts bought it

9782
02:41:36,790 --> 02:41:36,800
you know 10 000 enthusiasts bought it
 

9783
02:41:36,800 --> 02:41:38,150
you know 10 000 enthusiasts bought it
but i mean like

9784
02:41:38,150 --> 02:41:38,160
but i mean like
 

9785
02:41:38,160 --> 02:41:41,830
but i mean like
you know 2 million 10 million 50 million

9786
02:41:41,830 --> 02:41:41,840
you know 2 million 10 million 50 million
 

9787
02:41:41,840 --> 02:41:44,630
you know 2 million 10 million 50 million
like mass market kind of interest uh you

9788
02:41:44,630 --> 02:41:44,640
like mass market kind of interest uh you
 

9789
02:41:44,640 --> 02:41:46,389
like mass market kind of interest uh you
know have bought it

9790
02:41:46,389 --> 02:41:46,399
know have bought it
 

9791
02:41:46,399 --> 02:41:48,469
know have bought it
that bar is very very high and typically

9792
02:41:48,469 --> 02:41:48,479
that bar is very very high and typically
 

9793
02:41:48,479 --> 02:41:50,389
that bar is very very high and typically
robotics is novel enough and

9794
02:41:50,389 --> 02:41:50,399
robotics is novel enough and
 

9795
02:41:50,399 --> 02:41:52,070
robotics is novel enough and
non-standardized enough to where pushes

9796
02:41:52,070 --> 02:41:52,080
non-standardized enough to where pushes
 

9797
02:41:52,080 --> 02:41:53,750
non-standardized enough to where pushes
on price points so much

9798
02:41:53,750 --> 02:41:53,760
on price points so much
 

9799
02:41:53,760 --> 02:41:55,750
on price points so much
you can easily get out of range where

9800
02:41:55,750 --> 02:41:55,760
you can easily get out of range where
 

9801
02:41:55,760 --> 02:41:57,830
you can easily get out of range where
the capabilities and today's technology

9802
02:41:57,830 --> 02:41:57,840
the capabilities and today's technology
 

9803
02:41:57,840 --> 02:41:59,030
the capabilities and today's technology
or just a function that was picked just

9804
02:41:59,030 --> 02:41:59,040
or just a function that was picked just
 

9805
02:41:59,040 --> 02:42:01,429
or just a function that was picked just
doesn't line up um and so that product

9806
02:42:01,429 --> 02:42:01,439
doesn't line up um and so that product
 

9807
02:42:01,439 --> 02:42:03,269
doesn't line up um and so that product
market fit is very important

9808
02:42:03,269 --> 02:42:03,279
market fit is very important
 

9809
02:42:03,279 --> 02:42:05,670
market fit is very important
so the space of killer apps or

9810
02:42:05,670 --> 02:42:05,680
so the space of killer apps or
 

9811
02:42:05,680 --> 02:42:08,309
so the space of killer apps or
a rather super compelling apps is much

9812
02:42:08,309 --> 02:42:08,319
a rather super compelling apps is much
 

9813
02:42:08,319 --> 02:42:10,790
a rather super compelling apps is much
smaller because it's easy to get outside

9814
02:42:10,790 --> 02:42:10,800
smaller because it's easy to get outside
 

9815
02:42:10,800 --> 02:42:13,110
smaller because it's easy to get outside
the price range yeah and most consumers

9816
02:42:13,110 --> 02:42:13,120
the price range yeah and most consumers
 

9817
02:42:13,120 --> 02:42:15,190
the price range yeah and most consumers
and it's not constant right like yeah

9818
02:42:15,190 --> 02:42:15,200
and it's not constant right like yeah
 

9819
02:42:15,200 --> 02:42:16,309
and it's not constant right like yeah
that's why like we picked off

9820
02:42:16,309 --> 02:42:16,319
that's why like we picked off
 

9821
02:42:16,319 --> 02:42:18,070
that's why like we picked off
entertainment because

9822
02:42:18,070 --> 02:42:18,080
entertainment because
 

9823
02:42:18,080 --> 02:42:20,150
entertainment because
the quality was just so low in physical

9824
02:42:20,150 --> 02:42:20,160
the quality was just so low in physical
 

9825
02:42:20,160 --> 02:42:22,150
the quality was just so low in physical
entertainment that we could we felt we

9826
02:42:22,150 --> 02:42:22,160
entertainment that we could we felt we
 

9827
02:42:22,160 --> 02:42:24,309
entertainment that we could we felt we
could leapfrog that and still create a

9828
02:42:24,309 --> 02:42:24,319
could leapfrog that and still create a
 

9829
02:42:24,319 --> 02:42:25,750
could leapfrog that and still create a
really compelling offering at a price

9830
02:42:25,750 --> 02:42:25,760
really compelling offering at a price
 

9831
02:42:25,760 --> 02:42:27,510
really compelling offering at a price
point that was defensible and and we

9832
02:42:27,510 --> 02:42:27,520
point that was defensible and and we
 

9833
02:42:27,520 --> 02:42:30,230
point that was defensible and and we
like that proved out to be true um

9834
02:42:30,230 --> 02:42:30,240
like that proved out to be true um
 

9835
02:42:30,240 --> 02:42:31,110
like that proved out to be true um
and

9836
02:42:31,110 --> 02:42:31,120
and
 

9837
02:42:31,120 --> 02:42:33,510
and
over time that same opportunity opens up

9838
02:42:33,510 --> 02:42:33,520
over time that same opportunity opens up
 

9839
02:42:33,520 --> 02:42:36,630
over time that same opportunity opens up
in healthcare in home applications and

9840
02:42:36,630 --> 02:42:36,640
in healthcare in home applications and
 

9841
02:42:36,640 --> 02:42:38,070
in healthcare in home applications and
you know commercial

9842
02:42:38,070 --> 02:42:38,080
you know commercial
 

9843
02:42:38,080 --> 02:42:40,070
you know commercial
applications and kind of broader more

9844
02:42:40,070 --> 02:42:40,080

9846
02:42:41,429 --> 02:42:41,439
generalized interface
 

9847
02:42:41,439 --> 02:42:42,150
generalized interface
but

9848
02:42:42,150 --> 02:42:42,160
but
 

9849
02:42:42,160 --> 02:42:43,830
but
there's missing pieces in order for that

9850
02:42:43,830 --> 02:42:43,840
there's missing pieces in order for that
 

9851
02:42:43,840 --> 02:42:45,590
there's missing pieces in order for that
to happen and all of those have to be

9852
02:42:45,590 --> 02:42:45,600
to happen and all of those have to be
 

9853
02:42:45,600 --> 02:42:47,510
to happen and all of those have to be
present um for it to line up and we see

9854
02:42:47,510 --> 02:42:47,520
present um for it to line up and we see
 

9855
02:42:47,520 --> 02:42:49,510
present um for it to line up and we see
these sort of trends in technology where

9856
02:42:49,510 --> 02:42:49,520
these sort of trends in technology where
 

9857
02:42:49,520 --> 02:42:51,670
these sort of trends in technology where
um you know kind of technologies that

9858
02:42:51,670 --> 02:42:51,680
um you know kind of technologies that
 

9859
02:42:51,680 --> 02:42:53,349
um you know kind of technologies that
start in one place

9860
02:42:53,349 --> 02:42:53,359
start in one place
 

9861
02:42:53,359 --> 02:42:55,190
start in one place
evolve and kind of grow to another

9862
02:42:55,190 --> 02:42:55,200
evolve and kind of grow to another
 

9863
02:42:55,200 --> 02:42:57,110
evolve and kind of grow to another

start in
 

9867
02:42:58,080 --> 02:42:59,110
start in
uh

9868
02:42:59,110 --> 02:42:59,120
uh
 

9869
02:42:59,120 --> 02:43:01,349
uh
in space uh or aerospace and then kind

9870
02:43:01,349 --> 02:43:01,359
in space uh or aerospace and then kind
 

9871
02:43:01,359 --> 02:43:03,349
in space uh or aerospace and then kind
of move into the consumer market

9872
02:43:03,349 --> 02:43:03,359
of move into the consumer market
 

9873
02:43:03,359 --> 02:43:04,950
of move into the consumer market
and sometimes it's just a timing thing

9874
02:43:04,950 --> 02:43:04,960
and sometimes it's just a timing thing
 

9875
02:43:04,960 --> 02:43:07,030
and sometimes it's just a timing thing
right where how many

9876
02:43:07,030 --> 02:43:07,040
right where how many
 

9877
02:43:07,040 --> 02:43:09,269
right where how many
stabs at what became the iphone were

9878
02:43:09,269 --> 02:43:09,279
stabs at what became the iphone were
 

9879
02:43:09,279 --> 02:43:11,349
stabs at what became the iphone were
there over the 20 years before that just

9880
02:43:11,349 --> 02:43:11,359
there over the 20 years before that just
 

9881
02:43:11,359 --> 02:43:13,830
there over the 20 years before that just
weren't quite ready in the function um

9882
02:43:13,830 --> 02:43:13,840
weren't quite ready in the function um
 

9883
02:43:13,840 --> 02:43:15,750
weren't quite ready in the function um
relative to the kind of price point and

9884
02:43:15,750 --> 02:43:15,760
relative to the kind of price point and
 

9885
02:43:15,760 --> 02:43:18,230
relative to the kind of price point and
complexity and sometimes it's a small

9886
02:43:18,230 --> 02:43:18,240
complexity and sometimes it's a small
 

9887
02:43:18,240 --> 02:43:19,830
complexity and sometimes it's a small
detail of the implementation that makes

9888
02:43:19,830 --> 02:43:19,840
detail of the implementation that makes
 

9889
02:43:19,840 --> 02:43:22,710
detail of the implementation that makes
all the difference which is uh design uh

9890
02:43:22,710 --> 02:43:22,720
all the difference which is uh design uh
 

9891
02:43:22,720 --> 02:43:24,070
all the difference which is uh design uh
design is so important well something

9892
02:43:24,070 --> 02:43:24,080
design is so important well something
 

9893
02:43:24,080 --> 02:43:26,070
design is so important well something
yeah like the the you the new generation

9894
02:43:26,070 --> 02:43:26,080
yeah like the the you the new generation
 

9895
02:43:26,080 --> 02:43:29,269
yeah like the the you the new generation
ux right yeah it's um and uh and that's

9896
02:43:29,269 --> 02:43:29,279
ux right yeah it's um and uh and that's
 

9897
02:43:29,279 --> 02:43:30,070
ux right yeah it's um and uh and that's
uh

9898
02:43:30,070 --> 02:43:30,080
uh
 

9899
02:43:30,080 --> 02:43:32,070
uh
um it's tough and oftentimes all of them

9900
02:43:32,070 --> 02:43:32,080
um it's tough and oftentimes all of them
 

9901
02:43:32,080 --> 02:43:33,349
um it's tough and oftentimes all of them
have to be there and it has to be like a

9902
02:43:33,349 --> 02:43:33,359
have to be there and it has to be like a
 

9903
02:43:33,359 --> 02:43:35,110
have to be there and it has to be like a
perfect storm and um

9904
02:43:35,110 --> 02:43:35,120
perfect storm and um
 

9905
02:43:35,120 --> 02:43:36,550
perfect storm and um
but yeah history repeats itself in a lot

9906
02:43:36,550 --> 02:43:36,560
but yeah history repeats itself in a lot
 

9907
02:43:36,560 --> 02:43:38,469
but yeah history repeats itself in a lot
of ways uh in a lot of these trends

9908
02:43:38,469 --> 02:43:38,479
of ways uh in a lot of these trends
 

9909
02:43:38,479 --> 02:43:40,309
of ways uh in a lot of these trends
which is pretty fascinating well let me

9910
02:43:40,309 --> 02:43:40,319
which is pretty fascinating well let me
 

9911
02:43:40,319 --> 02:43:41,990
which is pretty fascinating well let me
ask you about the humanoid form what do

9912
02:43:41,990 --> 02:43:42,000
ask you about the humanoid form what do
 

9913
02:43:42,000 --> 02:43:43,590
ask you about the humanoid form what do
you think about the tesla bot and

9914
02:43:43,590 --> 02:43:43,600
you think about the tesla bot and
 

9915
02:43:43,600 --> 02:43:46,230
you think about the tesla bot and
humanoid robotics in general

9916
02:43:46,230 --> 02:43:46,240
humanoid robotics in general
 

9917
02:43:46,240 --> 02:43:49,269
humanoid robotics in general
so obviously to me autonomous driving

9918
02:43:49,269 --> 02:43:49,279
so obviously to me autonomous driving
 

9919
02:43:49,279 --> 02:43:50,870
so obviously to me autonomous driving
waymo and the other companies working in

9920
02:43:50,870 --> 02:43:50,880
waymo and the other companies working in
 

9921
02:43:50,880 --> 02:43:51,910
waymo and the other companies working in
the space

9922
02:43:51,910 --> 02:43:51,920
the space
 

9923
02:43:51,920 --> 02:43:54,950
the space
that seems to be a great place to invest

9924
02:43:54,950 --> 02:43:54,960
that seems to be a great place to invest
 

9925
02:43:54,960 --> 02:43:57,110
that seems to be a great place to invest
in potential revolutionary application

9926
02:43:57,110 --> 02:43:57,120
in potential revolutionary application
 

9927
02:43:57,120 --> 02:44:00,230
in potential revolutionary application
robotics application focused application

9928
02:44:00,230 --> 02:44:00,240
robotics application focused application
 

9929
02:44:00,240 --> 02:44:02,790
robotics application focused application
what's the role of humanoid robotics do

9930
02:44:02,790 --> 02:44:02,800
what's the role of humanoid robotics do
 

9931
02:44:02,800 --> 02:44:03,670
what's the role of humanoid robotics do
you think

9932
02:44:03,670 --> 02:44:03,680
you think
 

9933
02:44:03,680 --> 02:44:06,309
you think
teslabot is ridiculous do you think it's

9934
02:44:06,309 --> 02:44:06,319
teslabot is ridiculous do you think it's
 

9935
02:44:06,319 --> 02:44:08,469
teslabot is ridiculous do you think it's
super promising do you think it's

9936
02:44:08,469 --> 02:44:08,479
super promising do you think it's
 

9937
02:44:08,479 --> 02:44:10,710
super promising do you think it's
interesting full of mystery nobody knows

9938
02:44:10,710 --> 02:44:10,720
interesting full of mystery nobody knows
 

9939
02:44:10,720 --> 02:44:12,790
interesting full of mystery nobody knows
what do you think about this thing yeah

9940
02:44:12,790 --> 02:44:12,800
what do you think about this thing yeah
 

9941
02:44:12,800 --> 02:44:15,510
what do you think about this thing yeah
i think today humanoid form robotics is

9942
02:44:15,510 --> 02:44:15,520
i think today humanoid form robotics is
 

9943
02:44:15,520 --> 02:44:17,429
i think today humanoid form robotics is
research there's very few situations

9944
02:44:17,429 --> 02:44:17,439
research there's very few situations
 

9945
02:44:17,439 --> 02:44:18,870
research there's very few situations
where you actually need a humanoid form

9946
02:44:18,870 --> 02:44:18,880
where you actually need a humanoid form
 

9947
02:44:18,880 --> 02:44:20,950
where you actually need a humanoid form
to solve a problem uh if you think about

9948
02:44:20,950 --> 02:44:20,960
to solve a problem uh if you think about
 

9949
02:44:20,960 --> 02:44:23,030
to solve a problem uh if you think about
it right like wheels are more efficient

9950
02:44:23,030 --> 02:44:23,040
it right like wheels are more efficient
 

9951
02:44:23,040 --> 02:44:24,710
it right like wheels are more efficient
than legs there's

9952
02:44:24,710 --> 02:44:24,720
than legs there's
 

9953
02:44:24,720 --> 02:44:27,190
than legs there's
joints and degrees of freedom beyond a

9954
02:44:27,190 --> 02:44:27,200
joints and degrees of freedom beyond a
 

9955
02:44:27,200 --> 02:44:28,309
joints and degrees of freedom beyond a
certain point just add a lot of

9956
02:44:28,309 --> 02:44:28,319
certain point just add a lot of
 

9957
02:44:28,319 --> 02:44:30,389
certain point just add a lot of
complexity and cost right so if you're

9958
02:44:30,389 --> 02:44:30,399
complexity and cost right so if you're
 

9959
02:44:30,399 --> 02:44:32,070
complexity and cost right so if you're
doing a humanoid robot oftentimes it's

9960
02:44:32,070 --> 02:44:32,080
doing a humanoid robot oftentimes it's
 

9961
02:44:32,080 --> 02:44:33,429
doing a humanoid robot oftentimes it's
in the pursuit of a humanoid robot not

9962
02:44:33,429 --> 02:44:33,439
in the pursuit of a humanoid robot not
 

9963
02:44:33,439 --> 02:44:34,790
in the pursuit of a humanoid robot not
in a pursuit of an application for the

9964
02:44:34,790 --> 02:44:34,800
in a pursuit of an application for the
 

9965
02:44:34,800 --> 02:44:35,830
in a pursuit of an application for the
time being

9966
02:44:35,830 --> 02:44:35,840
time being
 

9967
02:44:35,840 --> 02:44:36,790
time being
um

9968
02:44:36,790 --> 02:44:36,800
um
 

9969
02:44:36,800 --> 02:44:37,990
um
especially when you have like kind of

9970
02:44:37,990 --> 02:44:38,000
especially when you have like kind of
 

9971
02:44:38,000 --> 02:44:39,750
especially when you have like kind of
the gaps and interface and you know kind

9972
02:44:39,750 --> 02:44:39,760
the gaps and interface and you know kind
 

9973
02:44:39,760 --> 02:44:42,150
the gaps and interface and you know kind
of ai that we kind of talk about today

9974
02:44:42,150 --> 02:44:42,160
of ai that we kind of talk about today
 

9975
02:44:42,160 --> 02:44:44,150
of ai that we kind of talk about today
so anything you want does i'm interested

9976
02:44:44,150 --> 02:44:44,160
so anything you want does i'm interested
 

9977
02:44:44,160 --> 02:44:45,910
so anything you want does i'm interested
in following so there's there's an

9978
02:44:45,910 --> 02:44:45,920
in following so there's there's an
 

9979
02:44:45,920 --> 02:44:47,110
in following so there's there's an
element of that world no matter how

9980
02:44:47,110 --> 02:44:47,120
element of that world no matter how
 

9981
02:44:47,120 --> 02:44:49,030
element of that world no matter how
crazy how crazy it is i just like you

9982
02:44:49,030 --> 02:44:49,040
crazy how crazy it is i just like you
 

9983
02:44:49,040 --> 02:44:50,230
crazy how crazy it is i just like you
know i'll pay attention i'm curious to

9984
02:44:50,230 --> 02:44:50,240
know i'll pay attention i'm curious to
 

9985
02:44:50,240 --> 02:44:51,590
know i'll pay attention i'm curious to
see what comes out of it so it's like

9986
02:44:51,590 --> 02:44:51,600
see what comes out of it so it's like
 

9987
02:44:51,600 --> 02:44:54,070
see what comes out of it so it's like
you can't you can't ever you know ignore

9988
02:44:54,070 --> 02:44:54,080
you can't you can't ever you know ignore
 

9989
02:44:54,080 --> 02:44:55,990
you can't you can't ever you know ignore
it but you know it's uh definitely far

9990
02:44:55,990 --> 02:44:56,000
it but you know it's uh definitely far
 

9991
02:44:56,000 --> 02:44:57,349
it but you know it's uh definitely far
afield from their kind of core business

9992
02:44:57,349 --> 02:44:57,359
afield from their kind of core business
 

9993
02:44:57,359 --> 02:45:00,469
afield from their kind of core business
um uh obviously and um what was

9994
02:45:00,469 --> 02:45:00,479
um uh obviously and um what was
 

9995
02:45:00,479 --> 02:45:02,790
um uh obviously and um what was
interesting to me is i've

9996
02:45:02,790 --> 02:45:02,800
interesting to me is i've
 

9997
02:45:02,800 --> 02:45:05,110
interesting to me is i've
i've disagreed with you know elon a lot

9998
02:45:05,110 --> 02:45:05,120
i've disagreed with you know elon a lot
 

9999
02:45:05,120 --> 02:45:07,030
i've disagreed with you know elon a lot
about this

10000
02:45:07,030 --> 02:45:07,040
about this
 

10001
02:45:07,040 --> 02:45:07,990
about this
is

10002
02:45:07,990 --> 02:45:08,000
is
 

10003
02:45:08,000 --> 02:45:09,990
is
to me the in the compelling aspect of

10004
02:45:09,990 --> 02:45:10,000
to me the in the compelling aspect of
 

10005
02:45:10,000 --> 02:45:11,910
to me the in the compelling aspect of
the humanoid form

10006
02:45:11,910 --> 02:45:11,920
the humanoid form
 

10007
02:45:11,920 --> 02:45:14,469
the humanoid form
and a lot of kind of robots cosmo for

10008
02:45:14,469 --> 02:45:14,479
and a lot of kind of robots cosmo for
 

10009
02:45:14,479 --> 02:45:15,510
and a lot of kind of robots cosmo for
example

10010
02:45:15,510 --> 02:45:15,520
example
 

10011
02:45:15,520 --> 02:45:17,750
example
is a human robot interaction

10012
02:45:17,750 --> 02:45:17,760
is a human robot interaction
 

10013
02:45:17,760 --> 02:45:20,150
is a human robot interaction
part

10014
02:45:20,150 --> 02:45:20,160

 

10015
02:45:20,160 --> 02:45:21,030

from

10016
02:45:21,030 --> 02:45:21,040
from
 

10017
02:45:21,040 --> 02:45:23,750
from
elon musk's perspective the tesla bot

10018
02:45:23,750 --> 02:45:23,760
elon musk's perspective the tesla bot
 

10019
02:45:23,760 --> 02:45:25,670
elon musk's perspective the tesla bot
has nothing to do with the human

10020
02:45:25,670 --> 02:45:25,680
has nothing to do with the human
 

10021
02:45:25,680 --> 02:45:27,269
has nothing to do with the human
it's a form

10022
02:45:27,269 --> 02:45:27,279
it's a form
 

10023
02:45:27,279 --> 02:45:28,950
it's a form
that's effective for the factory because

10024
02:45:28,950 --> 02:45:28,960
that's effective for the factory because
 

10025
02:45:28,960 --> 02:45:31,510
that's effective for the factory because
the factory is designed for humans

10026
02:45:31,510 --> 02:45:31,520
the factory is designed for humans
 

10027
02:45:31,520 --> 02:45:33,670
the factory is designed for humans
but to me the reason you might want to

10028
02:45:33,670 --> 02:45:33,680
but to me the reason you might want to
 

10029
02:45:33,680 --> 02:45:36,630
but to me the reason you might want to
argue for the humanoid form is because

10030
02:45:36,630 --> 02:45:36,640
argue for the humanoid form is because
 

10031
02:45:36,640 --> 02:45:38,630
argue for the humanoid form is because
you know at a party

10032
02:45:38,630 --> 02:45:38,640
you know at a party
 

10033
02:45:38,640 --> 02:45:40,309
you know at a party
yeah it's a nice way to fit into the

10034
02:45:40,309 --> 02:45:40,319
yeah it's a nice way to fit into the
 

10035
02:45:40,319 --> 02:45:43,190
yeah it's a nice way to fit into the
party the humanoid form has a compelling

10036
02:45:43,190 --> 02:45:43,200
party the humanoid form has a compelling
 

10037
02:45:43,200 --> 02:45:44,950
party the humanoid form has a compelling
notion to it in the same way that cosmo

10038
02:45:44,950 --> 02:45:44,960
notion to it in the same way that cosmo
 

10039
02:45:44,960 --> 02:45:46,070
notion to it in the same way that cosmo
is compelling

10040
02:45:46,070 --> 02:45:46,080
is compelling
 

10041
02:45:46,080 --> 02:45:48,550
is compelling
i you i would argue if we were

10042
02:45:48,550 --> 02:45:48,560
i you i would argue if we were
 

10043
02:45:48,560 --> 02:45:50,150
i you i would argue if we were
arguing about this

10044
02:45:50,150 --> 02:45:50,160
arguing about this
 

10045
02:45:50,160 --> 02:45:53,750
arguing about this
that it's cheaper to build a cosmo like

10046
02:45:53,750 --> 02:45:53,760
that it's cheaper to build a cosmo like
 

10047
02:45:53,760 --> 02:45:56,230
that it's cheaper to build a cosmo like
that form but if you wanted to make an

10048
02:45:56,230 --> 02:45:56,240
that form but if you wanted to make an
 

10049
02:45:56,240 --> 02:45:58,070
that form but if you wanted to make an
argument which i have with jim keller

10050
02:45:58,070 --> 02:45:58,080
argument which i have with jim keller
 

10051
02:45:58,080 --> 02:45:59,429
argument which i have with jim keller
about you know you could actually make a

10052
02:45:59,429 --> 02:45:59,439
about you know you could actually make a
 

10053
02:45:59,439 --> 02:46:01,429
about you know you could actually make a
humanoid robot for pretty cheap

10054
02:46:01,429 --> 02:46:01,439
humanoid robot for pretty cheap
 

10055
02:46:01,439 --> 02:46:02,950
humanoid robot for pretty cheap
it's possible

10056
02:46:02,950 --> 02:46:02,960
it's possible
 

10057
02:46:02,960 --> 02:46:05,670
it's possible
and then the question is all right if if

10058
02:46:05,670 --> 02:46:05,680
and then the question is all right if if
 

10059
02:46:05,680 --> 02:46:07,750
and then the question is all right if if
you're using an application where it can

10060
02:46:07,750 --> 02:46:07,760
you're using an application where it can
 

10061
02:46:07,760 --> 02:46:09,590
you're using an application where it can
be flawed

10062
02:46:09,590 --> 02:46:09,600
be flawed
 

10063
02:46:09,600 --> 02:46:11,910
be flawed
it could it can have a personality and

10064
02:46:11,910 --> 02:46:11,920
it could it can have a personality and
 

10065
02:46:11,920 --> 02:46:14,150
it could it can have a personality and
be flawed in the same way that cosmo is

10066
02:46:14,150 --> 02:46:14,160
be flawed in the same way that cosmo is
 

10067
02:46:14,160 --> 02:46:15,510
be flawed in the same way that cosmo is
that maybe it's interesting for

10068
02:46:15,510 --> 02:46:15,520
that maybe it's interesting for
 

10069
02:46:15,520 --> 02:46:17,670
that maybe it's interesting for
integration to human society

10070
02:46:17,670 --> 02:46:17,680
integration to human society
 

10071
02:46:17,680 --> 02:46:19,190
integration to human society
that's that's to me is an interesting

10072
02:46:19,190 --> 02:46:19,200
that's that's to me is an interesting
 

10073
02:46:19,200 --> 02:46:21,269
that's that's to me is an interesting
application of a humanoid form because

10074
02:46:21,269 --> 02:46:21,279
application of a humanoid form because
 

10075
02:46:21,279 --> 02:46:23,110
application of a humanoid form because
humans are drawn like i mentioned to you

10076
02:46:23,110 --> 02:46:23,120
humans are drawn like i mentioned to you
 

10077
02:46:23,120 --> 02:46:25,190
humans are drawn like i mentioned to you
legged robots we're drawn to legs and

10078
02:46:25,190 --> 02:46:25,200
legged robots we're drawn to legs and
 

10079
02:46:25,200 --> 02:46:27,429
legged robots we're drawn to legs and
limbs and body language and all that

10080
02:46:27,429 --> 02:46:27,439
limbs and body language and all that
 

10081
02:46:27,439 --> 02:46:28,469
limbs and body language and all that
kind of stuff

10082
02:46:28,469 --> 02:46:28,479
kind of stuff
 

10083
02:46:28,479 --> 02:46:30,389
kind of stuff
and even a face even if you don't have

10084
02:46:30,389 --> 02:46:30,399
and even a face even if you don't have
 

10085
02:46:30,399 --> 02:46:31,830
and even a face even if you don't have
the facial features which you might not

10086
02:46:31,830 --> 02:46:31,840
the facial features which you might not
 

10087
02:46:31,840 --> 02:46:33,429
the facial features which you might not
want to have for the

10088
02:46:33,429 --> 02:46:33,439
want to have for the
 

10089
02:46:33,439 --> 02:46:35,110
want to have for the
uh

10090
02:46:35,110 --> 02:46:35,120
uh
 

10091
02:46:35,120 --> 02:46:36,870
uh
to reduce the creepiness factor all that

10092
02:46:36,870 --> 02:46:36,880
to reduce the creepiness factor all that
 

10093
02:46:36,880 --> 02:46:39,110
to reduce the creepiness factor all that
kind of stuff but yeah that to me the

10094
02:46:39,110 --> 02:46:39,120
kind of stuff but yeah that to me the
 

10095
02:46:39,120 --> 02:46:40,870
kind of stuff but yeah that to me the
humanoid form is compelling but in terms

10096
02:46:40,870 --> 02:46:40,880
humanoid form is compelling but in terms
 

10097
02:46:40,880 --> 02:46:42,309
humanoid form is compelling but in terms
of

10098
02:46:42,309 --> 02:46:42,319
of
 

10099
02:46:42,319 --> 02:46:44,309
of
that being the right form for the

10100
02:46:44,309 --> 02:46:44,319
that being the right form for the
 

10101
02:46:44,319 --> 02:46:46,790
that being the right form for the
factory environment i'm not so sure yeah

10102
02:46:46,790 --> 02:46:46,800
factory environment i'm not so sure yeah
 

10103
02:46:46,800 --> 02:46:48,389
factory environment i'm not so sure yeah
for the factory environment like right

10104
02:46:48,389 --> 02:46:48,399
for the factory environment like right
 

10105
02:46:48,399 --> 02:46:50,309
for the factory environment like right
off the bat um what are you optimizing

10106
02:46:50,309 --> 02:46:50,319
off the bat um what are you optimizing
 

10107
02:46:50,319 --> 02:46:52,389
off the bat um what are you optimizing
for is it strength is it mobility is it

10108
02:46:52,389 --> 02:46:52,399
for is it strength is it mobility is it
 

10109
02:46:52,399 --> 02:46:53,910
for is it strength is it mobility is it
versatility right like that changes

10110
02:46:53,910 --> 02:46:53,920
versatility right like that changes
 

10111
02:46:53,920 --> 02:46:55,110
versatility right like that changes
completely the look and feel of the

10112
02:46:55,110 --> 02:46:55,120
completely the look and feel of the
 

10113
02:46:55,120 --> 02:46:57,830
completely the look and feel of the
robot that you create you know and uh

10114
02:46:57,830 --> 02:46:57,840
robot that you create you know and uh
 

10115
02:46:57,840 --> 02:47:00,469
robot that you create you know and uh
almost certainly the human form is over

10116
02:47:00,469 --> 02:47:00,479
almost certainly the human form is over
 

10117
02:47:00,479 --> 02:47:02,389
almost certainly the human form is over
designed for some asp dimensions and

10118
02:47:02,389 --> 02:47:02,399
designed for some asp dimensions and
 

10119
02:47:02,399 --> 02:47:03,830
designed for some asp dimensions and
constrained for some dimensions and so

10120
02:47:03,830 --> 02:47:03,840
constrained for some dimensions and so
 

10121
02:47:03,840 --> 02:47:06,389
constrained for some dimensions and so
like like what are you grasping is it

10122
02:47:06,389 --> 02:47:06,399
like like what are you grasping is it
 

10123
02:47:06,399 --> 02:47:07,750
like like what are you grasping is it
big is it little right so you would

10124
02:47:07,750 --> 02:47:07,760
big is it little right so you would
 

10125
02:47:07,760 --> 02:47:10,070
big is it little right so you would
customize it and make it um

10126
02:47:10,070 --> 02:47:10,080
customize it and make it um
 

10127
02:47:10,080 --> 02:47:12,710
customize it and make it um
customizable um for the different needs

10128
02:47:12,710 --> 02:47:12,720
customizable um for the different needs
 

10129
02:47:12,720 --> 02:47:14,550
customizable um for the different needs
if that was the optimization right and

10130
02:47:14,550 --> 02:47:14,560
if that was the optimization right and
 

10131
02:47:14,560 --> 02:47:17,030
if that was the optimization right and
then you know for the other one uh

10132
02:47:17,030 --> 02:47:17,040
then you know for the other one uh
 

10133
02:47:17,040 --> 02:47:18,630
then you know for the other one uh
i could totally be wrong you know i

10134
02:47:18,630 --> 02:47:18,640
i could totally be wrong you know i
 

10135
02:47:18,640 --> 02:47:20,630
i could totally be wrong you know i
still feel that the closer you try to

10136
02:47:20,630 --> 02:47:20,640
still feel that the closer you try to
 

10137
02:47:20,640 --> 02:47:23,110
still feel that the closer you try to
get to a human the more you're subject

10138
02:47:23,110 --> 02:47:23,120
get to a human the more you're subject
 

10139
02:47:23,120 --> 02:47:25,670
get to a human the more you're subject
to the um biases of what a human should

10140
02:47:25,670 --> 02:47:25,680
to the um biases of what a human should
 

10141
02:47:25,680 --> 02:47:29,429
to the um biases of what a human should
be and you lose flexibility to shift

10142
02:47:29,429 --> 02:47:29,439
be and you lose flexibility to shift
 

10143
02:47:29,439 --> 02:47:31,429
be and you lose flexibility to shift
away from your weaknesses uh and towards

10144
02:47:31,429 --> 02:47:31,439
away from your weaknesses uh and towards
 

10145
02:47:31,439 --> 02:47:32,830
away from your weaknesses uh and towards
your strengths

10146
02:47:32,830 --> 02:47:32,840
your strengths
 

10147
02:47:32,840 --> 02:47:36,469
your strengths
and that changes over time but there's

10148
02:47:36,469 --> 02:47:36,479
and that changes over time but there's
 

10149
02:47:36,479 --> 02:47:38,150
and that changes over time but there's
ways to make

10150
02:47:38,150 --> 02:47:38,160
ways to make
 

10151
02:47:38,160 --> 02:47:39,269
ways to make
really

10152
02:47:39,269 --> 02:47:39,279
really
 

10153
02:47:39,279 --> 02:47:40,870
really
approachable

02:47:44,150 --> 02:47:44,160
and natural interfaces for
 

10157
02:47:44,160 --> 02:47:47,429
and natural interfaces for
robotic kind of characters and

robotic kind of characters and
 

10159
02:47:47,439 --> 02:47:49,510
robotic kind of characters and
you know and uh

10160
02:47:49,510 --> 02:47:49,520
you know and uh
 

10161
02:47:49,520 --> 02:47:50,950
you know and uh
you know and kind of deployments in

10162
02:47:50,950 --> 02:47:50,960
you know and kind of deployments in
 

10163
02:47:50,960 --> 02:47:52,550
you know and kind of deployments in
these applications

10164
02:47:52,550 --> 02:47:52,560
these applications
 

10165
02:47:52,560 --> 02:47:53,670
these applications
that

10166
02:47:53,670 --> 02:47:53,680
that
 

10167
02:47:53,680 --> 02:47:56,230
that
do not at all look like a human directly

10168
02:47:56,230 --> 02:47:56,240
do not at all look like a human directly
 

10169
02:47:56,240 --> 02:47:57,910
do not at all look like a human directly
but that actually creates way more

10170
02:47:57,910 --> 02:47:57,920
but that actually creates way more
 

10171
02:47:57,920 --> 02:48:00,790
but that actually creates way more
flexibility and capability and role and

10172
02:48:00,790 --> 02:48:00,800
flexibility and capability and role and
 

10173
02:48:00,800 --> 02:48:02,309
flexibility and capability and role and
forgiveness and interface and everything

10174
02:48:02,309 --> 02:48:02,319
forgiveness and interface and everything
 

10175
02:48:02,319 --> 02:48:04,790
forgiveness and interface and everything
else yeah it's interesting but i'm still

10176
02:48:04,790 --> 02:48:04,800
else yeah it's interesting but i'm still
 

10177
02:48:04,800 --> 02:48:08,230
else yeah it's interesting but i'm still
confused by the magic i see in legged

10178
02:48:08,230 --> 02:48:08,240
confused by the magic i see in legged
 

10179
02:48:08,240 --> 02:48:10,630
confused by the magic i see in legged
robots yeah so there is a magic so i i'm

10180
02:48:10,630 --> 02:48:10,640
robots yeah so there is a magic so i i'm
 

10181
02:48:10,640 --> 02:48:11,590
robots yeah so there is a magic so i i'm
uh

10182
02:48:11,590 --> 02:48:11,600
uh
 

10183
02:48:11,600 --> 02:48:14,870
uh
absolutely amazed at it from a

10184
02:48:14,870 --> 02:48:14,880
absolutely amazed at it from a
 

10185
02:48:14,880 --> 02:48:16,870
absolutely amazed at it from a
technical curiosity standpoint and like

10186
02:48:16,870 --> 02:48:16,880
technical curiosity standpoint and like
 

10187
02:48:16,880 --> 02:48:17,670
technical curiosity standpoint and like
the

10188
02:48:17,670 --> 02:48:17,680
the
 

10189
02:48:17,680 --> 02:48:19,349
the
the magic that like the boston dynamics

10190
02:48:19,349 --> 02:48:19,359
the magic that like the boston dynamics
 

10191
02:48:19,359 --> 02:48:21,590
the magic that like the boston dynamics
team can do from uh you know like from

10192
02:48:21,590 --> 02:48:21,600
team can do from uh you know like from
 

10193
02:48:21,600 --> 02:48:24,550
team can do from uh you know like from
walking and jumping and so forth now

10194
02:48:24,550 --> 02:48:24,560
walking and jumping and so forth now
 

10195
02:48:24,560 --> 02:48:26,630
walking and jumping and so forth now
like there's been a long journey to try

10196
02:48:26,630 --> 02:48:26,640
like there's been a long journey to try
 

10197
02:48:26,640 --> 02:48:28,150
like there's been a long journey to try
to find an application for that sort of

10198
02:48:28,150 --> 02:48:28,160
to find an application for that sort of
 

10199
02:48:28,160 --> 02:48:30,790
to find an application for that sort of
um technology but wow that's incredible

10200
02:48:30,790 --> 02:48:30,800
um technology but wow that's incredible
 

10201
02:48:30,800 --> 02:48:32,710
um technology but wow that's incredible
technology right yes so

10202
02:48:32,710 --> 02:48:32,720
technology right yes so
 

10203
02:48:32,720 --> 02:48:34,230
technology right yes so
then you kind of go towards okay are you

10204
02:48:34,230 --> 02:48:34,240
then you kind of go towards okay are you
 

10205
02:48:34,240 --> 02:48:36,389
then you kind of go towards okay are you
working back from a goal of what you're

10206
02:48:36,389 --> 02:48:36,399
working back from a goal of what you're
 

10207
02:48:36,399 --> 02:48:37,510
working back from a goal of what you're
trying to solve or are you working

10208
02:48:37,510 --> 02:48:37,520
trying to solve or are you working
 

10209
02:48:37,520 --> 02:48:38,710
trying to solve or are you working
forward from a technology and then

10210
02:48:38,710 --> 02:48:38,720
forward from a technology and then
 

10211
02:48:38,720 --> 02:48:39,910
forward from a technology and then
looking for a solution and i think

10212
02:48:39,910 --> 02:48:39,920
looking for a solution and i think
 

10213
02:48:39,920 --> 02:48:42,070
looking for a solution and i think
that's where um it's a kind of a

10214
02:48:42,070 --> 02:48:42,080
that's where um it's a kind of a
 

10215
02:48:42,080 --> 02:48:43,990
that's where um it's a kind of a
bi-directional search oftentimes but you

10216
02:48:43,990 --> 02:48:44,000
bi-directional search oftentimes but you
 

10217
02:48:44,000 --> 02:48:45,750
bi-directional search oftentimes but you
gotta you the two have to meet and that

10218
02:48:45,750 --> 02:48:45,760
gotta you the two have to meet and that
 

10219
02:48:45,760 --> 02:48:46,790
gotta you the two have to meet and that
that's where

10220
02:48:46,790 --> 02:48:46,800
that's where
 

10221
02:48:46,800 --> 02:48:49,110
that's where
humanoid robots is kind of close to that

10222
02:48:49,110 --> 02:48:49,120
humanoid robots is kind of close to that
 

10223
02:48:49,120 --> 02:48:51,269
humanoid robots is kind of close to that
and that like it is a decision about a

10224
02:48:51,269 --> 02:48:51,279
and that like it is a decision about a
 

10225
02:48:51,279 --> 02:48:52,870
and that like it is a decision about a
form factor and a

10226
02:48:52,870 --> 02:48:52,880
form factor and a
 

10227
02:48:52,880 --> 02:48:55,510
form factor and a
technology that it forces um

10228
02:48:55,510 --> 02:48:55,520
technology that it forces um
 

10229
02:48:55,520 --> 02:48:56,389
technology that it forces um
that

10230
02:48:56,389 --> 02:48:56,399
that
 

10231
02:48:56,399 --> 02:48:57,750
that
doesn't have a clear justification on

10232
02:48:57,750 --> 02:48:57,760
doesn't have a clear justification on
 

10233
02:48:57,760 --> 02:48:59,349
doesn't have a clear justification on
why that's the killer app or you know

10234
02:48:59,349 --> 02:48:59,359
why that's the killer app or you know
 

10235
02:48:59,359 --> 02:49:00,870
why that's the killer app or you know
from the other end but i think the core

10236
02:49:00,870 --> 02:49:00,880
from the other end but i think the core
 

10237
02:49:00,880 --> 02:49:03,110
from the other end but i think the core
fascinating idea with the tesla bot is

10238
02:49:03,110 --> 02:49:03,120
fascinating idea with the tesla bot is
 

10239
02:49:03,120 --> 02:49:05,670
fascinating idea with the tesla bot is
the one that's carried by waymo as well

10240
02:49:05,670 --> 02:49:05,680
the one that's carried by waymo as well
 

10241
02:49:05,680 --> 02:49:07,030
the one that's carried by waymo as well
is when you're solving the general

10242
02:49:07,030 --> 02:49:07,040
is when you're solving the general
 

10243
02:49:07,040 --> 02:49:08,710
is when you're solving the general
robotics problem

10244
02:49:08,710 --> 02:49:08,720
robotics problem
 

10245
02:49:08,720 --> 02:49:11,349
robotics problem
of perception control where this there's

10246
02:49:11,349 --> 02:49:11,359
of perception control where this there's
 

10247
02:49:11,359 --> 02:49:13,910
of perception control where this there's
the very clear applications of driving

10248
02:49:13,910 --> 02:49:13,920
the very clear applications of driving
 

10249
02:49:13,920 --> 02:49:14,950
the very clear applications of driving
it's

10250
02:49:14,950 --> 02:49:14,960
it's
 

10251
02:49:14,960 --> 02:49:16,870
it's
as you get better and better at it when

10252
02:49:16,870 --> 02:49:16,880
as you get better and better at it when
 

10253
02:49:16,880 --> 02:49:19,750
as you get better and better at it when
you have like way more driver yeah

10254
02:49:19,750 --> 02:49:19,760
you have like way more driver yeah
 

10255
02:49:19,760 --> 02:49:21,910
you have like way more driver yeah
the whole world starts to kind of start

10256
02:49:21,910 --> 02:49:21,920
the whole world starts to kind of start
 

10257
02:49:21,920 --> 02:49:23,830
the whole world starts to kind of start
to look like a robotics problem so it's

10258
02:49:23,830 --> 02:49:23,840
to look like a robotics problem so it's
 

10259
02:49:23,840 --> 02:49:25,750
to look like a robotics problem so it's
very interesting for now detection

10260
02:49:25,750 --> 02:49:25,760
very interesting for now detection
 

10261
02:49:25,760 --> 02:49:27,030
very interesting for now detection

02:49:31,110 --> 02:49:31,120
planning like it's carrie yeah so
 

10267
02:49:31,120 --> 02:49:33,750
planning like it's carrie yeah so
there's no reason i mean i'm not i'm not

02:49:36,070 --> 02:49:36,080
speaking for way more here but
 

10271
02:49:36,080 --> 02:49:36,950
speaking for way more here but
you know

10272
02:49:36,950 --> 02:49:36,960
you know
 

10273
02:49:36,960 --> 02:49:38,150
you know
um

transformer like this thing couldn't you

10280
02:49:43,429 --> 02:49:43,439
transformer like this thing couldn't you
 

10281
02:49:43,439 --> 02:49:46,389
transformer like this thing couldn't you
know uh take the goods up an elevator

10282
02:49:46,389 --> 02:49:46,399
know uh take the goods up an elevator
 

10283
02:49:46,399 --> 02:49:50,070
know uh take the goods up an elevator
you know yeah like that like uh slowly

10284
02:49:50,070 --> 02:49:50,080
you know yeah like that like uh slowly
 

10285
02:49:50,080 --> 02:49:53,349
you know yeah like that like uh slowly
expand yeah what it means to move goods

10286
02:49:53,349 --> 02:49:53,359
expand yeah what it means to move goods
 

10287
02:49:53,359 --> 02:49:54,630
expand yeah what it means to move goods
and

10288
02:49:54,630 --> 02:49:54,640
and
 

10289
02:49:54,640 --> 02:49:57,349
and
expand more and more of the world uh

10290
02:49:57,349 --> 02:49:57,359
expand more and more of the world uh
 

10291
02:49:57,359 --> 02:49:59,269
expand more and more of the world uh
into a robotics problem well that's

10292
02:49:59,269 --> 02:49:59,279
into a robotics problem well that's
 

10293
02:49:59,279 --> 02:50:01,269
into a robotics problem well that's
right and you start to like think of it

10294
02:50:01,269 --> 02:50:01,279
right and you start to like think of it
 

10295
02:50:01,279 --> 02:50:03,269
right and you start to like think of it
as an end robotics problem from like

10296
02:50:03,269 --> 02:50:03,279
as an end robotics problem from like
 

10297
02:50:03,279 --> 02:50:04,870
as an end robotics problem from like
loading from you know from everything

yes and even like the truck itself um

10300
02:50:07,750 --> 02:50:07,760
yes and even like the truck itself um
 

10301
02:50:07,760 --> 02:50:09,590
yes and even like the truck itself um
you know today's generation is

10302
02:50:09,590 --> 02:50:09,600
you know today's generation is
 

10303
02:50:09,600 --> 02:50:11,190
you know today's generation is
integrating into

integrating into
 

10305
02:50:11,200 --> 02:50:12,630
integrating into
today's understanding of what a vehicle

today's understanding of what a vehicle
 

10307
02:50:12,640 --> 02:50:15,830
today's understanding of what a vehicle
is right the pacifica jaguar uh the

10308
02:50:15,830 --> 02:50:15,840
is right the pacifica jaguar uh the
 

10309

freightliners from daimler there's

10310
02:50:17,750 --> 02:50:17,760
freightliners from daimler there's
 

10311
02:50:17,760 --> 02:50:20,950
freightliners from daimler there's
nothing that stops these us from like

10312
02:50:20,950 --> 02:50:20,960
nothing that stops these us from like
 

10313
02:50:20,960 --> 02:50:23,030
nothing that stops these us from like
down the road after like starting to get

10314
02:50:23,030 --> 02:50:23,040
down the road after like starting to get
 

10315
02:50:23,040 --> 02:50:24,710
down the road after like starting to get
to scale to like

10316
02:50:24,710 --> 02:50:24,720
to scale to like
 

10317

expand these partnerships to really

10318
02:50:26,070 --> 02:50:26,080
expand these partnerships to really
 

10319
02:50:26,080 --> 02:50:28,389
expand these partnerships to really
rethink what would the next generation

10320
02:50:28,389 --> 02:50:28,399
rethink what would the next generation
 

10321
02:50:28,399 --> 02:50:30,870
rethink what would the next generation
of a truck look like um that is actually

10322
02:50:30,870 --> 02:50:30,880
of a truck look like um that is actually
 

10323
02:50:30,880 --> 02:50:33,110
of a truck look like um that is actually
optimized for autonomy not for today's

10324
02:50:33,110 --> 02:50:33,120
optimized for autonomy not for today's
 

10325
02:50:33,120 --> 02:50:33,990

um

10328
02:50:34,830 --> 02:50:34,840
um
 

10329
02:50:34,840 --> 02:50:36,870
um
and maybe that means a very different

10330
02:50:36,870 --> 02:50:36,880
and maybe that means a very different
 

10331
02:50:36,880 --> 02:50:38,469
and maybe that means a very different
type of trailer maybe that like there's

10332
02:50:38,469 --> 02:50:38,479
type of trailer maybe that like there's
 

10333
02:50:38,479 --> 02:50:39,910
type of trailer maybe that like there's
a lot of things you could rethink on

10334
02:50:39,910 --> 02:50:39,920
a lot of things you could rethink on
 

10335
02:50:39,920 --> 02:50:41,750
a lot of things you could rethink on
that front which is on its own very very

10336
02:50:41,750 --> 02:50:41,760
that front which is on its own very very
 

10337
02:50:41,760 --> 02:50:42,630
that front which is on its own very very
exciting

10338
02:50:42,630 --> 02:50:42,640
exciting
 

10339
02:50:42,640 --> 02:50:44,710
exciting
let me ask you like i said you went to

10340
02:50:44,710 --> 02:50:44,720
let me ask you like i said you went to
 

10341
02:50:44,720 --> 02:50:47,349
let me ask you like i said you went to
the mecca of robotics which is cmu

10342
02:50:47,349 --> 02:50:47,359
the mecca of robotics which is cmu
 

10343

carnegie mellon university you got a phd

10344
02:50:49,590 --> 02:50:49,600
carnegie mellon university you got a phd
 

10345
02:50:49,600 --> 02:50:50,710
carnegie mellon university you got a phd
there

10346
02:50:50,710 --> 02:50:50,720
there
 

10347
02:50:50,720 --> 02:50:53,349
there
so maybe by way of advice

10348
02:50:53,349 --> 02:50:53,359
so maybe by way of advice
 

10349
02:50:53,359 --> 02:50:56,070
so maybe by way of advice
and maybe by way of

10350
02:50:56,070 --> 02:50:56,080
and maybe by way of
 

10351
02:50:56,080 --> 02:50:58,630
and maybe by way of
story and memories what does it take to

10352
02:50:58,630 --> 02:50:58,640
story and memories what does it take to
 

10353
02:50:58,640 --> 02:51:00,309
story and memories what does it take to
get a phd

10354
02:51:00,309 --> 02:51:00,319
get a phd
 

10355
02:51:00,319 --> 02:51:03,590
get a phd
in robotics at cmu

10356
02:51:03,590 --> 02:51:03,600
in robotics at cmu
 

10357
02:51:03,600 --> 02:51:05,269
in robotics at cmu
and maybe

10358
02:51:05,269 --> 02:51:05,279
and maybe
 

10359
02:51:05,279 --> 02:51:07,269
and maybe
you can throw in there some advice for

10360
02:51:07,269 --> 02:51:07,279
you can throw in there some advice for
 

10361
02:51:07,279 --> 02:51:09,910
you can throw in there some advice for
people who are thinking about

10362
02:51:09,910 --> 02:51:09,920
people who are thinking about
 

10363
02:51:09,920 --> 02:51:11,590
people who are thinking about
doing work in artificial intelligence

10364
02:51:11,590 --> 02:51:11,600
doing work in artificial intelligence
 

10365
02:51:11,600 --> 02:51:13,110
doing work in artificial intelligence
and robotics and are thinking about

10366
02:51:13,110 --> 02:51:13,120
and robotics and are thinking about
 

10367
02:51:13,120 --> 02:51:15,269
and robotics and are thinking about
whether to get a phd it's like i

10368
02:51:15,269 --> 02:51:15,279
whether to get a phd it's like i
 

10369
02:51:15,279 --> 02:51:17,510
whether to get a phd it's like i
actually went i was a cmu for undergrad

10370
02:51:17,510 --> 02:51:17,520
actually went i was a cmu for undergrad
 

10371
02:51:17,520 --> 02:51:18,630
actually went i was a cmu for undergrad
as well and didn't know anything about

10372
02:51:18,630 --> 02:51:18,640
as well and didn't know anything about
 

10373
02:51:18,640 --> 02:51:21,429
as well and didn't know anything about
robotics coming in and was doing you

10374
02:51:21,429 --> 02:51:21,439
robotics coming in and was doing you
 

10375
02:51:21,439 --> 02:51:22,630
robotics coming in and was doing you
know electrical computer engineering

10376
02:51:22,630 --> 02:51:22,640
know electrical computer engineering
 

10377
02:51:22,640 --> 02:51:24,309
know electrical computer engineering
computer science and really got more and

10378
02:51:24,309 --> 02:51:24,319
computer science and really got more and
 

10379
02:51:24,319 --> 02:51:26,630
computer science and really got more and
more into kind of ai and then fell in

10380
02:51:26,630 --> 02:51:26,640
more into kind of ai and then fell in
 

10381
02:51:26,640 --> 02:51:28,230
more into kind of ai and then fell in
love with autonomous driving and at that

10382
02:51:28,230 --> 02:51:28,240
love with autonomous driving and at that
 

10383
02:51:28,240 --> 02:51:30,309
love with autonomous driving and at that
point like that was just by a big margin

10384
02:51:30,309 --> 02:51:30,319
point like that was just by a big margin
 

10385
02:51:30,319 --> 02:51:33,429
point like that was just by a big margin
like such a incredible like central spot

10386
02:51:33,429 --> 02:51:33,439
like such a incredible like central spot
 

10387
02:51:33,439 --> 02:51:34,309
like such a incredible like central spot
of

10388
02:51:34,309 --> 02:51:34,319
of
 

10389
02:51:34,319 --> 02:51:36,550
of
develop of investment in that area and

10390
02:51:36,550 --> 02:51:36,560
develop of investment in that area and
 

10391
02:51:36,560 --> 02:51:37,510
develop of investment in that area and
so what i would say is that like

10392
02:51:37,510 --> 02:51:37,520
so what i would say is that like
 

10393
02:51:37,520 --> 02:51:39,110
so what i would say is that like
robotics like for

10394
02:51:39,110 --> 02:51:39,120
robotics like for
 

10395
02:51:39,120 --> 02:51:40,309
robotics like for
all the progress that's happened is

10396
02:51:40,309 --> 02:51:40,319
all the progress that's happened is
 

10397
02:51:40,319 --> 02:51:41,990
all the progress that's happened is
still a really young field there's a

10398
02:51:41,990 --> 02:51:42,000
still a really young field there's a
 

10399
02:51:42,000 --> 02:51:43,349
still a really young field there's a
huge amount of opportunity now that

10400
02:51:43,349 --> 02:51:43,359
huge amount of opportunity now that
 

10401
02:51:43,359 --> 02:51:45,349
huge amount of opportunity now that
opportunity shifted where something like

10402
02:51:45,349 --> 02:51:45,359
opportunity shifted where something like
 

10403
02:51:45,359 --> 02:51:47,429
opportunity shifted where something like
autonomous driving has moved from being

10404
02:51:47,429 --> 02:51:47,439
autonomous driving has moved from being
 

10405
02:51:47,439 --> 02:51:50,070
autonomous driving has moved from being
very research and academics driven to

10406
02:51:50,070 --> 02:51:50,080
very research and academics driven to
 

10407
02:51:50,080 --> 02:51:51,349
very research and academics driven to
being commercial driven where you see

10408
02:51:51,349 --> 02:51:51,359
being commercial driven where you see
 

10409
02:51:51,359 --> 02:51:53,110
being commercial driven where you see
the investments happening

10410
02:51:53,110 --> 02:51:53,120
the investments happening
 

10411
02:51:53,120 --> 02:51:54,389
the investments happening
in commercial now there's other areas

10412
02:51:54,389 --> 02:51:54,399
in commercial now there's other areas
 

10413
02:51:54,399 --> 02:51:55,910
in commercial now there's other areas
that are much younger

10414
02:51:55,910 --> 02:51:55,920
that are much younger
 

10415
02:51:55,920 --> 02:51:58,070
that are much younger
and you see like kind of grasping and

10416
02:51:58,070 --> 02:51:58,080
and you see like kind of grasping and
 

10417
02:51:58,080 --> 02:51:59,990
and you see like kind of grasping and
manipulation making kind of the same

10418
02:51:59,990 --> 02:52:00,000
manipulation making kind of the same
 

10419
02:52:00,000 --> 02:52:01,830
manipulation making kind of the same
sort of journey that like autonomy made

10420
02:52:01,830 --> 02:52:01,840
sort of journey that like autonomy made
 

10421
02:52:01,840 --> 02:52:03,830
sort of journey that like autonomy made
and there's other areas as well what i

10422
02:52:03,830 --> 02:52:03,840
and there's other areas as well what i
 

10423
02:52:03,840 --> 02:52:05,910
and there's other areas as well what i
would say is the space moves very

10424
02:52:05,910 --> 02:52:05,920
would say is the space moves very
 

10425
02:52:05,920 --> 02:52:08,870
would say is the space moves very
quickly anything you do a phd in like it

10426
02:52:08,870 --> 02:52:08,880
quickly anything you do a phd in like it
 

10427
02:52:08,880 --> 02:52:11,030
quickly anything you do a phd in like it
is in most areas will evolve and change

10428
02:52:11,030 --> 02:52:11,040
is in most areas will evolve and change
 

10429
02:52:11,040 --> 02:52:12,790
is in most areas will evolve and change
as technology changes and constraints

10430
02:52:12,790 --> 02:52:12,800
as technology changes and constraints
 

10431
02:52:12,800 --> 02:52:14,230
as technology changes and constraints
change and hardware changes and the

10432
02:52:14,230 --> 02:52:14,240
change and hardware changes and the
 

10433
02:52:14,240 --> 02:52:15,510
change and hardware changes and the
world changes

10434
02:52:15,510 --> 02:52:15,520
world changes
 

10435
02:52:15,520 --> 02:52:16,790
world changes
um and so

10436
02:52:16,790 --> 02:52:16,800
um and so
 

10437
02:52:16,800 --> 02:52:18,309
um and so
the beautiful thing about robotics is

10438
02:52:18,309 --> 02:52:18,319
the beautiful thing about robotics is
 

10439
02:52:18,319 --> 02:52:20,389
the beautiful thing about robotics is
it's super broad it's not a narrow space

10440
02:52:20,389 --> 02:52:20,399
it's super broad it's not a narrow space
 

10441
02:52:20,399 --> 02:52:22,150
it's super broad it's not a narrow space
at all and it can be a million different

10442
02:52:22,150 --> 02:52:22,160
at all and it can be a million different
 

10443
02:52:22,160 --> 02:52:23,910
at all and it can be a million different
things in a million different industries

10444
02:52:23,910 --> 02:52:23,920
things in a million different industries
 

10445
02:52:23,920 --> 02:52:24,950
things in a million different industries
and so

10446
02:52:24,950 --> 02:52:24,960
and so
 

10447
02:52:24,960 --> 02:52:27,349
and so
uh it's a great opportunity to come in

10448
02:52:27,349 --> 02:52:27,359
uh it's a great opportunity to come in
 

10449
02:52:27,359 --> 02:52:29,990
uh it's a great opportunity to come in
and get a broad foundation on ai machine

10450
02:52:29,990 --> 02:52:30,000
and get a broad foundation on ai machine
 

10451
02:52:30,000 --> 02:52:32,070
and get a broad foundation on ai machine
learning computer vision systems

10452
02:52:32,070 --> 02:52:32,080
learning computer vision systems
 

10453
02:52:32,080 --> 02:52:33,910
learning computer vision systems
hardware sensors all these separate

10454
02:52:33,910 --> 02:52:33,920
hardware sensors all these separate
 

10455
02:52:33,920 --> 02:52:34,790
hardware sensors all these separate
things

10456
02:52:34,790 --> 02:52:34,800
things
 

10457
02:52:34,800 --> 02:52:37,030
things
you do need to like go deep and find

10458
02:52:37,030 --> 02:52:37,040
you do need to like go deep and find
 

10459
02:52:37,040 --> 02:52:38,950
you do need to like go deep and find
something that you're like really really

10460
02:52:38,950 --> 02:52:38,960
something that you're like really really
 

10461
02:52:38,960 --> 02:52:40,070
something that you're like really really
passionate

10462
02:52:40,070 --> 02:52:40,080
passionate
 

10463
02:52:40,080 --> 02:52:42,309
passionate
about obviously like just like any phd

10464
02:52:42,309 --> 02:52:42,319
about obviously like just like any phd
 

10465
02:52:42,319 --> 02:52:43,670
about obviously like just like any phd
this is like a

10466
02:52:43,670 --> 02:52:43,680
this is like a
 

10467
02:52:43,680 --> 02:52:47,030
this is like a
five six year kind of uh endeavor

10468
02:52:47,030 --> 02:52:47,040
five six year kind of uh endeavor
 

10469
02:52:47,040 --> 02:52:48,710
five six year kind of uh endeavor
and you have to

10470
02:52:48,710 --> 02:52:48,720
and you have to
 

10471
02:52:48,720 --> 02:52:51,590
and you have to
love it enough to go super deep to learn

10472
02:52:51,590 --> 02:52:51,600
love it enough to go super deep to learn
 

10473
02:52:51,600 --> 02:52:53,349
love it enough to go super deep to learn
all the things necessary to be super

10474
02:52:53,349 --> 02:52:53,359
all the things necessary to be super
 

10475
02:52:53,359 --> 02:52:54,630
all the things necessary to be super
deeply functioning in that area and then

10476
02:52:54,630 --> 02:52:54,640
deeply functioning in that area and then
 

10477
02:52:54,640 --> 02:52:56,230
deeply functioning in that area and then
contribute to it in a way that hasn't

10478
02:52:56,230 --> 02:52:56,240
contribute to it in a way that hasn't
 

10479
02:52:56,240 --> 02:52:58,070
contribute to it in a way that hasn't
been done before and in robotics that

10480
02:52:58,070 --> 02:52:58,080
been done before and in robotics that
 

10481
02:52:58,080 --> 02:53:01,269
been done before and in robotics that
probably means um more breadth because

10482
02:53:01,269 --> 02:53:01,279
probably means um more breadth because
 

10483
02:53:01,279 --> 02:53:03,349
probably means um more breadth because
robotics is rarely kind of like one

10484
02:53:03,349 --> 02:53:03,359
robotics is rarely kind of like one
 

10485
02:53:03,359 --> 02:53:05,590
robotics is rarely kind of like one
particular kind of narrow technology

10486
02:53:05,590 --> 02:53:05,600
particular kind of narrow technology
 

10487
02:53:05,600 --> 02:53:07,269
particular kind of narrow technology
and it means being able to collaborate

10488
02:53:07,269 --> 02:53:07,279
and it means being able to collaborate
 

10489
02:53:07,279 --> 02:53:09,030
and it means being able to collaborate
with teams where like one of the coolest

10490
02:53:09,030 --> 02:53:09,040
with teams where like one of the coolest
 

10491
02:53:09,040 --> 02:53:10,469
with teams where like one of the coolest
aspects of like

10492
02:53:10,469 --> 02:53:10,479
aspects of like
 

10493
02:53:10,479 --> 02:53:12,710
aspects of like
my the exp the experience that i kind of

10494
02:53:12,710 --> 02:53:12,720
my the exp the experience that i kind of
 

10495
02:53:12,720 --> 02:53:14,070
my the exp the experience that i kind of
cherish in our phd is that we actually

10496
02:53:14,070 --> 02:53:14,080
cherish in our phd is that we actually
 

10497
02:53:14,080 --> 02:53:17,510
cherish in our phd is that we actually
had a pretty large av project that for

10498
02:53:17,510 --> 02:53:17,520
had a pretty large av project that for
 

10499
02:53:17,520 --> 02:53:19,510
had a pretty large av project that for
that time was like a pretty serious

10500
02:53:19,510 --> 02:53:19,520
that time was like a pretty serious
 

10501
02:53:19,520 --> 02:53:21,830
that time was like a pretty serious
initiative where you got to like partner

10502
02:53:21,830 --> 02:53:21,840
initiative where you got to like partner
 

10503
02:53:21,840 --> 02:53:23,830
initiative where you got to like partner
with a larger team and you had the

10504
02:53:23,830 --> 02:53:23,840
with a larger team and you had the
 

10505
02:53:23,840 --> 02:53:25,510
with a larger team and you had the
experts in perception and the experts in

10506
02:53:25,510 --> 02:53:25,520
experts in perception and the experts in
 

10507
02:53:25,520 --> 02:53:26,550
experts in perception and the experts in
planning and the staff and the

10508
02:53:26,550 --> 02:53:26,560
planning and the staff and the
 

10509
02:53:26,560 --> 02:53:29,349
planning and the staff and the
mechanical challenge um so i was working

10510
02:53:29,349 --> 02:53:29,359
mechanical challenge um so i was working
 

10511
02:53:29,359 --> 02:53:32,469
mechanical challenge um so i was working
on the a project called upi back then uh

10512
02:53:32,469 --> 02:53:32,479
on the a project called upi back then uh
 

10513
02:53:32,479 --> 02:53:34,070
on the a project called upi back then uh
which was basically the off-road version

10514
02:53:34,070 --> 02:53:34,080
which was basically the off-road version
 

10515
02:53:34,080 --> 02:53:35,429
which was basically the off-road version
of the darpa challenge it was a darpa

10516
02:53:35,429 --> 02:53:35,439
of the darpa challenge it was a darpa
 

10517
02:53:35,439 --> 02:53:37,030
of the darpa challenge it was a darpa
funded project for

10518
02:53:37,030 --> 02:53:37,040
funded project for
 

10519
02:53:37,040 --> 02:53:38,710
funded project for
basically like a large off-road vehicle

10520
02:53:38,710 --> 02:53:38,720
basically like a large off-road vehicle
 

10521
02:53:38,720 --> 02:53:39,830
basically like a large off-road vehicle
that you would like

10522
02:53:39,830 --> 02:53:39,840
that you would like
 

10523
02:53:39,840 --> 02:53:41,590
that you would like
drop and then give it a waypoint 10

10524
02:53:41,590 --> 02:53:41,600
drop and then give it a waypoint 10
 

10525
02:53:41,600 --> 02:53:42,790
drop and then give it a waypoint 10
kilometers away and it would have to

10526
02:53:42,790 --> 02:53:42,800
kilometers away and it would have to
 

10527
02:53:42,800 --> 02:53:44,230
kilometers away and it would have to
navigate a complete structure in an

10528
02:53:44,230 --> 02:53:44,240
navigate a complete structure in an
 

10529
02:53:44,240 --> 02:53:46,710
navigate a complete structure in an
office environment yeah so like forest

10530
02:53:46,710 --> 02:53:46,720
office environment yeah so like forest
 

10531
02:53:46,720 --> 02:53:49,030
office environment yeah so like forest
ditches rocks vegetation and so it was

10532
02:53:49,030 --> 02:53:49,040
ditches rocks vegetation and so it was
 

10533
02:53:49,040 --> 02:53:50,230
ditches rocks vegetation and so it was
like a really really interesting kind of

10534
02:53:50,230 --> 02:53:50,240
like a really really interesting kind of
 

10535
02:53:50,240 --> 02:53:51,830
like a really really interesting kind of
a hard problem where like wheels would

10536
02:53:51,830 --> 02:53:51,840
a hard problem where like wheels would
 

10537
02:53:51,840 --> 02:53:53,510
a hard problem where like wheels would
be up to my shoulders it's like gigantic

10538
02:53:53,510 --> 02:53:53,520
be up to my shoulders it's like gigantic
 

10539
02:53:53,520 --> 02:53:55,349
be up to my shoulders it's like gigantic
right yeah by the way av for people

10540
02:53:55,349 --> 02:53:55,359
right yeah by the way av for people
 

10541
02:53:55,359 --> 02:53:56,790
right yeah by the way av for people
stands for autonomous vehicles house

10542
02:53:56,790 --> 02:53:56,800
stands for autonomous vehicles house
 

10543
02:53:56,800 --> 02:53:59,910
stands for autonomous vehicles house
vehicles yeah sorry um and so what i

10544
02:53:59,910 --> 02:53:59,920
vehicles yeah sorry um and so what i
 

10545
02:53:59,920 --> 02:54:01,590
vehicles yeah sorry um and so what i
think is like the beauty of robotics but

10546
02:54:01,590 --> 02:54:01,600
think is like the beauty of robotics but
 

10547
02:54:01,600 --> 02:54:03,030
think is like the beauty of robotics but
also kind of like the expectation is

10548
02:54:03,030 --> 02:54:03,040
also kind of like the expectation is
 

10549
02:54:03,040 --> 02:54:04,550
also kind of like the expectation is
that um

10550
02:54:04,550 --> 02:54:04,560
that um
 

10551
02:54:04,560 --> 02:54:06,469
that um
there's um spaces in computer science

10552
02:54:06,469 --> 02:54:06,479
there's um spaces in computer science
 

10553
02:54:06,479 --> 02:54:07,990
there's um spaces in computer science
where you can be very very narrow and

10554
02:54:07,990 --> 02:54:08,000
where you can be very very narrow and
 

10555
02:54:08,000 --> 02:54:08,950
where you can be very very narrow and
deep

10556
02:54:08,950 --> 02:54:08,960
deep
 

10557
02:54:08,960 --> 02:54:11,269
deep
robotics one of the the necessity but

10558
02:54:11,269 --> 02:54:11,279
robotics one of the the necessity but
 

10559
02:54:11,279 --> 02:54:12,870
robotics one of the the necessity but
also the beauty of it is that it forces

10560
02:54:12,870 --> 02:54:12,880
also the beauty of it is that it forces
 

10561
02:54:12,880 --> 02:54:15,429
also the beauty of it is that it forces
you to be excited about that breadth and

10562
02:54:15,429 --> 02:54:15,439
you to be excited about that breadth and
 

10563
02:54:15,439 --> 02:54:16,710
you to be excited about that breadth and
that partnership across different

10564
02:54:16,710 --> 02:54:16,720
that partnership across different
 

10565
02:54:16,720 --> 02:54:18,870
that partnership across different
disciplines that enable it but that also

10566
02:54:18,870 --> 02:54:18,880
disciplines that enable it but that also
 

10567
02:54:18,880 --> 02:54:21,030
disciplines that enable it but that also
opens up so many more doors where you

10568
02:54:21,030 --> 02:54:21,040
opens up so many more doors where you
 

10569
02:54:21,040 --> 02:54:22,950
opens up so many more doors where you
can go and you can do robotics and

10570
02:54:22,950 --> 02:54:22,960
can go and you can do robotics and
 

10571
02:54:22,960 --> 02:54:25,429
can go and you can do robotics and
almost any category where robotics isn't

10572
02:54:25,429 --> 02:54:25,439
almost any category where robotics isn't
 

10573
02:54:25,439 --> 02:54:28,230
almost any category where robotics isn't
a in isn't really an industry it's like

10574
02:54:28,230 --> 02:54:28,240
a in isn't really an industry it's like
 

10575
02:54:28,240 --> 02:54:29,429
a in isn't really an industry it's like
it's like ai right it's like the

10576
02:54:29,429 --> 02:54:29,439
it's like ai right it's like the
 

10577
02:54:29,439 --> 02:54:32,630
it's like ai right it's like the
application of physical automation to uh

10578
02:54:32,630 --> 02:54:32,640
application of physical automation to uh
 

10579
02:54:32,640 --> 02:54:33,910
application of physical automation to uh
you know to all these other worlds and

10580
02:54:33,910 --> 02:54:33,920
you know to all these other worlds and
 

10581
02:54:33,920 --> 02:54:36,469
you know to all these other worlds and
so you can do robotic surgery you can do

10582
02:54:36,469 --> 02:54:36,479
so you can do robotic surgery you can do
 

10583
02:54:36,479 --> 02:54:38,469
so you can do robotic surgery you can do
vehicles you can do factory automation

10584
02:54:38,469 --> 02:54:38,479
vehicles you can do factory automation
 

10585
02:54:38,479 --> 02:54:40,710
vehicles you can do factory automation
you can do healthcare or you can do like

10586
02:54:40,710 --> 02:54:40,720
you can do healthcare or you can do like
 

10587
02:54:40,720 --> 02:54:41,750
you can do healthcare or you can do like
uh

10588
02:54:41,750 --> 02:54:41,760
uh
 

10589
02:54:41,760 --> 02:54:44,790
uh
leverage the ai around the sensing to

10590
02:54:44,790 --> 02:54:44,800
leverage the ai around the sensing to
 

10591
02:54:44,800 --> 02:54:46,710
leverage the ai around the sensing to
think about static sensors and scene

10592
02:54:46,710 --> 02:54:46,720
think about static sensors and scene
 

10593
02:54:46,720 --> 02:54:49,670
think about static sensors and scene
understanding so um so i think that's

10594
02:54:49,670 --> 02:54:49,680
understanding so um so i think that's
 

10595
02:54:49,680 --> 02:54:50,950
understanding so um so i think that's
got to be the expectation and the

10596
02:54:50,950 --> 02:54:50,960
got to be the expectation and the
 

10597
02:54:50,960 --> 02:54:52,630
got to be the expectation and the
excitement and it

10598
02:54:52,630 --> 02:54:52,640
excitement and it
 

10599
02:54:52,640 --> 02:54:53,750
excitement and it
breeds people they're probably a little

10600
02:54:53,750 --> 02:54:53,760
breeds people they're probably a little
 

10601
02:54:53,760 --> 02:54:55,910
breeds people they're probably a little
bit more collaborative and more excited

10602
02:54:55,910 --> 02:54:55,920
bit more collaborative and more excited
 

10603
02:54:55,920 --> 02:54:57,110
bit more collaborative and more excited
about um

10604
02:54:57,110 --> 02:54:57,120
about um
 

10605
02:54:57,120 --> 02:54:59,429
about um
working in teams uh if i could briefly

10606
02:54:59,429 --> 02:54:59,439
working in teams uh if i could briefly
 

10607
02:54:59,439 --> 02:55:00,790
working in teams uh if i could briefly
comment

10608
02:55:00,790 --> 02:55:00,800
comment
 

10609
02:55:00,800 --> 02:55:03,030
comment
on the fact that the robotics people

10610
02:55:03,030 --> 02:55:03,040
on the fact that the robotics people
 

10611
02:55:03,040 --> 02:55:05,190
on the fact that the robotics people
i've met in my life

10612
02:55:05,190 --> 02:55:05,200
i've met in my life
 

10613
02:55:05,200 --> 02:55:07,990
i've met in my life
from cmu and mit

10614
02:55:07,990 --> 02:55:08,000
from cmu and mit
 

10615
02:55:08,000 --> 02:55:10,710
from cmu and mit
they're really happy people yeah because

10616
02:55:10,710 --> 02:55:10,720
they're really happy people yeah because
 

10617
02:55:10,720 --> 02:55:12,870
they're really happy people yeah because
i think it's the collaborative thing

10618
02:55:12,870 --> 02:55:12,880
i think it's the collaborative thing
 

10619
02:55:12,880 --> 02:55:16,070
i think it's the collaborative thing
yeah i think i think you don't

10620
02:55:16,070 --> 02:55:16,080
yeah i think i think you don't
 

10621
02:55:16,080 --> 02:55:18,070
yeah i think i think you don't
you're not like a sitting in like the

10622
02:55:18,070 --> 02:55:18,080
you're not like a sitting in like the
 

10623
02:55:18,080 --> 02:55:20,870
you're not like a sitting in like the
fourth basement uh exactly

10624
02:55:20,870 --> 02:55:20,880
fourth basement uh exactly
 

10625
02:55:20,880 --> 02:55:22,309
fourth basement uh exactly
which when you're doing machine learning

10626
02:55:22,309 --> 02:55:22,319
which when you're doing machine learning
 

10627
02:55:22,319 --> 02:55:24,710
which when you're doing machine learning
purely software it's very tempting to

10628
02:55:24,710 --> 02:55:24,720
purely software it's very tempting to
 

10629
02:55:24,720 --> 02:55:27,590
purely software it's very tempting to
just disappear into your own hole yeah

10630
02:55:27,590 --> 02:55:27,600
just disappear into your own hole yeah
 

10631
02:55:27,600 --> 02:55:30,710
just disappear into your own hole yeah
and never collaborate and and there that

10632
02:55:30,710 --> 02:55:30,720
and never collaborate and and there that
 

10633
02:55:30,720 --> 02:55:31,750
and never collaborate and and there that
breeds

10634
02:55:31,750 --> 02:55:31,760
breeds
 

10635
02:55:31,760 --> 02:55:33,990
breeds
a little bit more of the silo mentality

10636
02:55:33,990 --> 02:55:34,000
a little bit more of the silo mentality
 

10637
02:55:34,000 --> 02:55:34,950
a little bit more of the silo mentality
of like

10638
02:55:34,950 --> 02:55:34,960
of like
 

10639
02:55:34,960 --> 02:55:36,790
of like
i have a problem it's almost like

10640
02:55:36,790 --> 02:55:36,800
i have a problem it's almost like
 

10641
02:55:36,800 --> 02:55:38,309
i have a problem it's almost like
negative to talk to somebody else or

10642
02:55:38,309 --> 02:55:38,319
negative to talk to somebody else or
 

10643
02:55:38,319 --> 02:55:40,469
negative to talk to somebody else or
something like that but robotics folks

10644
02:55:40,469 --> 02:55:40,479
something like that but robotics folks
 

10645
02:55:40,479 --> 02:55:42,710
something like that but robotics folks
are just very collaborative very

10646
02:55:42,710 --> 02:55:42,720
are just very collaborative very
 

10647
02:55:42,720 --> 02:55:44,870
are just very collaborative very
friendly just and there's also an energy

10648
02:55:44,870 --> 02:55:44,880
friendly just and there's also an energy
 

10649
02:55:44,880 --> 02:55:47,510
friendly just and there's also an energy
of like you get to confront the physics

10650
02:55:47,510 --> 02:55:47,520
of like you get to confront the physics
 

10651
02:55:47,520 --> 02:55:50,710
of like you get to confront the physics
of reality often which is

10652
02:55:50,710 --> 02:55:50,720
of reality often which is
 

10653
02:55:50,720 --> 02:55:51,990
of reality often which is
humbling

10654
02:55:51,990 --> 02:55:52,000
humbling
 

10655
02:55:52,000 --> 02:55:54,230
humbling
and also exciting so it's humbling when

10656
02:55:54,230 --> 02:55:54,240
and also exciting so it's humbling when
 

10657
02:55:54,240 --> 02:55:56,710
and also exciting so it's humbling when
it it fails and exciting when it finally

10658
02:55:56,710 --> 02:55:56,720
it it fails and exciting when it finally
 

10659
02:55:56,720 --> 02:55:57,910
it it fails and exciting when it finally
it's like the purity of the passion you

10660
02:55:57,910 --> 02:55:57,920
it's like the purity of the passion you
 

10661
02:55:57,920 --> 02:56:00,630
it's like the purity of the passion you
got to remember that like right now like

10662
02:56:00,630 --> 02:56:00,640
got to remember that like right now like
 

10663
02:56:00,640 --> 02:56:03,190
got to remember that like right now like
robotics and ais like just all the rage

10664
02:56:03,190 --> 02:56:03,200
robotics and ais like just all the rage
 

10665
02:56:03,200 --> 02:56:05,030
robotics and ais like just all the rage
and autonomous vehicles and all this

10666
02:56:05,030 --> 02:56:05,040
and autonomous vehicles and all this
 

10667
02:56:05,040 --> 02:56:08,389
and autonomous vehicles and all this
like 15 years ago and 20 years ago

10668
02:56:08,389 --> 02:56:08,399
like 15 years ago and 20 years ago
 

10669
02:56:08,399 --> 02:56:09,349
like 15 years ago and 20 years ago
like

10670
02:56:09,349 --> 02:56:09,359
like
 

10671
02:56:09,359 --> 02:56:11,590
like
it wasn't that deeply lucrative people

10672
02:56:11,590 --> 02:56:11,600
it wasn't that deeply lucrative people
 

10673
02:56:11,600 --> 02:56:13,030
it wasn't that deeply lucrative people
went into robotics they did it because

10674
02:56:13,030 --> 02:56:13,040
went into robotics they did it because
 

10675
02:56:13,040 --> 02:56:14,469
went into robotics they did it because
they were like thought it was just the

10676
02:56:14,469 --> 02:56:14,479
they were like thought it was just the
 

10677
02:56:14,479 --> 02:56:15,990
they were like thought it was just the
coolest thing in the world to like make

10678
02:56:15,990 --> 02:56:16,000
coolest thing in the world to like make
 

10679
02:56:16,000 --> 02:56:18,070
coolest thing in the world to like make
physical things intelligent in the real

10680
02:56:18,070 --> 02:56:18,080
physical things intelligent in the real
 

10681
02:56:18,080 --> 02:56:20,230
physical things intelligent in the real
world and so there's like a raw passion

10682
02:56:20,230 --> 02:56:20,240
world and so there's like a raw passion
 

10683
02:56:20,240 --> 02:56:21,510
world and so there's like a raw passion
where they went into it for the right

10684
02:56:21,510 --> 02:56:21,520
where they went into it for the right
 

10685
02:56:21,520 --> 02:56:23,110
where they went into it for the right
reasons and so forth and so it's really

10686
02:56:23,110 --> 02:56:23,120
reasons and so forth and so it's really
 

10687
02:56:23,120 --> 02:56:25,030
reasons and so forth and so it's really
great space and that organizational

10688
02:56:25,030 --> 02:56:25,040
great space and that organizational
 

10689
02:56:25,040 --> 02:56:26,710
great space and that organizational
challenge by the way like um when you

10690
02:56:26,710 --> 02:56:26,720
challenge by the way like um when you
 

10691
02:56:26,720 --> 02:56:28,790
challenge by the way like um when you
think about the challenges in av we talk

10692
02:56:28,790 --> 02:56:28,800
think about the challenges in av we talk
 

10693
02:56:28,800 --> 02:56:30,710
think about the challenges in av we talk
a lot about the technical challenges the

10694
02:56:30,710 --> 02:56:30,720
a lot about the technical challenges the
 

10695
02:56:30,720 --> 02:56:32,550
a lot about the technical challenges the
organizational challenge is through the

10696
02:56:32,550 --> 02:56:32,560
organizational challenge is through the
 

10697
02:56:32,560 --> 02:56:33,990
organizational challenge is through the
roof where

10698
02:56:33,990 --> 02:56:34,000
roof where
 

10699
02:56:34,000 --> 02:56:36,150
roof where
um you think about the challenge the

10700
02:56:36,150 --> 02:56:36,160
um you think about the challenge the
 

10701
02:56:36,160 --> 02:56:39,750
um you think about the challenge the
what it takes to build an av system and

10702
02:56:39,750 --> 02:56:39,760
what it takes to build an av system and
 

10703
02:56:39,760 --> 02:56:40,790
what it takes to build an av system and
you have companies that are now

10704
02:56:40,790 --> 02:56:40,800
you have companies that are now
 

10705
02:56:40,800 --> 02:56:42,150
you have companies that are now
thousands of people

10706
02:56:42,150 --> 02:56:42,160
thousands of people
 

10707
02:56:42,160 --> 02:56:44,469
thousands of people
and um you know you look at other really

10708
02:56:44,469 --> 02:56:44,479
and um you know you look at other really
 

10709
02:56:44,479 --> 02:56:45,750
and um you know you look at other really
hard technical problems like an

10710
02:56:45,750 --> 02:56:45,760
hard technical problems like an
 

10711
02:56:45,760 --> 02:56:47,510
hard technical problems like an
operating system it's pretty well

10712
02:56:47,510 --> 02:56:47,520
operating system it's pretty well
 

10713
02:56:47,520 --> 02:56:50,230
operating system it's pretty well
established like you kind of know that

10714
02:56:50,230 --> 02:56:50,240
established like you kind of know that
 

10715
02:56:50,240 --> 02:56:51,910
established like you kind of know that
there's a file system there's virtual

10716
02:56:51,910 --> 02:56:51,920
there's a file system there's virtual
 

10717
02:56:51,920 --> 02:56:53,590
there's a file system there's virtual
memory there's this there's that there's

10718
02:56:53,590 --> 02:56:53,600
memory there's this there's that there's
 

10719
02:56:53,600 --> 02:56:55,429
memory there's this there's that there's
like

10720
02:56:55,429 --> 02:56:55,439
like
 

10721
02:56:55,439 --> 02:56:57,110
like
caching and like and there's like a

10722
02:56:57,110 --> 02:56:57,120
caching and like and there's like a
 

10723
02:56:57,120 --> 02:56:58,550
caching and like and there's like a
really reasonably well established

10724
02:56:58,550 --> 02:56:58,560
really reasonably well established
 

10725
02:56:58,560 --> 02:57:00,469
really reasonably well established
modularity and apis and so forth and so

10726
02:57:00,469 --> 02:57:00,479
modularity and apis and so forth and so
 

10727
02:57:00,479 --> 02:57:02,070
modularity and apis and so forth and so
you can kind of like scale it in an

10728
02:57:02,070 --> 02:57:02,080
you can kind of like scale it in an
 

10729
02:57:02,080 --> 02:57:04,710
you can kind of like scale it in an
efficient fashion that doesn't exist

10730
02:57:04,710 --> 02:57:04,720
efficient fashion that doesn't exist
 

10731
02:57:04,720 --> 02:57:06,550
efficient fashion that doesn't exist
anywhere near to that level of maturity

10732
02:57:06,550 --> 02:57:06,560
anywhere near to that level of maturity
 

10733
02:57:06,560 --> 02:57:08,550
anywhere near to that level of maturity
in autonomous driving right now

10734
02:57:08,550 --> 02:57:08,560
in autonomous driving right now
 

10735
02:57:08,560 --> 02:57:10,870
in autonomous driving right now
and tech stacks are being reinvented

10736
02:57:10,870 --> 02:57:10,880
and tech stacks are being reinvented
 

10737
02:57:10,880 --> 02:57:11,990
and tech stacks are being reinvented
organizational structures are being

10738
02:57:11,990 --> 02:57:12,000
organizational structures are being
 

10739
02:57:12,000 --> 02:57:13,510
organizational structures are being
reinvented you have problems like

10740
02:57:13,510 --> 02:57:13,520
reinvented you have problems like
 

10741
02:57:13,520 --> 02:57:15,110
reinvented you have problems like
pedestrians that are not isolated

10742
02:57:15,110 --> 02:57:15,120
pedestrians that are not isolated
 

10743
02:57:15,120 --> 02:57:17,190
pedestrians that are not isolated
problems they're part sensing part

10744
02:57:17,190 --> 02:57:17,200
problems they're part sensing part
 

10745
02:57:17,200 --> 02:57:19,030
problems they're part sensing part
behavior prediction part planning part

10746
02:57:19,030 --> 02:57:19,040
behavior prediction part planning part
 

10747
02:57:19,040 --> 02:57:21,269
behavior prediction part planning part
evaluation and

10748
02:57:21,269 --> 02:57:21,279
evaluation and
 

10749
02:57:21,279 --> 02:57:22,870
evaluation and
like one of the biggest challenges is

10750
02:57:22,870 --> 02:57:22,880
like one of the biggest challenges is
 

10751
02:57:22,880 --> 02:57:24,550
like one of the biggest challenges is
actually how do you solve these problems

10752
02:57:24,550 --> 02:57:24,560
actually how do you solve these problems
 

10753
02:57:24,560 --> 02:57:26,870
actually how do you solve these problems
where the mental capacity of a human is

10754
02:57:26,870 --> 02:57:26,880
where the mental capacity of a human is
 

10755
02:57:26,880 --> 02:57:28,790
where the mental capacity of a human is
starting to get strained on how do you

10756
02:57:28,790 --> 02:57:28,800
starting to get strained on how do you
 

10757
02:57:28,800 --> 02:57:31,910
starting to get strained on how do you
organize it and think about it where

10758
02:57:31,910 --> 02:57:31,920
organize it and think about it where
 

10759
02:57:31,920 --> 02:57:33,590
organize it and think about it where
you know you have this like

10760
02:57:33,590 --> 02:57:33,600
you know you have this like
 

10761
02:57:33,600 --> 02:57:35,750
you know you have this like
multi-dimensional matrix that needs to

10762
02:57:35,750 --> 02:57:35,760
multi-dimensional matrix that needs to
 

10763
02:57:35,760 --> 02:57:38,150
multi-dimensional matrix that needs to
all work together and so

10764
02:57:38,150 --> 02:57:38,160
all work together and so
 

10765
02:57:38,160 --> 02:57:39,670
all work together and so
that makes it kind of cool as well

10766
02:57:39,670 --> 02:57:39,680
that makes it kind of cool as well
 

10767
02:57:39,680 --> 02:57:42,630
that makes it kind of cool as well
because it's not like solved at all uh

10768
02:57:42,630 --> 02:57:42,640
because it's not like solved at all uh
 

10769
02:57:42,640 --> 02:57:44,389
because it's not like solved at all uh
from you know like what what is what

10770
02:57:44,389 --> 02:57:44,399
from you know like what what is what
 

10771
02:57:44,399 --> 02:57:45,429
from you know like what what is what
does it take to actually scale this

10772
02:57:45,429 --> 02:57:45,439
does it take to actually scale this
 

10773
02:57:45,439 --> 02:57:46,950
does it take to actually scale this
right and then you look at like other

10774
02:57:46,950 --> 02:57:46,960
right and then you look at like other
 

10775
02:57:46,960 --> 02:57:49,429
right and then you look at like other
gigantic challenges that have you know

10776
02:57:49,429 --> 02:57:49,439
gigantic challenges that have you know
 

10777
02:57:49,439 --> 02:57:50,870
gigantic challenges that have you know
that have been success successful and

10778
02:57:50,870 --> 02:57:50,880
that have been success successful and
 

10779
02:57:50,880 --> 02:57:52,230
that have been success successful and
are way more mature

10780
02:57:52,230 --> 02:57:52,240
are way more mature
 

10781
02:57:52,240 --> 02:57:54,230
are way more mature
there's a stability to it and like maybe

10782
02:57:54,230 --> 02:57:54,240
there's a stability to it and like maybe
 

10783
02:57:54,240 --> 02:57:56,070
there's a stability to it and like maybe
the autonomous vehicle space will get

10784
02:57:56,070 --> 02:57:56,080
the autonomous vehicle space will get
 

10785
02:57:56,080 --> 02:57:58,950
the autonomous vehicle space will get
there but right now just as many uh

10786
02:57:58,950 --> 02:57:58,960
there but right now just as many uh
 

10787
02:57:58,960 --> 02:58:00,309
there but right now just as many uh
technical challenges as they are they're

10788
02:58:00,309 --> 02:58:00,319
technical challenges as they are they're
 

10789
02:58:00,319 --> 02:58:01,510
technical challenges as they are they're
like organizational challenges and how

10790
02:58:01,510 --> 02:58:01,520
like organizational challenges and how
 

10791
02:58:01,520 --> 02:58:03,190
like organizational challenges and how
do you like solve these problems that

10792
02:58:03,190 --> 02:58:03,200
do you like solve these problems that
 

10793
02:58:03,200 --> 02:58:05,429
do you like solve these problems that
touch on so many different areas and

10794

of journey ever um the things that make
it easier and that i would recommend is

10984
03:01:13,429 --> 03:01:13,439
it easier and that i would recommend is
 

10985
03:01:13,439 --> 03:01:14,870
it easier and that i would recommend is
like be really really thoughtful about

03:01:14,880 --> 03:01:15,750
like be really really thoughtful about
the

10988
03:01:15,750 --> 03:01:15,760
the
 

10989
03:01:15,760 --> 03:01:17,910
the
the application like there's a there's a

10990
03:01:17,910 --> 03:01:17,920
the application like there's a there's a
 

10991

the application like there's a there's a
saying of like kind of you know team and

10992
03:01:20,230 --> 03:01:20,240
saying of like kind of you know team and
 

10993
03:01:20,240 --> 03:01:22,150
saying of like kind of you know team and
execution and market and like kind of

10994
03:01:22,150 --> 03:01:22,160
execution and market and like kind of
 

10995
03:01:22,160 --> 03:01:24,950
execution and market and like kind of
how important are each of those um and

10996
03:01:24,950 --> 03:01:24,960
how important are each of those um and
 

10997
03:01:24,960 --> 03:01:27,190
how important are each of those um and
oftentimes the market wins and you come

10998
03:01:27,190 --> 03:01:27,200
oftentimes the market wins and you come
 

10999
03:01:27,200 --> 03:01:28,630
oftentimes the market wins and you come
at it thinking that if you're smart

11000
03:01:28,630 --> 03:01:28,640
at it thinking that if you're smart
 

11001
03:01:28,640 --> 03:01:29,830
at it thinking that if you're smart
enough and you work hard enough and

11002
03:01:29,830 --> 03:01:29,840
enough and you work hard enough and
 

11003
03:01:29,840 --> 03:01:31,830
enough and you work hard enough and
you're like have the right talented team

11004
03:01:31,830 --> 03:01:31,840
you're like have the right talented team
 

11005
03:01:31,840 --> 03:01:33,510
you're like have the right talented team
and so forth like you'll always kind of

11006
03:01:33,510 --> 03:01:33,520
and so forth like you'll always kind of
 

11007
03:01:33,520 --> 03:01:35,910
and so forth like you'll always kind of
find a way through and um it's

11008
03:01:35,910 --> 03:01:35,920
find a way through and um it's
 

11009
03:01:35,920 --> 03:01:37,910
find a way through and um it's
surprising how much dynamics are driven

11010
03:01:37,910 --> 03:01:37,920
surprising how much dynamics are driven
 

11011
03:01:37,920 --> 03:01:39,510
surprising how much dynamics are driven
by the industry you're in and the timing

11012
03:01:39,510 --> 03:01:39,520
by the industry you're in and the timing
 

11013
03:01:39,520 --> 03:01:42,389
by the industry you're in and the timing
of you entering that industry um and so

11014
03:01:42,389 --> 03:01:42,399
of you entering that industry um and so
 

11015
03:01:42,399 --> 03:01:44,469
of you entering that industry um and so
just uh waymo is a great example of it

11016
03:01:44,469 --> 03:01:44,479
just uh waymo is a great example of it
 

11017
03:01:44,479 --> 03:01:45,510
just uh waymo is a great example of it
there is

11018
03:01:45,510 --> 03:01:45,520
there is
 

11019
03:01:45,520 --> 03:01:46,710
there is
i don't know if there'll ever be another

11020
03:01:46,710 --> 03:01:46,720
i don't know if there'll ever be another
 

11021
03:01:46,720 --> 03:01:50,150
i don't know if there'll ever be another
company or suite of companies that

11022
03:01:50,150 --> 03:01:50,160
company or suite of companies that
 

11023
03:01:50,160 --> 03:01:52,950
company or suite of companies that
has raised and continues to spend so

11024
03:01:52,950 --> 03:01:52,960
has raised and continues to spend so
 

11025
03:01:52,960 --> 03:01:56,790
has raised and continues to spend so
much money at such an early uh phase of

11026
03:01:56,790 --> 03:01:56,800
much money at such an early uh phase of
 

11027
03:01:56,800 --> 03:01:58,950
much money at such an early uh phase of
revenue generation and product and

11028
03:01:58,950 --> 03:01:58,960
revenue generation and product and
 

11029
03:01:58,960 --> 03:02:01,990
revenue generation and product and
productization um the you know from a p

11030
03:02:01,990 --> 03:02:02,000
productization um the you know from a p
 

11031
03:02:02,000 --> 03:02:05,349
productization um the you know from a p
l standpoint uh like it's it's a

11032
03:02:05,349 --> 03:02:05,359
l standpoint uh like it's it's a
 

11033
03:02:05,359 --> 03:02:07,190
l standpoint uh like it's it's a
anomaly like by any measure of any

11034
03:02:07,190 --> 03:02:07,200
anomaly like by any measure of any
 

11035
03:02:07,200 --> 03:02:09,269

industry that's ever existed um except

11036
03:02:09,269 --> 03:02:09,279
industry that's ever existed um except
 

11037
03:02:09,279 --> 03:02:11,510
industry that's ever existed um except
for maybe the u.s space program uh like

11038
03:02:11,510 --> 03:02:11,520
for maybe the u.s space program uh like
 

11039
03:02:11,520 --> 03:02:13,990
for maybe the u.s space program uh like
right uh like but

11040
03:02:13,990 --> 03:02:14,000
right uh like but
 

11041
03:02:14,000 --> 03:02:15,510
right uh like but
it's like uh

11042
03:02:15,510 --> 03:02:15,520
it's like uh
 

11043
03:02:15,520 --> 03:02:17,349
it's like uh
multiple trillion dollar opportunities

11044
03:02:17,349 --> 03:02:17,359
multiple trillion dollar opportunities
 

11045
03:02:17,359 --> 03:02:19,349
multiple trillion dollar opportunities
which is so unusual to find that size of

03:02:22,960 --> 03:02:24,550
just the progress that shows the
de-risking of it you could apply

11052
03:02:24,550 --> 03:02:24,560
de-risking of it you could apply
 

11053
03:02:24,560 --> 03:02:25,990
de-risking of it you could apply
whatever discounts you want off of that

03:02:25,990 --> 03:02:26,000
whatever discounts you want off of that
 

11055

whatever discounts you want off of that
trillion-dollar market and it still

03:02:27,110 --> 03:02:27,120
trillion-dollar market and it still
 

11057
03:02:27,120 --> 03:02:28,710
trillion-dollar market and it still
justifies the investment that is

11058
03:02:28,710 --> 03:02:28,720
justifies the investment that is
 

11059
03:02:28,720 --> 03:02:30,710
justifies the investment that is
happening because like being successful

like
 

11067
03:02:36,000 --> 03:02:37,349
like
the size of the market the size of the

probably one of the lessons i appreciate

03:02:44,790 --> 03:02:44,800
probably one of the lessons i appreciate
 

11077
03:02:44,800 --> 03:02:46,309
probably one of the lessons i appreciate
like more than anything else where like

11078
03:02:46,309 --> 03:02:46,319
like more than anything else where like
 

11079
03:02:46,319 --> 03:02:48,550
like more than anything else where like
those things really really do matter

11080
03:02:48,550 --> 03:02:48,560
those things really really do matter
 

11081
03:02:48,560 --> 03:02:51,590
those things really really do matter
and um oftentimes can dominate the

11082
03:02:51,590 --> 03:02:51,600
and um oftentimes can dominate the
 

11083
03:02:51,600 --> 03:02:53,670
and um oftentimes can dominate the
quality of the team or execution because

quality of the team or execution because
 

11085
03:02:53,680 --> 03:02:54,630

if you
 

11087
03:02:54,640 --> 03:02:56,070
if you
miss the timing or you do it in the

miss the timing or you do it in the
 

11089
03:02:56,080 --> 03:02:57,510
miss the timing or you do it in the
wrong space you run into like the

11090
03:02:57,510 --> 03:02:57,520
wrong space you run into like the
 

11091
03:02:57,520 --> 03:02:59,990
wrong space you run into like the
institutional kind of headwinds of a

11092
03:02:59,990 --> 03:03:00,000
institutional kind of headwinds of a
 

11093
03:03:00,000 --> 03:03:01,590
institutional kind of headwinds of a
particular environment like let's say

11094
03:03:01,590 --> 03:03:01,600
particular environment like let's say
 

11095
03:03:01,600 --> 03:03:02,630
particular environment like let's say
you have the greatest idea in the world

11096
03:03:02,630 --> 03:03:02,640
you have the greatest idea in the world
 

11097
03:03:02,640 --> 03:03:04,070
you have the greatest idea in the world
but you barrel into healthcare but it

11098
03:03:04,070 --> 03:03:04,080
but you barrel into healthcare but it
 

11099
03:03:04,080 --> 03:03:05,670
but you barrel into healthcare but it
takes 10 years to innovate in healthcare

11100
03:03:05,670 --> 03:03:05,680
takes 10 years to innovate in healthcare
 

11101
03:03:05,680 --> 03:03:07,190
takes 10 years to innovate in healthcare
because of a lot of challenges right

11102
03:03:07,190 --> 03:03:07,200
because of a lot of challenges right
 

11103
03:03:07,200 --> 03:03:09,269
because of a lot of challenges right
like there's fundamental

11104
03:03:09,269 --> 03:03:09,279
like there's fundamental
 

11105
03:03:09,279 --> 03:03:11,110
like there's fundamental
uh laws of physics that you have to

11106
03:03:11,110 --> 03:03:11,120
uh laws of physics that you have to
 

11107
03:03:11,120 --> 03:03:13,990
uh laws of physics that you have to
think about and so um the combination of

11108
03:03:13,990 --> 03:03:14,000
think about and so um the combination of
 

11109
03:03:14,000 --> 03:03:15,910
think about and so um the combination of
like anki waymo kind of drives that

11110
03:03:15,910 --> 03:03:15,920
like anki waymo kind of drives that
 

11111
03:03:15,920 --> 03:03:18,230
like anki waymo kind of drives that
point home for me where you can do a ton

11112
03:03:18,230 --> 03:03:18,240
point home for me where you can do a ton
 

11113
03:03:18,240 --> 03:03:19,910
point home for me where you can do a ton
if you have the right market the right

11114
03:03:19,910 --> 03:03:19,920
if you have the right market the right
 

11115
03:03:19,920 --> 03:03:22,150
if you have the right market the right
opportunity the right way to explain it

11116
03:03:22,150 --> 03:03:22,160
opportunity the right way to explain it
 

11117
03:03:22,160 --> 03:03:23,750
opportunity the right way to explain it
and you show the progress in the right

11118
03:03:23,750 --> 03:03:23,760
and you show the progress in the right
 

11119
03:03:23,760 --> 03:03:25,510
and you show the progress in the right
sequence

sequence
 

11121
03:03:25,520 --> 03:03:27,590

it actually can really significantly

03:03:27,590 --> 03:03:27,600
it actually can really significantly
 

11123
03:03:27,600 --> 03:03:29,429
it actually can really significantly
change the course of your

11124
03:03:29,429 --> 03:03:29,439
change the course of your
 

11125
03:03:29,439 --> 03:03:30,950
change the course of your
journey and startup how much of it is

11126
03:03:30,950 --> 03:03:30,960
journey and startup how much of it is
 

11127
03:03:30,960 --> 03:03:32,550
journey and startup how much of it is
understanding the market and how much of

11128
03:03:32,550 --> 03:03:32,560
understanding the market and how much of
 

11129
03:03:32,560 --> 03:03:35,349
understanding the market and how much of
it's creating a new market so how do you

11130
03:03:35,349 --> 03:03:35,359
it's creating a new market so how do you
 

11131
03:03:35,359 --> 03:03:37,030
it's creating a new market so how do you
think about

11132
03:03:37,030 --> 03:03:37,040
think about
 

11133
03:03:37,040 --> 03:03:38,469
think about
like space robotics is really

11134
03:03:38,469 --> 03:03:38,479
like space robotics is really
 

11135
03:03:38,479 --> 03:03:41,110
like space robotics is really
interesting you said exactly right the

11136
03:03:41,110 --> 03:03:41,120
interesting you said exactly right the
 

11137
03:03:41,120 --> 03:03:43,349
interesting you said exactly right the
space of applications is small

11138
03:03:43,349 --> 03:03:43,359
space of applications is small
 

11139
03:03:43,359 --> 03:03:45,030
space of applications is small
yeah

11140
03:03:45,030 --> 03:03:45,040
yeah
 

11141
03:03:45,040 --> 03:03:47,349
yeah
you know relative to the cost involved

11142
03:03:47,349 --> 03:03:47,359
you know relative to the cost involved
 

11143
03:03:47,359 --> 03:03:50,469
you know relative to the cost involved
so how much is like truly revolutionary

11144
03:03:50,469 --> 03:03:50,479
so how much is like truly revolutionary
 

11145
03:03:50,479 --> 03:03:51,750
so how much is like truly revolutionary
thinking

11146
03:03:51,750 --> 03:03:51,760
thinking
 

11147
03:03:51,760 --> 03:03:54,790
thinking
about like what is the application

11148
03:03:54,790 --> 03:03:54,800
about like what is the application
 

11149
03:03:54,800 --> 03:03:56,230
about like what is the application
and then

11150
03:03:56,230 --> 03:03:56,240
and then
 

11151
03:03:56,240 --> 03:03:59,269
and then
yeah but so creating something that

11152
03:03:59,269 --> 03:03:59,279
yeah but so creating something that
 

11153
03:03:59,279 --> 03:04:01,590
yeah but so creating something that
didn't exist it didn't really exist like

11154
03:04:01,590 --> 03:04:01,600
didn't exist it didn't really exist like
 

11155
03:04:01,600 --> 03:04:03,190
didn't exist it didn't really exist like
this is pretty obvious to me the whole

11156
03:04:03,190 --> 03:04:03,200
this is pretty obvious to me the whole
 

11157
03:04:03,200 --> 03:04:05,670
this is pretty obvious to me the whole
space of home robotics just every

11158
03:04:05,670 --> 03:04:05,680
space of home robotics just every
 

11159
03:04:05,680 --> 03:04:07,429
space of home robotics just every
everything that cosmo did i guess you

11160
03:04:07,429 --> 03:04:07,439
everything that cosmo did i guess you
 

11161
03:04:07,439 --> 03:04:09,349
everything that cosmo did i guess you
could talk to it as a toy and people

11162
03:04:09,349 --> 03:04:09,359
could talk to it as a toy and people
 

11163
03:04:09,359 --> 03:04:11,269
could talk to it as a toy and people
will understand it picazo is much more

11164
03:04:11,269 --> 03:04:11,279
will understand it picazo is much more
 

11165
03:04:11,279 --> 03:04:13,190
will understand it picazo is much more
than a toy yeah

11166
03:04:13,190 --> 03:04:13,200
than a toy yeah
 

11167
03:04:13,200 --> 03:04:14,389
than a toy yeah
and

11168
03:04:14,389 --> 03:04:14,399
and
 

11169
03:04:14,399 --> 03:04:16,469
and
i don't think people fully understand

11170
03:04:16,469 --> 03:04:16,479
i don't think people fully understand
 

11171
03:04:16,479 --> 03:04:19,110
i don't think people fully understand
the value of that you have to create it

11172
03:04:19,110 --> 03:04:19,120
the value of that you have to create it
 

11173
03:04:19,120 --> 03:04:20,870
the value of that you have to create it
and the product will communicate it like

11174
03:04:20,870 --> 03:04:20,880
and the product will communicate it like
 

11175
03:04:20,880 --> 03:04:22,790
and the product will communicate it like
just like the iphone

11176
03:04:22,790 --> 03:04:22,800
just like the iphone
 

11177
03:04:22,800 --> 03:04:24,870
just like the iphone
nobody understood the value

11178
03:04:24,870 --> 03:04:24,880
nobody understood the value
 

11179
03:04:24,880 --> 03:04:28,950
nobody understood the value
of of no keyboard and a thing that's

11180
03:04:28,950 --> 03:04:28,960
of of no keyboard and a thing that's
 

11181
03:04:28,960 --> 03:04:31,269
of of no keyboard and a thing that's
that can do web browsing i don't think

11182
03:04:31,269 --> 03:04:31,279
that can do web browsing i don't think
 

11183
03:04:31,279 --> 03:04:32,870
that can do web browsing i don't think
they understand the value of that until

11184
03:04:32,870 --> 03:04:32,880
they understand the value of that until
 

11185
03:04:32,880 --> 03:04:34,070
they understand the value of that until
you create it

11186
03:04:34,070 --> 03:04:34,080
you create it
 

11187
03:04:34,080 --> 03:04:36,070
you create it
yeah having a foot and a door in an

11188
03:04:36,070 --> 03:04:36,080
yeah having a foot and a door in an
 

11189
03:04:36,080 --> 03:04:37,510
yeah having a foot and a door in an
entry point still helps because at the

11190
03:04:37,510 --> 03:04:37,520
entry point still helps because at the
 

11191
03:04:37,520 --> 03:04:39,830
entry point still helps because at the
end of the day like an iphone replaced

11192
03:04:39,830 --> 03:04:39,840
end of the day like an iphone replaced
 

11193
03:04:39,840 --> 03:04:41,110
end of the day like an iphone replaced
your phone and so it had a fundamental

11194
03:04:41,110 --> 03:04:41,120
your phone and so it had a fundamental
 

11195
03:04:41,120 --> 03:04:42,630
your phone and so it had a fundamental
purpose and all these things that it did

11196
03:04:42,630 --> 03:04:42,640
purpose and all these things that it did
 

11197
03:04:42,640 --> 03:04:44,550
purpose and all these things that it did
better right sure and so then you could

11198
03:04:44,550 --> 03:04:44,560
better right sure and so then you could
 

11199
03:04:44,560 --> 03:04:47,269
better right sure and so then you could
do abc on top of it and uh and then like

11200
03:04:47,269 --> 03:04:47,279
do abc on top of it and uh and then like
 

11201
03:04:47,279 --> 03:04:48,630
do abc on top of it and uh and then like
you even remember the early commercials

11202
03:04:48,630 --> 03:04:48,640
you even remember the early commercials
 

11203
03:04:48,640 --> 03:04:50,630
you even remember the early commercials
where it's always like one application

11204
03:04:50,630 --> 03:04:50,640
where it's always like one application
 

11205
03:04:50,640 --> 03:04:51,830
where it's always like one application
of what he could do and then you get a

11206
03:04:51,830 --> 03:04:51,840
of what he could do and then you get a
 

11207
03:04:51,840 --> 03:04:54,150
of what he could do and then you get a
phone call right and so that was

11208
03:04:54,150 --> 03:04:54,160
phone call right and so that was
 

11209
03:04:54,160 --> 03:04:55,190
phone call right and so that was
intentionally sending a message

11210
03:04:55,190 --> 03:04:55,200
intentionally sending a message
 

11211
03:04:55,200 --> 03:04:56,950
intentionally sending a message
something familiar but then like yes you

11212
03:04:56,950 --> 03:04:56,960
something familiar but then like yes you
 

11213
03:04:56,960 --> 03:04:58,150
something familiar but then like yes you
can send a text message you can listen

11214
03:04:58,150 --> 03:04:58,160
can send a text message you can listen
 

11215
03:04:58,160 --> 03:04:59,990
can send a text message you can listen
to music you can surf the web right and

11216
03:04:59,990 --> 03:05:00,000
to music you can surf the web right and
 

11217
03:05:00,000 --> 03:05:00,790
to music you can surf the web right and
so

11218
03:05:00,790 --> 03:05:00,800
so
 

11219
03:05:00,800 --> 03:05:02,550
so
you know autonomous driving obviously

11220
03:05:02,550 --> 03:05:02,560
you know autonomous driving obviously
 

11221
03:05:02,560 --> 03:05:04,070
you know autonomous driving obviously
anchors on that as well you don't have

11222
03:05:04,070 --> 03:05:04,080
anchors on that as well you don't have
 

11223
03:05:04,080 --> 03:05:05,990
anchors on that as well you don't have
to explain to somebody the functionality

11224
03:05:05,990 --> 03:05:06,000
to explain to somebody the functionality
 

11225
03:05:06,000 --> 03:05:07,269
to explain to somebody the functionality
of an autonomous truck right like

11226
03:05:07,269 --> 03:05:07,279
of an autonomous truck right like
 

11227
03:05:07,279 --> 03:05:08,389
of an autonomous truck right like
there's nuances around it but the

11228
03:05:08,389 --> 03:05:08,399
there's nuances around it but the
 

11229
03:05:08,399 --> 03:05:10,790
there's nuances around it but the
functionality makes sense um

11230
03:05:10,790 --> 03:05:10,800
functionality makes sense um
 

11231
03:05:10,800 --> 03:05:11,990
functionality makes sense um
in the home

11232
03:05:11,990 --> 03:05:12,000
in the home
 

11233
03:05:12,000 --> 03:05:13,750
in the home
you have a fundamental advantage like we

11234
03:05:13,750 --> 03:05:13,760
you have a fundamental advantage like we
 

11235
03:05:13,760 --> 03:05:15,110
you have a fundamental advantage like we
always thought about this because it was

11236
03:05:15,110 --> 03:05:15,120
always thought about this because it was
 

11237
03:05:15,120 --> 03:05:16,950
always thought about this because it was
so painful to explain to people what our

11238
03:05:16,950 --> 03:05:16,960
so painful to explain to people what our
 

11239
03:05:16,960 --> 03:05:18,309
so painful to explain to people what our
products did and how like how to

11240
03:05:18,309 --> 03:05:18,319
products did and how like how to
 

11241
03:05:18,319 --> 03:05:20,389
products did and how like how to
communicate that super cleanly

11242
03:05:20,389 --> 03:05:20,399
communicate that super cleanly
 

11243
03:05:20,399 --> 03:05:21,429
communicate that super cleanly
especially when something was so

11244
03:05:21,429 --> 03:05:21,439
especially when something was so
 

11245
03:05:21,439 --> 03:05:24,950
especially when something was so
experiential and so you compare like

11246
03:05:24,950 --> 03:05:24,960
experiential and so you compare like
 

11247
03:05:24,960 --> 03:05:27,030
experiential and so you compare like
anki to nest

11248
03:05:27,030 --> 03:05:27,040
anki to nest
 

11249
03:05:27,040 --> 03:05:29,030

had some beautiful products

11252
03:05:31,670 --> 03:05:31,680
had some beautiful products
 

11253
03:05:31,680 --> 03:05:33,110
had some beautiful products
where they

11254
03:05:33,110 --> 03:05:33,120
where they
 

11255
03:05:33,120 --> 03:05:34,790
where they
started scaling and like actually find

11256
03:05:34,790 --> 03:05:34,800
started scaling and like actually find
 

11257
03:05:34,800 --> 03:05:36,469
started scaling and like actually find
like really great success and they had

11258
03:05:36,469 --> 03:05:36,479
like really great success and they had
 

11259
03:05:36,479 --> 03:05:37,830
like really great success and they had
like really clean and beautiful

11260
03:05:37,830 --> 03:05:37,840
like really clean and beautiful
 

11261
03:05:37,840 --> 03:05:39,910
like really clean and beautiful
marketing messaging because they

11262
03:05:39,910 --> 03:05:39,920
marketing messaging because they
 

11263
03:05:39,920 --> 03:05:41,429
marketing messaging because they
anchored on reinventing existing

11264
03:05:41,429 --> 03:05:41,439
anchored on reinventing existing
 

11265
03:05:41,439 --> 03:05:42,950
anchored on reinventing existing
categories where it was a smart

11266
03:05:42,950 --> 03:05:42,960
categories where it was a smart
 

11267
03:05:42,960 --> 03:05:45,990
categories where it was a smart
thermostat right and uh like and so you

11268
03:05:45,990 --> 03:05:46,000
thermostat right and uh like and so you
 

11269
03:05:46,000 --> 03:05:48,230
thermostat right and uh like and so you
you kind of are able to

11270
03:05:48,230 --> 03:05:48,240
you kind of are able to
 

11271
03:05:48,240 --> 03:05:50,550
you kind of are able to
um take what's familiar anchor that

11272
03:05:50,550 --> 03:05:50,560
um take what's familiar anchor that
 

11273
03:05:50,560 --> 03:05:52,150
um take what's familiar anchor that
understanding and then explain what's

11274
03:05:52,150 --> 03:05:52,160
understanding and then explain what's

you're right cosmo is like totally new

11278
03:05:55,750 --> 03:05:55,760
you're right cosmo is like totally new
 

11279
03:05:55,760 --> 03:05:57,830
you're right cosmo is like totally new
thing like what what is this thing

03:06:00,080 --> 03:06:01,830
because we struggle we spent like a lot
of money on marketing we had a heart

11284
03:06:01,830 --> 03:06:01,840
of money on marketing we had a heart
 

11285
03:06:01,840 --> 03:06:03,590
of money on marketing we had a heart
like we fought we actually had far

11286
03:06:03,590 --> 03:06:03,600
like we fought we actually had far
 

11287
03:06:03,600 --> 03:06:05,830
like we fought we actually had far
greater efficiency on cosmo than um

11288
03:06:05,830 --> 03:06:05,840
greater efficiency on cosmo than um
 

11289
03:06:05,840 --> 03:06:07,269
greater efficiency on cosmo than um
anything else because we found a way to

11290
03:06:07,269 --> 03:06:07,279
anything else because we found a way to
 

11291
03:06:07,279 --> 03:06:08,710
anything else because we found a way to
capture the emotion in some little

11292
03:06:08,710 --> 03:06:08,720
capture the emotion in some little
 

11293
03:06:08,720 --> 03:06:10,230
capture the emotion in some little
shorts to kind of lean into the

11294
03:06:10,230 --> 03:06:10,240
shorts to kind of lean into the
 

11295
03:06:10,240 --> 03:06:12,230
shorts to kind of lean into the
personality in our marketing and it

11296
03:06:12,230 --> 03:06:12,240
personality in our marketing and it
 

11297
03:06:12,240 --> 03:06:14,469
personality in our marketing and it
became viral where like we had these

11298
03:06:14,469 --> 03:06:14,479
became viral where like we had these
 

11299
03:06:14,479 --> 03:06:16,070
became viral where like we had these
kind of videos that would like go and

11300
03:06:16,070 --> 03:06:16,080
kind of videos that would like go and
 

11301
03:06:16,080 --> 03:06:17,590
kind of videos that would like go and
get like hundreds of thousands of views

11302
03:06:17,590 --> 03:06:17,600
get like hundreds of thousands of views
 

11303
03:06:17,600 --> 03:06:19,429
get like hundreds of thousands of views
and like kind of like get spread and

11304
03:06:19,429 --> 03:06:19,439
and like kind of like get spread and
 

11305
03:06:19,439 --> 03:06:21,590
and like kind of like get spread and
sometimes millions of views and so um

11306
03:06:21,590 --> 03:06:21,600
sometimes millions of views and so um
 

11307
03:06:21,600 --> 03:06:23,910
sometimes millions of views and so um
but it was like really really hard um

11308
03:06:23,910 --> 03:06:23,920
but it was like really really hard um
 

11309
03:06:23,920 --> 03:06:26,230
but it was like really really hard um
and so finding a way to kind of like

11310
03:06:26,230 --> 03:06:26,240
and so finding a way to kind of like
 

11311
03:06:26,240 --> 03:06:27,830
and so finding a way to kind of like
anchor on something that's familiar but

11312
03:06:27,830 --> 03:06:27,840
anchor on something that's familiar but
 

11313
03:06:27,840 --> 03:06:30,230
anchor on something that's familiar but
then grow into something that's not um

11314
03:06:30,230 --> 03:06:30,240
then grow into something that's not um
 

11315
03:06:30,240 --> 03:06:32,389
then grow into something that's not um
is an advantage but then again like you

11316
03:06:32,389 --> 03:06:32,399
is an advantage but then again like you
 

11317
03:06:32,399 --> 03:06:33,750
is an advantage but then again like you
don't have like there's successes

11318
03:06:33,750 --> 03:06:33,760
don't have like there's successes
 

11319
03:06:33,760 --> 03:06:35,990
don't have like there's successes
otherwise like alexa never had a comp

11320
03:06:35,990 --> 03:06:36,000
otherwise like alexa never had a comp
 

11321
03:06:36,000 --> 03:06:37,110
otherwise like alexa never had a comp
right uh

11322
03:06:37,110 --> 03:06:37,120
right uh
 

11323
03:06:37,120 --> 03:06:39,030
right uh
you could argue that that's very novel

11324
03:06:39,030 --> 03:06:39,040
you could argue that that's very novel
 

11325
03:06:39,040 --> 03:06:40,950
you could argue that that's very novel
and very new and um

11326
03:06:40,950 --> 03:06:40,960
and very new and um
 

11327
03:06:40,960 --> 03:06:42,230
and very new and um
and there's a lot of other examples that

11328
03:06:42,230 --> 03:06:42,240
and there's a lot of other examples that
 

11329
03:06:42,240 --> 03:06:43,670
and there's a lot of other examples that
kind of created a

11330
03:06:43,670 --> 03:06:43,680
kind of created a
 

11331
03:06:43,680 --> 03:06:45,910
kind of created a
kind of a category out of like kiva

11332
03:06:45,910 --> 03:06:45,920
kind of a category out of like kiva
 

11333
03:06:45,920 --> 03:06:48,309
kind of a category out of like kiva
systems i mean they like came in and

11334
03:06:48,309 --> 03:06:48,319
systems i mean they like came in and
 

11335
03:06:48,319 --> 03:06:49,349
systems i mean they like came in and
they like

11336
03:06:49,349 --> 03:06:49,359
they like
 

11337
03:06:49,359 --> 03:06:51,030
they like
uh enterprise is a little easier because

11338
03:06:51,030 --> 03:06:51,040
uh enterprise is a little easier because
 

11339
03:06:51,040 --> 03:06:53,590
uh enterprise is a little easier because
if you can uh it's less susceptible to

11340
03:06:53,590 --> 03:06:53,600
if you can uh it's less susceptible to
 

11341
03:06:53,600 --> 03:06:55,590
if you can uh it's less susceptible to
this because if you can argue a clear

11342
03:06:55,590 --> 03:06:55,600
this because if you can argue a clear
 

11343
03:06:55,600 --> 03:06:57,830
this because if you can argue a clear
value proposition it's a more logical

11344
03:06:57,830 --> 03:06:57,840
value proposition it's a more logical
 

11345
03:06:57,840 --> 03:06:59,830
value proposition it's a more logical
conversation that you can have um with

11346
03:06:59,830 --> 03:06:59,840
conversation that you can have um with
 

11347
03:06:59,840 --> 03:07:01,990
conversation that you can have um with
customers it's not it's a little bit

11348
03:07:01,990 --> 03:07:02,000
customers it's not it's a little bit
 

11349
03:07:02,000 --> 03:07:04,389
customers it's not it's a little bit
less emotional and um kind of subjective

11350
03:07:04,389 --> 03:07:04,399
less emotional and um kind of subjective
 

11351
03:07:04,399 --> 03:07:06,870
less emotional and um kind of subjective
but yeah in the home you have to

11352
03:07:06,870 --> 03:07:06,880
but yeah in the home you have to
 

11353
03:07:06,880 --> 03:07:08,309
but yeah in the home you have to
yeah so like a home robot it's like what

11354
03:07:08,309 --> 03:07:08,319
yeah so like a home robot it's like what
 

11355
03:07:08,319 --> 03:07:09,910
yeah so like a home robot it's like what
does that mean yeah and so then you

11356
03:07:09,910 --> 03:07:09,920
does that mean yeah and so then you
 

11357
03:07:09,920 --> 03:07:11,590
does that mean yeah and so then you
really have to be crisp about the value

11358
03:07:11,590 --> 03:07:11,600
really have to be crisp about the value
 

11359
03:07:11,600 --> 03:07:13,750
really have to be crisp about the value
proposition and what like

11360
03:07:13,750 --> 03:07:13,760
proposition and what like
 

11361
03:07:13,760 --> 03:07:15,910
proposition and what like
really makes it worth it like and and we

11362
03:07:15,910 --> 03:07:15,920
really makes it worth it like and and we
 

11363
03:07:15,920 --> 03:07:17,110
really makes it worth it like and and we
by the way went to that same order we

11364
03:07:17,110 --> 03:07:17,120
by the way went to that same order we
 

11365
03:07:17,120 --> 03:07:18,790
by the way went to that same order we
almost like

11366
03:07:18,790 --> 03:07:18,800
almost like
 

11367
03:07:18,800 --> 03:07:21,190
almost like
we almost hit a wall coming out of 2013

11368
03:07:21,190 --> 03:07:21,200
we almost hit a wall coming out of 2013
 

11369
03:07:21,200 --> 03:07:21,990
we almost hit a wall coming out of 2013
where

11370
03:07:21,990 --> 03:07:22,000
where
 

11371
03:07:22,000 --> 03:07:23,910
where
we were so big on explaining why our

11372
03:07:23,910 --> 03:07:23,920
we were so big on explaining why our
 

11373
03:07:23,920 --> 03:07:25,910
we were so big on explaining why our
stuff was so high-tech and all the kind

11374
03:07:25,910 --> 03:07:25,920
stuff was so high-tech and all the kind
 

11375
03:07:25,920 --> 03:07:27,510
stuff was so high-tech and all the kind
of like great technology in it and how

11376
03:07:27,510 --> 03:07:27,520
of like great technology in it and how
 

11377
03:07:27,520 --> 03:07:29,830
of like great technology in it and how
cool it is and so forth um to having to

11378
03:07:29,830 --> 03:07:29,840
cool it is and so forth um to having to
 

11379
03:07:29,840 --> 03:07:32,469
cool it is and so forth um to having to
make a super hard pivot on why is it fun

11380
03:07:32,469 --> 03:07:32,479
make a super hard pivot on why is it fun
 

11381
03:07:32,479 --> 03:07:34,950
make a super hard pivot on why is it fun
and why did like does the random kind of

11382
03:07:34,950 --> 03:07:34,960
and why did like does the random kind of
 

11383
03:07:34,960 --> 03:07:36,150
and why did like does the random kind of
family of

11384
03:07:36,150 --> 03:07:36,160
family of
 

11385
03:07:36,160 --> 03:07:38,469
family of
four need this right like so it's

11386
03:07:38,469 --> 03:07:38,479
four need this right like so it's
 

11387
03:07:38,479 --> 03:07:39,830
four need this right like so it's
learnings but

11388
03:07:39,830 --> 03:07:39,840
learnings but
 

11389
03:07:39,840 --> 03:07:41,750
learnings but
that's that's the challenge and i think

11390
03:07:41,750 --> 03:07:41,760
that's that's the challenge and i think
 

11391
03:07:41,760 --> 03:07:43,750
that's that's the challenge and i think
like robotics tends to sometimes fall

11392
03:07:43,750 --> 03:07:43,760
like robotics tends to sometimes fall
 

11393
03:07:43,760 --> 03:07:46,230
like robotics tends to sometimes fall
into the new category problem but then

11394
03:07:46,230 --> 03:07:46,240
into the new category problem but then
 

11395
03:07:46,240 --> 03:07:48,550
into the new category problem but then
you gotta be really crisp about why

11396
03:07:48,550 --> 03:07:48,560
you gotta be really crisp about why
 

11397
03:07:48,560 --> 03:07:50,230
you gotta be really crisp about why
it needs to exist well i think some of

11398
03:07:50,230 --> 03:07:50,240
it needs to exist well i think some of
 

11399
03:07:50,240 --> 03:07:52,710
it needs to exist well i think some of
robotics depending on the category

11400
03:07:52,710 --> 03:07:52,720
robotics depending on the category
 

11401
03:07:52,720 --> 03:07:55,670
robotics depending on the category
depending on the application

11402
03:07:55,670 --> 03:07:55,680
depending on the application
 

11403
03:07:55,680 --> 03:07:57,590
depending on the application
is a little bit of a marketing

11404
03:07:57,590 --> 03:07:57,600
is a little bit of a marketing
 

11405
03:07:57,600 --> 03:08:00,389
is a little bit of a marketing
this uh challenge and i don't i don't

11406
03:08:00,389 --> 03:08:00,399
this uh challenge and i don't i don't
 

11407
03:08:00,399 --> 03:08:01,990
this uh challenge and i don't i don't
mean

11408
03:08:01,990 --> 03:08:02,000
mean
 

11409
03:08:02,000 --> 03:08:02,870
mean
i mean

11410
03:08:02,870 --> 03:08:02,880
i mean
 

11411
03:08:02,880 --> 03:08:05,190
i mean
it's it's the kind of marketing that

11412
03:08:05,190 --> 03:08:05,200
it's it's the kind of marketing that
 

11413
03:08:05,200 --> 03:08:07,429
it's it's the kind of marketing that
weimo is doing that tesla is doing is

11414
03:08:07,429 --> 03:08:07,439
weimo is doing that tesla is doing is
 

11415
03:08:07,439 --> 03:08:08,630
weimo is doing that tesla is doing is
like

11416
03:08:08,630 --> 03:08:08,640
like
 

11417
03:08:08,640 --> 03:08:11,030
like
showing off incredible

engineering incredible technology
 

11421
03:08:13,760 --> 03:08:15,910
engineering incredible technology
but convincing like you said a family of

11422
03:08:15,910 --> 03:08:15,920
but convincing like you said a family of
 

11423
03:08:15,920 --> 03:08:18,150
but convincing like you said a family of
four that this this will this is like

11424

11429
03:08:21,920 --> 03:08:23,590
this is this is this is fun this is you
don't care about tech isn't your thing

11430
03:08:23,590 --> 03:08:23,600
don't care about tech isn't your thing
 

11431

need to know why they want it so some of
 

11435
03:08:26,560 --> 03:08:28,710
need to know why they want it so some of
that is just marketing yeah that's why

11436
03:08:28,710 --> 03:08:28,720
that is just marketing yeah that's why
 

11437
03:08:28,720 --> 03:08:31,269
that is just marketing yeah that's why
like roomba like um yes they didn't you

11438
03:08:31,269 --> 03:08:31,279
like roomba like um yes they didn't you
 

11439

go and you know have this like
 

11443
03:08:34,800 --> 03:08:36,710
go and you know have this like
you know huge huge con you know ramp

11444
03:08:36,710 --> 03:08:36,720
you know huge huge con you know ramp
 

11445
03:08:36,720 --> 03:08:38,469
you know huge huge con you know ramp
into like the entirety of like kind of a

11446
03:08:38,469 --> 03:08:38,479
into like the entirety of like kind of a
 

11447
03:08:38,479 --> 03:08:39,910
into like the entirety of like kind of a
robotics and so forth but like they

11448
03:08:39,910 --> 03:08:39,920
robotics and so forth but like they
 

11449
03:08:39,920 --> 03:08:42,389
robotics and so forth but like they
built a really great business and um uh

11450
03:08:42,389 --> 03:08:42,399
built a really great business and um uh
 

11451
03:08:42,399 --> 03:08:43,750
built a really great business and um uh
in a vacuum cleaner world and like

11452
03:08:43,750 --> 03:08:43,760
in a vacuum cleaner world and like
 

11453
03:08:43,760 --> 03:08:44,950
in a vacuum cleaner world and like
everybody understands what a vacuum

11454
03:08:44,950 --> 03:08:44,960
everybody understands what a vacuum
 

11455
03:08:44,960 --> 03:08:47,269
everybody understands what a vacuum
cleaner is um most people are annoyed by

11456
03:08:47,269 --> 03:08:47,279
cleaner is um most people are annoyed by
 

11457
03:08:47,279 --> 03:08:49,590
cleaner is um most people are annoyed by
doing it um and now you have one that

11458
03:08:49,590 --> 03:08:49,600
doing it um and now you have one that
 

11459
03:08:49,600 --> 03:08:51,429
doing it um and now you have one that
like kind of does it itself

11460
03:08:51,429 --> 03:08:51,439
like kind of does it itself
 

11461
03:08:51,439 --> 03:08:54,150
like kind of does it itself
uh yeah various degrees of quality but

11462
03:08:54,150 --> 03:08:54,160
uh yeah various degrees of quality but
 

11463
03:08:54,160 --> 03:08:55,590
uh yeah various degrees of quality but
that is so compelling that like it's

11464
03:08:55,590 --> 03:08:55,600
that is so compelling that like it's
 

11465
03:08:55,600 --> 03:08:58,550
that is so compelling that like it's
easier to understand and like uh and

11466
03:08:58,550 --> 03:08:58,560
easier to understand and like uh and
 

11467
03:08:58,560 --> 03:09:00,550
easier to understand and like uh and
they had a very kind of and i think they

11468
03:09:00,550 --> 03:09:00,560
they had a very kind of and i think they
 

11469
03:09:00,560 --> 03:09:01,990
they had a very kind of and i think they
have like 15 of the vacuum cleaner

11470
03:09:01,990 --> 03:09:02,000
have like 15 of the vacuum cleaner
 

11471
03:09:02,000 --> 03:09:03,590
have like 15 of the vacuum cleaner
market so it's like pretty successful

11472
03:09:03,590 --> 03:09:03,600
market so it's like pretty successful
 

11473
03:09:03,600 --> 03:09:04,309
market so it's like pretty successful
right

11474
03:09:04,309 --> 03:09:04,319
right
 

11475
03:09:04,319 --> 03:09:06,630
right
i think we need more of those um types

11476
03:09:06,630 --> 03:09:06,640
i think we need more of those um types
 

11477
03:09:06,640 --> 03:09:07,750
i think we need more of those um types
of thoughtful stepping stones in

11478
03:09:07,750 --> 03:09:07,760
of thoughtful stepping stones in
 

11479
03:09:07,760 --> 03:09:09,190
of thoughtful stepping stones in
robotics but the opportunities are

11480
03:09:09,190 --> 03:09:09,200
robotics but the opportunities are
 

11481
03:09:09,200 --> 03:09:10,870
robotics but the opportunities are
becoming bigger because

11482
03:09:10,870 --> 03:09:10,880
becoming bigger because
 

11483
03:09:10,880 --> 03:09:12,389
becoming bigger because
hardware's cheaper computes cheaper

11484
03:09:12,389 --> 03:09:12,399
hardware's cheaper computes cheaper
 

11485
03:09:12,399 --> 03:09:14,790
hardware's cheaper computes cheaper
clouds cheaper and ai's better so

11486
03:09:14,790 --> 03:09:14,800
clouds cheaper and ai's better so
 

11487
03:09:14,800 --> 03:09:16,790
clouds cheaper and ai's better so
there's a lot of opportunity if we zoom

11488
03:09:16,790 --> 03:09:16,800
there's a lot of opportunity if we zoom
 

11489
03:09:16,800 --> 03:09:18,870
there's a lot of opportunity if we zoom
out from specifically startups and

11490
03:09:18,870 --> 03:09:18,880
out from specifically startups and
 

11491
03:09:18,880 --> 03:09:22,150
out from specifically startups and

if you can convert that into a
 

11509
03:09:36,960 --> 03:09:39,590
if you can convert that into a
generalizable potion what advice would

11510

interested in technology um that might
 

11559
03:10:26,880 --> 03:10:28,389
interested in technology um that might
point to like go and study machine

11560
03:10:28,389 --> 03:10:28,399
point to like go and study machine
 

11561
03:10:28,399 --> 03:10:29,670
point to like go and study machine
learning because you don't have to

11562
03:10:29,670 --> 03:10:29,680
learning because you don't have to
 

11563
03:10:29,680 --> 03:10:30,790
learning because you don't have to
decide what career you're going to go

11564
03:10:30,790 --> 03:10:30,800
decide what career you're going to go
 

11565
03:10:30,800 --> 03:10:31,990
decide what career you're going to go
into but it's going to be such a

11566
03:10:31,990 --> 03:10:32,000
into but it's going to be such a
 

11567
03:10:32,000 --> 03:10:33,670
into but it's going to be such a
versatile space that's going to be at

that doesn't apply to just technology
 

11587
03:10:49,120 --> 03:10:50,870
that doesn't apply to just technology
right it's uh it could be the exact same

11588
03:10:50,870 --> 03:10:50,880
right it's uh it could be the exact same
 

11589
03:10:50,880 --> 03:10:53,429
right it's uh it could be the exact same
thing if you want to um you know the

11590
03:10:53,429 --> 03:10:53,439
thing if you want to um you know the
 

11591

11689
03:12:21,600 --> 03:12:23,590
people can be happy on
actually many kind of extremes on that

11690
03:12:23,590 --> 03:12:23,600
actually many kind of extremes on that
 

11691
03:12:23,600 --> 03:12:27,110
actually many kind of extremes on that
spectrum but it's easy to kind of

11692
03:12:27,110 --> 03:12:27,120
spectrum but it's easy to kind of
 

11693
03:12:27,120 --> 03:12:29,030
spectrum but it's easy to kind of
inadvertently make a choice

11694
03:12:29,030 --> 03:12:29,040
inadvertently make a choice
 

11695
03:12:29,040 --> 03:12:31,030
inadvertently make a choice
by how how you approach it that then

11696
03:12:31,030 --> 03:12:31,040
by how how you approach it that then
 

11697
03:12:31,040 --> 03:12:33,269
by how how you approach it that then
becomes really hard to unwind um

11698
03:12:33,269 --> 03:12:33,279
becomes really hard to unwind um
 

11699
03:12:33,279 --> 03:12:35,670
becomes really hard to unwind um
and so being very thoughtful about

11700
03:12:35,670 --> 03:12:35,680
and so being very thoughtful about
 

11701
03:12:35,680 --> 03:12:37,190
and so being very thoughtful about
kind of all of those dimensions makes a

11702
03:12:37,190 --> 03:12:37,200
kind of all of those dimensions makes a
 

11703
03:12:37,200 --> 03:12:38,630
kind of all of those dimensions makes a
lot of sense and so

11704
03:12:38,630 --> 03:12:38,640
lot of sense and so
 

11705
03:12:38,640 --> 03:12:40,950
lot of sense and so
um to come those are all interrelated um

11706
03:12:40,950 --> 03:12:40,960
um to come those are all interrelated um
