that I study the only checks and

that I study the only checks and
 

477

that I study the only checks and
balances on executive power are

478
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:54,950
balances on executive power are
 

479
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:58,400
balances on executive power are
circumstantial so for example distances

appealing to that kind of power to the
 

675
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:32,539
appealing to that kind of power to the
people I think we have to give credit to

676
00:15:32,539 --> 00:15:32,549
people I think we have to give credit to
 

677
00:15:32,549 --> 00:15:35,329
people I think we have to give credit to
President Putin for understanding the

00:15:35,329 --> 00:15:35,339
President Putin for understanding the
 

679
00:15:35,339 --> 00:15:39,739
President Putin for understanding the
psychology of the Russians who to whom

680
00:15:39,739 --> 00:15:39,749
psychology of the Russians who to whom
 

681
00:15:39,749 --> 00:15:43,009
psychology of the Russians who to whom
he appeals many of them were the losers

682
00:15:43,009 --> 00:15:43,019
he appeals many of them were the losers
 

683
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:46,369
he appeals many of them were the losers
in the transition from communism they

684
00:15:46,369 --> 00:15:46,379
in the transition from communism they
 

685
00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:48,319
in the transition from communism they
were the ones whose pensions were

686
00:15:48,319 --> 00:15:48,329
were the ones whose pensions were
 

687
00:15:48,329 --> 00:15:51,289
were the ones whose pensions were
destroyed by inflation or whose salaries

688
00:15:51,289 --> 00:15:51,299
destroyed by inflation or whose salaries
 

689
00:15:51,299 --> 00:15:53,539
destroyed by inflation or whose salaries
didn't go up or whose regions were

690
00:15:53,539 --> 00:15:53,549
didn't go up or whose regions were
 

691
00:15:53,549 --> 00:15:56,629
didn't go up or whose regions were
abandoned they were not the winners for

692
00:15:56,629 --> 00:15:56,639
abandoned they were not the winners for
 

693
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:59,869
abandoned they were not the winners for
the most part and so I think there's an

694
00:15:59,869 --> 00:15:59,879
the most part and so I think there's an
 

695
00:15:59,879 --> 00:16:01,340
the most part and so I think there's an
understanding on his part of their

696
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:01,350
understanding on his part of their
 

697
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:03,769
understanding on his part of their
psychology Putin has grown in the

698
00:16:03,769 --> 00:16:03,779
psychology Putin has grown in the
 

699
00:16:03,779 --> 00:16:06,079
psychology Putin has grown in the
position he was not a public politician

700
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:06,089
position he was not a public politician
 

701
00:16:06,089 --> 00:16:08,629
position he was not a public politician
when he first started out he was quite

702
00:16:08,629 --> 00:16:08,639
when he first started out he was quite
 

703
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:11,389
when he first started out he was quite
poor in public settings he didn't have

704
00:16:11,389 --> 00:16:11,399
poor in public settings he didn't have
 

705
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:13,549
poor in public settings he didn't have
the kind of political instincts that he

706
00:16:13,549 --> 00:16:13,559
the kind of political instincts that he
 

707
00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:16,159
the kind of political instincts that he
has now he didn't have the appeal to

708
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:16,169
has now he didn't have the appeal to
 

709
00:16:16,169 --> 00:16:18,289
has now he didn't have the appeal to
traditional values in the Orthodox

710
00:16:18,289 --> 00:16:18,299
traditional values in the Orthodox
 

711
00:16:18,299 --> 00:16:21,319
traditional values in the Orthodox
Church and some of the other dimensions

712
00:16:21,319 --> 00:16:21,329
Church and some of the other dimensions
 

713
00:16:21,329 --> 00:16:26,479
Church and some of the other dimensions
of his rule today so yes we have to give

714
00:16:26,479 --> 00:16:26,489
of his rule today so yes we have to give
 

715
00:16:26,489 --> 00:16:29,990
of his rule today so yes we have to give
some credit to Putin himself for this

716
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:30,000
some credit to Putin himself for this
 

717
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,119
some credit to Putin himself for this
in addition to the frustrations and the

718
00:16:32,119 --> 00:16:32,129
in addition to the frustrations and the
 

719
00:16:32,129 --> 00:16:34,910
in addition to the frustrations and the
mass of the people but let's think about

720
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:34,920
mass of the people but let's think about
 

721
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:35,840
mass of the people but let's think about
it this way

722
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:35,850
it this way
 

723
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:38,449
it this way
in addition without taking away the fact

724
00:16:38,449 --> 00:16:38,459
in addition without taking away the fact
 

725
00:16:38,459 --> 00:16:41,090
in addition without taking away the fact
that he's become a better politician

726
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:41,100
that he's become a better politician
 

727
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:44,319
that he's become a better politician
over time and that sentiment has shifted

728
00:16:44,319 --> 00:16:44,329
over time and that sentiment has shifted
 

729
00:16:44,329 --> 00:16:47,090
over time and that sentiment has shifted
because of the disappointments with the

730
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:47,100
because of the disappointments with the
 

731
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:51,559
because of the disappointments with the
transition with the population when I

732
00:16:51,559 --> 00:16:51,569
transition with the population when I
 

733
00:16:51,569 --> 00:16:56,079
transition with the population when I
asked my kids am I a good dad

734
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:56,089
asked my kids am I a good dad
 

735
00:16:56,089 --> 00:16:59,780
asked my kids am I a good dad
my kids don't have any other dad to

736
00:16:59,780 --> 00:16:59,790
my kids don't have any other dad to
 

737
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:03,079
my kids don't have any other dad to
measure me against I'm the only dad they

738
00:17:03,079 --> 00:17:03,089
measure me against I'm the only dad they
 

739
00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:05,480
measure me against I'm the only dad they
know and I'm the only dad they can

740
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:05,490
know and I'm the only dad they can
 

741
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:08,870
know and I'm the only dad they can
choose or not choose they think if they

742
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:08,880
choose or not choose they think if they
 

743
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,000
choose or not choose they think if they
don't choose me they still get me as dad

744
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:11,010
don't choose me they still get me as dad
 

745
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:12,220
don't choose me they still get me as dad
right

746
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:12,230
right
 

747
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:16,480
right
so with Putin today he's the only dad

748
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:16,490
so with Putin today he's the only dad
 

749
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:19,699
so with Putin today he's the only dad
that the Russian people have now if my

750
00:17:19,699 --> 00:17:19,709
that the Russian people have now if my
 

751
00:17:19,709 --> 00:17:21,500
that the Russian people have now if my
kids were introduced to alternative

752
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:21,510
kids were introduced to alternative
 

753
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:24,230
kids were introduced to alternative
fathers they might be better than me

754
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:24,240
fathers they might be better than me
 

755
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,820
fathers they might be better than me
they might be more loving more giving

756
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:27,830
they might be more loving more giving
 

757
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:32,149
they might be more loving more giving
funnier richer whatever it might be they

758
00:17:32,149 --> 00:17:32,159
funnier richer whatever it might be they
 

759
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:34,610
funnier richer whatever it might be they
might be more appealing there are some

760
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:34,620
might be more appealing there are some
 

761
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,860
might be more appealing there are some
blood ties there for sure with that I

762
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:36,870
blood ties there for sure with that I
 

763
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:37,940
blood ties there for sure with that I
have with my kids

764
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:37,950
have with my kids
 

765
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:39,830
have with my kids
but they would at least be able to

766
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:39,840
but they would at least be able to
 

767
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,690
but they would at least be able to
choose alternatives and then I would

768
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:41,700
choose alternatives and then I would
 

769
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:46,399
choose alternatives and then I would
have to win their favor in that

770
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:46,409
have to win their favor in that
 

771
00:17:46,409 --> 00:17:48,740
have to win their favor in that
constellation of alternatives if

772
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:48,750
constellation of alternatives if
 

773
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,810
constellation of alternatives if
President Putin were up against real

774
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:50,820
President Putin were up against real
 

775
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:53,750
President Putin were up against real
alternatives if the population had real

776
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:53,760
alternatives if the population had real
 

777
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,450
alternatives if the population had real
choice and that choice could express

778
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:56,460
choice and that choice could express
 

779
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:59,840
choice and that choice could express
itself and have resources and have media

itself and have resources and have media
 

781
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:02,320

and everything else the way he does
 

783
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:06,230
and everything else the way he does
maybe he would be very popular and maybe

784
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:06,240
maybe he would be very popular and maybe
 

785
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,539
maybe he would be very popular and maybe
his popularity would not be as great as

786
00:18:08,539 --> 00:18:08,549
his popularity would not be as great as
 

787
00:18:08,549 --> 00:18:11,330
his popularity would not be as great as
it currently is so the absence of

00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:11,340
it currently is so the absence of
 

789
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:14,680
it currently is so the absence of
alternatives is another factor that

790
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:14,690
alternatives is another factor that
 

791
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:18,020
alternatives is another factor that
reinforces his authority and his

popularity having said that there are
 

795
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:24,169

many authoritarian leaders who deny any

many authoritarian leaders who deny any
 

797
00:18:24,179 --> 00:18:26,840
many authoritarian leaders who deny any
alternatives to the population and are

alternatives to the population and are
 

799
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:30,020
alternatives to the population and are
not very popular so denial of

not very popular so denial of
 

801
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:32,120
not very popular so denial of
alternatives doesn't guarantee you the

alternatives doesn't guarantee you the
 

803
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:35,000
alternatives doesn't guarantee you the
popularity you still have to figure out

popularity you still have to figure out
 

805
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:37,100

with methods that were not conducive to
long-term success and stability the

long-term success and stability the

long-term success and stability the

rescue referring to is this of the
 

1133
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:42,490
rescue referring to is this of the
economic growth when Putin first tests

1134
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:42,500
economic growth when Putin first tests
 

1135
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,800
economic growth when Putin first tests
took office they had 10 years they had a

took office they had 10 years they had a
 

1137
00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:47,860
took office they had 10 years they had a
full decade of an average of 7% growth a

1138
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:47,870
full decade of an average of 7% growth a
 

1139
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:50,740
full decade of an average of 7% growth a
year which was phenomenal and is not

1140
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:50,750
year which was phenomenal and is not
 

1141
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:54,190
year which was phenomenal and is not
attributable predominantly to oil prices

1142
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:54,200
attributable predominantly to oil prices
 

1143
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,890
attributable predominantly to oil prices
during president Putin's first term as

1144
00:26:56,890 --> 00:26:56,900
during president Putin's first term as
 

1145
00:26:56,900 --> 00:27:00,300
during president Putin's first term as
president the average price of oil was

1146
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:00,310
president the average price of oil was
 

1147
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:04,120
president the average price of oil was
$35 a barrel during his second term as

1148
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:04,130
$35 a barrel during his second term as
 

1149
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:07,240
$35 a barrel during his second term as
president the average price was $70 a

1150
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:07,250
president the average price was $70 a
 

1151
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:11,230
president the average price was $70 a
barrel so during those two terms when

1152
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:11,240
barrel so during those two terms when
 

1153
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:13,800
barrel so during those two terms when
Russia was growing at about 7% a year

1154
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:13,810
Russia was growing at about 7% a year
 

1155
00:27:13,810 --> 00:27:17,950
Russia was growing at about 7% a year
oil prices were averaging somewhere

1156
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:17,960
oil prices were averaging somewhere
 

1157
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:20,920
oil prices were averaging somewhere
around $50 a barrel which is fine

1158
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:20,930
around $50 a barrel which is fine
 

1159
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:24,390
around $50 a barrel which is fine
but is not the reason because later on

1160
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:24,400
but is not the reason because later on
 

1161
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:28,270
but is not the reason because later on
when oil prices were over $100 a barrel

1162
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:28,280
when oil prices were over $100 a barrel
 

1163
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:31,660
when oil prices were over $100 a barrel
Russia stagnated so the initial growth

1164
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:31,670
Russia stagnated so the initial growth
 

1165
00:27:31,670 --> 00:27:33,340
Russia stagnated so the initial growth
do you think Putin deserves some credit

1166
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:33,350
do you think Putin deserves some credit
 

1167
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:35,770
do you think Putin deserves some credit
for that yes he does because he

1168
00:27:35,770 --> 00:27:35,780
for that yes he does because he
 

1169
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:38,770
for that yes he does because he
introduced some important liberalizing

1170
00:27:38,770 --> 00:27:38,780
introduced some important liberalizing
 

1171
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:39,450
introduced some important liberalizing
measures

1172
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:39,460
measures
 

1173
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:43,410
measures
he lowered taxes he allowed land to be

1174
00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:43,420
he lowered taxes he allowed land to be
 

1175
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:47,760
he lowered taxes he allowed land to be
bought and sold he deregulated many

1176
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:47,770
bought and sold he deregulated many
 

1177
00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:51,090
bought and sold he deregulated many
areas of the economy and so there was a

1178
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:51,100
areas of the economy and so there was a
 

1179
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:54,510
areas of the economy and so there was a
kind of intrapreneurial burst that were

1180
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:54,520
kind of intrapreneurial burst that were
 

1181
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:57,720
kind of intrapreneurial burst that were
that was partly attributable partly

1182
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:57,730
that was partly attributable partly
 

1183
00:27:57,730 --> 00:28:00,000
that was partly attributable partly
attributable to government policy during

1184
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:00,010
attributable to government policy during
 

1185
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:02,450
attributable to government policy during
his first term but also he was

1186
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:02,460
his first term but also he was
 

1187
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:06,000
his first term but also he was
consolidating political power and as I

1188
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:06,010
consolidating political power and as I
 

1189
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:08,460

said the methods he used overall for the

00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:08,470
said the methods he used overall for the
 

1191
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:12,300
said the methods he used overall for the
long term were not able to continue

00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:12,310
long term were not able to continue
 

1193
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:15,840
long term were not able to continue
sustain that success in addition we have

1194
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:15,850
sustain that success in addition we have
 

1195
00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:18,450
sustain that success in addition we have
to remember that China played a really

1196
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:18,460
to remember that China played a really
 

1197
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:22,650
to remember that China played a really
big role in the success of Russia in the

1198
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:22,660
big role in the success of Russia in the
 

1199
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:25,430
big role in the success of Russia in the
first two terms of Putin's presidency

1200
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:25,440
first two terms of Putin's presidency
 

1201
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:29,570
first two terms of Putin's presidency
because China's phenomenal growth

1202
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:29,580
because China's phenomenal growth
 

1203
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:33,420
because China's phenomenal growth
created insatiable demand for just about

1204

created insatiable demand for just about
 

1205

once produced and so China's global
 

1217
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:57,170

raising of global demand overall brought

raising of global demand overall brought
 

1219
00:28:57,180 --> 00:29:00,600
raising of global demand overall brought
soviet-era industry back from the dead

soviet-era industry back from the dead
 

1221
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:03,900
soviet-era industry back from the dead
and so there was something that happened

1222
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:03,910
and so there was something that happened
 

1223
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:06,960
and so there was something that happened
Soviet era industry fell off a cliff in

1224
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:06,970
Soviet era industry fell off a cliff in
 

1225
00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:10,250
Soviet era industry fell off a cliff in
the 1990s there was a decline in

1226
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:10,260
the 1990s there was a decline in
 

1227
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:12,180
the 1990s there was a decline in
manufacturing and industrial production

1228
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:12,190
manufacturing and industrial production
 

1229
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:14,910
manufacturing and industrial production
greater than in the great depression in

1230
00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:14,920
greater than in the great depression in
 

1231
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:18,000
greater than in the great depression in
the US but a lot of that came back

1232
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:18,010
the US but a lot of that came back
 

1233
00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:21,900
the US but a lot of that came back
online in the 2000s and that had to do

1234
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:21,910
online in the 2000s and that had to do
 

1235
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:24,360
online in the 2000s and that had to do
with China's phenomenal growth the trade

1236
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:24,370
with China's phenomenal growth the trade
 

1237
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:26,610
with China's phenomenal growth the trade
between China and Russia was not always

1238
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:26,620
between China and Russia was not always
 

1239
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:29,760
between China and Russia was not always
direct so this was an indirect effect

1240
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:29,770
direct so this was an indirect effect
 

1241
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:33,030
direct so this was an indirect effect
but raising global prices for the

1242
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:33,040
but raising global prices for the
 

1243
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:36,600
but raising global prices for the
commodities and the products the kind of

1244
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:36,610
commodities and the products the kind of
 

1245
00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:39,920
commodities and the products the kind of
lower and lower value products in

1246
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:39,930
lower and lower value products in
 

1247
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:42,300
lower and lower value products in
manufacturing not high-end stuff but

1248
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:42,310
manufacturing not high-end stuff but
 

1249
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:45,990
manufacturing not high-end stuff but
lower and stuff like steel or iron or

value-added is not
 

1255
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,810
value-added is not
but nonetheless which had been destroyed

1256
00:29:54,810 --> 00:29:54,820
but nonetheless which had been destroyed
 

1257
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:57,540
but nonetheless which had been destroyed
by the 1990s and after the Soviet

1258
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:57,550
by the 1990s and after the Soviet
 

1259
00:29:57,550 --> 00:30:00,000
by the 1990s and after the Soviet
collapse this was brought back to life

1260
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,010
collapse this was brought back to life
 

1261
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:03,060
collapse this was brought back to life
now you can do that once you can bring

1262
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:03,070
now you can do that once you can bring
 

1263
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:05,610
now you can do that once you can bring
Soviet era industry back to life once

1264
00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:05,620
Soviet era industry back to life once
 

1265
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:08,430
Soviet era industry back to life once
and that happened during Putin's first

1266
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:08,440
and that happened during Putin's first
 

1267
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,080
and that happened during Putin's first
two terms in addition to the

1268
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:10,090
two terms in addition to the
 

1269
00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:13,049
two terms in addition to the
liberalizing policies which spurred

1270
00:30:13,049 --> 00:30:13,059
liberalizing policies which spurred
 

1271
00:30:13,059 --> 00:30:15,299
liberalizing policies which spurred
intrapreneurial ISM and some small and

1272
00:30:15,299 --> 00:30:15,309
intrapreneurial ISM and some small and
 

1273
00:30:15,309 --> 00:30:18,240
intrapreneurial ISM and some small and
medium business the crash of the ruble

1274
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:18,250
medium business the crash of the ruble
 

1275
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:22,740
medium business the crash of the ruble
in 1998 which made Russian products much

1276
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:22,750
in 1998 which made Russian products much
 

1277
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:25,080
in 1998 which made Russian products much
cheaper abroad and made imports much

1278
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:25,090
cheaper abroad and made imports much
 

1279
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:28,740
cheaper abroad and made imports much
more expensive also facilitated the

1280
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:28,750
more expensive also facilitated the
 

1281
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:31,440
more expensive also facilitated the
resuscitation the revival of domestic

1282
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:31,450
resuscitation the revival of domestic
 

1283
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:34,470
resuscitation the revival of domestic
manufacturing so all of this came

1284
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:34,480
manufacturing so all of this came
 

1285
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:38,390
manufacturing so all of this came
together for that spectacular 10-year

big cost to pay for this regime
 

1433
00:34:18,669 --> 00:34:20,940
big cost to pay for this regime
and so whatever benefits this regime

country the disadvantage is the downside
 

1439
00:34:27,490 --> 00:34:30,510
country the disadvantage is the downside
the costs are also really high so we

1440
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:30,520
the costs are also really high so we

a stroke and a major stroke

a stroke and a major stroke
 

2121

00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:52,150
really returns as a full actor to power
before he dies of a fourth stroke in

00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:52,160
before he dies of a fourth stroke in
 

2125
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:56,450
before he dies of a fourth stroke in
January 1924 so a position is created

2126
00:51:56,450 --> 00:51:56,460
January 1924 so a position is created
 

2127

January 1924 so a position is created
for Stalin to run things on Lenin's

for Stalin to run things on Lenin's
 

2129
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:02,080
for Stalin to run things on Lenin's
behalf and then Lenin has a stroke and

2130
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:02,090
behalf and then Lenin has a stroke and
 

2131
00:52:02,090 --> 00:52:04,910
behalf and then Lenin has a stroke and
so Stalin now has this new position

2132
00:52:04,910 --> 00:52:04,920
so Stalin now has this new position
 

2133
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:08,360
so Stalin now has this new position
general secretary but he's the right

2139
00:52:13,770 --> 00:52:16,730
exercising day-to-day control over
affairs Stalin then uses this new

2140
00:52:16,730 --> 00:52:16,740
affairs Stalin then uses this new
 

2141
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:18,620
affairs Stalin then uses this new
position to create a personal

position to create a personal
 

2143
00:52:18,630 --> 00:52:21,500
position to create a personal
dictatorship inside the Bolshevik

2144
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:21,510
dictatorship inside the Bolshevik
 

2145
00:52:21,510 --> 00:52:24,080
dictatorship inside the Bolshevik
dictatorship which is the remarkable

2146
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:24,090
dictatorship which is the remarkable
 

2147
00:52:24,090 --> 00:52:26,120
dictatorship which is the remarkable
story I tried to tell so is there

2148
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:26,130
story I tried to tell so is there
 

2149
00:52:26,130 --> 00:52:29,450
story I tried to tell so is there
anything nefarious about any of what you

2150
00:52:29,450 --> 00:52:29,460
anything nefarious about any of what you
 

2151
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:30,590
anything nefarious about any of what you
just described

2152
00:52:30,590 --> 00:52:30,600
just described
 

2153
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:35,210
just described
so it seems conveniently that the

2154
00:52:35,210 --> 00:52:35,220
so it seems conveniently that the
 

2155
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:37,190
so it seems conveniently that the
positions created just for Stalin there

2156
00:52:37,190 --> 00:52:37,200
positions created just for Stalin there
 

2157

positions created just for Stalin there
was a few other brilliant people

00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:39,210
was a few other brilliant people
 

2159
00:52:39,210 --> 00:52:41,540
was a few other brilliant people
arguably more brilliant than Stalin in

2160
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:41,550
arguably more brilliant than Stalin in
 

2161
00:52:41,550 --> 00:52:43,880
arguably more brilliant than Stalin in
the vicinity of Lenin why was Stalin

2162
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:43,890
the vicinity of Lenin why was Stalin
 

2163
00:52:43,890 --> 00:52:48,700
the vicinity of Lenin why was Stalin
chosen why did Lenin all of a sudden

2164
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:48,710
chosen why did Lenin all of a sudden
 

2165
00:52:48,710 --> 00:52:52,670
chosen why did Lenin all of a sudden
fall ill as perhaps a conspiratorial

2166
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:52,680
fall ill as perhaps a conspiratorial
 

2167
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:54,680
fall ill as perhaps a conspiratorial
question but is there anything nefarious

2168
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:54,690
question but is there anything nefarious
 

2169
00:52:54,690 --> 00:52:58,220
question but is there anything nefarious
about any of this historical trajectory

2170
00:52:58,220 --> 00:52:58,230
about any of this historical trajectory
 

2171
00:52:58,230 --> 00:53:01,340
about any of this historical trajectory
to power that Stalin took in creating

2172
00:53:01,340 --> 00:53:01,350
to power that Stalin took in creating
 

2173
00:53:01,350 --> 00:53:03,410
to power that Stalin took in creating
the personal dictatorship so history is

2174
00:53:03,410 --> 00:53:03,420
the personal dictatorship so history is
 

2175
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:07,580
the personal dictatorship so history is
full of contingency and surprise after

2176
00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:07,590
full of contingency and surprise after
 

2177
00:53:07,590 --> 00:53:10,670
full of contingency and surprise after
something happens we all think it's

2178
00:53:10,670 --> 00:53:10,680
something happens we all think it's
 

2179
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:13,120
something happens we all think it's
inevitable it had to happen that way

2180
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:13,130
inevitable it had to happen that way
 

2181
00:53:13,130 --> 00:53:16,310
inevitable it had to happen that way
everything was leading up to it so

2182
00:53:16,310 --> 00:53:16,320
everything was leading up to it so
 

2183
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:19,910
everything was leading up to it so
Hitler seizes power in Germany in 1933

2184
00:53:19,910 --> 00:53:19,920
Hitler seizes power in Germany in 1933
 

2185
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:23,510
Hitler seizes power in Germany in 1933
and the Nazi regime gets

2186
00:53:23,510 --> 00:53:23,520
and the Nazi regime gets
 

2187
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:25,760
and the Nazi regime gets
institutionalized by several of his

2188
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:25,770
institutionalized by several of his
 

2189
00:53:25,770 --> 00:53:28,420
institutionalized by several of his
moves after being named Chancellor and

moves after being named Chancellor and
 

2191
00:53:28,430 --> 00:53:31,610
moves after being named Chancellor and
so all German history becomes a story of

2192
00:53:31,610 --> 00:53:31,620
so all German history becomes a story of
 

2193
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:34,190
so all German history becomes a story of
the Nazi rise to power Hitler's rise to

that outcome things which don't seem

that outcome things which don't seem
related to that outcome all of a sudden

00:53:44,150 --> 00:53:44,160
related to that outcome all of a sudden
 

2201
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:47,180

get bent in that direction and all the
 

2203
00:53:47,190 --> 00:53:49,730
get bent in that direction and all the
trends that were going on are no longer

it won't last
just like we discovered with Putin he

2336
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:54,690
just like we discovered with Putin he
 

2337
00:56:54,690 --> 00:56:56,480
just like we discovered with Putin he
had some qualities that we didn't

2338
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:56,490
had some qualities that we didn't
 

2339
00:56:56,490 --> 00:56:59,420
had some qualities that we didn't
foresee at the beginning and he's been

2340
00:56:59,420 --> 00:56:59,430
foresee at the beginning and he's been
 

2341
00:56:59,430 --> 00:57:02,540
foresee at the beginning and he's been
able to hold power not just be named and

2342
00:57:02,540 --> 00:57:02,550
able to hold power not just be named and
 

2343
00:57:02,550 --> 00:57:05,000
able to hold power not just be named and
now Putin and Stalin are very different

2344
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:05,010
now Putin and Stalin are very different
 

2345
00:57:05,010 --> 00:57:07,880
now Putin and Stalin are very different
people these are very different regimes

I wouldn't put them in the same sentence

2348
00:57:10,130 --> 00:57:10,140
I wouldn't put them in the same sentence
 

2349
00:57:10,140 --> 00:57:13,070
I wouldn't put them in the same sentence
my point is not that one resembles the

00:57:13,070 --> 00:57:13,080
my point is not that one resembles the
 

2351
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:17,180
my point is not that one resembles the
other my point is that when people come

2352
00:57:17,180 --> 00:57:17,190
other my point is that when people come
 

2353
00:57:17,190 --> 00:57:20,180
other my point is that when people come
to power for contingent reasons they

2354
00:57:20,180 --> 00:57:20,190
to power for contingent reasons they
 

2355
00:57:20,190 --> 00:57:22,670
to power for contingent reasons they
don't stay in power unless they're able

2356
00:57:22,670 --> 00:57:22,680
don't stay in power unless they're able
 

2357
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:25,280
don't stay in power unless they're able
to manage it and Stalin was able to

2358
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:25,290
to manage it and Stalin was able to
 

2359
00:57:25,290 --> 00:57:27,890
to manage it and Stalin was able to
build a personal dictatorship inside

2360
00:57:27,890 --> 00:57:27,900
build a personal dictatorship inside
 

2361
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:30,800
build a personal dictatorship inside
that dictatorship he was cunning he was

that dictatorship he was cunning he was
 

2363
00:57:30,810 --> 00:57:33,950
that dictatorship he was cunning he was
ruthless and he was a workaholic he was

capitalist system that was not a hundred
percent not a monolith but had a lot of

imperialism colonies that even the
 

2549
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:20,260
imperialism colonies that even the
democratic rule of law capitalist states

01:02:20,260 --> 01:02:20,270
democratic rule of law capitalist states
 

2551
01:02:20,270 --> 01:02:23,330
democratic rule of law capitalist states
had non democratic non rule of law

2552
01:02:23,330 --> 01:02:23,340
had non democratic non rule of law
 

2553
01:02:23,340 --> 01:02:26,990
had non democratic non rule of law
colonies under their rule so the image

2554
01:02:26,990 --> 01:02:27,000
colonies under their rule so the image
 

2555
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:30,080
colonies under their rule so the image
and reality of capitalism during that

2556
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:30,090
and reality of capitalism during that
 

2557
01:02:30,090 --> 01:02:32,570
and reality of capitalism during that
time period between World War one and

2558
01:02:32,570 --> 01:02:32,580
time period between World War one and
 

2559
01:02:32,580 --> 01:02:35,570
time period between World War one and
World War two was very different from

2560
01:02:35,570 --> 01:02:35,580
World War two was very different from
 

2561
01:02:35,580 --> 01:02:38,360
World War two was very different from
how it would become later and so in that

2562
01:02:38,360 --> 01:02:38,370
how it would become later and so in that
 

2563
01:02:38,370 --> 01:02:41,390
how it would become later and so in that
time period in that interwar conjuncture

2564
01:02:41,390 --> 01:02:41,400
time period in that interwar conjuncture
 

2565
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:44,890
time period in that interwar conjuncture
after World War one before World War two

2566
01:02:44,890 --> 01:02:44,900
after World War one before World War two
 

2567
01:02:44,900 --> 01:02:49,910
after World War one before World War two
communism held some appeal inside the

2568
01:02:49,910 --> 01:02:49,920
communism held some appeal inside the
 

2569
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:51,560
communism held some appeal inside the
Soviet Union for sure but even outside

01:02:51,560 --> 01:02:51,570
Soviet Union for sure but even outside

the
because the image and reality of

because the image and reality of
 

2575
01:02:54,180 --> 01:02:57,290
because the image and reality of
capitalism disappointed many people now

2576
01:02:57,290 --> 01:02:57,300
capitalism disappointed many people now
 

2577
01:02:57,300 --> 01:02:59,420
capitalism disappointed many people now
in the end communism was significantly

2578
01:02:59,420 --> 01:02:59,430
in the end communism was significantly
 

2579
01:02:59,430 --> 01:03:03,560
in the end communism was significantly
worse many more victims and the system

2580
01:03:03,560 --> 01:03:03,570
worse many more victims and the system
 

2581
01:03:03,570 --> 01:03:06,740
worse many more victims and the system
of course would eventually implode but

2582
01:03:06,740 --> 01:03:06,750
of course would eventually implode but
 

2583
01:03:06,750 --> 01:03:07,880
of course would eventually implode but
nonetheless there were real problems

2584
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:07,890
nonetheless there were real problems
 

2585
01:03:07,890 --> 01:03:11,180
nonetheless there were real problems
that communism tried to address it

2586
01:03:11,180 --> 01:03:11,190
that communism tried to address it
 

2587
01:03:11,190 --> 01:03:13,460
that communism tried to address it
didn't solve those problems it was not a

didn't solve those problems it was not a
 

2589
01:03:13,470 --> 01:03:15,950
didn't solve those problems it was not a
solution but it didn't come out of

2590
01:03:15,950 --> 01:03:15,960
solution but it didn't come out of
 

2591
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:18,890
solution but it didn't come out of
nowhere it came out of the context of

nowhere it came out of the context of
 

2593
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:21,740
nowhere it came out of the context of
that inner war period and so Stalin's

01:03:21,740 --> 01:03:21,750
that inner war period and so Stalin's
 

2595
01:03:21,750 --> 01:03:26,210
that inner war period and so Stalin's
rule some people saw it as potentially a

rule some people saw it as potentially a
 

2597
01:03:26,220 --> 01:03:30,260

better option than imperialism fascism

better option than imperialism fascism
 

2599
01:03:30,270 --> 01:03:33,109

and Great Depression having said that
 

2601
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:35,510
and Great Depression having said that
they were wrong it turned out that

01:03:35,510 --> 01:03:35,520
they were wrong it turned out that
 

2603
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:38,090
they were wrong it turned out that
Stalin wasn't a better alternative to

2604
01:03:38,090 --> 01:03:38,100
Stalin wasn't a better alternative to
 

2605
01:03:38,100 --> 01:03:41,030
Stalin wasn't a better alternative to
markets and private property and rule of

01:03:48,260 --> 01:03:48,270
become clearer to people until after
 

2611
01:03:48,270 --> 01:03:51,830
become clearer to people until after
World War two after Nazism had been

fascist Italy had been defeated and

fascist Italy had been defeated and

decolonization had happened around the
 

2621
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:01,340
decolonization had happened around the
world and there was a middle class

2622
01:04:01,340 --> 01:04:01,350
world and there was a middle class
 

2623
01:04:01,350 --> 01:04:04,910
world and there was a middle class
economic boom in the period from the

economic boom in the period from the
 

2625
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:08,270
economic boom in the period from the
late 40s through the 70s that created a

2626
01:04:08,270 --> 01:04:08,280
late 40s through the 70s that created a
 

2627
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:10,190
late 40s through the 70s that created a
kind of mass middle class in many

2628
01:04:10,190 --> 01:04:10,200
kind of mass middle class in many
 

2629
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:13,099
kind of mass middle class in many
societies so capitalism rose from the

2630
01:04:13,099 --> 01:04:13,109
societies so capitalism rose from the
 

2631
01:04:13,109 --> 01:04:17,630
societies so capitalism rose from the
ashes as it were and this changed the

2632
01:04:17,630 --> 01:04:17,640
ashes as it were and this changed the
 

2633
01:04:17,640 --> 01:04:21,380
ashes as it were and this changed the
game for Stalin and communism communism

2634
01:04:21,380 --> 01:04:21,390
game for Stalin and communism communism
 

2635
01:04:21,390 --> 01:04:24,830
game for Stalin and communism communism
is about an alternative to capitalism

2636
01:04:24,830 --> 01:04:24,840
is about an alternative to capitalism
 

2637
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:28,880
is about an alternative to capitalism
and if that alternative is not superior

2638
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:28,890
and if that alternative is not superior
 

2639
01:04:28,890 --> 01:04:31,910
and if that alternative is not superior
there's no reason for communism to exist

2640
01:04:31,910 --> 01:04:31,920
there's no reason for communism to exist
 

2641
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:35,510
there's no reason for communism to exist
but if capitalism is in foul odor if

2642
01:04:35,510 --> 01:04:35,520
but if capitalism is in foul odor if
 

2643
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:39,950
but if capitalism is in foul odor if
people have a bad opinion a strong

01:04:39,950 --> 01:04:39,960
people have a bad opinion a strong
 

2645
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:41,870
people have a bad opinion a strong
critique of capitalism that can be

2646
01:04:41,870 --> 01:04:41,880
critique of capitalism that can be
 

2647
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:43,970
critique of capitalism that can be
appealed to alternatives and that's kind

2648
01:04:43,970 --> 01:04:43,980
appealed to alternatives and that's kind
 

2649
01:04:43,980 --> 01:04:47,060
appealed to alternatives and that's kind
of what happened with Stalin's rule but

2650
01:04:47,060 --> 01:04:47,070
of what happened with Stalin's rule but
 

2651
01:04:47,070 --> 01:04:50,660
of what happened with Stalin's rule but
after World War two the context changed

2652
01:04:50,660 --> 01:04:50,670
after World War two the context changed
 

2653
01:04:50,670 --> 01:04:53,000
after World War two the context changed
a lot capitalism was very different much

2654
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:53,010
a lot capitalism was very different much
 

2655
01:04:53,010 --> 01:04:56,240
a lot capitalism was very different much
more successful not a non-violence

2656
01:04:56,240 --> 01:04:56,250
more successful not a non-violence
 

2657
01:04:56,250 --> 01:04:58,190
more successful not a non-violence
compared to what it was in the interwar

2658
01:04:58,190 --> 01:04:58,200
compared to what it was in the interwar
 

2659
01:04:58,200 --> 01:05:01,550
compared to what it was in the interwar
period and the Soviet Union had a tough

2660
01:05:01,550 --> 01:05:01,560
period and the Soviet Union had a tough
 

2661
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:05,000
period and the Soviet Union had a tough
time competing against that new context

2662
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:05,010
time competing against that new context
 

2663
01:05:05,010 --> 01:05:09,200
time competing against that new context
now today we see similarly that the

2664
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:09,210
now today we see similarly that the
 

2665
01:05:09,210 --> 01:05:11,599
now today we see similarly that the
image and reality of capitalism is on

2666
01:05:11,599 --> 01:05:11,609
image and reality of capitalism is on
 

2667
01:05:11,609 --> 01:05:14,450
image and reality of capitalism is on
the question again which leads some

2668
01:05:14,450 --> 01:05:14,460
the question again which leads some
 

2669
01:05:14,460 --> 01:05:18,200
the question again which leads some
people to find an answer in socialism as

2670
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:18,210
people to find an answer in socialism as
 

2671
01:05:18,210 --> 01:05:20,990
people to find an answer in socialism as
an alternative so you just kind of

2672
01:05:20,990 --> 01:05:21,000
an alternative so you just kind of
 

2673
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,370
an alternative so you just kind of
painted a beautiful picture of

2674
01:05:22,370 --> 01:05:22,380
painted a beautiful picture of
 

2675
01:05:22,380 --> 01:05:23,990
painted a beautiful picture of
comparison this is the way we think

2676
01:05:23,990 --> 01:05:24,000
comparison this is the way we think
 

2677
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:27,349
comparison this is the way we think
about ideologies because we is what's

2678
01:05:27,349 --> 01:05:27,359
about ideologies because we is what's
 

2679
01:05:27,359 --> 01:05:29,900
about ideologies because we is what's
working better do you separate in your

2680
01:05:29,900 --> 01:05:29,910
working better do you separate in your
 

2681
01:05:29,910 --> 01:05:32,830
working better do you separate in your
mind the ideals of communism to the

2682
01:05:32,830 --> 01:05:32,840
mind the ideals of communism to the
 

2683
01:05:32,840 --> 01:05:35,270
mind the ideals of communism to the
Stalinist implementation of communism

2684
01:05:35,270 --> 01:05:35,280
Stalinist implementation of communism
 

2685
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:38,630
Stalinist implementation of communism
and again capitalism and American

2686
01:05:38,630 --> 01:05:38,640
and again capitalism and American
 

2687
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:42,080
and again capitalism and American
implementation of capitalism and as we

2688
01:05:42,080 --> 01:05:42,090
implementation of capitalism and as we
 

2689
01:05:42,090 --> 01:05:44,630
implementation of capitalism and as we
look at now the 21st century where yes

2690
01:05:44,630 --> 01:05:44,640
look at now the 21st century where yes
 

2691
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:50,420
look at now the 21st century where yes
this idea you know of socialism being a

2692
01:05:50,420 --> 01:05:50,430
this idea you know of socialism being a
 

2693
01:05:50,430 --> 01:05:53,570
this idea you know of socialism being a
potential political system that we would

2694
01:05:53,570 --> 01:05:53,580
potential political system that we would
 

2695
01:05:53,580 --> 01:05:55,400
potential political system that we would
or economic system would operate under

2696
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:55,410
or economic system would operate under
 

2697
01:05:55,410 --> 01:05:58,550
or economic system would operate under
in the United States rising up again as

2698
01:05:58,550 --> 01:05:58,560
in the United States rising up again as
 

2699
01:05:58,560 --> 01:06:00,740
in the United States rising up again as
an idea so how do we think about that

2700
01:06:00,740 --> 01:06:00,750
an idea so how do we think about that
 

2701
01:06:00,750 --> 01:06:03,800
an idea so how do we think about that
again in the 21st century about these

2702
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:03,810
again in the 21st century about these
 

2703
01:06:03,810 --> 01:06:06,530
again in the 21st century about these
ideas fundamental deep ideas of

2704
01:06:06,530 --> 01:06:06,540
ideas fundamental deep ideas of
 

2705
01:06:06,540 --> 01:06:08,630
ideas fundamental deep ideas of
communism capitalism yeah so in the

2706
01:06:08,630 --> 01:06:08,640
communism capitalism yeah so in the
 

2707
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:11,690
communism capitalism yeah so in the
Marxist schema there was something

2708
01:06:11,690 --> 01:06:11,700
Marxist schema there was something
 

2709
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:14,599
Marxist schema there was something
called feudalism which was supposedly

2710
01:06:14,599 --> 01:06:14,609
called feudalism which was supposedly
 

2711
01:06:14,609 --> 01:06:17,420
called feudalism which was supposedly
destroyed by the bourgeoisie who created

2712
01:06:17,420 --> 01:06:17,430
destroyed by the bourgeoisie who created
 

2713
01:06:17,430 --> 01:06:20,210
destroyed by the bourgeoisie who created
capitalism and then the working class

2714
01:06:20,210 --> 01:06:20,220
capitalism and then the working class
 

2715
01:06:20,220 --> 01:06:22,580
capitalism and then the working class
was supposed to destroy capitalism and

2716
01:06:22,580 --> 01:06:22,590
was supposed to destroy capitalism and
 

2717
01:06:22,590 --> 01:06:26,120
was supposed to destroy capitalism and
create socialism but socialism wasn't

2718
01:06:26,120 --> 01:06:26,130
create socialism but socialism wasn't
 

2719
01:06:26,130 --> 01:06:28,220
create socialism but socialism wasn't
the end stage the end stage was going to

2720
01:06:28,220 --> 01:06:28,230
the end stage the end stage was going to
 

2721
01:06:28,230 --> 01:06:31,040
the end stage the end stage was going to
be communism so that's why the communist

2722
01:06:31,040 --> 01:06:31,050
be communism so that's why the communist
 

2723
01:06:31,050 --> 01:06:33,440
be communism so that's why the communist
party in the Soviet Union first built

2724
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:33,450
party in the Soviet Union first built
 

2725
01:06:33,450 --> 01:06:37,609
party in the Soviet Union first built
socialism transcending capitalism the

2726
01:06:37,609 --> 01:06:37,619
socialism transcending capitalism the
 

2727
01:06:37,619 --> 01:06:39,800
socialism transcending capitalism the
next stage was socialism and the end

2728
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:39,810
next stage was socialism and the end
 

2729
01:06:39,810 --> 01:06:43,700
next stage was socialism and the end
game the final stage was communism so

2730
01:06:43,700 --> 01:06:43,710
game the final stage was communism so
 

2731
01:06:43,710 --> 01:06:45,859
game the final stage was communism so
their version of socialism was derived

2732
01:06:45,859 --> 01:06:45,869
their version of socialism was derived
 

2733
01:06:45,869 --> 01:06:50,930
their version of socialism was derived
from Marx and Marx argued that the

2734
01:06:50,930 --> 01:06:50,940
from Marx and Marx argued that the
 

2735
01:06:50,940 --> 01:06:54,740
from Marx and Marx argued that the
problem was capitalism had been very

2736
01:06:54,740 --> 01:06:54,750
problem was capitalism had been very
 

2737
01:06:54,750 --> 01:06:58,580
problem was capitalism had been very
beneficial for a while it had produced

2738
01:06:58,580 --> 01:06:58,590
beneficial for a while it had produced
 

2739
01:06:58,590 --> 01:07:01,490
beneficial for a while it had produced
greater wealth and greater opportunities

2740
01:07:01,490 --> 01:07:01,500
greater wealth and greater opportunities
 

2741
01:07:01,500 --> 01:07:04,670
greater wealth and greater opportunities
and feudalism had but then it had come

2742
01:07:04,670 --> 01:07:04,680
and feudalism had but then it had come
 

2743
01:07:04,680 --> 01:07:07,070
and feudalism had but then it had come
to serve only the narrow interests of

2744
01:07:07,070 --> 01:07:07,080
to serve only the narrow interests of
 

2745
01:07:07,080 --> 01:07:08,960
to serve only the narrow interests of
the so called booze huazi or the

2746
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:08,970
the so called booze huazi or the
 

2747
01:07:08,970 --> 01:07:11,720
the so called booze huazi or the
capitalists themselves and so for

2748
01:07:11,720 --> 01:07:11,730
capitalists themselves and so for
 

2749
01:07:11,730 --> 01:07:15,830
capitalists themselves and so for
Humanity's sake the universal class the

2750
01:07:15,830 --> 01:07:15,840
Humanity's sake the universal class the
 

2751
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:17,630
Humanity's sake the universal class the
working class needed to overthrow

2752
01:07:17,630 --> 01:07:17,640
working class needed to overthrow
 

2753
01:07:17,640 --> 01:07:18,530
working class needed to overthrow
capitalist

2754
01:07:18,530 --> 01:07:18,540
capitalist
 

2755
01:07:18,540 --> 01:07:20,870
capitalist
in order for greater productivity

2756
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:20,880
in order for greater productivity
 

2757
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:24,140
in order for greater productivity
greater wealth to be produced for all of

2758
01:07:24,140 --> 01:07:24,150
greater wealth to be produced for all of
 

2759
01:07:24,150 --> 01:07:26,480
greater wealth to be produced for all of
humanity to flourish and on a higher

2760
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:26,490
humanity to flourish and on a higher
 

2761
01:07:26,490 --> 01:07:29,830
humanity to flourish and on a higher
level so you couldn't have socialism

2762
01:07:29,830 --> 01:07:29,840
level so you couldn't have socialism
 

2763
01:07:29,840 --> 01:07:33,170
level so you couldn't have socialism
unless you destroyed capitalism so that

2764
01:07:33,170 --> 01:07:33,180
unless you destroyed capitalism so that
 

2765
01:07:33,180 --> 01:07:37,540
unless you destroyed capitalism so that
meant no markets no private property no

2766
01:07:37,540 --> 01:07:37,550
meant no markets no private property no
 

2767
01:07:37,550 --> 01:07:40,010
meant no markets no private property no
so-called Parliament's or bourgeois

2768
01:07:40,010 --> 01:07:40,020
so-called Parliament's or bourgeois
 

2769
01:07:40,020 --> 01:07:42,410
so-called Parliament's or bourgeois
Parliament's as they were called so you

2770
01:07:42,410 --> 01:07:42,420
Parliament's as they were called so you
 

2771
01:07:42,420 --> 01:07:45,890
Parliament's as they were called so you
got socialism in Marxist schema by

2772
01:07:45,890 --> 01:07:45,900
got socialism in Marxist schema by
 

2773
01:07:45,900 --> 01:07:49,330
got socialism in Marxist schema by
transcending by eliminating capitalism

2774
01:07:49,330 --> 01:07:49,340
transcending by eliminating capitalism
 

2775
01:07:49,340 --> 01:07:55,790
transcending by eliminating capitalism
now Marx also called for freedom he said

2776
01:07:55,790 --> 01:07:55,800
now Marx also called for freedom he said
 

2777
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:57,860
now Marx also called for freedom he said
that this elimination of markets and

2778
01:07:57,860 --> 01:07:57,870
that this elimination of markets and
 

2779
01:07:57,870 --> 01:07:59,960
that this elimination of markets and
private property and bourgeois

2780
01:07:59,960 --> 01:07:59,970
private property and bourgeois
 

2781
01:07:59,970 --> 01:08:01,490
private property and bourgeois
Parliament's would produce greater

2782
01:08:01,490 --> 01:08:01,500
Parliament's would produce greater
 

2783
01:08:01,500 --> 01:08:04,180
Parliament's would produce greater
freedom in addition to greater abundance

2784
01:08:04,180 --> 01:08:04,190
freedom in addition to greater abundance
 

2785
01:08:04,190 --> 01:08:08,150
freedom in addition to greater abundance
however everywhere this was tried it

2786
01:08:08,150 --> 01:08:08,160
however everywhere this was tried it
 

2787
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:13,100
however everywhere this was tried it
produced tyranny and mass violence death

2788
01:08:13,100 --> 01:08:13,110
produced tyranny and mass violence death
 

2789
01:08:13,110 --> 01:08:16,460
produced tyranny and mass violence death
and shortages everywhere it was tried

2790
01:08:16,460 --> 01:08:16,470
and shortages everywhere it was tried
 

2791
01:08:16,470 --> 01:08:18,820
and shortages everywhere it was tried
there's no exception in historical terms

2792
01:08:18,820 --> 01:08:18,830
there's no exception in historical terms
 

2793
01:08:18,830 --> 01:08:22,690
there's no exception in historical terms
and so it's very interesting Marx

2794
01:08:22,690 --> 01:08:22,700
and so it's very interesting Marx
 

2795
01:08:22,700 --> 01:08:25,700
and so it's very interesting Marx
insisted that capitalism had to be

2796
01:08:25,700 --> 01:08:25,710
insisted that capitalism had to be
 

2797
01:08:25,710 --> 01:08:26,510
insisted that capitalism had to be
eliminated

2798
01:08:26,510 --> 01:08:26,520
eliminated
 

2799
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:29,120
eliminated
you couldn't have markets markets were

2800
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:29,130
you couldn't have markets markets were
 

2801
01:08:29,130 --> 01:08:30,710
you couldn't have markets markets were
chaos you needed planning

2802
01:08:30,710 --> 01:08:30,720
chaos you needed planning
 

2803
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:35,120
chaos you needed planning
you couldn't have wait a hiring of wage

2804
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:35,130
you couldn't have wait a hiring of wage
 

2805
01:08:35,130 --> 01:08:37,940
you couldn't have wait a hiring of wage
labor that was wage slavery now you

2806
01:08:37,940 --> 01:08:37,950
labor that was wage slavery now you
 

2807
01:08:37,950 --> 01:08:39,590
labor that was wage slavery now you
couldn't have private property because

2808
01:08:39,590 --> 01:08:39,600
couldn't have private property because
 

2809
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:43,730
couldn't have private property because
that was a form of theft so in the

2810
01:08:43,730 --> 01:08:43,740
that was a form of theft so in the
 

2811
01:08:43,740 --> 01:08:46,249
that was a form of theft so in the
Marxist scheme somehow you were going to

2812
01:08:46,249 --> 01:08:46,259
Marxist scheme somehow you were going to
 

2813
01:08:46,259 --> 01:08:49,570
Marxist scheme somehow you were going to
eliminate capitalism and get to freedom

2814
01:08:49,570 --> 01:08:49,580
eliminate capitalism and get to freedom
 

2815
01:08:49,580 --> 01:08:51,920
eliminate capitalism and get to freedom
it turned out you didn't get to freedom

2816
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:51,930
it turned out you didn't get to freedom
 

2817
01:08:51,930 --> 01:08:54,230
it turned out you didn't get to freedom
so then people said well you can't blame

2818
01:08:54,230 --> 01:08:54,240
so then people said well you can't blame
 

2819
01:08:54,240 --> 01:08:58,519
so then people said well you can't blame
Marx because he said we needed freedom

2820
01:08:58,519 --> 01:08:58,529
Marx because he said we needed freedom
 

2821
01:08:58,529 --> 01:09:01,370
Marx because he said we needed freedom
he was Pro freedom so it's kind of like

2822
01:09:01,370 --> 01:09:01,380
he was Pro freedom so it's kind of like
 

2823
01:09:01,380 --> 01:09:04,999
he was Pro freedom so it's kind of like
dropping a nuclear bomb you say you're

2824
01:09:04,999 --> 01:09:05,009
dropping a nuclear bomb you say you're
 

2825
01:09:05,009 --> 01:09:09,499
dropping a nuclear bomb you say you're
gonna drop a nuclear bomb but you want

2826
01:09:09,499 --> 01:09:09,509
gonna drop a nuclear bomb but you want
 

2827
01:09:09,509 --> 01:09:12,970
gonna drop a nuclear bomb but you want
to minimize civilian casualties

2828
01:09:12,970 --> 01:09:12,980

 

2829
01:09:12,980 --> 01:09:15,650

so the dropping of the nuclear bomb is

2830
01:09:15,650 --> 01:09:15,660
so the dropping of the nuclear bomb is
 

2831
01:09:15,660 --> 01:09:17,420
so the dropping of the nuclear bomb is
the elimination of markets private

2832
01:09:17,420 --> 01:09:17,430
the elimination of markets private
 

2833
01:09:17,430 --> 01:09:21,349
the elimination of markets private
property in Parliament's but you're

2834
01:09:21,349 --> 01:09:21,359
property in Parliament's but you're
 

2835
01:09:21,359 --> 01:09:23,300
property in Parliament's but you're
going to bring freedom or you're going

2836
01:09:23,300 --> 01:09:23,310
going to bring freedom or you're going
 

2837
01:09:23,310 --> 01:09:25,849
going to bring freedom or you're going
to minimize civilian casualties so you

2838
01:09:25,849 --> 01:09:25,859
to minimize civilian casualties so you
 

2839
01:09:25,859 --> 01:09:28,400
to minimize civilian casualties so you
drop the nuclear bomb you eliminate the

2840
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:28,410
drop the nuclear bomb you eliminate the
 

2841
01:09:28,410 --> 01:09:32,770
drop the nuclear bomb you eliminate the
capitalism and you get famine

2842
01:09:32,770 --> 01:09:32,780
capitalism and you get famine
 

2843
01:09:32,780 --> 01:09:36,380
capitalism and you get famine
deportation no constraints on executive

2844
01:09:36,380 --> 01:09:36,390
deportation no constraints on executive
 

2845
01:09:36,390 --> 01:09:39,320
deportation no constraints on executive
power and not abundance but shortages

2846
01:09:39,320 --> 01:09:39,330
power and not abundance but shortages
 

2847
01:09:39,330 --> 01:09:42,410
power and not abundance but shortages
and people say well that's not what I

2848
01:09:42,410 --> 01:09:42,420
and people say well that's not what I
 

2849
01:09:42,420 --> 01:09:44,420
and people say well that's not what I
mark said that's not what I said

2850
01:09:44,420 --> 01:09:44,430
mark said that's not what I said
 

2851
01:09:44,430 --> 01:09:46,460
mark said that's not what I said
I said I wanted to minimize civilian

2852
01:09:46,460 --> 01:09:46,470
I said I wanted to minimize civilian
 

2853
01:09:46,470 --> 01:09:49,340
I said I wanted to minimize civilian
casualties the nuclear bomb goes off and

2854
01:09:49,340 --> 01:09:49,350
casualties the nuclear bomb goes off and
 

2855
01:09:49,350 --> 01:09:52,460
casualties the nuclear bomb goes off and
there's mass civilian casualties and you

2856
01:09:52,460 --> 01:09:52,470
there's mass civilian casualties and you
 

2857
01:09:52,470 --> 01:09:56,390
there's mass civilian casualties and you
keep saying but I said drop the bomb but

2858
01:09:56,390 --> 01:09:56,400
keep saying but I said drop the bomb but
 

2859
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:58,850
keep saying but I said drop the bomb but

those Marxists those socialists became

2902
01:11:03,740 --> 01:11:03,750
those Marxists those socialists became
 

2903
01:11:03,750 --> 01:11:06,790
those Marxists those socialists became
what we would call Social Democrats or

2904
01:11:06,790 --> 01:11:06,800
what we would call Social Democrats or
 

2905
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:09,170
what we would call Social Democrats or
people who would use the state to

private property in markets and so this

2914
01:11:22,700 --> 01:11:22,710
private property in markets and so this
 

2915
01:11:22,710 --> 01:11:25,640
private property in markets and so this
in the Marxist schema was apostasy

2916
01:11:25,640 --> 01:11:25,650
in the Marxist schema was apostasy
 

2917
01:11:25,650 --> 01:11:28,610
in the Marxist schema was apostasy
because they were accepting markets and

2918

01:11:30,950 --> 01:11:30,960
private property they were accepting
 

2921
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:33,680

alienation and wage slavery they were

01:11:33,680 --> 01:11:33,690
alienation and wage slavery they were
 

2923
01:11:33,690 --> 01:11:37,070
alienation and wage slavery they were
accepting capitalism in principle what

2924
01:11:37,070 --> 01:11:37,080
accepting capitalism in principle what
 

2925
01:11:37,080 --> 01:11:39,020
accepting capitalism in principle what
they wanted to fix it they wanted to

2926
01:11:39,020 --> 01:11:39,030
they wanted to fix it they wanted to
 

2927
01:11:39,030 --> 01:11:41,540
they wanted to fix it they wanted to
ameliorate they wanted to regulate and

01:11:41,540 --> 01:11:41,550
ameliorate they wanted to regulate and
 

2929
01:11:41,550 --> 01:11:44,750
ameliorate they wanted to regulate and
so they became what was denounced as

3103
01:16:00,720 --> 01:16:03,860
having to co-sign the paperwork I took a
long time but nonetheless the category

3104
01:16:03,860 --> 01:16:03,870
long time but nonetheless the category
 

3105
01:16:03,870 --> 01:16:06,950
long time but nonetheless the category
citizen can expand and it can become a

citizen can expand and it can become a
 

3107
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:10,849
citizen can expand and it can become a
universal category so we have that

3108
01:16:10,849 --> 01:16:10,859
universal category so we have that
 

3109
01:16:10,859 --> 01:16:14,509

the citizen universal humanity model of
the American Revolution which was deeply

3112
01:16:17,839 --> 01:16:17,849
the American Revolution which was deeply
 

3113
01:16:17,849 --> 01:16:20,959
the American Revolution which was deeply
flawed at the time it was introduced but

3114
01:16:20,959 --> 01:16:20,969
flawed at the time it was introduced but
 

3115
01:16:20,969 --> 01:16:24,649
flawed at the time it was introduced but
fixable over time we also had that

3116
01:16:24,649 --> 01:16:24,659
fixable over time we also had that
 

3117
01:16:24,659 --> 01:16:26,899
fixable over time we also had that
separation of powers and constraint on

3118
01:16:26,899 --> 01:16:26,909
separation of powers and constraint on
 

3119
01:16:26,909 --> 01:16:28,669
separation of powers and constraint on
executive power that we began this

3120
01:16:28,669 --> 01:16:28,679
executive power that we began this
 

3121
01:16:28,679 --> 01:16:30,829
executive power that we began this
conversation with that was also

3122
01:16:30,829 --> 01:16:30,839
conversation with that was also
 

3123
01:16:30,839 --> 01:16:32,629
conversation with that was also
institutionalized in the American

3124
01:16:32,629 --> 01:16:32,639
institutionalized in the American
 

3125
01:16:32,639 --> 01:16:35,449
institutionalized in the American
Revolution because they were afraid of

3126
01:16:35,449 --> 01:16:35,459
Revolution because they were afraid of
 

3127
01:16:35,459 --> 01:16:38,469

tyranny they were afraid of

3128
01:16:38,469 --> 01:16:38,479
tyranny they were afraid of
 

3129
01:16:38,479 --> 01:16:41,239
tyranny they were afraid of
unconstrained executive power so they

3130
01:16:41,239 --> 01:16:41,249
unconstrained executive power so they
 

3131
01:16:41,249 --> 01:16:44,139
unconstrained executive power so they
built a system that would contain that

3132
01:16:44,139 --> 01:16:44,149
built a system that would contain that
 

3133
01:16:44,149 --> 01:16:46,629
built a system that would contain that
constrain it institutionally not

3134
01:16:46,629 --> 01:16:46,639
constrain it institutionally not
 

3135
01:16:46,639 --> 01:16:49,299
constrain it institutionally not
circumstantially so that's a great gift

3136
01:16:49,299 --> 01:16:49,309
circumstantially so that's a great gift
 

3137
01:16:49,309 --> 01:16:53,389
circumstantially so that's a great gift

3888
01:35:16,680 --> 01:35:16,690
it and so it's horrible when wars break
 

3889
01:35:16,690 --> 01:35:20,190
it and so it's horrible when wars break
out in the humanitarian catastrophes for

3890
01:35:20,190 --> 01:35:20,200
out in the humanitarian catastrophes for
 

3891
01:35:20,200 --> 01:35:23,730
out in the humanitarian catastrophes for
example Yemen and Syria and several

3892
01:35:23,730 --> 01:35:23,740
example Yemen and Syria and several
 

3893
01:35:23,740 --> 01:35:26,250
example Yemen and Syria and several
other places I could name today it's

3894
01:35:26,250 --> 01:35:26,260
other places I could name today it's
 

3895
01:35:26,260 --> 01:35:28,770
other places I could name today it's
just horrible what you see there and the

3896
01:35:28,770 --> 01:35:28,780
just horrible what you see there and the
 

3897
01:35:28,780 --> 01:35:32,070
just horrible what you see there and the
scale is colossal for those places but

3898
01:35:32,070 --> 01:35:32,080
scale is colossal for those places but
 

3899
01:35:32,080 --> 01:35:35,360
scale is colossal for those places but
it's not planetary scale and so avoiding

3900
01:35:35,360 --> 01:35:35,370
it's not planetary scale and so avoiding
 

3901
01:35:35,370 --> 01:35:38,970
it's not planetary scale and so avoiding
planetary scale destruction is really

3902
01:35:38,970 --> 01:35:38,980
planetary scale destruction is really
 

3903
01:35:38,980 --> 01:35:41,790
planetary scale destruction is really
important for us and so having those

3904
01:35:41,790 --> 01:35:41,800
important for us and so having those
 

3905
01:35:41,800 --> 01:35:45,680
important for us and so having those
different interests be somehow managed

3906
01:35:45,680 --> 01:35:45,690
different interests be somehow managed
 

3907
01:35:45,690 --> 01:35:49,680
different interests be somehow managed
in a way that they don't that no one

3908
01:35:49,680 --> 01:35:49,690
in a way that they don't that no one
 

3909
01:35:49,690 --> 01:35:53,880
in a way that they don't that no one
sees advantage in a violent resolution

3910
01:35:53,880 --> 01:35:53,890
sees advantage in a violent resolution
 

3911
01:35:53,890 --> 01:35:55,770
sees advantage in a violent resolution
and a part of that is remembering

3912
01:35:55,770 --> 01:35:55,780
and a part of that is remembering
 

3913
01:35:55,780 --> 01:35:57,780
and a part of that is remembering
history so they should read your books

3914
