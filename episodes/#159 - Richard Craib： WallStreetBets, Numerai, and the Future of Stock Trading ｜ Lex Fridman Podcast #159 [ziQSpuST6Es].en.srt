173
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,430
and looking at the mechanisms that these
are wall street bets

174
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:03,440
are wall street bets

00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,149
um and and then also to see that
how big of an impact that that

00:03:16,149 --> 00:03:16,159
how big of an impact that that
 

185
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,309
how big of an impact that that
decentralized coordination had

186
00:03:18,309 --> 00:03:18,319
decentralized coordination had
 

187
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:21,430
decentralized coordination had
um it really was a big deal well you're

incredible level of coordination could
happen

218
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:49,760
happen
 

219
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,830
happen
where a lot of people come together and

behavior that happens after that
 

225
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:57,670
behavior that happens after that
no it's not at all um obvious and one of

226
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:57,680
no it's not at all um obvious and one of
 

227
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,789
no it's not at all um obvious and one of
the reasons is the

228
00:03:58,789 --> 00:03:58,799
the reasons is the
 

229
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,750
the reasons is the
lack of kind of like credibility to

00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:01,760
lack of kind of like credibility to
 

231

our wall street bets like some of them

240
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:12,560
our wall street bets like some of them
 

241
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,550
our wall street bets like some of them
are like deep value

242
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:14,560
are like deep value
 

243
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,390
are like deep value
is one of them that's an actual username

244
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:16,400
is one of them that's an actual username
 

245
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,990
is one of them that's an actual username
by the way we're talking about

246
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:18,000
by the way we're talking about
 

247
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,590
by the way we're talking about
there's a website called reddit and

248
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:19,600
there's a website called reddit and
 

249
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,030
there's a website called reddit and
there's subreddits on it

250
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:21,040
there's subreddits on it
 

251
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,230
there's subreddits on it
and a lot of people mostly anonymous i

252
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:24,240
and a lot of people mostly anonymous i
 

253
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,110
and a lot of people mostly anonymous i
i think for the most part anonymous can

254
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:27,120
i think for the most part anonymous can
 

255
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,950
i think for the most part anonymous can
create user accounts and then can then

256
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:28,960
create user accounts and then can then
 

257
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:29,430
create user accounts and then can then
just

258
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:29,440

uh if you don't know what red is maybe
 

267
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,830
uh if you don't know what red is maybe
go to uh

268

go to uh
 

269
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,270
go to uh
the ah sub subreddit first aww

270
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:41,280
the ah sub subreddit first aww
 

271

reddit when you when you get into it
more go to our wall street vets

280
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:48,800
more go to our wall street vets
 

281
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,350
more go to our wall street vets
it gets dark quickly oh we'll probably

282
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:51,360
it gets dark quickly oh we'll probably
 

283
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,230
it gets dark quickly oh we'll probably
talk about that too

284
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:52,240
talk about that too
 

285
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,150
talk about that too
uh so so yeah so there's these users

286
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:56,160
uh so so yeah so there's these users
 

287
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,670
uh so so yeah so there's these users
and it's there's no contracts like

288
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:57,680
and it's there's no contracts like
 

289
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,030
and it's there's no contracts like
you're saying there's no contracts the

290
00:04:59,030 --> 00:04:59,040
you're saying there's no contracts the
 

291
00:04:59,040 --> 00:04:59,590
you're saying there's no contracts the
the

292
00:04:59,590 --> 00:04:59,600
the
 

293
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,909
the
users are anonymous um but there are

294
00:05:01,909 --> 00:05:01,919
users are anonymous um but there are
 

295
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:03,510
users are anonymous um but there are
little things that that do help

296
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:03,520
little things that that do help
 

297
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,590
little things that that do help
so for example if you've posted a really

298
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:05,600
so for example if you've posted a really
 

299
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,670
so for example if you've posted a really
good investment idea in the past

300
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:07,680
good investment idea in the past
 

301
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,310
good investment idea in the past
that exists on reddit as well and it

302
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:10,320
that exists on reddit as well and it
 

303
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,070
that exists on reddit as well and it
might have lots of upvotes

304
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:12,080
might have lots of upvotes
 

305
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,070
might have lots of upvotes
um and that's also kind of like giving

306
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:14,080
um and that's also kind of like giving
 

307
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,749
um and that's also kind of like giving
credibility to your next

308
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:15,759
credibility to your next
 

309
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,310
credibility to your next
to your next thing um and then they are

310
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:18,320
to your next thing um and then they are
 

311
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,430
to your next thing um and then they are
also putting up

312
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:19,440
also putting up
 

313
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,390
also putting up
screenshots uh like this this is the

314
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:22,400
screenshots uh like this this is the
 

315
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:22,830
screenshots uh like this this is the
these

316
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:22,840
these
 

317
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,510
these
i here's the trades i've made and here's

318
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:25,520
i here's the trades i've made and here's
 

319
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,950
i here's the trades i've made and here's
a screenshot now you could fake the

320
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:26,960
a screenshot now you could fake the
 

321
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,070
a screenshot now you could fake the
screenshot

322
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:28,080
screenshot
 

323
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,870
screenshot
but um but but still it seems like if

324
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:30,880
but um but but still it seems like if
 

325
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,070
but um but but still it seems like if
you've got a lot of karma

326
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:32,080
you've got a lot of karma
 

327
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,469
you've got a lot of karma
and you've had a good performance on the

00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:37,840
it somehow becomes credible enough for
 

333
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,670
it somehow becomes credible enough for
other people to be like you know what

334
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:39,680
other people to be like you know what
 

335
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,909
other people to be like you know what
he actually probably did put a million

336
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:41,919
he actually probably did put a million
 

337
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:43,189
he actually probably did put a million
dollars into this

338
00:05:43,189 --> 00:05:43,199
dollars into this
 

339
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,189
dollars into this
and you know what i can i can follow

340
00:05:45,189 --> 00:05:45,199
and you know what i can i can follow
 

341
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:46,230
and you know what i can i can follow
that trade easily

342
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:46,240
that trade easily
 

343
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,510
that trade easily
and there's a bunch of people like that

344
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:47,520
and there's a bunch of people like that
 

345
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,510
and there's a bunch of people like that
so you're kind of uh integrating all

346
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:49,520
so you're kind of uh integrating all
 

347
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,110
so you're kind of uh integrating all
that information together yourself

348
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:51,120
that information together yourself
 

349
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,870
that information together yourself
to see like huh there's something

350
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:52,880
to see like huh there's something
 

351
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,390
to see like huh there's something
happening here and then you jump

352
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:54,400
happening here and then you jump
 

353
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,430
happening here and then you jump
onto this little boat of like behavior

354
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:57,440
onto this little boat of like behavior
 

355
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,390
onto this little boat of like behavior
like

person jumps on and uh all of a sudden
 

365
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:05,990
person jumps on and uh all of a sudden
you have

um tesla well now they do
um so what they did with this in this

388
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:28,720
um so what they did with this in this
 

389
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,350
um so what they did with this in this
case

390
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:29,360
case
 

391
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,189
case
they're buying a stock that was bad

392
00:06:31,189 --> 00:06:31,199
they're buying a stock that was bad
 

393
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,350
they're buying a stock that was bad
they're buying it because it was bad

394
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:33,360
they're buying it because it was bad
 

395
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,590
they're buying it because it was bad
and that's really weird because that's a

396
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:35,600
and that's really weird because that's a
 

397
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,110
and that's really weird because that's a
little bit um

398
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:37,120
little bit um
 

399
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,550
little bit um

how did they come up with it how did

404
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:43,360
how did they come up with it how did
 

405
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,029
how did they come up with it how did
they know that was the right one and the

406
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:45,039
they know that was the right one and the
 

407
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:46,469
they know that was the right one and the
reason they liked it

408
00:06:46,469 --> 00:06:46,479
reason they liked it
 

409
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:48,469
reason they liked it
is because it had really really high

410
00:06:48,469 --> 00:06:48,479
is because it had really really high
 

411
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:49,749
is because it had really really high
short interest

412
00:06:49,749 --> 00:06:49,759
short interest
 

413
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:52,469
short interest
it had been shorted uh more than its own

414
00:06:52,469 --> 00:06:52,479
it had been shorted uh more than its own
 

415
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:52,870
it had been shorted uh more than its own
uh

416
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:52,880
uh
 

417
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,150
uh
float i believe um and so they figured

418
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:56,160
float i believe um and so they figured
 

419
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,150
float i believe um and so they figured
out that if they all bought this bad

420
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:58,160
out that if they all bought this bad
 

421
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,430
out that if they all bought this bad
stock

422
00:06:59,430 --> 00:06:59,440
stock
 

423
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,150
stock
they could short squeeze some hedge

424
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:02,160
they could short squeeze some hedge
 

425
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,189
they could short squeeze some hedge
funds

426
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:03,199
funds
 

427
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:04,550
funds
and those hedge funds would have to

428
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:04,560
and those hedge funds would have to
 

429
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,629
and those hedge funds would have to
capitulate and buy the stock at really

430
00:07:06,629 --> 00:07:06,639
capitulate and buy the stock at really
 

431
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,230
capitulate and buy the stock at really
really high prices

432
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:08,240
really high prices
 

433
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,909
really high prices
and we should say that shorted means

434
00:07:09,909 --> 00:07:09,919
and we should say that shorted means
 

435
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:12,070
and we should say that shorted means
that these are a bunch of people

436
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:12,080
that these are a bunch of people
 

437
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,070
that these are a bunch of people
when you short a stock you're betting on

438
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:14,080
when you short a stock you're betting on
 

439
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,430
when you short a stock you're betting on
the on the

440
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:15,440
the on the
 

441
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,870
the on the
you're predicting the stock's going to

442
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:16,880
you're predicting the stock's going to
 

443
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,469
you're predicting the stock's going to
go down and then you will make money if

444
00:07:18,469 --> 00:07:18,479
go down and then you will make money if
 

445
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:19,510
go down and then you will make money if
it does

446
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:19,520
it does
 

447
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,230
it does
and then uh what's the short squeeze

448
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:22,240
and then uh what's the short squeeze
 

449
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,189
and then uh what's the short squeeze
it's really that

450
00:07:23,189 --> 00:07:23,199
it's really that
 

451
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:24,710
it's really that
if you if you are a hedge fund and you

452
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:24,720
if you if you are a hedge fund and you
 

453
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,230
if you if you are a hedge fund and you
take a big short position

454
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:26,240
take a big short position
 

455
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,589
take a big short position
in a in a company um there's a certain

456
00:07:29,589 --> 00:07:29,599
in a in a company um there's a certain
 

457
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:29,990
in a in a company um there's a certain
level

458
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:30,000
level
 

459
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,510
level
at which you can't sustain holding that

460
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:33,520
at which you can't sustain holding that
 

461
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,150
at which you can't sustain holding that
position

462
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:34,160
position
 

463
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,150
position
right there's no limit to how high a

464
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:36,160
right there's no limit to how high a
 

465
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,070
right there's no limit to how high a
stock can go but there is a limit to how

466
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:38,080
stock can go but there is a limit to how
 

467
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:38,629
stock can go but there is a limit to how
low

468
00:07:38,629 --> 00:07:38,639
low
 

469
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,309
low
it can go right so if you short

470
00:07:40,309 --> 00:07:40,319
it can go right so if you short
 

471
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:41,990
it can go right so if you short
something you have infinite loss

472
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:42,000
something you have infinite loss
 

473
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,110
something you have infinite loss
potential

474
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:43,120
potential
 

475
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,909
potential
and if the stock doubles overnight like

476
00:07:45,909 --> 00:07:45,919
and if the stock doubles overnight like
 

477
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,510
and if the stock doubles overnight like
gamestop did

478
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:47,520
gamestop did
 

479
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,550
gamestop did
um you're putting a lot of stress

480
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:50,560
um you're putting a lot of stress
 

481
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,550
um you're putting a lot of stress
on that hedge fund and that hedge fund

482
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:52,560
on that hedge fund and that hedge fund
 

483
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,670
on that hedge fund and that hedge fund
manager might have to say

484
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:53,680
manager might have to say
 

485
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,430
manager might have to say
you know what i have to get out of the

486
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:55,440
you know what i have to get out of the
 

487
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,670
you know what i have to get out of the
trade and the only way to get out

488
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:57,680
trade and the only way to get out
 

489
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,150
trade and the only way to get out
is to buy the bad stock that they don't

490
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:00,160
is to buy the bad stock that they don't
 

491
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,230
is to buy the bad stock that they don't
want like they believe will go down

492
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:02,240
want like they believe will go down
 

493
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,350
want like they believe will go down
uh so it's an interesting situation

494
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:05,360
uh so it's an interesting situation
 

495
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,029
uh so it's an interesting situation
particularly because it's not zero sum

496
00:08:09,029 --> 00:08:09,039
particularly because it's not zero sum
 

497
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,029
particularly because it's not zero sum
if you say let's make let's all get

498
00:08:11,029 --> 00:08:11,039
if you say let's make let's all get
 

499
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:12,070
if you say let's make let's all get
together and make a bubble

500
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:12,080

at this stage it feels like that's
really exciting

632

the same time
 

639
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,310
the same time
it's scary a little bit because

640
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:42,320
it's scary a little bit because

and so like uh just like elon right now
 

649
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,829
and so like uh just like elon right now
is like manipulating

650
00:10:53,829 --> 00:10:53,839
is like manipulating
 

651
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:56,069

uh encouraging people to buy dogecoin or

652
00:10:56,069 --> 00:10:56,079
uh encouraging people to buy dogecoin or
 

653

whatever uh
the the like that can be good

656
00:10:59,750 --> 00:10:59,760
the the like that can be good
 

657
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,190
the the like that can be good
charismatic leaders and there could be

658
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:01,200
charismatic leaders and there could be

and now he's gonna look wait for the
next thing and this decentralized

946
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:02,560
next thing and this decentralized
 

947
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,990
next thing and this decentralized
entity is just gonna get bigger and

948
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:04,000
entity is just gonna get bigger and
 

949
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,670
entity is just gonna get bigger and
bigger and they're gonna together search

950
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:05,680
bigger and they're gonna together search
 

951
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,550
bigger and they're gonna together search
for the next thing

952
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:06,560
for the next thing

00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:11,509
and they're going to probably search for
the next thing to attack

958
00:16:11,509 --> 00:16:11,519
the next thing to attack

00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:25,120
and honestly that's probably a little
 

971
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,150
and honestly that's probably a little
bit good

972
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:26,160
bit good
 

973
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,550

any of them except for one because

1054
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:52,400
any of them except for one because
 

1055
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,789
any of them except for one because
it was one of the meme stocks but

1056
00:17:56,789 --> 00:17:56,799

1058
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:00,160
yeah but it we shorting them
 

1059
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,470
yeah but it we shorting them
not to make them go we don't even want

1060
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:02,480
not to make them go we don't even want
 

1061
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,430
not to make them go we don't even want
them to go down

1062
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:03,440
them to go down
 

1063
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,950
them to go down
necessarily yeah that doesn't sound a

1064
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:04,960
necessarily yeah that doesn't sound a
 

1065
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,470
necessarily yeah that doesn't sound a
bit strange did i say that but

1066
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:06,480
bit strange did i say that but
 

1067
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,750
bit strange did i say that but
we just want them to to not go up as

1068
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:09,760
we just want them to to not go up as
 

1069
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,350
we just want them to to not go up as
much as our longs

1070
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:11,360
much as our longs
 

1071
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,390
much as our longs
right so by shorting

1072
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:14,400
right so by shorting
 

1073
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,510
right so by shorting
a little bit we can actually go along

1074
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:17,520
a little bit we can actually go along
 

1075
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,510
a little bit we can actually go along
more in the things we do believe in

1076
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:19,520
more in the things we do believe in
 

1077
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,470
more in the things we do believe in
so when we were going long in tesla we

1078
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:22,480
so when we were going long in tesla we
 

1079
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,870
so when we were going long in tesla we
could do it with more money than we had

1080
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:24,880
could do it with more money than we had
 

1081
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,830
could do it with more money than we had
because we would borrow from banks who

1082
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:27,840
because we would borrow from banks who
 

1083
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,630
because we would borrow from banks who
would lend us

1084
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:28,640
would lend us
 

1085
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,150
would lend us
money because we had longs and shorts

1086
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:32,160
money because we had longs and shorts
 

1087
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,390
money because we had longs and shorts
because we didn't have market exposure

1088
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:34,400
because we didn't have market exposure
 

1089
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,830
because we didn't have market exposure
we didn't have market risk

1090
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:35,840
we didn't have market risk
 

1091
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,350
we didn't have market risk
and so i think that's a good thing

1092
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:37,360
and so i think that's a good thing
 

1093
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,029
and so i think that's a good thing
because that means

1094
00:18:39,029 --> 00:18:39,039
because that means
 

1095
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:40,630
because that means
um you know we can short the oil

1096
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:40,640
um you know we can short the oil
 

1097
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,070
um you know we can short the oil
companies and go along tesla and make

1098
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:42,080
companies and go along tesla and make
 

1099
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,070
companies and go along tesla and make
the future come forward faster

1100
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:44,080
the future come forward faster
 

1101
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,110
the future come forward faster
and i do think that's not a bad thing

1102
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:47,120
and i do think that's not a bad thing
 

1103
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,430
and i do think that's not a bad thing
so we talked about this incredible

1104
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:49,440
so we talked about this incredible
 

1105
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,950
so we talked about this incredible
distributed system

1106
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:50,960
distributed system
 

1107
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,029
distributed system
created by wall street bets and then

1108
00:18:53,029 --> 00:18:53,039
created by wall street bets and then
 

1109
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:54,789
created by wall street bets and then
there's a platform

1110
00:18:54,789 --> 00:18:54,799
there's a platform
 

1111
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:57,590
there's a platform

there's those and there's others and
there's numerai that

1120
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:04,640
there's numerai that
 

1121
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,350
there's numerai that
allow you to make it accessible for

00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:52,240
but also to say like we don't know what
 

1805
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,149
but also to say like we don't know what
we're doing we have all these nazis

1806
00:30:54,149 --> 00:30:54,159
we're doing we have all these nazis

we don't we don't know how to like
 

1811
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,149
we don't we don't know how to like
handle it and just being real like that

1812
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:00,159
handle it and just being real like that
 

1813
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:02,549
handle it and just being real like that
i suppose that's just the skill maybe it

1814
00:31:02,549 --> 00:31:02,559
i suppose that's just the skill maybe it
 

1815
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:03,350
i suppose that's just the skill maybe it
can't be taught

1816
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:03,360
can't be taught
 

1817
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:06,230
can't be taught
but over time the whatever the dynamics

1818
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:06,240
but over time the whatever the dynamics
 

1819
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,669
but over time the whatever the dynamics
the company is it does seem like

1820
00:31:07,669 --> 00:31:07,679
the company is it does seem like
 

1821
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:08,950
the company is it does seem like
zuckerberg and others get

1822
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:08,960
zuckerberg and others get
 

1823
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,830
zuckerberg and others get
worn down they just get tired yeah uh

1824
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:11,840
worn down they just get tired yeah uh
 

1825
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:12,789

they get tired of

1826
00:31:12,789 --> 00:31:12,799
they get tired of
 

1827
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:14,789
they get tired of
not being real of not being real which

1828
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:14,799
not being real of not being real which
 

1829
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:16,310
not being real of not being real which
is uh sad

1830
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:16,320
is uh sad
 

1831
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,149
is uh sad
so let's talk about numerai which is an

1832
00:31:18,149 --> 00:31:18,159
so let's talk about numerai which is an
 

1833
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:19,909
so let's talk about numerai which is an
incredible

1834
00:31:19,909 --> 00:31:19,919
incredible
 

1835
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:23,590
incredible
company uh system idea

1836
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:23,600
company uh system idea
 

1837
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:27,029
company uh system idea
i think but good place to start

1838
00:31:27,029 --> 00:31:27,039
i think but good place to start
 

1839
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:30,549
i think but good place to start
what is numerai and how does it work

1840
00:31:30,549 --> 00:31:30,559
what is numerai and how does it work
 

1841
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:33,190
what is numerai and how does it work
so numero is the first hedge fund that

1842
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:33,200
so numero is the first hedge fund that
 

1843
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:33,830
so numero is the first hedge fund that
gives away

1844
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:33,840
gives away
 

1845
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,230
gives away
all of its data so this is like probably

1846
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:36,240
all of its data so this is like probably
 

1847
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,509
all of its data so this is like probably
the last thing

1848
00:31:37,509 --> 00:31:37,519
the last thing
 

1849
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:39,509
the last thing
a hedge fund would do right why would we

1850
00:31:39,509 --> 00:31:39,519
a hedge fund would do right why would we
 

1851
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:41,029
a hedge fund would do right why would we
give away a data it's like giving away

1852
00:31:41,029 --> 00:31:41,039
give away a data it's like giving away
 

1853
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:42,470
give away a data it's like giving away
your edge

1854
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:42,480
your edge
 

1855
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:45,509
your edge
um but the reason we do it is because

1856
00:31:45,509 --> 00:31:45,519
um but the reason we do it is because
 

1857
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:46,789
um but the reason we do it is because
we're looking for people

1858
00:31:46,789 --> 00:31:46,799
we're looking for people
 

1859
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:50,630
we're looking for people
to model our data and the way we do it

1860
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:50,640
to model our data and the way we do it
 

1861
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,870
to model our data and the way we do it
is by obfuscating the data

1862
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:52,880
is by obfuscating the data
 

1863
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,549
is by obfuscating the data
so when you get when you look at

1864
00:31:54,549 --> 00:31:54,559
so when you get when you look at
 

1865
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:56,230
so when you get when you look at
numerized data that you can download for

1866
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:56,240
numerized data that you can download for
 

1867
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,430
numerized data that you can download for
free

1868

it just looks like like a million rows

have no idea what the columns mean
 

1877
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,389
have no idea what the columns mean
but you do know that if you're good at

but you do know that if you're good at
 

1879

but you do know that if you're good at
machine learning or have done

machine learning or have done
 

1881
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,630
machine learning or have done
regressions before you know that i can

regressions before you know that i can
 

1883
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,789
regressions before you know that i can
still find patents on in this data even

1884
00:32:14,789 --> 00:32:14,799
still find patents on in this data even
 

1885
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:15,909
still find patents on in this data even
though i don't know

i don't know what the features mean and
 

1889
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:20,470
i don't know what the features mean and
and the data itself is time series data

1890
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:20,480
and the data itself is time series data
 

1891
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,190
and the data itself is time series data
and even though it's obfuscated

what is the source data like

1896
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:26,080
what is the source data like
 

1897
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,909
what is the source data like
approximately what are we talking about

1898
00:32:27,909 --> 00:32:27,919
approximately what are we talking about
 

1899
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:29,269
approximately what are we talking about
so we are buying

1900
00:32:29,269 --> 00:32:29,279
so we are buying
 

1901
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:31,750
so we are buying
data from lots of different data vendors

1902
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:31,760
data from lots of different data vendors
 

1903
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:32,310
data from lots of different data vendors
um

1904
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:32,320
um
 

1905
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,630
um
and they would also never want us to

1906
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:34,640
and they would also never want us to
 

1907
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,070
and they would also never want us to
share that data

1908

share that data
 

1909
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,549
share that data
um so we have strict contracts with them

1910
00:32:38,549 --> 00:32:38,559
um so we have strict contracts with them
 

1911
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:39,590
um so we have strict contracts with them
so we only

1912

so we only
 

1913
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,830
so we only
we only can but it but it's the kind of

1914
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:41,840
we only can but it but it's the kind of
 

1915
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,430
we only can but it but it's the kind of
data you could never buy yourself

1916
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:43,440
data you could never buy yourself
 

1917
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,909
data you could never buy yourself
unless you had maybe a million dollars a

year
 

1921
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,350
year
of budget to buy data so what's happened

1922
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:49,360
of budget to buy data so what's happened
 

1923
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,350
of budget to buy data so what's happened
with the hedge fund industry is

1924
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:51,360
with the hedge fund industry is
 

1925
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:54,549
with the hedge fund industry is
you have a lot of talented people

1926
00:32:54,549 --> 00:32:54,559
you have a lot of talented people
 

1927
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:58,070
you have a lot of talented people
who used to be able to trade

1928
00:32:58,070 --> 00:32:58,080
who used to be able to trade
 

1929
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,389
who used to be able to trade
and still can trade but now they have

1930
00:33:00,389 --> 00:33:00,399
and still can trade but now they have
 

1931
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:02,070
and still can trade but now they have
such a data disadvantage

1932
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:02,080
such a data disadvantage
 

1933
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,470
such a data disadvantage
it would never make sense for them to um

1934
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:04,480
it would never make sense for them to um
 

1935
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,269
it would never make sense for them to um
to

to
 

1937
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:07,990
to
to trade themselves but numerai by

1938
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:08,000
to trade themselves but numerai by
 

1939
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,750
to trade themselves but numerai by
giving away this obfuscated data we can

1940
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:09,760
giving away this obfuscated data we can
 

1941
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,590
giving away this obfuscated data we can
give them a really really high quality

1942
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:11,600
give them a really really high quality
 

1943
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,549
give them a really really high quality
data set that's

1944
00:33:12,549 --> 00:33:12,559
data set that's
 

1945
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:14,710
data set that's
that would otherwise be very expensive

1946
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:14,720
that would otherwise be very expensive
 

1947
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,710
that would otherwise be very expensive
and they can use whatever

1948
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:16,720
and they can use whatever
 

1949
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,909
and they can use whatever
new machine learning technique they want

1950
00:33:19,909 --> 00:33:19,919
new machine learning technique they want
 

1951
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:22,230
new machine learning technique they want
to find patterns in that data that we

1952
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:22,240
to find patterns in that data that we
 

1953
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,630
to find patterns in that data that we
can use in our hedge fund and so

1954
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:24,640
can use in our hedge fund and so
 

1955
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,630
can use in our hedge fund and so
how much variety is there in underlying

1956
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:26,640
how much variety is there in underlying
 

1957
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,990
how much variety is there in underlying
data we're talking about

1958
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:28,000
data we're talking about
 

1959
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,710
data we're talking about
uh i apologize if i'm using the wrong

1960
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:30,720
uh i apologize if i'm using the wrong
 

1961
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,590
uh i apologize if i'm using the wrong
terms but there's

1962
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:31,600
terms but there's
 

1963
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,470
terms but there's
one is just like the stock price the

1964
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:34,480
one is just like the stock price the
 

1965
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,310
one is just like the stock price the
other there's like options and all that

1966
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:36,320
other there's like options and all that
 

1967
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,590
other there's like options and all that
kind of stuff like the what are they

1968
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:37,600
kind of stuff like the what are they
 

1969
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,029
kind of stuff like the what are they
called order books or

1970
00:33:39,029 --> 00:33:39,039
called order books or
 

1971
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:43,269
called order books or
whatever like i is is there

1972
00:33:43,269 --> 00:33:43,279
whatever like i is is there
 

1973
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:45,269
whatever like i is is there
maybe other totally unrelated to

1974
00:33:45,269 --> 00:33:45,279
maybe other totally unrelated to
 

1975
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:47,029
maybe other totally unrelated to
directly to the stock market data

1976
00:33:47,029 --> 00:33:47,039
directly to the stock market data
 

1977
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:50,230
directly to the stock market data
like like the natural language as well

1978
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:50,240
like like the natural language as well
 

1979
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,190
like like the natural language as well
all that kind of stuff

1980
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:51,200
all that kind of stuff
 

1981
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,710
all that kind of stuff
yeah we were really focused on um stock

1982
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:54,720
yeah we were really focused on um stock
 

1983
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,909
yeah we were really focused on um stock
data that's specific to stocks so um

1984
00:33:57,909 --> 00:33:57,919
data that's specific to stocks so um
 

1985
00:33:57,919 --> 00:33:59,990
data that's specific to stocks so um
things like you can have like a p every

1986
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:00,000
things like you can have like a p every
 

1987
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,750
things like you can have like a p every
stock has like a p e ratio

1988
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:01,760
stock has like a p e ratio
 

1989
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,669
stock has like a p e ratio
for some stocks it's not as meaningful

1990
00:34:03,669 --> 00:34:03,679
for some stocks it's not as meaningful
 

1991
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:05,430
for some stocks it's not as meaningful
but every stock has that

1992
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:05,440
but every stock has that
 

1993
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,750
but every stock has that
every stock has one year momentum how

1994
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:07,760
every stock has one year momentum how
 

1995
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:10,069
every stock has one year momentum how
much they went up in the last year

1996
00:34:10,069 --> 00:34:10,079
much they went up in the last year
 

1997
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:12,550
much they went up in the last year
um but those are very common factors but

1998
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:12,560
um but those are very common factors but
 

1999
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,669
um but those are very common factors but
we try to get

2000
00:34:13,669 --> 00:34:13,679
we try to get
 

2001
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:15,589
we try to get
lots and lots of those factors that we

2002
00:34:15,589 --> 00:34:15,599
lots and lots of those factors that we
 

2003
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:17,909
lots and lots of those factors that we
have for many many years like 15

2004
00:34:17,909 --> 00:34:17,919
have for many many years like 15
 

2005
00:34:17,919 --> 00:34:21,430
have for many many years like 15
20 years history and

2006
00:34:21,430 --> 00:34:21,440
20 years history and
 

2007
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:24,470
20 years history and
and then the setup of the problem is

2008
00:34:24,470 --> 00:34:24,480
and then the setup of the problem is
 

2009
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,069
and then the setup of the problem is
commonly in quant called like

2010
00:34:26,069 --> 00:34:26,079
commonly in quant called like
 

2011
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:27,909
commonly in quant called like
cross-sectional global equity

2012
00:34:27,909 --> 00:34:27,919
cross-sectional global equity
 

2013
00:34:27,919 --> 00:34:29,829
cross-sectional global equity
you're not really trying to say i want i

2014
00:34:29,829 --> 00:34:29,839
you're not really trying to say i want i
 

2015
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:31,829
you're not really trying to say i want i
i believe this stock will go up

2016
00:34:31,829 --> 00:34:31,839
i believe this stock will go up
 

2017
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:34,389
i believe this stock will go up
you're trying to say um the like

2018
00:34:34,389 --> 00:34:34,399
you're trying to say um the like
 

2019
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:36,230
you're trying to say um the like
relative position of this stock

2020
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:36,240
relative position of this stock
 

2021
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:39,349
relative position of this stock
in feature space uh makes it not a bad

2022
00:34:39,349 --> 00:34:39,359
in feature space uh makes it not a bad
 

2023
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:39,990
in feature space uh makes it not a bad
buy

2024
00:34:39,990 --> 00:34:40,000
buy
 

2025
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,790
buy
in a in a portfolio so it captures some

2026
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:42,800
in a in a portfolio so it captures some
 

2027
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,389
in a in a portfolio so it captures some
period of time

2028
00:34:44,389 --> 00:34:44,399
period of time
 

2029
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:45,909
period of time
and you're trying to find the patterns

2030
00:34:45,909 --> 00:34:45,919
and you're trying to find the patterns
 

2031
00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:47,990
and you're trying to find the patterns
the dynamics captured by

2032
00:34:47,990 --> 00:34:48,000
the dynamics captured by
 

2033
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,149
the dynamics captured by
the data of that period of time in order

2034
00:34:50,149 --> 00:34:50,159
the data of that period of time in order
 

2035
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:51,829
the data of that period of time in order
to make short-term predictions about

2036
00:34:51,829 --> 00:34:51,839
to make short-term predictions about
 

2037
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:53,109
to make short-term predictions about
what's going to happen

2038
00:34:53,109 --> 00:34:53,119
what's going to happen
 

2039
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:54,710
what's going to happen
yeah so our predictions are also not

2040
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:54,720
yeah so our predictions are also not
 

2041
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:57,430
yeah so our predictions are also not
that short we're not really um

2042
00:34:57,430 --> 00:34:57,440
that short we're not really um
 

2043
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,109
that short we're not really um
caring about things like order books and

2044
00:34:59,109 --> 00:34:59,119
caring about things like order books and
 

2045
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:00,550
caring about things like order books and
and tech data

2046
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:00,560
and tech data
 

2047
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,630
and tech data
not high frequency at all we're actually

2048
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:02,640
not high frequency at all we're actually
 

2049
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,950
not high frequency at all we're actually
holding things for quite a bit longer

2050
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:04,960
holding things for quite a bit longer
 

2051
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,870
holding things for quite a bit longer
so our prediction time horizon is about

2052
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:06,880
so our prediction time horizon is about
 

2053
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,870
so our prediction time horizon is about
one month we end up holding stocks for

2054
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:08,880
one month we end up holding stocks for
 

2055
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,630
one month we end up holding stocks for
maybe like three or four months

2056
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:10,640
maybe like three or four months
 

2057
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,069
maybe like three or four months
so i kind of believe that's a little bit

2058
00:35:12,069 --> 00:35:12,079
so i kind of believe that's a little bit
 

2059
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:14,630
so i kind of believe that's a little bit
more like investing

2060
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:14,640
more like investing
 

2061
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:17,750
more like investing
than um then kind of plumbing

2062
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:17,760
than um then kind of plumbing
 

2063
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,950
than um then kind of plumbing
like to go long a stock that's mispriced

2064
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:20,960
like to go long a stock that's mispriced
 

2065
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,790
like to go long a stock that's mispriced
on one exchange and

2066
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:22,800
on one exchange and
 

2067
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,950
on one exchange and
shorter on another exchange that's just

2068
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:24,960
shorter on another exchange that's just
 

2069
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:25,990
shorter on another exchange that's just
arbitrage

2070
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:26,000
arbitrage
 

2071
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,430
arbitrage
but what we're trying to do is really

2072
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:27,440
but what we're trying to do is really
 

2073
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,190
but what we're trying to do is really
know know

2074
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:29,200
know know
 

2075
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,550
know know
know something more about the longer

2076
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:30,560
know something more about the longer
 

2077
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,550
know something more about the longer
term future of the stock yeah so from

2078
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:32,560
term future of the stock yeah so from
 

2079
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,790
term future of the stock yeah so from
the patterns from these like periods of

2080
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:34,800
the patterns from these like periods of
 

2081
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,150
the patterns from these like periods of
uh time series data you're trying to

2082
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:38,160
uh time series data you're trying to
 

2083
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,589
uh time series data you're trying to
understand something fundamental about

2084
00:35:39,589 --> 00:35:39,599
understand something fundamental about
 

2085
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:41,349
understand something fundamental about
the stock not

2086
00:35:41,349 --> 00:35:41,359
the stock not
 

2087
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:44,230
the stock not
like about deep value about like with

2088
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:44,240
like about deep value about like with
 

2089
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:44,950
like about deep value about like with
this big

2090
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:44,960
this big
 

2091
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,550
this big
in the context of the markets like

2092
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:46,560
in the context of the markets like
 

2093
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,150
in the context of the markets like
underpriced overpriced all that kind of

2094
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:48,160
underpriced overpriced all that kind of
 

2095
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:48,710
underpriced overpriced all that kind of
stuff

2096
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:48,720
stuff
 

2097
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:51,030
stuff
so like this is about investing it's not

2098
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:51,040
so like this is about investing it's not
 

2099
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,069
so like this is about investing it's not
about like

2100
00:35:52,069 --> 00:35:52,079
about like
 

2101
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:53,670
about like
just like you said high frequency

2102
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:53,680
just like you said high frequency
 

2103
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,670
just like you said high frequency
trading which i think is a

2104
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:55,680
trading which i think is a
 

2105
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,430
trading which i think is a
fascinating open question for a machine

2106
00:35:57,430 --> 00:35:57,440
fascinating open question for a machine
 

2107
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,109
fascinating open question for a machine
learning perspective but just to like

2108
00:35:59,109 --> 00:35:59,119
learning perspective but just to like
 

2109
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:00,790
learning perspective but just to like
sort of build on that

2110
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:00,800
sort of build on that
 

2111
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,190
sort of build on that
so you've anonymized the data and now

2112
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:03,200
so you've anonymized the data and now
 

2113
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,190
so you've anonymized the data and now
you're giving away the data

2114
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:05,200
you're giving away the data
 

2115
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:08,790
you're giving away the data
and then now anyone can

2116
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:08,800
and then now anyone can
 

2117
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:12,550
and then now anyone can
try to build algorithms that

2118
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:12,560
try to build algorithms that
 

2119
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,390
try to build algorithms that
make investing decisions on top of that

2120
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:14,400
make investing decisions on top of that
 

2121
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,910
make investing decisions on top of that
data or predictions on the top of that

2122
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:15,920
data or predictions on the top of that
 

2123
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:16,390
data or predictions on the top of that
data

2124
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:16,400
data
 

2125
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,750
data
exactly and so that that's um

2126
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:19,760
exactly and so that that's um
 

2127
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,270
exactly and so that that's um
what is that so what does that look like

2128
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:21,280
what is that so what does that look like
 

2129
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,550
what is that so what does that look like
what's the goal of that what are the

2130
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:22,560
what's the goal of that what are the
 

2131
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,190
what's the goal of that what are the
underlying

2132
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:23,200
underlying
 

2133
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,829
underlying
principles of that so the first thing is

2134
00:36:25,829 --> 00:36:25,839
principles of that so the first thing is
 

2135
00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:26,230
principles of that so the first thing is
you know

2136
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:26,240
you know
 

2137
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,829
you know
we could obviously model that data

2138
00:36:27,829 --> 00:36:27,839
we could obviously model that data
 

2139
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:30,069
we could obviously model that data
in-house right we can make

2140
00:36:30,069 --> 00:36:30,079
in-house right we can make
 

2141
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:33,270
in-house right we can make
an xg boost model on the data um

2142
00:36:33,270 --> 00:36:33,280
an xg boost model on the data um
 

2143
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:36,630
an xg boost model on the data um
and that would be quite good too but

2144
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:36,640
and that would be quite good too but
 

2145
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:39,750
and that would be quite good too but
what we're trying to do is by by opening

2146
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:39,760
what we're trying to do is by by opening
 

2147
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:39,990
what we're trying to do is by by opening
it

2148
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:40,000
it
 

2149
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,030
it
up and letting anybody participate we

2150
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:43,040
up and letting anybody participate we
 

2151
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:43,750
up and letting anybody participate we
can do

2152
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:43,760
can do
 

2153
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,390
can do
quite a lot better than if we modeled it

2154
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:46,400
quite a lot better than if we modeled it
 

2155
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,510
quite a lot better than if we modeled it
ourselves

2156
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:47,520
ourselves
 

2157
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,990
ourselves
and a lot better on the stock market

2158
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:50,000
and a lot better on the stock market
 

2159
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,109
and a lot better on the stock market
doesn't need to be

2160
00:36:51,109 --> 00:36:51,119
doesn't need to be
 

2161
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:53,510
doesn't need to be
very much like it really matters the

2162
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:53,520
very much like it really matters the
 

2163
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,109
very much like it really matters the
difference between if you can make

2164
00:36:55,109 --> 00:36:55,119
difference between if you can make
 

2165
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:57,670
difference between if you can make
10 and 12 in an equity market neutral

2166
00:36:57,670 --> 00:36:57,680
10 and 12 in an equity market neutral
 

2167
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:58,470
10 and 12 in an equity market neutral
hedge fund

2168
00:36:58,470 --> 00:36:58,480
hedge fund
 

2169
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,390
hedge fund
because the whole usually you're trying

2170
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:00,400
because the whole usually you're trying
 

2171
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,910
because the whole usually you're trying
you're charging two percent

2172
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:01,920
you're charging two percent
 

2173
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,950
you're charging two percent
fees so if you can do two percent better

2174
00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:04,960
fees so if you can do two percent better
 

2175
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,589
fees so if you can do two percent better
that's like all your fees it's worth it

2176
00:37:07,589 --> 00:37:07,599
that's like all your fees it's worth it
 

2177
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:08,150
that's like all your fees it's worth it
so

2178
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:08,160
so
 

2179
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,069
so
we're trying to make sure that we always

2180
00:37:10,069 --> 00:37:10,079
we're trying to make sure that we always
 

2181
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:11,670
we're trying to make sure that we always
have the best possible model as new

2182
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:11,680
have the best possible model as new
 

2183
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,270
have the best possible model as new
machine learning libraries come out

2184
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:13,280
machine learning libraries come out
 

2185
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,430
machine learning libraries come out
new new techniques come out they get

2186
00:37:15,430 --> 00:37:15,440
new new techniques come out they get
 

2187
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,030
new new techniques come out they get
automatically synthesized like if

2188
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:17,040
automatically synthesized like if
 

2189
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,310
automatically synthesized like if
there's a great paper

2190
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:18,320
there's a great paper
 

2191
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,230
there's a great paper
on supervised learning someone on

2192
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:20,240
on supervised learning someone on
 

2193
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,390
on supervised learning someone on
numerix will figure out how to use it on

2194
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:22,400
numerix will figure out how to use it on
 

2195
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,430
numerix will figure out how to use it on
numerized data

2196
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:23,440
numerized data
 

2197
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:26,870
numerized data
and is there an ensemble of

2198
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:26,880
and is there an ensemble of
 

2199
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,990
and is there an ensemble of
uh models going on or is it always

2200
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:30,000
uh models going on or is it always
 

2201
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,670
uh models going on or is it always
or is it more towards kind of like one

2202
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:31,680
or is it more towards kind of like one
 

2203
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,430
or is it more towards kind of like one
or two or three

2204
00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:33,440
or two or three
 

2205
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,829
or two or three
like best performing models so the way

2206
00:37:35,829 --> 00:37:35,839
like best performing models so the way
 

2207
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:37,750
like best performing models so the way
we decide on how to weight

2208
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:37,760
we decide on how to weight
 

2209
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:41,030
we decide on how to weight
all of the predictions together is

2210
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:41,040
all of the predictions together is
 

2211
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,430
all of the predictions together is
um by how much the users are staking on

2212
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:43,440
um by how much the users are staking on
 

2213
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,230
um by how much the users are staking on
them

2214
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:44,240
them
 

2215
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:46,230
them
oh yeah how much of the cryptocurrency

2216
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:46,240
oh yeah how much of the cryptocurrency
 

2217
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,230
oh yeah how much of the cryptocurrency
that they're putting behind their models

2218
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:48,240
that they're putting behind their models
 

2219
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,190
that they're putting behind their models
so they're saying

2220
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:49,200
so they're saying
 

2221
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,910
so they're saying
i believe in my model tr you can trust

2222
00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:51,920
i believe in my model tr you can trust
 

2223
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,190
i believe in my model tr you can trust
me because i'm going to put

2224
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:53,200
me because i'm going to put
 

2225
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:56,310
me because i'm going to put
skin in the game um and so we can take

2226
00:37:56,310 --> 00:37:56,320
skin in the game um and so we can take
 

2227
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,230
skin in the game um and so we can take
the stake weighted predictions from all

2228
00:37:58,230 --> 00:37:58,240
the stake weighted predictions from all
 

2229
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,510
the stake weighted predictions from all
our users

2230
00:37:59,510 --> 00:37:59,520
our users
 

2231
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,510
our users
add those together average those

2232
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:01,520
add those together average those
 

2233
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,670
add those together average those
together and that's a much better model

2234
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:03,680
together and that's a much better model
 

2235
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,910
together and that's a much better model
than any one model

2236
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:05,920
than any one model
 

2237
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,829
than any one model
in the in the sum because ensembling a

2238
00:38:07,829 --> 00:38:07,839
in the in the sum because ensembling a
 

2239
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:09,270
in the in the sum because ensembling a
lot of models together is kind of the

2240
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:09,280
lot of models together is kind of the
 

2241
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,950
lot of models together is kind of the
key thing you need to do in investing

2242
00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:10,960
key thing you need to do in investing
 

2243
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,310
key thing you need to do in investing
too

2244
00:38:12,310 --> 00:38:12,320
too
 

2245
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:15,430
too
yeah so you're putting there's the kind

2246
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:15,440
yeah so you're putting there's the kind
 

2247
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,790
yeah so you're putting there's the kind
of duality from the user

2248
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:16,800
of duality from the user
 

2249
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,150
of duality from the user
from the perspective of a machine

2250
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:18,160
from the perspective of a machine
 

2251
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,990
from the perspective of a machine
learning engineer you're

2252
00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:20,000
learning engineer you're
 

2253
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,910
learning engineer you're
it's both a competition just a really

2254
00:38:21,910 --> 00:38:21,920
it's both a competition just a really
 

2255
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,589
it's both a competition just a really
interesting difficult machine learning

2256
00:38:23,589 --> 00:38:23,599
interesting difficult machine learning
 

2257
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:24,710
interesting difficult machine learning
problem

2258
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:24,720
problem
 

2259
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:28,470
problem
and it's uh a way to to invest

2260
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:28,480
and it's uh a way to to invest
 

2261
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:31,510
and it's uh a way to to invest
algorithmically so like here and but

2262
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:31,520
algorithmically so like here and but
 

2263
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,829
algorithmically so like here and but
the the way to invest algorithmically

2264
00:38:33,829 --> 00:38:33,839
the the way to invest algorithmically
 

2265
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:35,510
the the way to invest algorithmically
also is a

2266
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:35,520
also is a
 

2267
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,589
also is a
way to put skin in the game that

2268
00:38:37,589 --> 00:38:37,599
way to put skin in the game that
 

2269
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:38,630
way to put skin in the game that
communicates to you

2270
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:38,640
communicates to you
 

2271
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:42,230
communicates to you
that your uh the the quality of the

2272
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:42,240
that your uh the the quality of the
 

2273
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:42,790
that your uh the the quality of the
algorithm

2274
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:42,800
algorithm
 

2275
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:46,150
algorithm
and also forces you to really uh

2276
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:46,160
and also forces you to really uh
 

2277
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:48,630
and also forces you to really uh
be serious about the models that you

2278
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:48,640
be serious about the models that you
 

2279
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:49,349
be serious about the models that you
build

2280
00:38:49,349 --> 00:38:49,359
build
 

2281
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:51,270
build
so it's like everything just works

2282
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:51,280
so it's like everything just works
 

2283
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,790
so it's like everything just works
nicely together like

2284
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:52,800
nicely together like
 

2285
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,870
nicely together like
um i guess one way to say that is the

2286
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:54,880
um i guess one way to say that is the
 

2287
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:57,030
um i guess one way to say that is the
interests are aligned

2288
00:38:57,030 --> 00:38:57,040
interests are aligned
 

2289
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:00,630
interests are aligned
exactly okay so uh it's just like poker

2290
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:00,640
exactly okay so uh it's just like poker
 

2291
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:03,589
exactly okay so uh it's just like poker
is not not fun when it's like for very

2292
00:39:03,589 --> 00:39:03,599
is not not fun when it's like for very
 

2293
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:04,630
is not not fun when it's like for very
low stakes

2294
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:04,640
low stakes
 

2295
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,390
low stakes
but the higher the stakes the more the

2296
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:06,400
but the higher the stakes the more the
 

2297
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,310
but the higher the stakes the more the
dynamics of the system starts playing

2298
00:39:08,310 --> 00:39:08,320
dynamics of the system starts playing
 

2299
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,670
dynamics of the system starts playing
out correctly

2300
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:09,680
out correctly
 

2301
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,710
out correctly
uh like as a small side note is there

2302
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:12,720
uh like as a small side note is there
 

2303
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:16,550
uh like as a small side note is there
something you can say about which kind

2304
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:16,560
something you can say about which kind
 

2305
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,470
something you can say about which kind
looking at the big broad view of machine

00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:26,310
what kind of algorithms seem to do
good in these kinds of competitions at

2312
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:26,320
good in these kinds of competitions at
 

2313
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,109
good in these kinds of competitions at
this time

00:39:27,109 --> 00:39:27,119
this time
 

2315
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:29,670
this time
is there some universal thing you can

2316
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:29,680
is there some universal thing you can
 

2317
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:30,230
is there some universal thing you can
say like

2318
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:30,240
say like
 

2319
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,550
say like
neural networks suck uh recurring you'll

2320
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:32,560
neural networks suck uh recurring you'll
 

2321
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,470
neural networks suck uh recurring you'll
know or suck transformers suck

2322
00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:34,480
know or suck transformers suck
 

2323
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:37,750
know or suck transformers suck
or they're awesome like old-school

2324
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:37,760
or they're awesome like old-school
 

2325
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,829
or they're awesome like old-school
sort of more basic kind of classifiers

2326
00:39:39,829 --> 00:39:39,839
sort of more basic kind of classifiers
 

2327
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:41,430
sort of more basic kind of classifiers
are better all the is there is there

2328
00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:41,440
are better all the is there is there
 

2329
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,470
are better all the is there is there
some kind of conclusion

2330
00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:42,480
some kind of conclusion
 

2331
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,710
some kind of conclusion
so far that you can say there is there

2332
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:44,720
so far that you can say there is there
 

2333
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:45,670
so far that you can say there is there
definitely something

2334
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:45,680
definitely something
 

2335
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:48,390
definitely something
pretty nice about tree models like like

2336
00:39:48,390 --> 00:39:48,400
pretty nice about tree models like like
 

2337
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:48,870
pretty nice about tree models like like
xg

2338
00:39:48,870 --> 00:39:48,880
xg
 

2339
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:52,470
xg
boost um and uh they just seem to work

2340
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:52,480
boost um and uh they just seem to work
 

2341
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,550
boost um and uh they just seem to work
pretty nicely on this type of data

2342
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:54,560
pretty nicely on this type of data
 

2343
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,870
pretty nicely on this type of data
uh so out of the box if you're trying to

2344
00:39:56,870 --> 00:39:56,880
uh so out of the box if you're trying to
 

2345
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,550
uh so out of the box if you're trying to
come

2346
00:39:58,550 --> 00:39:58,560
come
 

2347

100th in the competition in the

2348
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:00,720
100th in the competition in the
 

2349
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,390
100th in the competition in the
tournament maybe you would try it use

2350
00:40:02,390 --> 00:40:02,400
tournament maybe you would try it use
 

2351
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,190
tournament maybe you would try it use
that

2352
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:03,200
that
 

2353
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:06,309
that
um but what's what's

2354
00:40:06,309 --> 00:40:06,319
um but what's what's
 

2355
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:08,630
um but what's what's
particularly interesting about the the

2356
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:08,640
particularly interesting about the the
 

2357
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,390
particularly interesting about the the
problem that um

2358
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:10,400
problem that um
 

2359
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,069
problem that um
not many people understand if you're

2360
00:40:12,069 --> 00:40:12,079
not many people understand if you're
 

2361
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:14,069
not many people understand if you're
familiar with machine learning

2362
00:40:14,069 --> 00:40:14,079
familiar with machine learning
 

2363
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:17,030
familiar with machine learning
um this typically will surprise you when

2364
00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:17,040
um this typically will surprise you when
 

2365
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,470
um this typically will surprise you when
you model our data

2366
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:18,480
you model our data
 

2367
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:22,630
you model our data
so um one of the things that

2368
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:22,640
so um one of the things that
 

2369
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,390
so um one of the things that
you look at in finance is you don't want

2370
00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:24,400
you look at in finance is you don't want
 

2371
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,950
you look at in finance is you don't want
to be too exposed to any one

2372
00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:26,960
to be too exposed to any one
 

2373
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:30,309
to be too exposed to any one
risk like even if

2374
00:40:30,309 --> 00:40:30,319
risk like even if
 

2375
00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:34,390
risk like even if
the best sector in the world to invest

2376
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:34,400
the best sector in the world to invest
 

2377
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,069
the best sector in the world to invest
in over the last 10 years was

2378
00:40:36,069 --> 00:40:36,079
in over the last 10 years was
 

2379
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:38,630
in over the last 10 years was
tech you would not does not mean you

2380
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:38,640
tech you would not does not mean you
 

2381
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,150
tech you would not does not mean you
should put all of your money into tech

2382
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:40,160
should put all of your money into tech
 

2383
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:42,950
should put all of your money into tech
right so though if you train a model it

2384
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:42,960
right so though if you train a model it
 

2385
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,230
right so though if you train a model it
would say put all your money in stack

2386
00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:44,240
would say put all your money in stack
 

2387
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,670
would say put all your money in stack
it's super good

2388
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:45,680
it's super good
 

2389
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:48,230
it's super good
but um what you want to do is actually

2390
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:48,240
but um what you want to do is actually
 

2391
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,829
but um what you want to do is actually
be very careful of how much

2392
00:40:49,829 --> 00:40:49,839
be very careful of how much
 

2393
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:52,150
be very careful of how much
of this exposure you have to certain

2394
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:52,160
of this exposure you have to certain
 

2395
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,430
of this exposure you have to certain
features

2396
00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:53,440
features
 

2397
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:57,109
features
so on numerix what a lot of people

2398
00:40:57,109 --> 00:40:57,119
so on numerix what a lot of people
 

2399
00:40:57,119 --> 00:40:59,910
so on numerix what a lot of people
figure out is actually if you train a

2400
00:40:59,910 --> 00:40:59,920
figure out is actually if you train a
 

2401
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:00,390
figure out is actually if you train a
model

2402
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:00,400
model
 

2403
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:03,109

on this kind of data you want to somehow

2404
00:41:03,109 --> 00:41:03,119
on this kind of data you want to somehow
 

2405
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:04,630
on this kind of data you want to somehow
neutralize or minimize

2406
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:04,640
neutralize or minimize
 

2407
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,630
neutralize or minimize
your exposure to these to certain

your exposure to these to certain
 

2409
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:09,270
your exposure to these to certain
features which is unusual because if

2410
00:41:09,270 --> 00:41:09,280
features which is unusual because if
 

2411
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:12,390
features which is unusual because if
if you did train um a stop light or stop

uh detection uh on computer vision
 

2417
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:20,390
uh detection uh on computer vision
uh your favorite feature let's say you

2418
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:20,400
uh your favorite feature let's say you
 

2419
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,829
uh your favorite feature let's say you
could and you have an auto encoder and

2420
00:41:21,829 --> 00:41:21,839
could and you have an auto encoder and
 

2421
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:23,030
could and you have an auto encoder and
it's figuring out okay it's going to be

2422
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:23,040
it's figuring out okay it's going to be
 

2423

that's the last thing you want to be you

2426
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:28,240
that's the last thing you want to be you
 

2427
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:30,309
that's the last thing you want to be you
want to reduce your exposure to

2428
00:41:30,309 --> 00:41:30,319
want to reduce your exposure to
 

2429
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:31,510
want to reduce your exposure to
why would you reduce your exposure to

2430
00:41:31,510 --> 00:41:31,520
why would you reduce your exposure to
 

2431
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,190
why would you reduce your exposure to
the thing that's helping you your model

2432
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:33,200
the thing that's helping you your model
 

2433
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,470
the thing that's helping you your model
the most

2434
00:41:34,470 --> 00:41:34,480
the most
 

2435
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,349
the most
and that's actually this

2436
00:41:35,349 --> 00:41:35,359
and that's actually this
 

2437
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:36,870
and that's actually this
counter-intuitive thing you have to do

2438
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:36,880
counter-intuitive thing you have to do
 

2439
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,630
counter-intuitive thing you have to do
with machine learning on financial data

2440
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:38,640
with machine learning on financial data
 

2441
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:41,750
with machine learning on financial data
so reducing it's reducing your exposure

2442
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:41,760
so reducing it's reducing your exposure
 

2443
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,349
so reducing it's reducing your exposure
would help you generalize the things

2444
00:41:43,349 --> 00:41:43,359
would help you generalize the things
 

2445
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:43,990
would help you generalize the things
that are

2446
00:41:43,990 --> 00:41:44,000
that are
 

2447
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,190
that are
so basically financial data has

2448
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:47,200
so basically financial data has
 

2449
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:50,230
so basically financial data has
a large amount of patterns that appeared

2450
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:50,240
a large amount of patterns that appeared
 

2451
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,670
a large amount of patterns that appeared
in the past

2452
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:51,680
in the past
 

2453
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,349
in the past
and also a large amount of patterns that

2454
00:41:53,349 --> 00:41:53,359
and also a large amount of patterns that
 

2455
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:55,030
and also a large amount of patterns that
have not appeared in the past

2456
00:41:55,030 --> 00:41:55,040
have not appeared in the past
 

2457
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,030
have not appeared in the past
and so like in that sense you have to

2458
00:41:57,030 --> 00:41:57,040
and so like in that sense you have to
 

2459
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:59,510
and so like in that sense you have to
reduce the exposure to red lights

2460
00:41:59,510 --> 00:41:59,520
reduce the exposure to red lights
 

2461
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:02,710
reduce the exposure to red lights
uh to to the color red that's

2462
00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:02,720
uh to to the color red that's
 

2463
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:03,990
uh to to the color red that's
interesting but

2464
00:42:03,990 --> 00:42:04,000
interesting but
 

2465
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,670
interesting but
how much of this is art and how much of

2466
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:05,680
how much of this is art and how much of
 

2467
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,349
how much of this is art and how much of
it is science from your perspective so

2468
00:42:07,349 --> 00:42:07,359
it is science from your perspective so
 

2469
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:09,190
it is science from your perspective so
far

2470
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:09,200
far
 

2471
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,270
far
in terms of as you start to climb from

2472
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:11,280
in terms of as you start to climb from
 

2473
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:14,309
in terms of as you start to climb from
the 100th position to the 95th

2474
00:42:14,309 --> 00:42:14,319
the 100th position to the 95th
 

2475
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:17,270
the 100th position to the 95th
in in the competition yeah well if you

2476
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:17,280
in in the competition yeah well if you
 

2477
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,230
in in the competition yeah well if you
do you

2478
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:18,240
do you
 

2479
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:21,270
do you
make yourself super exposed to uh

2480
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:21,280
make yourself super exposed to uh
 

2481
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:24,390
make yourself super exposed to uh
one or two features you can have a lot

2482
00:42:24,390 --> 00:42:24,400
one or two features you can have a lot
 

2483
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,670
one or two features you can have a lot
of volatility

2484
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:25,680
of volatility
 

2485
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,349
of volatility
when you're playing numeri you could

2486
00:42:27,349 --> 00:42:27,359
when you're playing numeri you could
 

2487
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:29,109
when you're playing numeri you could
maybe very rapidly

2488
00:42:29,109 --> 00:42:29,119
maybe very rapidly
 

2489
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:32,390
maybe very rapidly
rise to be high if you were getting

2490
00:42:32,390 --> 00:42:32,400
rise to be high if you were getting
 

2491
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:35,510
rise to be high if you were getting
lucky yes and that's bit like the stock

2492
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:35,520
lucky yes and that's bit like the stock
 

2493
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:36,230
lucky yes and that's bit like the stock
market

2494
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:36,240
market
 

2495
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:39,030
market
sure take on massive risk exposure put

2496
00:42:39,030 --> 00:42:39,040
sure take on massive risk exposure put
 

2497
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:41,030
sure take on massive risk exposure put
all your money into one stock

2498
00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:41,040
all your money into one stock
 

2499
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:44,710
all your money into one stock
and you might make 100 but um

2500
00:42:44,710 --> 00:42:44,720
and you might make 100 but um
 

2501
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:46,870
and you might make 100 but um
it doesn't in the long run work out very

2502
00:42:46,870 --> 00:42:46,880
it doesn't in the long run work out very
 

2503
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:47,750
it doesn't in the long run work out very
well

2504
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:47,760
well
 

2505
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:51,109
well
and so um the best users are

2506
00:42:51,109 --> 00:42:51,119
and so um the best users are
 

2507
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:54,630
and so um the best users are
are trying to stay high for as long as

2508
00:42:54,630 --> 00:42:54,640
are trying to stay high for as long as
 

2509
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:57,910
are trying to stay high for as long as
possible and not not necessarily try to

what are let's see there's like a
 

2529
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,230
what are let's see there's like a
million questions but like

2530
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:16,240
million questions but like
 

2531
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:19,670
million questions but like
first one is how do i get started

2532
00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:19,680
first one is how do i get started
 

2533
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:23,430
first one is how do i get started
well you can go to numer.ai sign up

download the data and on
 

2537
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:30,630
download the data and on
the data is pretty small in the data

2538
00:43:30,630 --> 00:43:30,640
the data is pretty small in the data
 

2539
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:31,829
the data is pretty small in the data
pack you download

2540
00:43:31,829 --> 00:43:31,839
pack you download
 

2541
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:34,230
pack you download
there's like an example script python

2542
00:43:34,230 --> 00:43:34,240
there's like an example script python
 

2543
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:34,870
there's like an example script python

script
that just builds a xg boost model very

2546
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:38,000
that just builds a xg boost model very
 

2547
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,710
that just builds a xg boost model very
quickly from the data

2548
00:43:40,710 --> 00:43:40,720
quickly from the data
 

2549
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:44,309
quickly from the data
and um so in a very short time you can

2550
00:43:44,309 --> 00:43:44,319
and um so in a very short time you can
 

2551
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:45,589
and um so in a very short time you can
have an example

2552
00:43:45,589 --> 00:43:45,599
have an example
 

2553
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:47,589
have an example
model is that a particular structure

2554
00:43:47,589 --> 00:43:47,599
model is that a particular structure
 

2555
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:49,589
model is that a particular structure
like what uh is this model then

2556
00:43:49,589 --> 00:43:49,599
like what uh is this model then
 

2557
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:51,109
like what uh is this model then
submitted somewhere so this

2558
00:43:51,109 --> 00:43:51,119
submitted somewhere so this
 

2559
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:52,550
submitted somewhere so this
needs to be some kind of structure that

2560
00:43:52,550 --> 00:43:52,560
needs to be some kind of structure that
 

2561
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,550
needs to be some kind of structure that
communicates with some kind of api

2562
00:43:54,550 --> 00:43:54,560
communicates with some kind of api
 

2563
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:57,109
communicates with some kind of api
like how does the whole yeah how does

2564
00:43:57,109 --> 00:43:57,119
like how does the whole yeah how does
 

2565
00:43:57,119 --> 00:43:58,550
like how does the whole yeah how does
the your model once you've built it

2566
00:43:58,550 --> 00:43:58,560
the your model once you've built it
 

2567
00:43:58,560 --> 00:43:59,829
the your model once you've built it
wants to create a little

2568
00:43:59,829 --> 00:43:59,839
wants to create a little
 

2569
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:01,510
wants to create a little
little baby frankenstein yeah how does

2570
00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:01,520
little baby frankenstein yeah how does
 

2571
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:03,349
little baby frankenstein yeah how does
it then live in it's okay well we want

2572
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:03,359
it then live in it's okay well we want
 

2573
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:05,109
it then live in it's okay well we want
you to keep your baby frankenstein at

2574
00:44:05,109 --> 00:44:05,119
you to keep your baby frankenstein at
 

2575
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:05,750
you to keep your baby frankenstein at
home

2576
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:05,760
home
 

2577
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,510
home
and take care of it we don't want it

2578
00:44:07,510 --> 00:44:07,520
and take care of it we don't want it
 

2579
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:08,790
and take care of it we don't want it
okay so we you never

2580
00:44:08,790 --> 00:44:08,800
okay so we you never
 

2581
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:12,470
okay so we you never
upload your model to us you always um

2582
00:44:12,470 --> 00:44:12,480
upload your model to us you always um
 

2583
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:15,589
upload your model to us you always um
only giving us predictions so we never

2584
00:44:15,589 --> 00:44:15,599
only giving us predictions so we never
 

2585
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:17,190
only giving us predictions so we never
see the code that wrote your model which

2586
00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:17,200
see the code that wrote your model which
 

2587
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:18,790
see the code that wrote your model which
is pretty cool yeah that our whole hedge

2588
00:44:18,790 --> 00:44:18,800
is pretty cool yeah that our whole hedge
 

2589
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:19,589
is pretty cool yeah that our whole hedge
fund is built

2590
00:44:19,589 --> 00:44:19,599
fund is built
 

2591
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:21,349
fund is built
from models where we've never ever seen

2592
00:44:21,349 --> 00:44:21,359
from models where we've never ever seen
 

2593
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:23,670
from models where we've never ever seen
the code um

2594
00:44:23,670 --> 00:44:23,680
the code um
 

2595
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:26,069
the code um
but it's important for the users because

2596
00:44:26,069 --> 00:44:26,079
but it's important for the users because
 

2597
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:26,870
but it's important for the users because
it's their ip

2598
00:44:26,870 --> 00:44:26,880
it's their ip
 

2599
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,069
it's their ip
why they want to give it to us that's

2600
00:44:28,069 --> 00:44:28,079
why they want to give it to us that's
 

2601
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:30,309
why they want to give it to us that's
brilliant so they've got it

2602
00:44:30,309 --> 00:44:30,319
brilliant so they've got it
 

2603
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:33,030
brilliant so they've got it
themselves but they can basically almost

2604
00:44:33,030 --> 00:44:33,040
themselves but they can basically almost
 

2605
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:33,349
themselves but they can basically almost
like

2606
00:44:33,349 --> 00:44:33,359
like
 

2607
00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:37,670
like
license the the predictions from that

2608
00:44:37,670 --> 00:44:37,680
license the the predictions from that
 

2609
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:40,550
license the the predictions from that
yeah um so think about it what some

2610
00:44:40,550 --> 00:44:40,560
yeah um so think about it what some
 

2611
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:42,309
yeah um so think about it what some
users do is they set up a

2612
00:44:42,309 --> 00:44:42,319
users do is they set up a
 

2613
00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:44,710
users do is they set up a
uh compute server and we call numeric

2614
00:44:44,710 --> 00:44:44,720
uh compute server and we call numeric
 

2615
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:46,150
uh compute server and we call numeric
compute it's like a little aws

2616
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:46,160
compute it's like a little aws
 

2617
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:48,950
compute it's like a little aws
kind of image and you can automate this

2618
00:44:48,950 --> 00:44:48,960
kind of image and you can automate this
 

2619
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:51,349
kind of image and you can automate this
process um so we can ping you we can be

2620
00:44:51,349 --> 00:44:51,359
process um so we can ping you we can be
 

2621
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:52,870
process um so we can ping you we can be
like we need more predictions now

2622
00:44:52,870 --> 00:44:52,880
like we need more predictions now
 

2623
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:56,069
like we need more predictions now
and then you you send it to us okay cool

2624
00:44:56,069 --> 00:44:56,079
and then you you send it to us okay cool
 

2625
00:44:56,079 --> 00:44:57,270
and then you you send it to us okay cool
so that that's

2626
00:44:57,270 --> 00:44:57,280
so that that's
 

2627
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:00,309
so that that's
uh is that described somewhere like what

2628
00:45:00,309 --> 00:45:00,319
uh is that described somewhere like what
 

2629
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:03,030
uh is that described somewhere like what
the preferred is the aws or whether

2630
00:45:03,030 --> 00:45:03,040
the preferred is the aws or whether
 

2631
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:05,670
the preferred is the aws or whether
another cloud platform is there i mean

2632
00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:05,680
another cloud platform is there i mean
 

2633
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:06,390
another cloud platform is there i mean
is there sort of

2634
00:45:06,390 --> 00:45:06,400
is there sort of
 

2635
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:07,910
is there sort of
specific technical things you want to

2636
00:45:07,910 --> 00:45:07,920
specific technical things you want to
 

2637
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:09,910
specific technical things you want to
say that comes to mind that

2638
00:45:09,910 --> 00:45:09,920
say that comes to mind that
 

2639
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:12,870
say that comes to mind that
uh is a good path for getting started so

2640
00:45:12,870 --> 00:45:12,880
uh is a good path for getting started so
 

2641
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:13,910
uh is a good path for getting started so
download the data

2642
00:45:13,910 --> 00:45:13,920
download the data
 

2643
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:17,510
download the data
maybe play around see if

2644
00:45:17,510 --> 00:45:17,520
maybe play around see if
 

2645
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:20,550
maybe play around see if
you can modify the basic uh

2646
00:45:20,550 --> 00:45:20,560
you can modify the basic uh
 

2647
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:24,309
you can modify the basic uh
the algorithm provided in the

2648
00:45:24,309 --> 00:45:24,319
the algorithm provided in the
 

2649
00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:27,030
the algorithm provided in the
example and then you what set up a

2650
00:45:27,030 --> 00:45:27,040
example and then you what set up a
 

2651
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:28,470
example and then you what set up a
little server on the aws

2652
00:45:28,470 --> 00:45:28,480
little server on the aws
 

2653
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:31,270
little server on the aws
that then runs this model and takes

2654
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:31,280
that then runs this model and takes
 

2655
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:34,069
that then runs this model and takes
pings and then makes predictions

2656
00:45:34,069 --> 00:45:34,079
pings and then makes predictions
 

2657
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:36,230
pings and then makes predictions
and uh how does your own money actually

2658
00:45:36,230 --> 00:45:36,240
and uh how does your own money actually
 

2659
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:37,750
and uh how does your own money actually
come into play

2660
00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:37,760
come into play
 

2661
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:41,270
come into play
doing the stake of cryptocurrency

2662
00:45:41,270 --> 00:45:41,280
doing the stake of cryptocurrency
 

2663
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:44,309
doing the stake of cryptocurrency
yeah so you don't have to stake you can

2664
00:45:44,309 --> 00:45:44,319
yeah so you don't have to stake you can
 

2665
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:46,230
yeah so you don't have to stake you can
start without staking and many users

2666
00:45:46,230 --> 00:45:46,240
start without staking and many users
 

2667
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:46,950
start without staking and many users
might

2668
00:45:46,950 --> 00:45:46,960
might
 

2669
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:49,829
might
try for months uh without staking

2670
00:45:49,829 --> 00:45:49,839
try for months uh without staking
 

2671
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:52,230
try for months uh without staking
anything at all to see if their model

2672
00:45:52,230 --> 00:45:52,240
anything at all to see if their model
 

2673
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:55,190
anything at all to see if their model
works on the real life data right and is

2674
00:45:55,190 --> 00:45:55,200
works on the real life data right and is
 

2675
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:56,550
works on the real life data right and is
not over fit

2676
00:45:56,550 --> 00:45:56,560
not over fit
 

2677
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:59,990
not over fit
um but then you can get numeraire

2678
00:45:59,990 --> 00:46:00,000
um but then you can get numeraire
 

2679
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,790
um but then you can get numeraire
uh many different ways you can buy it on

2680
00:46:02,790 --> 00:46:02,800
uh many different ways you can buy it on
 

2681
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:03,270
uh many different ways you can buy it on
um

2682
00:46:03,270 --> 00:46:03,280
um
 

2683
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:05,349
um
you can buy some on coinbase you can buy

2684
00:46:05,349 --> 00:46:05,359
you can buy some on coinbase you can buy
 

2685
00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:07,349
you can buy some on coinbase you can buy
some on uniswap you can buy some on

2686
00:46:07,349 --> 00:46:07,359
some on uniswap you can buy some on
 

2687
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:08,470
some on uniswap you can buy some on
binance

2688
00:46:08,470 --> 00:46:08,480
binance
 

2689
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:11,109
binance
um so what what did you say this is uh

2690
00:46:11,109 --> 00:46:11,119
um so what what did you say this is uh
 

2691
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:12,550
um so what what did you say this is uh
how do you pronounce it so this is the

2692
00:46:12,550 --> 00:46:12,560
how do you pronounce it so this is the
 

2693
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:13,270
how do you pronounce it so this is the
numerai

2694
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:13,280
numerai
 

2695
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:16,309
numerai
uh cryptocurrency yeah nmr

2696
00:46:16,309 --> 00:46:16,319
uh cryptocurrency yeah nmr
 

2697
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:19,589
uh cryptocurrency yeah nmr
nmr what's you just say nmr it is

2698
00:46:19,589 --> 00:46:19,599
nmr what's you just say nmr it is
 

2699
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:22,710
nmr what's you just say nmr it is
it is technically called numero numero

2700
00:46:22,710 --> 00:46:22,720
it is technically called numero numero
 

2701
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:26,150
it is technically called numero numero
i like it yeah but uh and more simple

2702
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:26,160
i like it yeah but uh and more simple
 

2703
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:29,270
i like it yeah but uh and more simple
nmr numero okay so and you could buy it

2704
00:46:29,270 --> 00:46:29,280
nmr numero okay so and you could buy it
 

2705
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:32,150
nmr numero okay so and you could buy it
uh you know basically anywhere yeah so

2706
00:46:32,150 --> 00:46:32,160
uh you know basically anywhere yeah so
 

2707
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:33,349
uh you know basically anywhere yeah so
it's a bit strange because sometimes

2708
00:46:33,349 --> 00:46:33,359
it's a bit strange because sometimes
 

2709
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:33,750
it's a bit strange because sometimes
people

2710
00:46:33,750 --> 00:46:33,760
people
 

2711
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:36,630
people
are like is this like pay to play right

2712
00:46:36,630 --> 00:46:36,640
are like is this like pay to play right
 

2713
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:37,670
are like is this like pay to play right
and it's like

2714
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:37,680
and it's like
 

2715
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:39,510
and it's like
sword it's like yeah yeah you need to

2716
00:46:39,510 --> 00:46:39,520
sword it's like yeah yeah you need to
 

2717
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:41,349
sword it's like yeah yeah you need to
put some money down to show us you

2718
00:46:41,349 --> 00:46:41,359
put some money down to show us you
 

2719
00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:42,550
put some money down to show us you
believe in your model

2720
00:46:42,550 --> 00:46:42,560
believe in your model
 

2721
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:44,710
believe in your model
but uh weirdly we we're not selling you

2722
00:46:44,710 --> 00:46:44,720
but uh weirdly we we're not selling you
 

2723
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:45,910
but uh weirdly we we're not selling you
the cr like you can't buy the

2724
00:46:45,910 --> 00:46:45,920
the cr like you can't buy the
 

2725
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:47,589
the cr like you can't buy the
cryptocurrency from

2726
00:46:47,589 --> 00:46:47,599
cryptocurrency from
 

2727
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:51,750
cryptocurrency from
us right it's like it's also we never

2728
00:46:51,750 --> 00:46:51,760
us right it's like it's also we never
 

2729
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:55,030
us right it's like it's also we never
if you're if you do badly um we destroy

2730
00:46:55,030 --> 00:46:55,040
if you're if you do badly um we destroy
 

2731
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:57,270
if you're if you do badly um we destroy
your cryptocurrency

2732
00:46:57,270 --> 00:46:57,280
your cryptocurrency
 

2733
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:58,710
your cryptocurrency
okay that's not good right you don't

2734
00:46:58,710 --> 00:46:58,720
okay that's not good right you don't
 

2735
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:00,390
okay that's not good right you don't
want it to be destroyed but

2736
00:47:00,390 --> 00:47:00,400
want it to be destroyed but
 

2737
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,230
want it to be destroyed but
what's good about it is it's also not

2738
00:47:02,230 --> 00:47:02,240
what's good about it is it's also not
 

2739
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:03,430
what's good about it is it's also not
coming to us

2740
00:47:03,430 --> 00:47:03,440
coming to us
 

2741
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:05,829
coming to us
right so it's not like we win when you

2742
00:47:05,829 --> 00:47:05,839
right so it's not like we win when you
 

2743
00:47:05,839 --> 00:47:07,270
right so it's not like we win when you
lose or something like that

2744
00:47:07,270 --> 00:47:07,280
lose or something like that
 

2745
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:08,790
lose or something like that
like we're the house like we're

2746
00:47:08,790 --> 00:47:08,800
like we're the house like we're
 

2747
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:10,309
like we're the house like we're
definitely on the same team

2748
00:47:10,309 --> 00:47:10,319
definitely on the same team
 

2749
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:12,390
definitely on the same team
yes you're helping us make a hedge fund

2750
00:47:12,390 --> 00:47:12,400
yes you're helping us make a hedge fund
 

2751
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,069
yes you're helping us make a hedge fund
that's never been done before

2752
00:47:14,069 --> 00:47:14,079
that's never been done before
 

2753
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:15,670
that's never been done before
yeah so again interests are aligned

2754
00:47:15,670 --> 00:47:15,680
yeah so again interests are aligned
 

2755
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:17,910
yeah so again interests are aligned
there's no uh there's no tension there

2756
00:47:17,910 --> 00:47:17,920
there's no uh there's no tension there
 

2757
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:18,710
there's no uh there's no tension there
at all which is

2758
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:18,720
at all which is
 

2759
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:19,910
at all which is
which is really fascinating you're

2760
00:47:19,910 --> 00:47:19,920
which is really fascinating you're
 

2761
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,829
which is really fascinating you're
giving away everything and then the ip

2762
00:47:21,829 --> 00:47:21,839
giving away everything and then the ip
 

2763
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:22,710
giving away everything and then the ip
is owned by

2764
00:47:22,710 --> 00:47:22,720
is owned by
 

2765
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:24,870
is owned by
the sort of the the code you never share

2766
00:47:24,870 --> 00:47:24,880
the sort of the the code you never share
 

2767
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:26,549
the sort of the the code you never share
the code that's fascinating

2768
00:47:26,549 --> 00:47:26,559
the code that's fascinating
 

2769
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:29,910
the code that's fascinating
um so since i have you here and you said

2770
00:47:29,910 --> 00:47:29,920
um so since i have you here and you said
 

2771
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:31,589
um so since i have you here and you said
a hundredth i didn't ask

2772
00:47:31,589 --> 00:47:31,599
a hundredth i didn't ask
 

2773
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:34,870
a hundredth i didn't ask
out of how many so we'll just

2774
00:47:34,870 --> 00:47:34,880
out of how many so we'll just
 

2775
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:37,910
out of how many so we'll just
but if i if i then once you get started

2776
00:47:37,910 --> 00:47:37,920
but if i if i then once you get started
 

2777
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:38,950
but if i if i then once you get started
and you find this

2778
00:47:38,950 --> 00:47:38,960
and you find this
 

2779
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:43,270
and you find this
interesting how do you then

2780
00:47:43,270 --> 00:47:43,280
interesting how do you then
 

2781
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:46,069
interesting how do you then
win or do well but also how do you

2782
00:47:46,069 --> 00:47:46,079
win or do well but also how do you
 

2783
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:47,750
win or do well but also how do you
potentially try to win if this is

2784
00:47:47,750 --> 00:47:47,760
potentially try to win if this is
 

2785
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:49,750
potentially try to win if this is
something you want to take on seriously

2786
00:47:49,750 --> 00:47:49,760
something you want to take on seriously
 

2787
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:51,109
something you want to take on seriously
from the machine learning perspective

2788
00:47:51,109 --> 00:47:51,119
from the machine learning perspective
 

2789
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:53,270
from the machine learning perspective
not from a financial perspective

2790
00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:53,280
not from a financial perspective
 

2791
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:55,990
not from a financial perspective
yeah i think um the first of all you

2792
00:47:55,990 --> 00:47:56,000
yeah i think um the first of all you
 

2793
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,589
yeah i think um the first of all you
want to talk to the community people are

2794
00:47:57,589 --> 00:47:57,599
want to talk to the community people are
 

2795
00:47:57,599 --> 00:47:58,549
want to talk to the community people are
pretty open

2796
00:47:58,549 --> 00:47:58,559
pretty open
 

2797
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:00,309
pretty open
uh we give out really interesting

2798
00:48:00,309 --> 00:48:00,319
uh we give out really interesting
 

2799
00:48:00,319 --> 00:48:01,910
uh we give out really interesting
scripts and ideas

2800
00:48:01,910 --> 00:48:01,920
scripts and ideas
 

2801
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:05,430
scripts and ideas
for things you might want to try um and

2802
00:48:05,430 --> 00:48:05,440
for things you might want to try um and
 

2803
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:07,990
for things you might want to try um and
uh but you're also going to need a lot

2804
00:48:07,990 --> 00:48:08,000
uh but you're also going to need a lot
 

2805
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,349
uh but you're also going to need a lot
of compute probably

2806
00:48:09,349 --> 00:48:09,359
of compute probably
 

2807
00:48:09,359 --> 00:48:11,430
of compute probably
and so some of the best users are are

2808
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:11,440
and so some of the best users are are
 

2809
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:13,430
and so some of the best users are are
you know actually the very first time

2810
00:48:13,430 --> 00:48:13,440
you know actually the very first time
 

2811
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:14,710
you know actually the very first time
someone won

2812
00:48:14,710 --> 00:48:14,720
someone won
 

2813
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:16,309
someone won
on numerix i would i wrote them a

2814
00:48:16,309 --> 00:48:16,319
on numerix i would i wrote them a
 

2815
00:48:16,319 --> 00:48:18,150
on numerix i would i wrote them a
personal emails like you know you've won

2816
00:48:18,150 --> 00:48:18,160
personal emails like you know you've won
 

2817
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:18,790
personal emails like you know you've won
some money

2818
00:48:18,790 --> 00:48:18,800
some money
 

2819
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,150
some money
we're so excited to give you three

2820
00:48:20,150 --> 00:48:20,160
we're so excited to give you three
 

2821
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:22,150
we're so excited to give you three
hundred dollars and then they said i

2822
00:48:22,150 --> 00:48:22,160
hundred dollars and then they said i
 

2823
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:23,610
hundred dollars and then they said i
spend way more on the compute

2824
00:48:23,610 --> 00:48:23,620
spend way more on the compute
 

2825
00:48:23,620 --> 00:48:25,589
spend way more on the compute
[Laughter]

2826
00:48:25,589 --> 00:48:25,599
[Laughter]
 

2827
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:27,910
[Laughter]
um but this is fundamentally a machine

2828
00:48:27,910 --> 00:48:27,920
um but this is fundamentally a machine
 

2829
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:29,750
um but this is fundamentally a machine
learning problem first i think

2830
00:48:29,750 --> 00:48:29,760
learning problem first i think
 

2831
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:31,589
learning problem first i think
is this is one of the exciting things i

2832
00:48:31,589 --> 00:48:31,599
is this is one of the exciting things i
 

2833
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:32,950
is this is one of the exciting things i
don't know if we'll in

2834
00:48:32,950 --> 00:48:32,960
don't know if we'll in
 

2835
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:34,950
don't know if we'll in
how many ways you can approach this but

2836
00:48:34,950 --> 00:48:34,960
how many ways you can approach this but
 

2837
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:36,069
how many ways you can approach this but
really this is

2838
00:48:36,069 --> 00:48:36,079
really this is
 

2839
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:39,430
really this is
less about kind of

2840
00:48:39,430 --> 00:48:39,440
less about kind of
 

2841
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:42,069
less about kind of
no offense but like finance people

2842
00:48:42,069 --> 00:48:42,079
no offense but like finance people
 

2843
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:43,670
no offense but like finance people
finance minded people they're

2844
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:43,680
finance minded people they're
 

2845
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:46,790
finance minded people they're
also i'm sure great people but it

2846
00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:46,800
also i'm sure great people but it
 

2847
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:48,390
also i'm sure great people but it
feels like from the community that i've

2848
00:48:48,390 --> 00:48:48,400
feels like from the community that i've
 

2849
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:51,589
feels like from the community that i've
experienced these are people who see

2850
00:48:51,589 --> 00:48:51,599
experienced these are people who see
 

2851
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:55,030
experienced these are people who see
finance as a fascinating uh

2852
00:48:55,030 --> 00:48:55,040
finance as a fascinating uh
 

2853
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:57,829
finance as a fascinating uh
problem space the source of data but

2854
00:48:57,829 --> 00:48:57,839
problem space the source of data but
 

2855
00:48:57,839 --> 00:48:59,510
problem space the source of data but
ultimately they're machine learning

2856
00:48:59,510 --> 00:48:59,520
ultimately they're machine learning
 

2857
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:00,150
ultimately they're machine learning
people or

2858
00:49:00,150 --> 00:49:00,160
people or
 

2859
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:02,390
people or
ai people which is a very different kind

2860
00:49:02,390 --> 00:49:02,400
ai people which is a very different kind
 

2861
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:04,150
ai people which is a very different kind
of flavor of community and

2862
00:49:04,150 --> 00:49:04,160
of flavor of community and
 

2863
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:07,670
of flavor of community and
i mean i i should say to that uh i'd

2864
00:49:07,670 --> 00:49:07,680
i mean i i should say to that uh i'd
 

2865
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:08,870
i mean i i should say to that uh i'd
love to participate in this

2866
00:49:08,870 --> 00:49:08,880
love to participate in this
 

2867
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:11,430
love to participate in this
and i will participate in this and i'd

and i will participate in this and i'd
 

2869
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:12,950
and i will participate in this and i'd
love to hear from other people if you're

2870
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:12,960
love to hear from other people if you're
 

2871
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:14,230
love to hear from other people if you're
listening to this if you're a machine

2872
00:49:14,230 --> 00:49:14,240
listening to this if you're a machine
 

2873

learning person

2874
00:49:15,349 --> 00:49:15,359
learning person
 

2875
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:17,510
learning person
you should participate and tell me uh

2876
00:49:17,510 --> 00:49:17,520
you should participate and tell me uh
 

2877
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:18,630
you should participate and tell me uh
give me some hints

2878
00:49:18,630 --> 00:49:18,640
give me some hints
 

2879
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:21,190
give me some hints
um how i can do well at this thing

2880
00:49:21,190 --> 00:49:21,200
um how i can do well at this thing
 

2881
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:22,790
um how i can do well at this thing
because this boomer uh

2882
00:49:22,790 --> 00:49:22,800
because this boomer uh
 

2883
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:25,430
because this boomer uh
i'm not sure i still got it but because

2884
00:49:25,430 --> 00:49:25,440
i'm not sure i still got it but because
 

2885
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:27,270
i'm not sure i still got it but because
some of it is uh it's like

2886
00:49:27,270 --> 00:49:27,280
some of it is uh it's like
 

2887
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:30,950
some of it is uh it's like
kaggle competitions like some of it

2888
00:49:30,950 --> 00:49:30,960
kaggle competitions like some of it
 

2889
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:33,349
kaggle competitions like some of it
is certainly a set of ideas like

2890
00:49:33,349 --> 00:49:33,359
is certainly a set of ideas like
 

2891
00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:34,950
is certainly a set of ideas like
research ideas

2892
00:49:34,950 --> 00:49:34,960
research ideas
 

2893
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:37,510
research ideas
and like fundamental innovation but i'm

2894
00:49:37,510 --> 00:49:37,520
and like fundamental innovation but i'm
 

2895
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:39,349
and like fundamental innovation but i'm
sure some of it is like deeply

2896
00:49:39,349 --> 00:49:39,359
sure some of it is like deeply
 

2897
00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:40,630
sure some of it is like deeply
understanding getting like an

2898
00:49:40,630 --> 00:49:40,640
understanding getting like an
 

2899
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:43,750
understanding getting like an
intuition about the data and then like a

2900
00:49:43,750 --> 00:49:43,760
intuition about the data and then like a
 

2901
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:44,950
intuition about the data and then like a
lot of it will be like

2902
00:49:44,950 --> 00:49:44,960
lot of it will be like
 

2903
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:47,589
lot of it will be like
figuring out like what works like tricks

2904
00:49:47,589 --> 00:49:47,599
figuring out like what works like tricks
 

2905
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:48,230
figuring out like what works like tricks
i mean

2906
00:49:48,230 --> 00:49:48,240
i mean
 

2907
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:49,589
i mean
you could argue most of deep learning

2908
00:49:49,589 --> 00:49:49,599
you could argue most of deep learning
 

2909
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:51,430
you could argue most of deep learning
research is just tricks on top of tricks

2910
00:49:51,430 --> 00:49:51,440
research is just tricks on top of tricks
 

2911
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:52,710
research is just tricks on top of tricks
but

2912
00:49:52,710 --> 00:49:52,720
but
 

2913
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:55,750
but
there is uh some of it is just the art

2914
00:49:55,750 --> 00:49:55,760
there is uh some of it is just the art
 

2915
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:57,109
there is uh some of it is just the art
of getting to know

2916
00:49:57,109 --> 00:49:57,119
of getting to know
 

2917
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:58,710
of getting to know
how to work on a really difficult

2918
00:49:58,710 --> 00:49:58,720
how to work on a really difficult
 

2919
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:00,470
how to work on a really difficult
machine learning problem

2920
00:50:00,470 --> 00:50:00,480
machine learning problem
 

2921
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:02,069
machine learning problem
and i think what's important the

2922
00:50:02,069 --> 00:50:02,079
and i think what's important the
 

2923
00:50:02,079 --> 00:50:03,589
and i think what's important the
important difference with something like

2924
00:50:03,589 --> 00:50:03,599
important difference with something like
 

2925
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:04,710
important difference with something like
a kaggle competition

2926
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:04,720
a kaggle competition
 

2927
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:07,430
a kaggle competition
where they'll set up this kind of toy

2928
00:50:07,430 --> 00:50:07,440
where they'll set up this kind of toy
 

2929
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:08,230
where they'll set up this kind of toy
problem

2930
00:50:08,230 --> 00:50:08,240
problem
 

2931
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:10,230
problem
and then there will be an out of sample

2932
00:50:10,230 --> 00:50:10,240
and then there will be an out of sample
 

2933
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:12,230
and then there will be an out of sample
test like hey you did well out of sample

2934
00:50:12,230 --> 00:50:12,240
test like hey you did well out of sample
 

2935
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:13,270
test like hey you did well out of sample
and this is like okay

2936
00:50:13,270 --> 00:50:13,280
and this is like okay
 

2937
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:16,630
and this is like okay
cool um but what's cool with nimrod is

2938
00:50:16,630 --> 00:50:16,640
cool um but what's cool with nimrod is
 

2939
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:19,430
cool um but what's cool with nimrod is
you're you're the out of sample is the

2940
00:50:19,430 --> 00:50:19,440
you're you're the out of sample is the
 

2941
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:21,349
you're you're the out of sample is the
real live stock market

2942
00:50:21,349 --> 00:50:21,359
real live stock market
 

2943
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:23,990
real live stock market
we we don't even know like we don't know

2944
00:50:23,990 --> 00:50:24,000
we we don't even know like we don't know
 

2945
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,589
we we don't even know like we don't know
the answer to the problem well

2946
00:50:25,589 --> 00:50:25,599
the answer to the problem well
 

2947
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:27,349
the answer to the problem well
we don't like you'll have to find out

2948
00:50:27,349 --> 00:50:27,359
we don't like you'll have to find out
 

2949
00:50:27,359 --> 00:50:29,510
we don't like you'll have to find out
live and so we've had

2950
00:50:29,510 --> 00:50:29,520
live and so we've had
 

2951
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:31,589
live and so we've had
users who've like submitted every week

2952
00:50:31,589 --> 00:50:31,599
users who've like submitted every week
 

2953
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:32,710
users who've like submitted every week
for for like

2954
00:50:32,710 --> 00:50:32,720
for for like
 

2955
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:36,950
for for like
four years um because it's kind of a

2956
00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:36,960
four years um because it's kind of a
 

2957
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:39,829
four years um because it's kind of a
interesting we say it's the hardest data

2958
00:50:39,829 --> 00:50:39,839
interesting we say it's the hardest data
 

2959
00:50:39,839 --> 00:50:41,670
interesting we say it's the hardest data
science problem on the planet right

2960
00:50:41,670 --> 00:50:41,680
science problem on the planet right
 

2961
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:43,910
science problem on the planet right
and it sounds maybe sounds like maybe a

2962
00:50:43,910 --> 00:50:43,920
and it sounds maybe sounds like maybe a
 

2963
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:45,510
and it sounds maybe sounds like maybe a
bit too much for like a marketing thing

2964
00:50:45,510 --> 00:50:45,520
bit too much for like a marketing thing
 

2965
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:46,069
bit too much for like a marketing thing
but

2966
00:50:46,069 --> 00:50:46,079
but
 

2967
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:47,910
but
it's the hardest because it's the stock

2968
00:50:47,910 --> 00:50:47,920
it's the hardest because it's the stock
 

2969
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:49,270
it's the hardest because it's the stock
market it's like

2970
00:50:49,270 --> 00:50:49,280
market it's like
 

2971
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:51,190
market it's like
literally they're like billions of

2972
00:50:51,190 --> 00:50:51,200
literally they're like billions of
 

2973
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:52,630
literally they're like billions of
dollars at stake

2974
00:50:52,630 --> 00:50:52,640
dollars at stake
 

2975
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:54,790
dollars at stake
and like no one's like letting it be

2976
00:50:54,790 --> 00:50:54,800
and like no one's like letting it be
 

2977
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:56,630
and like no one's like letting it be
inefficient on purpose

2978
00:50:56,630 --> 00:50:56,640
inefficient on purpose
 

2979
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:58,150
inefficient on purpose
so if you can find something that works

2980
00:50:58,150 --> 00:50:58,160
so if you can find something that works
 

2981
00:50:58,160 --> 00:50:59,670
so if you can find something that works
on numerous you really have something

2982
00:50:59,670 --> 00:50:59,680
on numerous you really have something
 

2983
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:00,230
on numerous you really have something
that

2984
00:51:00,230 --> 00:51:00,240
that
 

2985
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:02,390
that
that is like working on the real stock

2986
00:51:02,390 --> 00:51:02,400
that is like working on the real stock
 

2987
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:03,910
that is like working on the real stock
market

2988
00:51:03,910 --> 00:51:03,920
market
 

2989
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:05,270
market
yeah because there's like humans

2990
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:05,280
yeah because there's like humans
 

2991
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:07,270
yeah because there's like humans
involved in the stock market i mean this

2992
00:51:07,270 --> 00:51:07,280
involved in the stock market i mean this
 

2993
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:08,710
involved in the stock market i mean this
uh you know you could argue there might

2994
00:51:08,710 --> 00:51:08,720
uh you know you could argue there might
 

2995
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:10,390
uh you know you could argue there might
be harder data sets like maybe

2996
00:51:10,390 --> 00:51:10,400
be harder data sets like maybe
 

2997
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:11,829
be harder data sets like maybe
predicting the weather all those kinds

2998
00:51:11,829 --> 00:51:11,839
predicting the weather all those kinds
 

2999
00:51:11,839 --> 00:51:12,870
predicting the weather all those kinds
of things but

3000
00:51:12,870 --> 00:51:12,880
of things but
 

3001
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:15,349
of things but
the the fundamental statement here is

3002
00:51:15,349 --> 00:51:15,359
the the fundamental statement here is
 

3003
00:51:15,359 --> 00:51:16,950
the the fundamental statement here is
which i like i was thinking like is this

3004
00:51:16,950 --> 00:51:16,960
which i like i was thinking like is this
 

3005
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:19,430
which i like i was thinking like is this
really the hardest data science problem

3006
00:51:19,430 --> 00:51:19,440
really the hardest data science problem
 

3007
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:21,349
really the hardest data science problem
and you start thinking about that but

3008
00:51:21,349 --> 00:51:21,359
and you start thinking about that but
 

3009
00:51:21,359 --> 00:51:23,990
and you start thinking about that but
ultimately also boils down to

3010
00:51:23,990 --> 00:51:24,000
ultimately also boils down to
 

3011
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,630
ultimately also boils down to
a problem where the data is accessible

3012
00:51:26,630 --> 00:51:26,640
a problem where the data is accessible
 

3013
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:28,390
a problem where the data is accessible
it's made accessible made

3014
00:51:28,390 --> 00:51:28,400
it's made accessible made
 

3015
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:31,750
it's made accessible made
really easy and efficient at

3016
00:51:31,750 --> 00:51:31,760
really easy and efficient at
 

3017
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:34,309
really easy and efficient at
like submitting algorithms so it's not

3018
00:51:34,309 --> 00:51:34,319
like submitting algorithms so it's not
 

3019
00:51:34,319 --> 00:51:35,190
like submitting algorithms so it's not
just

3020
00:51:35,190 --> 00:51:35,200
just
 

3021
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:36,630
just
you know it's not about the data being

3022
00:51:36,630 --> 00:51:36,640
you know it's not about the data being
 

3023
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:38,470
you know it's not about the data being
out there like the weather it's about

3024
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:38,480
out there like the weather it's about
 

3025
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:40,470
out there like the weather it's about
making the data super accessible

3026
00:51:40,470 --> 00:51:40,480
making the data super accessible
 

3027
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:42,950
making the data super accessible
making a building a community around it

3028
00:51:42,950 --> 00:51:42,960
making a building a community around it
 

3029
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:45,190
making a building a community around it
like this is what imagenet did

3030
00:51:45,190 --> 00:51:45,200
like this is what imagenet did
 

3031
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:47,589
like this is what imagenet did
exactly like it's not just there's

3032
00:51:47,589 --> 00:51:47,599
exactly like it's not just there's
 

3033
00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:48,950
exactly like it's not just there's
always images

3034
00:51:48,950 --> 00:51:48,960
always images
 

3035
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:51,190
always images
the point is you aggregate them together

3036
00:51:51,190 --> 00:51:51,200
the point is you aggregate them together
 

3037
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:52,549
the point is you aggregate them together
you give it a little title

3038
00:51:52,549 --> 00:51:52,559
you give it a little title
 

3039
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:55,589
you give it a little title
there's a community and that's that was

3040
00:51:55,589 --> 00:51:55,599
there's a community and that's that was
 

3041
00:51:55,599 --> 00:51:58,870
there's a community and that's that was
one of the hardest right for a time

3042
00:51:58,870 --> 00:51:58,880
one of the hardest right for a time
 

3043
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:02,309
one of the hardest right for a time
and most important data science problems

3044
00:52:02,309 --> 00:52:02,319
and most important data science problems
 

3045
00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:04,710
and most important data science problems
in the world uh because it was

3046
00:52:04,710 --> 00:52:04,720
in the world uh because it was
 

3047
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:06,230
in the world uh because it was
accessible because it was uh

3048
00:52:06,230 --> 00:52:06,240
accessible because it was uh
 

3049
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:09,430
accessible because it was uh
made uh sort of like

3050
00:52:09,430 --> 00:52:09,440
made uh sort of like
 

3051
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:11,510
made uh sort of like
there's uh mechanisms by which like

3052
00:52:11,510 --> 00:52:11,520
there's uh mechanisms by which like
 

3053
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:13,190
there's uh mechanisms by which like
standards and mechanisms about which to

3054
00:52:13,190 --> 00:52:13,200
standards and mechanisms about which to
 

3055
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:14,470
standards and mechanisms about which to
judge your performance all those kinds

3056
00:52:14,470 --> 00:52:14,480
judge your performance all those kinds
 

3057
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:15,990
judge your performance all those kinds
of things and numerize actually

3058
00:52:15,990 --> 00:52:16,000
of things and numerize actually
 

3059
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,069
of things and numerize actually
step up from that is there something

3060
00:52:18,069 --> 00:52:18,079
step up from that is there something
 

3061
00:52:18,079 --> 00:52:19,190
step up from that is there something
more you can say about

3062
00:52:19,190 --> 00:52:19,200
more you can say about
 

3063
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:21,030
more you can say about
why from your perspective it's the

3064
00:52:21,030 --> 00:52:21,040
why from your perspective it's the
 

3065
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:23,510
why from your perspective it's the
hardest uh

3066
00:52:23,510 --> 00:52:23,520
hardest uh
 

3067
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:25,030
hardest uh
problem in the world i mean you said

3068
00:52:25,030 --> 00:52:25,040
problem in the world i mean you said
 

3069
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:26,790
problem in the world i mean you said
it's connected to the market so if you

3070
00:52:26,790 --> 00:52:26,800
it's connected to the market so if you
 

3071
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:27,430
it's connected to the market so if you
can find

3072
00:52:27,430 --> 00:52:27,440
can find
 

3073
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:29,990
can find
a pattern in the market that's a really

3074
00:52:29,990 --> 00:52:30,000
a pattern in the market that's a really
 

3075
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,829
a pattern in the market that's a really
difficult thing to do because a lot of

3076
00:52:31,829 --> 00:52:31,839
difficult thing to do because a lot of
 

3077
00:52:31,839 --> 00:52:33,270
difficult thing to do because a lot of
people are trying to do it

3078
00:52:33,270 --> 00:52:33,280
people are trying to do it
 

3079
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:36,230
people are trying to do it
exactly but there's also the the biggest

3080
00:52:36,230 --> 00:52:36,240
exactly but there's also the the biggest
 

3081
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:37,109
exactly but there's also the the biggest
one is it's

3082
00:52:37,109 --> 00:52:37,119
one is it's
 

3083
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:40,390
one is it's
it's non-stationary time series

3084
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:40,400
it's non-stationary time series
 

3085
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:42,790
it's non-stationary time series
we've tried to regularize the data so

3086
00:52:42,790 --> 00:52:42,800
we've tried to regularize the data so
 

3087
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:44,069
we've tried to regularize the data so
you can find

3088
00:52:44,069 --> 00:52:44,079
you can find
 

3089
00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:47,030
you can find
patterns by doing certain things to the

3090
00:52:47,030 --> 00:52:47,040
patterns by doing certain things to the
 

3091
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:48,470
patterns by doing certain things to the
features and the target

3092
00:52:48,470 --> 00:52:48,480
features and the target
 

3093
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:51,109
features and the target
but ultimately you're in a space where

3094
00:52:51,109 --> 00:52:51,119
but ultimately you're in a space where
 

3095
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:51,829
but ultimately you're in a space where
you don't

3096
00:52:51,829 --> 00:52:51,839
you don't
 

3097
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:53,670
you don't
there's no guarantees that the

3098
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:53,680
there's no guarantees that the
 

3099
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:56,549
there's no guarantees that the
out-of-sample distributions will

3100
00:52:56,549 --> 00:52:56,559
out-of-sample distributions will
 

3101
00:52:56,559 --> 00:52:59,589
out-of-sample distributions will
conform to any of the training data

3102
00:52:59,589 --> 00:52:59,599
conform to any of the training data
 

3103
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:03,030
conform to any of the training data
and and every single um

3104
00:53:03,030 --> 00:53:03,040
and and every single um
 

3105
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:05,430
and and every single um
era which we call on the website like

3106
00:53:05,430 --> 00:53:05,440
era which we call on the website like
 

3107
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:07,270
era which we call on the website like
every single era in the data which is

3108
00:53:07,270 --> 00:53:07,280
every single era in the data which is
 

3109
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:08,790
every single era in the data which is
like sort of showing you the order of

3110
00:53:08,790 --> 00:53:08,800
like sort of showing you the order of
 

3111
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:10,069
like sort of showing you the order of
the time

3112
00:53:10,069 --> 00:53:10,079
the time
 

3113
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:13,829
the time
um it's it's even the training data is

3114
00:53:13,829 --> 00:53:13,839
um it's it's even the training data is
 

3115
00:53:13,839 --> 00:53:14,870
um it's it's even the training data is
has these same

3116
00:53:14,870 --> 00:53:14,880
has these same
 

3117
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:18,790
has these same
same dislocations and um so

3118
00:53:18,790 --> 00:53:18,800
same dislocations and um so
 

3119
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:21,430
same dislocations and um so
yeah it's and so and then there's yeah

3120
00:53:21,430 --> 00:53:21,440
yeah it's and so and then there's yeah
 

3121
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:22,790
yeah it's and so and then there's yeah
there's so many things that might

3122
00:53:22,790 --> 00:53:22,800
there's so many things that might
 

3123
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:26,390
there's so many things that might
um might you might want to try this this

3124
00:53:26,390 --> 00:53:26,400
um might you might want to try this this
 

3125
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:28,230
um might you might want to try this this
like there's unlimited possible number

3126
00:53:28,230 --> 00:53:28,240
like there's unlimited possible number
 

3127
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:29,589
like there's unlimited possible number
of models right

3128
00:53:29,589 --> 00:53:29,599
of models right
 

3129
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:33,349
of models right
um and so

3130
00:53:33,349 --> 00:53:33,359

 

3131
00:53:33,359 --> 00:53:36,390

by by having it um be

3132
00:53:36,390 --> 00:53:36,400
by by having it um be
 

3133
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:39,190
by by having it um be
open uh we can at least search that

3134
00:53:39,190 --> 00:53:39,200
open uh we can at least search that
 

3135
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:40,309
open uh we can at least search that
space

3136
00:53:40,309 --> 00:53:40,319
space
 

3137
00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:41,670
space
it's zooming back out to the

3138
00:53:41,670 --> 00:53:41,680
it's zooming back out to the
 

3139
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:43,750
it's zooming back out to the
philosophical you said that numerai is

3140
00:53:43,750 --> 00:53:43,760
philosophical you said that numerai is
 

3141
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:44,230
philosophical you said that numerai is
uh

3142
00:53:44,230 --> 00:53:44,240
uh
 

3143
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:47,349
uh
very much like wall street pets uh

3144
00:53:47,349 --> 00:53:47,359
very much like wall street pets uh
 

3145
00:53:47,359 --> 00:53:50,630
very much like wall street pets uh
is is there i i think it'd be

3146
00:53:50,630 --> 00:53:50,640
is is there i i think it'd be
 

3147
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:52,390
is is there i i think it'd be
interesting to dig in why you think so

3148
00:53:52,390 --> 00:53:52,400
interesting to dig in why you think so
 

3149
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:53,910
interesting to dig in why you think so
i think you're speaking to the

3150
00:53:53,910 --> 00:53:53,920
i think you're speaking to the
 

3151
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:56,230
i think you're speaking to the
distributed nature of the two

3152
00:53:56,230 --> 00:53:56,240
distributed nature of the two
 

3153
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:58,630
distributed nature of the two
and the power of the people nature of

3154
00:53:58,630 --> 00:53:58,640
and the power of the people nature of
 

3155
00:53:58,640 --> 00:53:59,589
and the power of the people nature of
the two

3156
00:53:59,589 --> 00:53:59,599
the two
 

3157
00:53:59,599 --> 00:54:01,510
the two
so maybe can you speak to the

3158
00:54:01,510 --> 00:54:01,520
so maybe can you speak to the
 

3159
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:03,109
so maybe can you speak to the
similarities and the differences

3160
00:54:03,109 --> 00:54:03,119
similarities and the differences
 

3161
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:05,990
similarities and the differences
and in which way is nimra more powerful

3162
00:54:05,990 --> 00:54:06,000
and in which way is nimra more powerful
 

3163
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,109
and in which way is nimra more powerful
in which way

3164
00:54:07,109 --> 00:54:07,119
in which way
 

3165
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:09,510
in which way
is wall street bets more powerful yeah

3166
00:54:09,510 --> 00:54:09,520
is wall street bets more powerful yeah
 

3167
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:10,950
is wall street bets more powerful yeah
this is why the wall street bet story is

3168
00:54:10,950 --> 00:54:10,960
this is why the wall street bet story is
 

3169
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:12,710
this is why the wall street bet story is
so interesting to me because it's like

3170
00:54:12,710 --> 00:54:12,720
so interesting to me because it's like
 

3171
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:14,069
so interesting to me because it's like
feels like we're connected

3172
00:54:14,069 --> 00:54:14,079
feels like we're connected
 

3173
00:54:14,079 --> 00:54:17,270
feels like we're connected
yeah um and looking at how just looking

3174
00:54:17,270 --> 00:54:17,280
yeah um and looking at how just looking
 

3175
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:19,270
yeah um and looking at how just looking
at the forum of wall street vets it's

3176
00:54:19,270 --> 00:54:19,280
at the forum of wall street vets it's
 

3177
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:21,589
at the forum of wall street vets it's
i was talking earlier about how how can

3178
00:54:21,589 --> 00:54:21,599
i was talking earlier about how how can
 

3179
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:23,430
i was talking earlier about how how can
you make credible claims

3180
00:54:23,430 --> 00:54:23,440
you make credible claims
 

3181
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:24,950
you make credible claims
you're anonymous okay well maybe you can

3182
00:54:24,950 --> 00:54:24,960
you're anonymous okay well maybe you can
 

3183
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:26,710
you're anonymous okay well maybe you can
take a screenshot how

3184
00:54:26,710 --> 00:54:26,720
take a screenshot how
 

3185
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:29,349
take a screenshot how
or maybe you can upvote someone maybe

3186
00:54:29,349 --> 00:54:29,359
or maybe you can upvote someone maybe
 

3187
00:54:29,359 --> 00:54:31,270
or maybe you can upvote someone maybe
you can have karma on reddit

3188
00:54:31,270 --> 00:54:31,280
you can have karma on reddit
 

3189
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:33,349
you can have karma on reddit
and those kinds of things make this

3190
00:54:33,349 --> 00:54:33,359
and those kinds of things make this
 

3191
00:54:33,359 --> 00:54:35,589
and those kinds of things make this
emerging thing possible

3192
00:54:35,589 --> 00:54:35,599
emerging thing possible
 

3193
00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:38,789
emerging thing possible
numerai it didn't work at all

3194
00:54:38,789 --> 00:54:38,799
numerai it didn't work at all
 

3195
00:54:38,799 --> 00:54:41,589
numerai it didn't work at all
when we started it didn't work at all

3196
00:54:41,589 --> 00:54:41,599
when we started it didn't work at all
 

3197
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:42,390
when we started it didn't work at all
why

3198
00:54:42,390 --> 00:54:42,400
why
 

3199
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:44,549
why
people made multiple accounts they made

3200
00:54:44,549 --> 00:54:44,559
people made multiple accounts they made
 

3201
00:54:44,559 --> 00:54:46,069
people made multiple accounts they made
really random models and hoped they

3202
00:54:46,069 --> 00:54:46,079
really random models and hoped they
 

3203
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:46,950
really random models and hoped they
would get lucky

3204
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:46,960
would get lucky
 

3205
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:50,230
would get lucky
and some of them did yes staking

3206
00:54:50,230 --> 00:54:50,240
and some of them did yes staking
 

3207
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:53,990
and some of them did yes staking
was our like solution to could we

3208
00:54:53,990 --> 00:54:54,000
was our like solution to could we
 

3209
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,630
was our like solution to could we
could we make it so that we could trust

3210
00:54:56,630 --> 00:54:56,640
could we make it so that we could trust
 

3211
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:58,470
could we make it so that we could trust
we could know which model people

3212
00:54:58,470 --> 00:54:58,480
we could know which model people
 

3213
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:00,069
we could know which model people
believed in the most

3214
00:55:00,069 --> 00:55:00,079
believed in the most
 

3215
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:02,390
believed in the most
and we could wait models that had high

3216
00:55:02,390 --> 00:55:02,400
and we could wait models that had high
 

3217
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:03,510
and we could wait models that had high
stake

3218
00:55:03,510 --> 00:55:03,520
stake
 

3219
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:06,630
stake
more and effectively coordinate this

3220
00:55:06,630 --> 00:55:06,640
more and effectively coordinate this
 

3221
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:07,670
more and effectively coordinate this
group of people

3222
00:55:07,670 --> 00:55:07,680
group of people
 

3223
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:09,510
group of people
to be like well actually there's no

3224
00:55:09,510 --> 00:55:09,520
to be like well actually there's no
 

3225
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:11,270
to be like well actually there's no
incentive to creating bot accounts

3226
00:55:11,270 --> 00:55:11,280
incentive to creating bot accounts
 

3227
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:12,309
incentive to creating bot accounts
anymore

3228
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:12,319
anymore
 

3229
00:55:12,319 --> 00:55:14,950
anymore
either i stake my accounts in which case

3230
00:55:14,950 --> 00:55:14,960
either i stake my accounts in which case
 

3231
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:15,910
either i stake my accounts in which case
i should believe in them

3232
00:55:15,910 --> 00:55:15,920
i should believe in them
 

3233
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:18,549
i should believe in them
because i could lose my stake or i don't

3234
00:55:18,549 --> 00:55:18,559
because i could lose my stake or i don't
 

3235
00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:20,390
because i could lose my stake or i don't
and that's a very powerful thing

3236
00:55:20,390 --> 00:55:20,400
and that's a very powerful thing
 

3237
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:23,190
and that's a very powerful thing
uh that having a negative incentive and

3238
00:55:23,190 --> 00:55:23,200
uh that having a negative incentive and
 

3239
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:24,549
uh that having a negative incentive and
a positive incentive

3240
00:55:24,549 --> 00:55:24,559
a positive incentive
 

3241
00:55:24,559 --> 00:55:26,710
a positive incentive
can make can make things a lot better

3242
00:55:26,710 --> 00:55:26,720
can make can make things a lot better
 

3243
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:28,150
can make can make things a lot better
and staking is like this

3244
00:55:28,150 --> 00:55:28,160
and staking is like this
 

3245
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:30,789
and staking is like this
is this really nice like key thing about

3246
00:55:30,789 --> 00:55:30,799
is this really nice like key thing about
 

3247
00:55:30,799 --> 00:55:31,430
is this really nice like key thing about
blockchain

3248
00:55:31,430 --> 00:55:31,440
blockchain
 

3249
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:33,589
blockchain
it's like something special you can do

3250
00:55:33,589 --> 00:55:33,599
it's like something special you can do
 

3251
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:35,510
it's like something special you can do
where they're not even trusting

3252
00:55:35,510 --> 00:55:35,520
where they're not even trusting
 

3253
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:37,510
where they're not even trusting
us with their stake in some ways they're

3254
00:55:37,510 --> 00:55:37,520
us with their stake in some ways they're
 

3255
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:38,870
us with their stake in some ways they're
trusting the blockchain

3256
00:55:38,870 --> 00:55:38,880
trusting the blockchain
 

3257
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:42,150
trusting the blockchain
right um so the incentives like you say

3258
00:55:42,150 --> 00:55:42,160
right um so the incentives like you say
 

3259
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:43,589
right um so the incentives like you say
it's about making these perfect

3260
00:55:43,589 --> 00:55:43,599
it's about making these perfect
 

3261
00:55:43,599 --> 00:55:44,230
it's about making these perfect
incentives

3262
00:55:44,230 --> 00:55:44,240
incentives
 

3263
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:46,150
incentives
so that you can have coordination to

3264
00:55:46,150 --> 00:55:46,160
so that you can have coordination to
 

3265
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:48,630
so that you can have coordination to
solve one problem and

3266
00:55:48,630 --> 00:55:48,640
solve one problem and
 

3267
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:51,990
solve one problem and

would be
 

3291
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:19,190
would be
fascinating to think if numerai style

would you know would have to stake

3304
00:56:32,950 --> 00:56:32,960
would you know would have to stake
 

3305
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:34,230
would you know would have to stake
something

3306
00:56:34,230 --> 00:56:34,240
something
 

3307
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:35,910
something
in the comments they make on the

in the comments they make on the
 

3309
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:37,270

internet yeah
 

3311
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:38,710
internet yeah
like that's that's the problem with

3312
00:56:38,710 --> 00:56:38,720
like that's that's the problem with
 

3313
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:40,309
like that's that's the problem with
anonymity is like

3314
00:56:40,309 --> 00:56:40,319
anonymity is like
 

3315
00:56:40,319 --> 00:56:42,309
anonymity is like
anonymity is freedom and power that you

3316
00:56:42,309 --> 00:56:42,319
anonymity is freedom and power that you
 

3317
00:56:42,319 --> 00:56:44,789
anonymity is freedom and power that you
don't have to you can speak your mind

3318
00:56:44,789 --> 00:56:44,799
don't have to you can speak your mind
 

3319
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:48,950
don't have to you can speak your mind
but it's too easy to just be shitty

3320
00:56:48,950 --> 00:56:48,960
but it's too easy to just be shitty
 

3321

clean way to solve this problem
 

3331
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:02,309
clean way to solve this problem
it's it's a really beautiful way of

um and any if reddit wanted to they
 

3351
00:57:22,319 --> 00:57:23,910
um and any if reddit wanted to they
could even use that code to do

some ethereum grants
 

3361
00:57:32,319 --> 00:57:36,150
some ethereum grants
on how could they have more crypto stuff

3362
00:57:36,150 --> 00:57:36,160
on how could they have more crypto stuff
 

3363
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:39,030
on how could they have more crypto stuff
in there in ethereum because wouldn't

3364
00:57:39,030 --> 00:57:39,040
in there in ethereum because wouldn't

and here is a smart contract

3380
00:57:56,870 --> 00:57:56,880
and here is a smart contract
 

3381
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:59,430
and here is a smart contract
which no one in the world including me

can
 

3385
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:04,150
can
undo that says my i have staked

3386
00:58:04,150 --> 00:58:04,160
undo that says my i have staked
 

3387

uh millions against this claim
 

3389
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:10,230
uh millions against this claim
um that's powerful and then what could

3390
00:58:10,230 --> 00:58:10,240
um that's powerful and then what could
 

3391
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:11,109
um that's powerful and then what could
you do

3392
00:58:11,109 --> 00:58:11,119
you do
 

3393
00:58:11,119 --> 00:58:12,150
you do
and of course it doesn't have to be

3394
00:58:12,150 --> 00:58:12,160
and of course it doesn't have to be
 

3395
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:14,069
and of course it doesn't have to be
millions it could be just very small

3396
00:58:14,069 --> 00:58:14,079
millions it could be just very small
 

3397
00:58:14,079 --> 00:58:14,950
millions it could be just very small
amount but then

3398
00:58:14,950 --> 00:58:14,960
amount but then
 

3399
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:16,630
amount but then
just a huge number of users doing that

3400
00:58:16,630 --> 00:58:16,640
just a huge number of users doing that
 

3401
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:19,510
just a huge number of users doing that
kind of stake exactly

3402
00:58:19,510 --> 00:58:19,520
kind of stake exactly
 

3403
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:20,950
kind of stake exactly
that you know that could change the

if we look into the future do you think

3420
00:58:34,390 --> 00:58:34,400
if we look into the future do you think
 

3421
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:36,950
if we look into the future do you think
it's possible that numerai

is run by basically
this army of ai systems with

3434
00:58:54,870 --> 00:58:54,880
this army of ai systems with
 

3435
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:57,750
this army of ai systems with
high level human supervision yeah the

3436
00:58:57,750 --> 00:58:57,760
high level human supervision yeah the
 

3437
00:58:57,760 --> 00:58:58,549
high level human supervision yeah the
thing is

3438
00:58:58,549 --> 00:58:58,559
thing is
 

3439
00:58:58,559 --> 00:59:01,030
thing is
that some of them could be could be bad

um some of the humans no well these
systems could be

3446
00:59:05,430 --> 00:59:05,440
systems could be
 

3447
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:08,390
systems could be
tricky so actually i once met a hedge

3448

3519
01:00:20,319 --> 01:00:23,270
think
uh maybe i misunderstood i thought that

3520
01:00:23,270 --> 01:00:23,280
uh maybe i misunderstood i thought that
 

3521
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:24,069
uh maybe i misunderstood i thought that
um

3522
01:00:24,069 --> 01:00:24,079
um
 

3523
01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:25,430
um
you're saying ai systems could be

3524
01:00:25,430 --> 01:00:25,440
you're saying ai systems could be
 

3525
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:26,789
you're saying ai systems could be
dangerous but you just describe how

3526
01:00:26,789 --> 01:00:26,799
dangerous but you just describe how
 

3527
01:00:26,799 --> 01:00:28,309
dangerous but you just describe how
humans can be dangerous

3528
01:00:28,309 --> 01:00:28,319
humans can be dangerous
 

3529
01:00:28,319 --> 01:00:31,829
humans can be dangerous
so which is safer so i mean one thing is

3530
01:00:31,829 --> 01:00:31,839
so which is safer so i mean one thing is
 

3531
01:00:31,839 --> 01:00:35,430
so which is safer so i mean one thing is
uh numero yeah so wall street bets these

3532
01:00:35,430 --> 01:00:35,440
uh numero yeah so wall street bets these
 

3533
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:36,470
uh numero yeah so wall street bets these
kinds of like

3534
01:00:36,470 --> 01:00:36,480
kinds of like
 

3535
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:39,030
kinds of like
these kinds of attacks like it's not

3536
01:00:39,030 --> 01:00:39,040
these kinds of attacks like it's not
 

3537
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:39,910
these kinds of attacks like it's not
possible to

3538
01:00:39,910 --> 01:00:39,920
possible to
 

3539
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:43,109
possible to
to model numerized data and then come up

3540
01:00:43,109 --> 01:00:43,119
to model numerized data and then come up
 

3541
01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:44,950
to model numerized data and then come up
with the idea from the model

3542
01:00:44,950 --> 01:00:44,960
with the idea from the model
 

3543
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:47,430
with the idea from the model
let's short screen gamestop right it's

3544
01:00:47,430 --> 01:00:47,440
let's short screen gamestop right it's
 

3545
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:49,750
let's short screen gamestop right it's
not even framed in that way it's not

3546
01:00:49,750 --> 01:00:49,760
not even framed in that way it's not
 

3547
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:52,069
not even framed in that way it's not
like possible to have that idea

3548
01:00:52,069 --> 01:00:52,079
like possible to have that idea
 

3549
01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:54,230
like possible to have that idea
so but it is possible for like kind of a

3550
01:00:54,230 --> 01:00:54,240
so but it is possible for like kind of a
 

3551
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:55,270
so but it is possible for like kind of a
bunch of humans so

3552
01:00:55,270 --> 01:00:55,280
bunch of humans so
 

3553
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:57,910
bunch of humans so
i think there's it's numerix could get

3554
01:00:57,910 --> 01:00:57,920
i think there's it's numerix could get
 

3555
01:00:57,920 --> 01:00:59,190
i think there's it's numerix could get
very powerful

3556
01:00:59,190 --> 01:00:59,200
very powerful
 

3557
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:02,309
very powerful
uh without it being dangerous but

3558
01:01:02,309 --> 01:01:02,319
uh without it being dangerous but
 

3559
01:01:02,319 --> 01:01:04,150
uh without it being dangerous but
wall street bets needs to get a little

3560
01:01:04,150 --> 01:01:04,160
wall street bets needs to get a little
 

3561
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:05,430
wall street bets needs to get a little
bit more powerful

3562
01:01:05,430 --> 01:01:05,440
bit more powerful
 

3563
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:08,710
bit more powerful
and it'll be pretty dangerous yeah well

3564
01:01:08,710 --> 01:01:08,720
and it'll be pretty dangerous yeah well
 

3565
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:10,150
and it'll be pretty dangerous yeah well
i mean uh so

3566
01:01:10,150 --> 01:01:10,160
i mean uh so
 

3567
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:12,710
i mean uh so
this is a good place to kind of think

3568
01:01:12,710 --> 01:01:12,720
this is a good place to kind of think
 

3569
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:15,030
this is a good place to kind of think
about mri data today

3570
01:01:15,030 --> 01:01:15,040
about mri data today
 

3571
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:18,230
about mri data today
uh and umri signals and what that looks

3572
01:01:18,230 --> 01:01:18,240
uh and umri signals and what that looks
 

3573
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:19,030
uh and umri signals and what that looks
like in 10

3574
01:01:19,030 --> 01:01:19,040
like in 10
 

3575
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:22,230
like in 10
20 30 50 100 years you know

3576
01:01:22,230 --> 01:01:22,240
20 30 50 100 years you know
 

3577
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:23,990
20 30 50 100 years you know
like right now i guess maybe you can

3578
01:01:23,990 --> 01:01:24,000
like right now i guess maybe you can
 

3579
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,829
like right now i guess maybe you can
correct me but this the data that we're

3580
01:01:25,829 --> 01:01:25,839
correct me but this the data that we're
 

3581
01:01:25,839 --> 01:01:27,910
correct me but this the data that we're
working with is like a window

3582
01:01:27,910 --> 01:01:27,920
working with is like a window
 

3583
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:31,910
working with is like a window
it's a you know anonymized obfuscated

3584
01:01:31,910 --> 01:01:31,920
it's a you know anonymized obfuscated
 

3585
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:35,030
it's a you know anonymized obfuscated
window into a particular aspect a time

3586
01:01:35,030 --> 01:01:35,040
window into a particular aspect a time
 

3587
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:37,829
window into a particular aspect a time
period of the market

3588
01:01:37,829 --> 01:01:37,839
period of the market
 

3589
01:01:37,839 --> 01:01:39,510
period of the market
you know you can expand that more and

3590
01:01:39,510 --> 01:01:39,520
you know you can expand that more and
 

3591
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:41,109
you know you can expand that more and
more and more and more potentially

3592
01:01:41,109 --> 01:01:41,119
more and more and more potentially
 

3593
01:01:41,119 --> 01:01:43,510
more and more and more potentially
you can imagine in different dimensions

3594
01:01:43,510 --> 01:01:43,520
you can imagine in different dimensions
 

3595
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:45,190
you can imagine in different dimensions
to where it encapsulates

3596
01:01:45,190 --> 01:01:45,200
to where it encapsulates
 

3597
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:48,789
to where it encapsulates
all the things that uh where you could

3598
01:01:48,789 --> 01:01:48,799
all the things that uh where you could
 

3599
01:01:48,799 --> 01:01:50,829
all the things that uh where you could
uh include kind of human to human

3600
01:01:50,829 --> 01:01:50,839
uh include kind of human to human
 

3601
01:01:50,839 --> 01:01:52,069
uh include kind of human to human
communication

3602
01:01:52,069 --> 01:01:52,079
communication
 

3603
01:01:52,079 --> 01:01:54,390
communication
that was available for like uh to buy

3604
01:01:54,390 --> 01:01:54,400
that was available for like uh to buy
 

3605
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:55,990
that was available for like uh to buy
gamestop for example

3606
01:01:55,990 --> 01:01:56,000
gamestop for example
 

3607
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,549
gamestop for example
on on wall street bets so maybe it's a

3608
01:01:58,549 --> 01:01:58,559
on on wall street bets so maybe it's a
 

3609
01:01:58,559 --> 01:01:59,589
on on wall street bets so maybe it's a
step back can you

3610
01:01:59,589 --> 01:01:59,599
step back can you
 

3611
01:01:59,599 --> 01:02:03,349
step back can you
speak to what is numerized signals

3612
01:02:03,349 --> 01:02:03,359
speak to what is numerized signals
 

3613
01:02:03,359 --> 01:02:05,910
speak to what is numerized signals
and uh what are the different data sets

3614
01:02:05,910 --> 01:02:05,920
and uh what are the different data sets
 

3615
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:07,430
and uh what are the different data sets
that are involved

3616
01:02:07,430 --> 01:02:07,440
that are involved
 

3617
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:10,789
that are involved
so with numeric signals um you're still

3618
01:02:10,789 --> 01:02:10,799
so with numeric signals um you're still
 

3619
01:02:10,799 --> 01:02:14,309
so with numeric signals um you're still
providing predictions to us

3620
01:02:14,309 --> 01:02:14,319
providing predictions to us
 

3621
01:02:14,319 --> 01:02:18,069
providing predictions to us
but you can do it from your own data set

3622
01:02:18,069 --> 01:02:18,079
but you can do it from your own data set
 

3623
01:02:18,079 --> 01:02:20,630
but you can do it from your own data set
so numeraid's all you have to model our

3624
01:02:20,630 --> 01:02:20,640
so numeraid's all you have to model our
 

3625
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:22,630
so numeraid's all you have to model our
data to come up with predictions

3626
01:02:22,630 --> 01:02:22,640
data to come up with predictions
 

3627
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:25,109
data to come up with predictions
numerous signals is whatever data you

3628
01:02:25,109 --> 01:02:25,119
numerous signals is whatever data you
 

3629
01:02:25,119 --> 01:02:25,829
numerous signals is whatever data you
can find

3630
01:02:25,829 --> 01:02:25,839
can find
 

3631
01:02:25,839 --> 01:02:28,470
can find
out there you can turn it into a signal

3632
01:02:28,470 --> 01:02:28,480
out there you can turn it into a signal
 

3633
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:29,670
out there you can turn it into a signal
and give it to us

3634
01:02:29,670 --> 01:02:29,680
and give it to us
 

3635
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:32,549
and give it to us
so it's a way for us to import signals

3636
01:02:32,549 --> 01:02:32,559
so it's a way for us to import signals
 

3637
01:02:32,559 --> 01:02:33,430
so it's a way for us to import signals
on data

3638
01:02:33,430 --> 01:02:33,440
on data
 

3639
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:36,789
on data
we don't yet have and

3640
01:02:36,789 --> 01:02:36,799
we don't yet have and
 

3641
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:38,150
we don't yet have and
and that's why it's particularly

3642
01:02:38,150 --> 01:02:38,160
and that's why it's particularly
 

3643
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:40,470
and that's why it's particularly
valuable because it's

3644
01:02:40,470 --> 01:02:40,480
valuable because it's
 

3645
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:42,950
valuable because it's
going to be signals you're only rewarded

3646
01:02:42,950 --> 01:02:42,960
going to be signals you're only rewarded
 

3647
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:44,150
going to be signals you're only rewarded
for signals that are

3648
01:02:44,150 --> 01:02:44,160
for signals that are
 

3649
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:47,430
for signals that are
orthogonal to our core signal

3650
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:47,440
orthogonal to our core signal
 

3651
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:49,029
orthogonal to our core signal
so you have to be doing something

3652
01:02:49,029 --> 01:02:49,039
so you have to be doing something
 

3653
01:02:49,039 --> 01:02:51,270
so you have to be doing something
uncorrelated and so

3654
01:02:51,270 --> 01:02:51,280
uncorrelated and so
 

3655
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:53,750
uncorrelated and so
strange alternative data tends to have

3656
01:02:53,750 --> 01:02:53,760
strange alternative data tends to have
 

3657
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:54,870
strange alternative data tends to have
that property

3658
01:02:54,870 --> 01:02:54,880
that property
 

3659
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:57,270
that property
there isn't too many other signals that

3660
01:02:57,270 --> 01:02:57,280
there isn't too many other signals that
 

3661
01:02:57,280 --> 01:02:58,549
there isn't too many other signals that
are correlated with

3662
01:02:58,549 --> 01:02:58,559
are correlated with
 

3663
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:01,829
are correlated with
um with uh you know what's happening on

3664
01:03:01,829 --> 01:03:01,839
um with uh you know what's happening on
 

3665
01:03:01,839 --> 01:03:02,789
um with uh you know what's happening on
wall street bets

3666
01:03:02,789 --> 01:03:02,799
wall street bets
 

3667
01:03:02,799 --> 01:03:04,470
wall street bets
that's not going to be like correlated

3668
01:03:04,470 --> 01:03:04,480
that's not going to be like correlated
 

3669
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:07,029
that's not going to be like correlated
with the price to earnings ratio right

3670
01:03:07,029 --> 01:03:07,039
with the price to earnings ratio right
 

3671
01:03:07,039 --> 01:03:09,990
with the price to earnings ratio right
um and we have some users as of recently

3672
01:03:09,990 --> 01:03:10,000
um and we have some users as of recently
 

3673
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,510
um and we have some users as of recently
as of like a week ago

3674
01:03:11,510 --> 01:03:11,520
as of like a week ago
 

3675
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:13,430
as of like a week ago
there was a user that created i think

3676
01:03:13,430 --> 01:03:13,440
there was a user that created i think
 

3677
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:14,549
there was a user that created i think
he's in india

3678
01:03:14,549 --> 01:03:14,559
he's in india
 

3679
01:03:14,559 --> 01:03:17,589
he's in india
he created a signal

3680
01:03:17,589 --> 01:03:17,599
he created a signal
 

3681
01:03:17,599 --> 01:03:21,349
he created a signal
that is scraped from wall street bits

3682
01:03:21,349 --> 01:03:21,359
that is scraped from wall street bits
 

3683
01:03:21,359 --> 01:03:24,470
that is scraped from wall street bits
and now we have that signal uh as

3684
01:03:24,470 --> 01:03:24,480
and now we have that signal uh as
 

3685
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:27,589
and now we have that signal uh as
one of our signals in thousands

3686
01:03:27,589 --> 01:03:27,599
one of our signals in thousands
 

3687
01:03:27,599 --> 01:03:29,270
one of our signals in thousands
that we use at numerai and the structure

3688
01:03:29,270 --> 01:03:29,280
that we use at numerai and the structure
 

3689
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:31,510
that we use at numerai and the structure
of the signal is similar so this is just

3690
01:03:31,510 --> 01:03:31,520
of the signal is similar so this is just
 

3691
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:33,190
of the signal is similar so this is just
numbers and time series data

3692
01:03:33,190 --> 01:03:33,200
numbers and time series data
 

3693
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:35,510
numbers and time series data
it's exactly and it's just like it's

3694
01:03:35,510 --> 01:03:35,520
it's exactly and it's just like it's
 

3695
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:37,190
it's exactly and it's just like it's
kind of a you're providing a ranking of

3696
01:03:37,190 --> 01:03:37,200
kind of a you're providing a ranking of
 

3697
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:38,549
kind of a you're providing a ranking of
stocks so you just say

3698
01:03:38,549 --> 01:03:38,559
stocks so you just say
 

3699
01:03:38,559 --> 01:03:41,430
stocks so you just say
give it a one means you like the stock

3700
01:03:41,430 --> 01:03:41,440
give it a one means you like the stock
 

3701
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:43,270
give it a one means you like the stock
zero means you don't like the stock

3702
01:03:43,270 --> 01:03:43,280
zero means you don't like the stock
 

3703
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:45,109
zero means you don't like the stock
and you provide that for five thousand

3704
01:03:45,109 --> 01:03:45,119
and you provide that for five thousand
 

3705
01:03:45,119 --> 01:03:46,630

source this collab notebook

3716
01:03:55,190 --> 01:03:55,200
source this collab notebook
 

3717
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:57,670
source this collab notebook
uh you can go and see it and look and so

3718
01:03:57,670 --> 01:03:57,680
uh you can go and see it and look and so
 

3719
01:03:57,680 --> 01:03:58,710
uh you can go and see it and look and so
yeah it's taking that

3720
01:03:58,710 --> 01:03:58,720
yeah it's taking that
 

3721
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:00,630
yeah it's taking that
making a sentiment score and then

3722
01:04:00,630 --> 01:04:00,640
making a sentiment score and then
 

3723
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:01,829
making a sentiment score and then
turning it into a rank

3724
01:04:01,829 --> 01:04:01,839
turning it into a rank
 

3725
01:04:01,839 --> 01:04:05,029
turning it into a rank
sentiment score yeah uh like this stock

3726
01:04:05,029 --> 01:04:05,039
sentiment score yeah uh like this stock
 

3727
01:04:05,039 --> 01:04:06,710
sentiment score yeah uh like this stock
sucks so the stock is awesome

3728
01:04:06,710 --> 01:04:06,720
sucks so the stock is awesome
 

3729
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:08,470
sucks so the stock is awesome
uh and then converting that's that's

3730
01:04:08,470 --> 01:04:08,480
uh and then converting that's that's
 

3731
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:09,990
uh and then converting that's that's
fast just even looking at that data

3732
01:04:09,990 --> 01:04:10,000
fast just even looking at that data
 

3733
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:10,950
fast just even looking at that data
would be

3734
01:04:10,950 --> 01:04:10,960
would be
 

3735
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:13,670
would be
fascinating so on the signal side what's

3736
01:04:13,670 --> 01:04:13,680
fascinating so on the signal side what's
 

3737
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:14,309
fascinating so on the signal side what's
the

3738
01:04:14,309 --> 01:04:14,319
the
 

3739
01:04:14,319 --> 01:04:16,710
the
vision it's long term what do you see

3740
01:04:16,710 --> 01:04:16,720
vision it's long term what do you see
 

3741
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:18,230
vision it's long term what do you see
that becoming

3742
01:04:18,230 --> 01:04:18,240
that becoming
 

3743
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:20,789
that becoming
so we want to manage all the money in

3744
01:04:20,789 --> 01:04:20,799
so we want to manage all the money in
 

3745
01:04:20,799 --> 01:04:21,589
so we want to manage all the money in
the world

3746
01:04:21,589 --> 01:04:21,599
the world
 

3747
01:04:21,599 --> 01:04:24,870
the world
that's numerized mission and to get that

3748
01:04:24,870 --> 01:04:24,880
that's numerized mission and to get that
 

3749
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:27,430
that's numerized mission and to get that
we need to have all the data

3750
01:04:27,430 --> 01:04:27,440
we need to have all the data
 

3751
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:30,549
we need to have all the data
and have all of the talent like there's

3752
01:04:30,549 --> 01:04:30,559
and have all of the talent like there's
 

3753
01:04:30,559 --> 01:04:31,270
and have all of the talent like there's
no way

3754
01:04:31,270 --> 01:04:31,280
no way
 

3755
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:32,710
no way
for the first principles if you had

3756
01:04:32,710 --> 01:04:32,720
for the first principles if you had
 

3757
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:34,870
for the first principles if you had
really good modeling and really good

3758
01:04:34,870 --> 01:04:34,880
really good modeling and really good
 

3759
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:35,430
really good modeling and really good
data

3760
01:04:35,430 --> 01:04:35,440
data
 

3761
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:38,150
data
that you would lose right it's just a

3762
01:04:38,150 --> 01:04:38,160
that you would lose right it's just a
 

3763
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:40,150
that you would lose right it's just a
question of how much do you need to get

3764
01:04:40,150 --> 01:04:40,160
question of how much do you need to get
 

3765
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:42,710
question of how much do you need to get
to get really good so numerai already

3766
01:04:42,710 --> 01:04:42,720
to get really good so numerai already
 

3767
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:44,390
to get really good so numerai already
has some really nice data that we give

3768
01:04:44,390 --> 01:04:44,400
has some really nice data that we give
 

3769
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:45,190
has some really nice data that we give
out

3770
01:04:45,190 --> 01:04:45,200
out
 

3771
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:48,309
out
this year we are 10xing that

3772
01:04:48,309 --> 01:04:48,319
this year we are 10xing that
 

3773
01:04:48,319 --> 01:04:49,910
this year we are 10xing that
and i actually think we'll 10x the

3774
01:04:49,910 --> 01:04:49,920
and i actually think we'll 10x the
 

3775
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:51,750
and i actually think we'll 10x the
amount of data we have on numerix

3776
01:04:51,750 --> 01:04:51,760
amount of data we have on numerix
 

3777
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:54,549
amount of data we have on numerix
every year for at least the next 10

3778
01:04:54,549 --> 01:04:54,559
every year for at least the next 10
 

3779
01:04:54,559 --> 01:04:55,190
every year for at least the next 10
years

3780
01:04:55,190 --> 01:04:55,200
years
 

3781
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:57,750
years
wow so it's going to get very big the

3782
01:04:57,750 --> 01:04:57,760
wow so it's going to get very big the
 

3783
01:04:57,760 --> 01:04:59,029
wow so it's going to get very big the
data we give out

3784
01:04:59,029 --> 01:04:59,039
data we give out
 

3785
01:04:59,039 --> 01:05:02,390
data we give out
and signals is more

3786
01:05:02,390 --> 01:05:02,400
and signals is more
 

3787
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:05,829
and signals is more
data people with any other random data

3788
01:05:05,829 --> 01:05:05,839
data people with any other random data
 

3789
01:05:05,839 --> 01:05:06,390
data people with any other random data
set

3790
01:05:06,390 --> 01:05:06,400
set
 

3791
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:08,470
set
can turn that into a signal and give it

3792
01:05:08,470 --> 01:05:08,480
can turn that into a signal and give it
 

3793
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:10,230
can turn that into a signal and give it
to us and in some sense that kind of

3794
01:05:10,230 --> 01:05:10,240
to us and in some sense that kind of
 

3795
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:12,309
to us and in some sense that kind of
data is the edge cases the weirdness is

3796
01:05:12,309 --> 01:05:12,319
data is the edge cases the weirdness is
 

3797
01:05:12,319 --> 01:05:12,710
data is the edge cases the weirdness is
the

3798
01:05:12,710 --> 01:05:12,720
the
 

3799
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:14,789
the
so you're focused on like the bulk yeah

3800
01:05:14,789 --> 01:05:14,799
so you're focused on like the bulk yeah
 

3801
01:05:14,799 --> 01:05:16,950
so you're focused on like the bulk yeah
like the main data and then there's just

3802
01:05:16,950 --> 01:05:16,960
like the main data and then there's just
 

3803
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:18,549
like the main data and then there's just
like weirdness from all over the place

3804
01:05:18,549 --> 01:05:18,559
like weirdness from all over the place
 

3805
01:05:18,559 --> 01:05:20,390
like weirdness from all over the place
that just can enter through this

3806
01:05:20,390 --> 01:05:20,400
that just can enter through this
 

3807
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:23,670
that just can enter through this
back door exactly and the it's

3808
01:05:23,670 --> 01:05:23,680
back door exactly and the it's
 

3809
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:26,309
back door exactly and the it's
it's also um a little bit shorter term

3810
01:05:26,309 --> 01:05:26,319
it's also um a little bit shorter term
 

3811
01:05:26,319 --> 01:05:26,950
it's also um a little bit shorter term
so

3812
01:05:26,950 --> 01:05:26,960
so
 

3813
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:29,589
so
right the signals are set about a seven

3814
01:05:29,589 --> 01:05:29,599
right the signals are set about a seven
 

3815
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:31,109
right the signals are set about a seven
day time horizon

3816
01:05:31,109 --> 01:05:31,119
day time horizon
 

3817
01:05:31,119 --> 01:05:34,630
day time horizon
and the on numeric it's like a 30 day so

3818
01:05:34,630 --> 01:05:34,640
and the on numeric it's like a 30 day so
 

3819
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:38,390
and the on numeric it's like a 30 day so
it's often for faster situations

3820
01:05:38,390 --> 01:05:38,400
it's often for faster situations
 

3821
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:40,630
it's often for faster situations
you've written about a master plan and

3822
01:05:40,630 --> 01:05:40,640
you've written about a master plan and
 

3823
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:42,630
you've written about a master plan and
you've mentioned which i love

3824
01:05:42,630 --> 01:05:42,640
you've mentioned which i love
 

3825
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:45,589
you've mentioned which i love
uh in a similar sort of style of big

3826
01:05:45,589 --> 01:05:45,599
uh in a similar sort of style of big
 

3827
01:05:45,599 --> 01:05:46,470
uh in a similar sort of style of big
style thinking

3828
01:05:46,470 --> 01:05:46,480
style thinking
 

3829
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:49,349
style thinking
you would like numerai to manage all of

3830
01:05:49,349 --> 01:05:49,359
you would like numerai to manage all of
 

3831
01:05:49,359 --> 01:05:50,390
you would like numerai to manage all of
the world's

3832
01:05:50,390 --> 01:05:50,400
the world's
 

3833
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:54,549
the world's
money uh so how do we get there

3834
01:05:54,549 --> 01:05:54,559
money uh so how do we get there
 

3835
01:05:54,559 --> 01:05:57,750
money uh so how do we get there
from from yesterday to

3836
01:05:57,750 --> 01:05:57,760
from from yesterday to
 

3837
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:00,309
from from yesterday to
several years from now like what's uh

3838
01:06:00,309 --> 01:06:00,319
several years from now like what's uh
 

3839
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:01,990
several years from now like what's uh
what is the plan

3840
01:06:01,990 --> 01:06:02,000
what is the plan
 

3841
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,950
what is the plan
so you've already started to allude to

3842
01:06:04,950 --> 01:06:04,960
so you've already started to allude to
 

3843
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:06,630
so you've already started to allude to
it it's like get all the data and get it

3844
01:06:06,630 --> 01:06:06,640
it it's like get all the data and get it
 

3845
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:06,950
it it's like get all the data and get it
uh

3846
01:06:06,950 --> 01:06:06,960
uh
 

3847
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:10,950
uh
yeah all the talent yeah humans

3848
01:06:10,950 --> 01:06:10,960
yeah all the talent yeah humans
 

3849
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:13,190
yeah all the talent yeah humans
models exactly i mean the important

3850
01:06:13,190 --> 01:06:13,200
models exactly i mean the important
 

3851
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:14,710
models exactly i mean the important
thing to note there is

3852
01:06:14,710 --> 01:06:14,720
thing to note there is
 

3853
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:16,870
thing to note there is
what would that mean right and i i think

3854
01:06:16,870 --> 01:06:16,880
what would that mean right and i i think
 

3855
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:19,270
what would that mean right and i i think
the biggest thing it means is like uh

3856
01:06:19,270 --> 01:06:19,280
the biggest thing it means is like uh
 

3857
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:22,470
the biggest thing it means is like uh
if there was one hedge fund um you would

3858
01:06:22,470 --> 01:06:22,480
if there was one hedge fund um you would
 

3859
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:22,950
if there was one hedge fund um you would
have

3860
01:06:22,950 --> 01:06:22,960
have
 

3861
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:26,069
have
uh not so much talent wasted

3862
01:06:26,069 --> 01:06:26,079
uh not so much talent wasted
 

3863
01:06:26,079 --> 01:06:28,069
uh not so much talent wasted
on all the other hedge funds like it's

3864
01:06:28,069 --> 01:06:28,079
on all the other hedge funds like it's
 

3865
01:06:28,079 --> 01:06:30,230
on all the other hedge funds like it's
super weird how the industry works

3866
01:06:30,230 --> 01:06:30,240
super weird how the industry works
 

3867
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:32,230
super weird how the industry works
it's like one hedge fund gets a data

3868
01:06:32,230 --> 01:06:32,240
it's like one hedge fund gets a data
 

3869
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:33,829
it's like one hedge fund gets a data
source and hires a phd

3870
01:06:33,829 --> 01:06:33,839
source and hires a phd
 

3871
01:06:33,839 --> 01:06:35,430
source and hires a phd
and another hedge fund has to buy the

3872
01:06:35,430 --> 01:06:35,440
and another hedge fund has to buy the
 

3873
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:37,430
and another hedge fund has to buy the
same data source and hire a phd

3874
01:06:37,430 --> 01:06:37,440

01:09:20,630 --> 01:09:20,640
bets we talk about it like we want to
 

4037
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:21,990
bets we talk about it like we want to
make a lot of independent bets because

4038
01:09:21,990 --> 01:09:22,000
make a lot of independent bets because
 

4039
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:23,510
make a lot of independent bets because
that's going to be um

4040
01:09:23,510 --> 01:09:23,520
that's going to be um
 

4041
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:25,189
that's going to be um
a higher sharp than if you have a lot of

4042
01:09:25,189 --> 01:09:25,199
a higher sharp than if you have a lot of
 

4043
01:09:25,199 --> 01:09:26,789
a higher sharp than if you have a lot of
bets that depend on each other like all

4044
01:09:26,789 --> 01:09:26,799
bets that depend on each other like all
 

4045
01:09:26,799 --> 01:09:29,349
bets that depend on each other like all
in one sector

4046
01:09:29,349 --> 01:09:29,359
in one sector
 

4047
01:09:29,359 --> 01:09:32,550
in one sector
um but but yeah i mean the point the

4048
01:09:32,550 --> 01:09:32,560
um but but yeah i mean the point the
 

4049
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:34,309
um but but yeah i mean the point the
the point is that you want the prices of

4050
01:09:34,309 --> 01:09:34,319
the point is that you want the prices of
 

4051
01:09:34,319 --> 01:09:35,749
the point is that you want the prices of
the stocks to be

4052
01:09:35,749 --> 01:09:35,759
the stocks to be
 

4053
01:09:35,759 --> 01:09:39,669
the stocks to be
to be reflective of of how

4054
01:09:39,669 --> 01:09:39,679
to be reflective of of how
 

4055
01:09:39,679 --> 01:09:41,510
to be reflective of of how
of their value of the underlying value

4056
01:09:41,510 --> 01:09:41,520
of their value of the underlying value
 

4057
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:43,510
of their value of the underlying value
yeah yeah you shouldn't have

4058
01:09:43,510 --> 01:09:43,520
yeah yeah you shouldn't have
 

4059
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:46,709
yeah yeah you shouldn't have
there be like a hedge fund that's able

4060
01:09:46,709 --> 01:09:46,719
there be like a hedge fund that's able
 

4061
01:09:46,719 --> 01:09:47,990
there be like a hedge fund that's able
to say well

4062
01:09:47,990 --> 01:09:48,000
to say well
 

4063
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,470
to say well
um i've looked at some data and all of

4064
01:09:50,470 --> 01:09:50,480
um i've looked at some data and all of
 

4065
01:09:50,480 --> 01:09:52,309
um i've looked at some data and all of
this stuff's super mispriced

4066
01:09:52,309 --> 01:09:52,319
this stuff's super mispriced
 

4067
01:09:52,319 --> 01:09:54,550
this stuff's super mispriced
like that's super bad for society if

4068
01:09:54,550 --> 01:09:54,560
like that's super bad for society if
 

4069
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:56,390
like that's super bad for society if
it's if it looks like that to someone

4070
01:09:56,390 --> 01:09:56,400
it's if it looks like that to someone
 

4071
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:58,950
it's if it looks like that to someone
i guess the the underlying question then

4072
01:09:58,950 --> 01:09:58,960
i guess the the underlying question then
 

4073
01:09:58,960 --> 01:09:59,910
i guess the the underlying question then
is uh

4074
01:09:59,910 --> 01:09:59,920
is uh
 

4075
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:01,990
is uh
do you see that the market often like

4076
01:10:01,990 --> 01:10:02,000
do you see that the market often like
 

4077
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,189
do you see that the market often like
drifts away

4078
01:10:03,189 --> 01:10:03,199
drifts away
 

4079
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:05,750
drifts away
from the underlying value of companies

4080
01:10:05,750 --> 01:10:05,760
from the underlying value of companies
 

4081
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:07,750
from the underlying value of companies
and it becomes a game in itself

4082
01:10:07,750 --> 01:10:07,760
and it becomes a game in itself
 

4083
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:10,950
and it becomes a game in itself
like with these whatever they're called

like with these whatever they're called
 

4085
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:13,030
like with these whatever they're called
like derivatives like the option like

4086
01:10:13,030 --> 01:10:13,040
like derivatives like the option like
 

4087
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:15,590

it's like layers of game on top of the
 

4095
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:23,510
it's like layers of game on top of the
actual

4096
01:10:23,510 --> 01:10:23,520
actual
 

4097
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:25,350
actual
like what you said which is like the

4098

like what you said which is like the
 

4099

um because you yeah you kind of
 

4267
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:22,229
um because you yeah you kind of
you stop caring about like the like

4268
01:13:22,229 --> 01:13:22,239
you stop caring about like the like
 

4269
01:13:22,239 --> 01:13:24,390
you stop caring about like the like
the price and you care about like the

tend to believe
from my interactions with people that

01:37:11,350 --> 01:37:11,360
from my interactions with people that
 

5655
01:37:11,360 --> 01:37:13,430
from my interactions with people that
it's a kind of prod to say

it's not going to succeed
 

5669
01:37:24,320 --> 01:37:26,950
it's not going to succeed
quickly in some way they're like this is

5670
01:37:26,950 --> 01:37:26,960
quickly in some way they're like this is
 

5671
01:37:26,960 --> 01:37:28,310
quickly in some way they're like this is
going to take a long time

5672
01:37:28,310 --> 01:37:28,320
going to take a long time
 

5673
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:32,629
going to take a long time
um and maybe maybe that's good to know

5674
01:37:32,629 --> 01:37:32,639
um and maybe maybe that's good to know
 

5675
01:37:32,639 --> 01:37:36,229
um and maybe maybe that's good to know
and certainly ai in in trading

that's one of the most so uh
philosophically interesting questions

5680
01:37:42,149 --> 01:37:42,159
philosophically interesting questions
 

5681
01:37:42,159 --> 01:37:44,950
philosophically interesting questions
about artificial intelligence and the

5682
01:37:44,950 --> 01:37:44,960
about artificial intelligence and the
 

5683
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:45,830
about artificial intelligence and the
nature of money

5684

nature of money
 

5685
01:37:45,840 --> 01:37:48,310
nature of money
because it's like how much can you

01:37:48,310 --> 01:37:48,320
because it's like how much can you
 

5687
01:37:48,320 --> 01:37:50,390
because it's like how much can you
extract in terms of patterns

5688
01:37:50,390 --> 01:37:50,400
extract in terms of patterns
 

5689

it's like one of the open questions in
 

5697

and machine learning
 

6093
01:44:34,960 --> 01:44:38,390
and machine learning
as i do and that's um a really nice set

6094
01:44:38,390 --> 01:44:38,400
as i do and that's um a really nice set
 

6095
01:44:38,400 --> 01:44:40,470
as i do and that's um a really nice set
of three things to know stuff about
