um there's sort of two general
categories of those

176
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:00,560
categories of those
 

177
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,229
categories of those
one are what are called the classic

178
00:03:02,229 --> 00:03:02,239
one are what are called the classic

00:03:06,309 --> 00:03:06,319
dissolving
 

183
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,990
dissolving
sort of merged into unitive states

184
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:10,000
sort of merged into unitive states
 

185
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,070
sort of merged into unitive states
those are like lsd psilocybin mescaline

186
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:14,080
those are like lsd psilocybin mescaline
 

187
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,430
those are like lsd psilocybin mescaline
ayahuasca ibogaine dmt

188
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:17,440
ayahuasca ibogaine dmt
 

189
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,750
ayahuasca ibogaine dmt
things like that and then there's mdma

190
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:19,760
things like that and then there's mdma
 

191
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,750
things like that and then there's mdma
which some people even argue is not a

192
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:21,760
which some people even argue is not a
 

193
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,710
which some people even argue is not a
psychedelic

194
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:22,720
psychedelic
 

195
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,630
psychedelic
they'll say it's an pathogen or an

196
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:24,640
they'll say it's an pathogen or an
 

197
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,630
they'll say it's an pathogen or an
intactogen it's about touching within or

198
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:26,640
intactogen it's about touching within or
 

199
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,830
intactogen it's about touching within or
empathy

200
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:27,840
empathy
 

201
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,830
empathy
it doesn't do the same kind of ego

202
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:30,840
it doesn't do the same kind of ego
 

203
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,070
it doesn't do the same kind of ego
dissolution

204
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:32,080
dissolution
 

205
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,430

that the classic psychedelics do but it

206
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:35,440
that the classic psychedelics do but it
 

207
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,710
that the classic psychedelics do but it
brings material to the surface

208
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:38,720
brings material to the surface
 

209
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,869
brings material to the surface
and and it changes the way we process

210
00:03:40,869 --> 00:03:40,879
and and it changes the way we process
 

211
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:43,990
and and it changes the way we process
information

212
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:44,000

 

213
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,430

and so i think you can quibble about

214
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:47,440
and so i think you can quibble about
 

215
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,550
and so i think you can quibble about
whether it's a

216
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:48,560
whether it's a
 

217
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,390
whether it's a
it's certainly not a classic psychedelic

218
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:50,400
it's certainly not a classic psychedelic
 

219
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,550
it's certainly not a classic psychedelic
but i think mdma is also a psychedelic

220
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:52,560
but i think mdma is also a psychedelic
 

221
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,750
but i think mdma is also a psychedelic
marijuana i would say it's a psychedelic

222
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:55,760
marijuana i would say it's a psychedelic
 

223
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,509
marijuana i would say it's a psychedelic
marijuana is closer to the classic

224
00:03:57,509 --> 00:03:57,519
marijuana is closer to the classic
 

225
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,309
marijuana is closer to the classic
psychedelics than it is to mdma

226
00:04:00,309 --> 00:04:00,319
psychedelics than it is to mdma
 

227
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:03,030
psychedelics than it is to mdma
one point i like to make is dreams

228
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:03,040
one point i like to make is dreams
 

229
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:03,750
one point i like to make is dreams
because

230
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:03,760
because
 

231
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,750
because
then everybody can relate to that dreams

232
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:05,760
then everybody can relate to that dreams
 

233
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,190
then everybody can relate to that dreams
are psychedelic dreams

234
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:07,200
are psychedelic dreams
 

235

are psychedelic dreams
bring emotions feelings um

236
00:04:10,309 --> 00:04:10,319
bring emotions feelings um
 

237
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:14,070
bring emotions feelings um
ideas concepts in symbolic form a lot of

238
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:14,080
ideas concepts in symbolic form a lot of
 

239
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,910
ideas concepts in symbolic form a lot of
times or just in raw motions to the

240
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:15,920
times or just in raw motions to the
 

241
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,189
times or just in raw motions to the
surface so

242
00:04:17,189 --> 00:04:17,199
surface so
 

243
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:19,030
surface so
when people hear the word psychedelic

244
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:19,040
when people hear the word psychedelic
 

245
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,229
when people hear the word psychedelic
often they

246
00:04:20,229 --> 00:04:20,239
often they
 

247
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:22,950
often they
are frightened by it it's about loss of

248
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:22,960
are frightened by it it's about loss of
 

249
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,189
are frightened by it it's about loss of
control

250
00:04:25,189 --> 00:04:25,199
control
 

251
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,749
control
and it is to an extent loss of conscious

252
00:04:27,749 --> 00:04:27,759
and it is to an extent loss of conscious
 

253
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,030
and it is to an extent loss of conscious
control

254
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:29,040
control
 

255
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,990
control
particularly with the classic

256
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:30,000
particularly with the classic
 

257
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,230
particularly with the classic
psychedelics but you know and we know

258
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:32,240
psychedelics but you know and we know
 

259
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,430
psychedelics but you know and we know
with dreams that

260
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:33,440
with dreams that
 

261
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,790
with dreams that
we can have frightening dreams

262
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:34,800
we can have frightening dreams
 

263
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,710
we can have frightening dreams
nightmares but i think that

264
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:36,720
nightmares but i think that
 

265
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,909
nightmares but i think that
um anchoring the the concept of

266
00:04:39,909 --> 00:04:39,919
um anchoring the the concept of
 

267
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:41,110
um anchoring the the concept of
psychedelic and dreams

268
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:41,120
psychedelic and dreams
 

269
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,790
psychedelic and dreams
is really helpful for people to know

270
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:42,800
is really helpful for people to know
 

271
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,270
is really helpful for people to know
that it's kind of a natural state

272
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:45,280
that it's kind of a natural state
 

273
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,110
that it's kind of a natural state
and that there are other ways that you

274
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:47,120
and that there are other ways that you
 

275
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,590
and that there are other ways that you
can catalyze it than by going to sleep

276
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:49,600
can catalyze it than by going to sleep
 

277
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,670
can catalyze it than by going to sleep
and that for thousands of years

278
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:51,680
and that for thousands of years
 

279
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,070
and that for thousands of years
substances have been used in that way

280
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:54,080
substances have been used in that way
 

281
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,510
substances have been used in that way
so you mentioned this idea of bringing

282
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:55,520
so you mentioned this idea of bringing
 

283
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,430
so you mentioned this idea of bringing
something to the surface which is really

284
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:57,440
something to the surface which is really
 

285
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,390
something to the surface which is really
interesting

286
00:04:58,390 --> 00:04:58,400
interesting
 

287
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,510
interesting
so can you maybe elaborate the surface

288
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:01,520
so can you maybe elaborate the surface
 

289
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,950
so can you maybe elaborate the surface
and what is

290
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:02,960
and what is
 

291
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,350
and what is
there in the depths of things and how

292
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:05,360
there in the depths of things and how
 

293
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,390
there in the depths of things and how
does

294
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:06,400
does
 

295
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,670
does
ego dissolution fits into that

296
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:09,680
ego dissolution fits into that
 

297
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,830
ego dissolution fits into that
all right well aldous huxley talked

298
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:11,840
all right well aldous huxley talked
 

299
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,790
all right well aldous huxley talked
about uh

300
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:12,800
about uh
 

301
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,430
about uh
the brain as a reducing valve that we

302
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:15,440
the brain as a reducing valve that we
 

303
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,990
the brain as a reducing valve that we
have an enormous amount of information

304
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:18,000
have an enormous amount of information
 

305
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,749
have an enormous amount of information
so right now there's an air conditioning

306
00:05:19,749 --> 00:05:19,759
so right now there's an air conditioning
 

307
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,830
so right now there's an air conditioning
sound in the background

308
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:21,840
sound in the background
 

309
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,909
sound in the background
but that's not crucial to what you and i

310
00:05:23,909 --> 00:05:23,919
but that's not crucial to what you and i
 

311
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:25,430
but that's not crucial to what you and i
are doing talking to each other so we

312
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:25,440
are doing talking to each other so we
 

313
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,950
are doing talking to each other so we
kind of tune that out

314
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:26,960
kind of tune that out
 

315
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,189
kind of tune that out
you know there's all sorts of sights and

316
00:05:29,189 --> 00:05:29,199
you know there's all sorts of sights and
 

317
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:32,150
you know there's all sorts of sights and
sounds there's incoming information

318
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:32,160
sounds there's incoming information
 

319
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,070
sounds there's incoming information
in all the different sense modalities

320
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:36,080
in all the different sense modalities
 

321
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,990
in all the different sense modalities
and we have to figure out um

322
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:40,000
and we have to figure out um
 

323
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,150
and we have to figure out um
what's important to us and so the

324
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:44,160
what's important to us and so the
 

325
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,909
what's important to us and so the
mind in a way focuses a lot on

326
00:05:47,909 --> 00:05:47,919
mind in a way focuses a lot on
 

327
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:50,950
mind in a way focuses a lot on
what are our core needs and and

328
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:50,960
what are our core needs and and
 

329
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,270
what are our core needs and and
we filter all the incoming information

330
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:53,280
we filter all the incoming information
 

331
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,189
we filter all the incoming information
that we get towards focusing on what our

332
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:55,199
that we get towards focusing on what our
 

333
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,430
that we get towards focusing on what our
court needs and we can even get to um

334
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:57,440
court needs and we can even get to um
 

335
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,670
court needs and we can even get to um

00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,630
of conscious awareness particularly once
we're adults that

508
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:02,640
we're adults that
 

509
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,990
we're adults that
are more these unit of mystical

510
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:04,000
are more these unit of mystical
 

511
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,829
are more these unit of mystical
experiences sense of connection

00:09:05,829 --> 00:09:05,839
experiences sense of connection
 

513
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:07,269
experiences sense of connection
you know i think kids are like this a

514
00:09:07,269 --> 00:09:07,279
you know i think kids are like this a
 

515
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,190
you know i think kids are like this a
lot we kind of come from the void you

516
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:09,200
lot we kind of come from the void you
 

517
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,630
lot we kind of come from the void you
could say and you're born and you you

518
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:10,640
could say and you're born and you you
 

519
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,590
could say and you're born and you you
have

520
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:11,600
have
 

521
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,829
have
um a different way of processing

522
00:09:13,829 --> 00:09:13,839
um a different way of processing
 

523
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:15,350
um a different way of processing
information what one

524
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:15,360
information what one
 

525
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,870
information what one
interesting point about that has to do

526
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:16,880
interesting point about that has to do
 

527
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,870
interesting point about that has to do
with ketamine which is

528
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:18,880
with ketamine which is
 

529
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,670
with ketamine which is
uh you know been approved s ketamine for

530
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:21,680
uh you know been approved s ketamine for
 

531
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,470
uh you know been approved s ketamine for
depression

532
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:22,480
depression
 

533
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,630
depression
but it's used for anesthesia and

534
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:26,640
but it's used for anesthesia and
 

535
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,670
but it's used for anesthesia and
roughly one-tenth the anesthetic dose

536
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:29,680
roughly one-tenth the anesthetic dose
 

537
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,790
roughly one-tenth the anesthetic dose
is a psychedelic dose and when it's used

538
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:32,800
is a psychedelic dose and when it's used
 

539
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,230
is a psychedelic dose and when it's used
in anesthesia

540
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:34,240
in anesthesia
 

541
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,750
in anesthesia
there's what's called the emergent

542
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:35,760
there's what's called the emergent
 

543
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,910
there's what's called the emergent
phenomena so this is you get

544
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:37,920
phenomena so this is you get
 

545
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,710
phenomena so this is you get
enough ketamine for um you can be

546
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:40,720
enough ketamine for um you can be
 

547
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,389
enough ketamine for um you can be
operated on you're not in pain you're

548
00:09:42,389 --> 00:09:42,399
operated on you're not in pain you're
 

549
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,630
operated on you're not in pain you're
not really there your ego's knocked out

550
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:44,640
not really there your ego's knocked out
 

551
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,949
not really there your ego's knocked out
but you can still breathe but as the

552
00:09:46,949 --> 00:09:46,959
but you can still breathe but as the
 

553
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:47,910
but you can still breathe but as the
operations

554
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:47,920
operations
 

555
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,630
operations
uh get over and then people metabolize

556
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:50,640
uh get over and then people metabolize
 

557
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,829
uh get over and then people metabolize
the ketamine

558
00:09:51,829 --> 00:09:51,839
the ketamine
 

559
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:53,350
the ketamine
there's a process that they call the

560
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:53,360
there's a process that they call the
 

561
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,269
there's a process that they call the
emergent phenomena it's like as you're

562
00:09:55,269 --> 00:09:55,279
emergent phenomena it's like as you're
 

563
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:56,710
emergent phenomena it's like as you're
emerging from this

564
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:56,720
emerging from this
 

565
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,590
emerging from this
tranquilized state and that's where you

566
00:09:59,590 --> 00:09:59,600
tranquilized state and that's where you
 

567
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,030
tranquilized state and that's where you
pass through the psychedelic phase and

568
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:01,040
pass through the psychedelic phase and
 

569
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,230
pass through the psychedelic phase and
they don't prepare people

570
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:02,240
they don't prepare people
 

571
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,350
they don't prepare people
for that and

572
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:05,360
for that and
 

573
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,030
for that and
what we see is that a lot of adults have

574
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:07,040
what we see is that a lot of adults have
 

575
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,030
what we see is that a lot of adults have
difficult times with that

576
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:09,040
difficult times with that
 

577
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,269
difficult times with that
but children don't seem to have that

578
00:10:11,269 --> 00:10:11,279
but children don't seem to have that
 

579
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:12,630
but children don't seem to have that
with those problems children are a

580
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:12,640
with those problems children are a
 

581
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,870
with those problems children are a
little bit more already in this kind of

582
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:14,880
little bit more already in this kind of
 

583
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:15,829
little bit more already in this kind of
state

584
00:10:15,829 --> 00:10:15,839
state
 

585
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,310
state
and so ketamine is is used quite

586
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:18,320
and so ketamine is is used quite
 

587
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,430
and so ketamine is is used quite
frequently in children

588
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:19,440
frequently in children
 

589
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,710
frequently in children
now for anesthesia so

590
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:22,720
now for anesthesia so
 

591
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,550
now for anesthesia so
all of that is to say to your question

592
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:24,560
all of that is to say to your question
 

593
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,310
all of that is to say to your question
that um i think it

594
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:26,320
that um i think it
 

595
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,829
that um i think it
these psychedelics reveal things that

596
00:10:27,829 --> 00:10:27,839
these psychedelics reveal things that
 

597
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,069
these psychedelics reveal things that
are within us

598
00:10:30,069 --> 00:10:30,079
are within us
 

599
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,150
are within us
some things that are how we process

600
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:32,160
some things that are how we process
 

601
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,389
some things that are how we process
information back when we are children

602
00:10:34,389 --> 00:10:34,399
information back when we are children
 

603
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,310
information back when we are children
um other things that we've never thought

604
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:36,320
um other things that we've never thought
 

605
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,750
um other things that we've never thought
of before that are sort of

606
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:37,760
of before that are sort of
 

607
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,350
of before that are sort of
baked into our consciousness um

608
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:41,360
baked into our consciousness um
 

609
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:46,069
baked into our consciousness um
you know there's one um drug 5-meo dmt

610
00:10:46,069 --> 00:10:46,079
you know there's one um drug 5-meo dmt
 

611
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,829
you know there's one um drug 5-meo dmt
it's this toxin from a sonoran toad

612
00:10:49,829 --> 00:10:49,839
it's this toxin from a sonoran toad
 

613
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:51,509
it's this toxin from a sonoran toad
that many people consider it to be the

614
00:10:51,509 --> 00:10:51,519
that many people consider it to be the
 

615
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,910
that many people consider it to be the
most powerful of all the psychedelics

616
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:53,920
most powerful of all the psychedelics
 

617
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,069
most powerful of all the psychedelics
and it kind of knocks the ego structures

618
00:10:56,069 --> 00:10:56,079
and it kind of knocks the ego structures
 

619
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:57,590
and it kind of knocks the ego structures
completely out of it

620
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:57,600
completely out of it
 

621
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,350
completely out of it
and we experience something different

622
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:01,360
and we experience something different
 

623
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,790
and we experience something different
but it's something i think that's always

624
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:02,800
but it's something i think that's always
 

625
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,949
but it's something i think that's always
within us it's at a deeper layer so we

626
00:11:04,949 --> 00:11:04,959
within us it's at a deeper layer so we
 

627
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:06,630
within us it's at a deeper layer so we
knock out some of the higher cognitive

628
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:06,640
knock out some of the higher cognitive
 

629
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,230
knock out some of the higher cognitive
functions and then we experience things

630
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:08,240
functions and then we experience things
 

631
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,110
functions and then we experience things
in a different way

632
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:09,120
in a different way
 

633
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,310
in a different way
so my sense is that these are human

634
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:12,320
so my sense is that these are human
 

635
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,150
so my sense is that these are human
experiences that the psychedelics

636
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:14,160
experiences that the psychedelics
 

637
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,069
experiences that the psychedelics
bring us to yeah it's really profound

638
00:11:16,069 --> 00:11:16,079
bring us to yeah it's really profound
 

639
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:17,910
bring us to yeah it's really profound
but and that's a dmt is a really

640
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:17,920
but and that's a dmt is a really
 

641
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,829
but and that's a dmt is a really
interesting example so

642
00:11:19,829 --> 00:11:19,839
interesting example so
 

643
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:21,670
interesting example so
uh terence mckenna has talked about

644
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:21,680
uh terence mckenna has talked about
 

645
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,430
uh terence mckenna has talked about
these machine elves

646
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:23,440
these machine elves
 

647
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,710
these machine elves
right and there's this um i think

648
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:26,720
right and there's this um i think
 

649
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,949
right and there's this um i think
from the people i've heard speak about

650
00:11:28,949 --> 00:11:28,959
from the people i've heard speak about
 

651
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:30,150
from the people i've heard speak about
the experience

652
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:30,160
the experience
 

653
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,150
the experience
there's a sense that you are traveling

654
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:32,160
there's a sense that you are traveling
 

655
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,670
there's a sense that you are traveling
elsewhere

656
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:33,680
elsewhere
 

657
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,949
elsewhere
to meet entities whether they're elves

658
00:11:36,949 --> 00:11:36,959
to meet entities whether they're elves
 

659
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:38,069
to meet entities whether they're elves
or not

660
00:11:38,069 --> 00:11:38,079
or not
 

661
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:41,350
or not
so in your sense you're not traveling

662
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:41,360
so in your sense you're not traveling
 

663
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,550
so in your sense you're not traveling
elsewhere

664
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:42,560
elsewhere
 

665
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,230
elsewhere
you're just revealing something that's

666
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:44,240
you're just revealing something that's
 

667
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,150
you're just revealing something that's
within and maybe it's a

668
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:46,160
within and maybe it's a
 

669
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,470
within and maybe it's a
a particular mechanism of revealing

670
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:48,480
a particular mechanism of revealing
 

671
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,150
a particular mechanism of revealing
what's already within

672
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:50,160
what's already within
 

673
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,069
what's already within
yeah and i knew terence i spent a lot of

674
00:11:52,069 --> 00:11:52,079
yeah and i knew terence i spent a lot of
 

675
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:53,350
yeah and i knew terence i spent a lot of
time talking with terence

676
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:53,360
time talking with terence
 

677
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,190
time talking with terence
and i do not um ascribe to a lot of

678
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:57,200
and i do not um ascribe to a lot of
 

679
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,550
and i do not um ascribe to a lot of
things that he was saying he was

680
00:11:58,550 --> 00:11:58,560
things that he was saying he was
 

681
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,150
things that he was saying he was
tremendous entertainer

682
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:00,160
tremendous entertainer
 

683
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,389
tremendous entertainer
and i think he did a lot of really good

684
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:02,399
and i think he did a lot of really good
 

685
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,470
and i think he did a lot of really good
things and focused us on

686
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:04,480
things and focused us on
 

687
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,230
things and focused us on
you know the power of psychedelics but i

688
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:06,240
you know the power of psychedelics but i
 

689
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,389
you know the power of psychedelics but i
think um i've never seen these quote

690
00:12:08,389 --> 00:12:08,399
think um i've never seen these quote
 

691
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,069
think um i've never seen these quote
machine elves

692
00:12:10,069 --> 00:12:10,079
machine elves
 

693
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:14,069
machine elves
i think culture is more determinative

694
00:12:14,069 --> 00:12:14,079
i think culture is more determinative
 

695
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:15,910
i think culture is more determinative
of what people experience under

696
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:15,920
of what people experience under
 

697
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,110
of what people experience under
psychedelics

698
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:17,120
psychedelics
 

699
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,790
psychedelics
your preconceptions than um than we give

700
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:20,800
your preconceptions than um than we give
 

701
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,990
your preconceptions than um than we give
it credit for

702
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:22,000
it credit for
 

703
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,269
it credit for
and so i think there's a lot of um

704
00:12:25,269 --> 00:12:25,279
and so i think there's a lot of um
 

705
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,430
and so i think there's a lot of um
priming that you could say that people

706
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:27,440
priming that you could say that people
 

707
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,870
priming that you could say that people
receive by

708
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:28,880
receive by
 

709
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,310
receive by
stories from their culture um

710
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:32,320
stories from their culture um
 

711
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,629
stories from their culture um
you know with ayahuasca it's about

712
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:34,639
you know with ayahuasca it's about
 

713
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:38,389
you know with ayahuasca it's about
jaguars and amazonian animals and so i i

714
00:12:38,389 --> 00:12:38,399
jaguars and amazonian animals and so i i
 

715
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,870
jaguars and amazonian animals and so i i
think these machine elves are this uh

716
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:40,880
think these machine elves are this uh
 

717
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:45,430
think these machine elves are this uh

741
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,790

one question is you know who are we are

00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:16,800
one question is you know who are we are
 

743
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,310
one question is you know who are we are
are we

744
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:18,320
are we
 

745
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,389
are we
connected to everything in the universe

746
00:13:20,389 --> 00:13:20,399
connected to everything in the universe
 

747
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,670
connected to everything in the universe
we certainly know

748
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:21,680
we certainly know
 

749
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,990
we certainly know
in many cases you talk about waves or

750
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:24,000
in many cases you talk about waves or
 

751
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,750
in many cases you talk about waves or
particles you know

752
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:25,760
particles you know
 

753
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,150
particles you know
the quantum approach so i don't

754
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:28,160
the quantum approach so i don't
 

755
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,190
the quantum approach so i don't
interpret

756
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:29,200
interpret
 

757
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,269
interpret
um experiences that we have of some

758
00:13:33,269 --> 00:13:33,279
um experiences that we have of some
 

759
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:36,389
um experiences that we have of some
entity that's you know somehow or other

760
00:13:36,389 --> 00:13:36,399
entity that's you know somehow or other
 

761
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,710
entity that's you know somehow or other
deep in our consciousness that's

762
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:38,720
deep in our consciousness that's
 

763
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,750
deep in our consciousness that's
not us it's a part of who we are so i

764
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:41,760
not us it's a part of who we are so i
 

765
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,509
not us it's a part of who we are so i
tend to interpret it in that way

766
00:13:43,509 --> 00:13:43,519
tend to interpret it in that way
 

767
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:47,030
tend to interpret it in that way
the the question is how big are we

768
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:47,040
the the question is how big are we
 

769
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,310
the the question is how big are we
yeah i mean that that's uh and how many

770
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:50,320
yeah i mean that that's uh and how many
 

771
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,710
yeah i mean that that's uh and how many
ideas are within us that can be revealed

772
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:54,720
ideas are within us that can be revealed
 

773
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,150
ideas are within us that can be revealed
by changing the perspective you

00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:56,160
by changing the perspective you
 

775
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,269
by changing the perspective you
mentioned physics one of the

00:13:59,269 --> 00:13:59,279
mentioned physics one of the
 

777
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:02,949
mentioned physics one of the

00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:04,230
what physicists mathematical physicists
or mathematicians do

00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:04,240
or mathematicians do
 

781
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:08,230
or mathematicians do
is the they reveal truths by looking at

00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:08,240
is the they reveal truths by looking at

00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,590
is the they reveal truths by looking at

00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,189
by taking a slightly different
perspective on a problem that reveals

788
00:14:13,189 --> 00:14:13,199
perspective on a problem that reveals
 

789
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:14,629
perspective on a problem that reveals
the simplicity

790
00:14:14,629 --> 00:14:14,639
the simplicity
 

791
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:17,910
the simplicity
of how it actually works in totally new

00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:17,920
of how it actually works in totally new
 

793
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:18,629

ways

794
00:14:18,629 --> 00:14:18,639
ways
 

795
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:20,150
ways
that's what einstein did that's what

796
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:20,160
that's what einstein did that's what
 

797
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,030
that's what einstein did that's what
like every progress in physics

798
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:23,040
like every progress in physics
 

799
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,310
like every progress in physics
and certainly every progress of

800
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:24,320
and certainly every progress of
 

801
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,629
and certainly every progress of
mathematics requires you to

802
00:14:26,629 --> 00:14:26,639
mathematics requires you to
 

803
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,629
mathematics requires you to
take a different perspective and then

804
00:14:28,629 --> 00:14:28,639
take a different perspective and then
 

805
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,230
take a different perspective and then
perhaps that's exactly what

806
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:30,240
perhaps that's exactly what
 

807
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,030
perhaps that's exactly what
um psychedelics are doing it's not that

808
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:33,040
um psychedelics are doing it's not that
 

809
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,629
um psychedelics are doing it's not that
they're contacting

810
00:14:34,629 --> 00:14:34,639
they're contacting
 

811
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:37,350
they're contacting
aliens that are elsewhere it may be

812
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:37,360
aliens that are elsewhere it may be
 

813
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,269
aliens that are elsewhere it may be
revealing the connection between us and

814
00:14:39,269 --> 00:14:39,279
revealing the connection between us and
 

815
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:39,590

revealing
 

821
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,949
revealing
a totally new perspective on what life

822
00:14:46,949 --> 00:14:46,959
a totally new perspective on what life
 

823

in to fully grasp and understand it so
 

833
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,590

it's just giving us an inkling of that

it's just giving us an inkling of that

00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,030
somehow
and it seems perhaps a little ridiculous

838
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:01,040
and it seems perhaps a little ridiculous
 

839
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:01,750
and it seems perhaps a little ridiculous
not

840
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:01,760
not
 

841
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,670
not
from a scientific perspective in the

842
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:03,680
from a scientific perspective in the
 

843
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,870
from a scientific perspective in the
sense that

844
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:04,880
sense that
 

845
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,710
sense that
we don't have a good physics of life or

846
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:06,720
we don't have a good physics of life or
 

847
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,550
we don't have a good physics of life or
physics of intelligence or

848
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:08,560
physics of intelligence or
 

849
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,310
physics of intelligence or
physics of consciousness but getting a

850
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:10,320
physics of consciousness but getting a
 

851
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,870
physics of consciousness but getting a
glimpse of that it's giving us a little

852
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:12,880
glimpse of that it's giving us a little
 

853
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,629
glimpse of that it's giving us a little
bit of um

854
00:15:14,629 --> 00:15:14,639
bit of um
 

855
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:17,350
bit of um
maybe an intuition of uh which way to

856
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:17,360
maybe an intuition of uh which way to
 

857
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,550
maybe an intuition of uh which way to
head

858
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:18,560
head
 

859
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:22,150
head
to uh to build such a physics

860
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:22,160
to uh to build such a physics
 

861
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,990
to uh to build such a physics
yeah yeah i think so i think that

862
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:24,000
yeah yeah i think so i think that
 

863
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,750
yeah yeah i think so i think that
there's this um

864
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:27,760
there's this um
 

865
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,670
there's this um
other concept i guess i would like to

866
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:29,680
other concept i guess i would like to
 

867
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,030
other concept i guess i would like to
talk about briefly this

868
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:31,040
talk about briefly this
 

869
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,150
talk about briefly this
jungian collective unconscious this idea

870
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:34,160
jungian collective unconscious this idea
 

871
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:34,550
jungian collective unconscious this idea
that

872
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:34,560
that
 

873
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,110
that
somehow or other everything that has

874
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:37,120
somehow or other everything that has
 

875
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,030
somehow or other everything that has
ever happened

876
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:39,040
ever happened
 

877
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,030
ever happened
is still accessible maybe not with as

878
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:41,040
is still accessible maybe not with as
 

879
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,189
is still accessible maybe not with as
much

880
00:15:43,189 --> 00:15:43,199
much
 

881
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:46,470
much
data or as much resolution

882
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:46,480
data or as much resolution
 

883
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,710
data or as much resolution
but that there's you know wave

884
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:48,720
but that there's you know wave
 

885
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,749
but that there's you know wave
resonances

886
00:15:49,749 --> 00:15:49,759
resonances
 

887
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:53,310
resonances
so that i do believe that we can have

888
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:53,320
so that i do believe that we can have
 

889
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:56,550
so that i do believe that we can have
experiences as part of this human

890
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:56,560
experiences as part of this human
 

891
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,230
experiences as part of this human
collective unconscious

892
00:15:58,230 --> 00:15:58,240
collective unconscious
 

893
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,670
collective unconscious
that we're not from our own life yeah

894
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:01,680
that we're not from our own life yeah
 

895
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,790
that we're not from our own life yeah
and that that we can it's like the

896
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:04,800
and that that we can it's like the
 

897
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,150
and that that we can it's like the
holographic realities

898
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:06,160
holographic realities
 

899
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,030
holographic realities
and that that that there is a way to

900
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:09,040
and that that that there is a way to
 

901
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:09,670
and that that that there is a way to
gather

902
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:09,680
gather
 

903
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,069
gather
information that can be accurate about

904
00:16:12,069 --> 00:16:12,079
information that can be accurate about
 

905
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:14,230
information that can be accurate about
other times and places

906
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:14,240
other times and places
 

907
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,350
other times and places
um through depth

908
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:17,360
um through depth
 

909
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,910
um through depth
investigations of our own consciousness

910
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:19,920
investigations of our own consciousness
 

911
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:20,949
investigations of our own consciousness
but i think what

912
00:16:20,949 --> 00:16:20,959
but i think what
 

913
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:23,829
but i think what
what i tend to believe is that it's

914
00:16:23,829 --> 00:16:23,839
what i tend to believe is that it's
 

915
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:25,990
what i tend to believe is that it's
because there's emotional resonances

916
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:26,000
because there's emotional resonances
 

917
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,790
because there's emotional resonances
between where we're at now in this life

918
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:28,800
between where we're at now in this life
 

919
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,470
between where we're at now in this life
and

920
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:30,480
and
 

921
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,710
and
you know other kind of um

922
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:34,720
you know other kind of um
 

923
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,189
you know other kind of um
experiences that people have had before

924
00:16:37,189 --> 00:16:37,199
experiences that people have had before
 

925
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:37,990
experiences that people have had before
and you know

926
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:38,000
and you know
 

927
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,389
and you know
we always hear about uh everybody who

928
00:16:40,389 --> 00:16:40,399
we always hear about uh everybody who
 

929
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:41,990
we always hear about uh everybody who
talks about past lives they're always

930
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:42,000
talks about past lives they're always
 

931
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,590
talks about past lives they're always
kings and queens

932
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:43,600
kings and queens
 

933
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,910
kings and queens
you know yeah so i think that's you know

934
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:45,920
you know yeah so i think that's you know
 

935
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,670
you know yeah so i think that's you know
that's again you filter things what you

936
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:47,680
that's again you filter things what you
 

937
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,710
that's again you filter things what you
want to be true

938
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:48,720
want to be true
 

939
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,030
want to be true
but but i do think that there is a way

940
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:51,040
but but i do think that there is a way
 

941
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,829
but but i do think that there is a way
to access information

942
00:16:53,829 --> 00:16:53,839
to access information
 

943
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:57,030
to access information
beyond what we've taken in in our own

944
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:57,040
beyond what we've taken in in our own
 

945
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,949
beyond what we've taken in in our own
temporal existence through our own five

946
00:16:58,949 --> 00:16:58,959
temporal existence through our own five
 

947
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:00,949
temporal existence through our own five
senses in some ways i really find that

948
00:17:00,949 --> 00:17:00,959
senses in some ways i really find that
 

949
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:02,230
senses in some ways i really find that
compelling the notion that that

950
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:02,240
compelling the notion that that
 

951
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,990
compelling the notion that that
information is already there

952
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:04,000
information is already there
 

953
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,789
information is already there
and you're simply just moving the

954
00:17:06,789 --> 00:17:06,799
and you're simply just moving the
 

955
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:07,990
and you're simply just moving the
attention of your mind

956
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:08,000
attention of your mind
 

957
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,630
attention of your mind
to different parts of that yeah i mean

958
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:10,640
to different parts of that yeah i mean
 

959
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,230
to different parts of that yeah i mean
we we have that with the radio

960
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:12,240
we we have that with the radio
 

961
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,750
we we have that with the radio
i mean you know you've got a frequency

962
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:13,760
i mean you know you've got a frequency
 

963
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:17,189
i mean you know you've got a frequency
you turn all this information

964
00:17:17,189 --> 00:17:17,199
you turn all this information
 

965
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:18,789
you turn all this information
you could actually say right now between

966
00:17:18,789 --> 00:17:18,799
you could actually say right now between
 

967
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:20,710
you could actually say right now between
the space between us we have the whole

968
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:20,720
the space between us we have the whole
 

969
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,150
the space between us we have the whole
world's knowledge that's up on the

970
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:22,160
world's knowledge that's up on the
 

971
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:22,710
world's knowledge that's up on the
internet

972
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:22,720
internet
 

973
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,350
internet
yeah it's right here yeah but we just

974
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:25,360
yeah it's right here yeah but we just
 

975
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,390
yeah it's right here yeah but we just
have to tune in

976
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:26,400
have to tune in
 

977
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,909
have to tune in
yeah what are the

978
00:17:29,909 --> 00:17:29,919
yeah what are the
 

979
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:32,230
yeah what are the
interesting differences would you say

980
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:32,240
interesting differences would you say
 

981
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,430
interesting differences would you say
between

982
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:33,440
between
 

983
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,710
between
the various psychedelics that you

984
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:34,720
the various psychedelics that you
 

985
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,029
the various psychedelics that you
mentioned ayahuasca dmt

986
00:17:37,029 --> 00:17:37,039
mentioned ayahuasca dmt
 

987
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:40,870
mentioned ayahuasca dmt

991
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:43,750
cybin mdma all
you mentioned a few of them they're

992
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:43,760
you mentioned a few of them they're
 

993
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,110
you mentioned a few of them they're
really interesting we'll we'll talk

994
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:45,120
really interesting we'll we'll talk
 

995
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,950
really interesting we'll we'll talk
about scientifically some of the

996
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:46,960
about scientifically some of the
 

997
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,950
about scientifically some of the
the different studies that have been

998
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:48,960
the different studies that have been
 

999
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,710
the different studies that have been
conducted on each but sort of at the

1000
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:50,720
conducted on each but sort of at the
 

1001
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,310
conducted on each but sort of at the
high level

1002
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:52,320
high level
 

1003
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,070
high level

is some are from nature some are from
 

1013
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,070
is some are from nature some are from
the lab right so there's this kind of

1014
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:04,080
the lab right so there's this kind of
 

1015
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,909
the lab right so there's this kind of
like romantic thought that if it's from

1016

like romantic thought that if it's from
 

1017
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,750
like romantic thought that if it's from
nature it's good if it's from the lab

1018
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:07,760
nature it's good if it's from the lab
 

1019
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,549
nature it's good if it's from the lab
it's somehow tainted by humanity

1020
00:18:10,549 --> 00:18:10,559
it's somehow tainted by humanity
 

1021
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:13,590
it's somehow tainted by humanity
and you know therefore some people are

1022
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:13,600
and you know therefore some people are
 

1023
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,470
and you know therefore some people are

1039
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:34,630
decriminalizing nature
so i i think that there is

1040
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:34,640

 

1041
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,909

from my perspective certain

1042
00:18:37,909 --> 00:18:37,919
from my perspective certain
 

1043
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:40,070
from my perspective certain
certain things from nature or poison

1044
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:40,080
certain things from nature or poison
 

1045
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,430
certain things from nature or poison
certain things from the lab are

1046
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:43,440
certain things from the lab are
 

1047
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,150
certain things from the lab are
spiritual even if they don't show up in

1048
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:46,160
spiritual even if they don't show up in
 

1049
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,669

nature like lsd

1050
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:47,679
nature like lsd
 

1051
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,909
nature like lsd
now there is something lsd is lysergic

1052
00:18:49,909 --> 00:18:49,919
now there is something lsd is lysergic
 

1053
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:51,350
now there is something lsd is lysergic
acid diethylamide

1054
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:51,360
acid diethylamide
 

1055
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,630
acid diethylamide
there is lysergic acid amide lsa

1056
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:54,640
there is lysergic acid amide lsa
 

1057
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,390
there is lysergic acid amide lsa
which comes from morning glory seeds so

1058
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:56,400
which comes from morning glory seeds so
 

1059
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,190
which comes from morning glory seeds so
it's very similar

1060
00:18:59,190 --> 00:18:59,200
it's very similar
 

1061
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,710
it's very similar
but at the same time i'd say i don't buy

1062
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:02,720
but at the same time i'd say i don't buy

and you know if it's from the lab it's

1138
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:17,440
and you know if it's from the lab it's
 

1139
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,230
and you know if it's from the lab it's
bad yeah um so that's one distinction um

1140
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:20,240
bad yeah um so that's one distinction um
 

1141

which is responsible for a lot of that

1158
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:41,520
which is responsible for a lot of that
 

1159
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:45,430
which is responsible for a lot of that

chemically it's the most similar to mdma

1164
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:50,960
chemically it's the most similar to mdma
 

1165
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,470
chemically it's the most similar to mdma
it's a phenethylamine which is mdma so

1166
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:54,480
it's a phenethylamine which is mdma so
 

1167
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,350
it's a phenethylamine which is mdma so
in the 50s there was the 53 i think it

a study in eight substances these were

1178
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:11,280
a study in eight substances these were
 

1179
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,590
a study in eight substances these were
now toxicity studies in animals

1180

chemically so

00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:21,840
chemically so
 

1189
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,830
chemically so
mescaline of the psychedelics tends to

mescaline of the psychedelics tends to
 

1191
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,110
mescaline of the psychedelics tends to
have the

1192
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:25,120
have the
 

1193
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,909
have the
warmth that mdma has it's not as

others
 

1199
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,990
others
i mean it's the main active ingredient

1200
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:32,000
i mean it's the main active ingredient
 

1201
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,149
i mean it's the main active ingredient
in peyote it is very psychedelic very

1202
00:21:34,149 --> 00:21:34,159
in peyote it is very psychedelic very
 

1203
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:36,710
in peyote it is very psychedelic very
visual

1204
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:36,720

 

1205
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,789

another distinction with these different

1206
00:21:38,789 --> 00:21:38,799
another distinction with these different
 

1207
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:41,110
another distinction with these different
drugs is how long they last

1208
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:41,120
drugs is how long they last
 

1209
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,110
drugs is how long they last
and a lot of that has to do with the

1210
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:43,120
and a lot of that has to do with the
 

1211
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,029
and a lot of that has to do with the
route of administration

1212
00:21:45,029 --> 00:21:45,039
route of administration
 

1213
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:49,029
route of administration
so for example if you smoke dmt

1214
00:21:49,029 --> 00:21:49,039
so for example if you smoke dmt
 

1215
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:52,149
so for example if you smoke dmt
it takes 10-15 minutes and you're

1216
00:21:52,149 --> 00:21:52,159
it takes 10-15 minutes and you're
 

1217
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:53,669
it takes 10-15 minutes and you're
within seconds you're off in another

1218
00:21:53,669 --> 00:21:53,679
within seconds you're off in another
 

1219
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:59,510
within seconds you're off in another
world um similarly 5-meo dmt very rapid

1220
00:21:59,510 --> 00:21:59,520
world um similarly 5-meo dmt very rapid
 

1221
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,149
world um similarly 5-meo dmt very rapid
when you take dmt in the form of

1222
00:22:02,149 --> 00:22:02,159
when you take dmt in the form of
 

1223
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:03,110
when you take dmt in the form of
ayahuasca

1224
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:03,120
ayahuasca
 

1225
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,669
ayahuasca
where it's mixed with another substance

1226
00:22:05,669 --> 00:22:05,679
where it's mixed with another substance
 

1227
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:06,470
where it's mixed with another substance
that

1228
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:06,480
that
 

1229
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,549
that
makes it so that it's orally active then

1230
00:22:08,549 --> 00:22:08,559
makes it so that it's orally active then
 

1231
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:11,270
makes it so that it's orally active then
it's a couple hours

1232
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:11,280
it's a couple hours
 

1233
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,710
it's a couple hours
so lsd is uh 8 10

1234
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:14,720
so lsd is uh 8 10
 

1235
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,510
so lsd is uh 8 10
12 hours sometimes psilocybin is more

1236
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:17,520
12 hours sometimes psilocybin is more
 

1237
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,470
12 hours sometimes psilocybin is more
like five or six

1238
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:18,480
like five or six
 

1239
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,909
like five or six
hours or four to six hours mdma is

1240
00:22:21,909 --> 00:22:21,919
hours or four to six hours mdma is
 

1241
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:23,669
hours or four to six hours mdma is
similar

1242
00:22:23,669 --> 00:22:23,679
similar
 

1243
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:26,070
similar
it's one reason why in our research we

1244
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:26,080
it's one reason why in our research we
 

1245
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,230
it's one reason why in our research we
give an initial dose of mdma and then

1246
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:28,240
give an initial dose of mdma and then
 

1247
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,070
give an initial dose of mdma and then
two hours later we give half the initial

1248
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:30,080
two hours later we give half the initial
 

1249
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,029
two hours later we give half the initial
amount

1250
00:22:31,029 --> 00:22:31,039
amount
 

1251
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:33,190
amount
to extend the plateau because we want it

00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,710
to extend the plateau because we want it
to last longer

so i think that there are a lot of ways
to look at these different substances

1322
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:44,960
them
 

1323
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,190
them
are being researched right now in

1324
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:47,200
are being researched right now in
 

1325
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,990
are being researched right now in
scientific context and which are not

1326
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:50,000
scientific context and which are not
 

1327
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,510
scientific context and which are not
and because of the rise of all these

1328
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:51,520
and because of the rise of all these
 

1329
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,269
and because of the rise of all these
for-profit companies and everybody's

1330
00:23:53,269 --> 00:23:53,279
for-profit companies and everybody's
 

1331
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:54,870
for-profit companies and everybody's
looking for what they can patent what

1332
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:54,880
looking for what they can patent what
 

1333
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,110
looking for what they can patent what
they can claim the land grab

1334
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:57,120
they can claim the land grab
 

1335
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,630
they can claim the land grab
you know more and more there are

1336
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:00,640
you know more and more there are
 

1337
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,909
you know more and more there are
companies looking at every different

1338
00:24:01,909 --> 00:24:01,919
companies looking at every different
 

1339
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:04,310
companies looking at every different
kind of psychedelics

1340
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:04,320
kind of psychedelics
 

1341
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,390
kind of psychedelics
the ones that are most important that

1342
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:06,400
the ones that are most important that
 

1343
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,310
the ones that are most important that
are not being researched

1344
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:08,320
are not being researched
 

1345
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,990
are not being researched
mescaline but now there's a company to

1346
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:10,000
mescaline but now there's a company to
 

1347
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,029
mescaline but now there's a company to
do masculine a journey collab

1348
00:24:13,029 --> 00:24:13,039
do masculine a journey collab
 

1349
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:15,830
do masculine a journey collab
ibogaine which is crucial for opiate

1350
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:15,840
ibogaine which is crucial for opiate
 

1351
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,029
ibogaine which is crucial for opiate
addiction

1352
00:24:17,029 --> 00:24:17,039
addiction
 

1353
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:20,310
addiction
there's a new company a

1354
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:20,320
there's a new company a
 

1355
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,909
there's a new company a
branch of this company a thai that's

1356
00:24:21,909 --> 00:24:21,919
branch of this company a thai that's
 

1357
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:23,590
branch of this company a thai that's
going to be looking at ibogaine

1358
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:23,600
going to be looking at ibogaine
 

1359
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,950
going to be looking at ibogaine
so i'd say the rise of the for-profit

1360
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:26,960
so i'd say the rise of the for-profit
 

1361
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,269
so i'd say the rise of the for-profit
companies is making it so that

1362
00:24:29,269 --> 00:24:29,279
companies is making it so that
 

1363
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:30,789
companies is making it so that
there's just going to be an enormous

1364
00:24:30,789 --> 00:24:30,799
there's just going to be an enormous
 

1365
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:32,470
there's just going to be an enormous
amount of investigations

1366
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:32,480
amount of investigations
 

1367
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,990
amount of investigations
into all these different psychedelics

1368
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:36,000
into all these different psychedelics
 

1369
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,789
into all these different psychedelics
but what we're going to see is the

1370
00:24:38,789 --> 00:24:38,799
but what we're going to see is the
 

1371
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:40,789
but what we're going to see is the
development of new psychedelics that we

1372
00:24:40,789 --> 00:24:40,799
development of new psychedelics that we
 

1373
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:42,070
development of new psychedelics that we
don't know anything about that have not

1374
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:42,080
don't know anything about that have not
 

1375
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,190
don't know anything about that have not
existed yet because

1376
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:43,200
existed yet because
 

1377
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,430
existed yet because
a lot of these for-profit companies are

1378
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:45,440
a lot of these for-profit companies are
 

1379
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,710
a lot of these for-profit companies are
going to want to

1380
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:46,720
going to want to
 

1381
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,190
going to want to
invent and patent and have composition

1382
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:49,200
invent and patent and have composition
 

1383
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,669
invent and patent and have composition
of matter patents on new molecules

1384
00:24:51,669 --> 00:24:51,679
of matter patents on new molecules
 

1385
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:53,029
of matter patents on new molecules
so i think we'll see a lot of that

1386
00:24:53,029 --> 00:24:53,039
so i think we'll see a lot of that
 

1387
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:55,190
so i think we'll see a lot of that
happening too that's really fast i mean

1388
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:55,200
happening too that's really fast i mean
 

1389
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,430
happening too that's really fast i mean
there's a lot of doors you've opened and

1390
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:57,440
there's a lot of doors you've opened and
 

1391
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,789
there's a lot of doors you've opened and
we're going to walk through all of them

1392
00:24:58,789 --> 00:24:58,799
we're going to walk through all of them
 

1393
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:02,070
we're going to walk through all of them
including the research and so on but

1394
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:02,080
including the research and so on but
 

1395
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,269
including the research and so on but
on this one little tangent of um the

1396
00:25:05,269 --> 00:25:05,279
on this one little tangent of um the
 

1397
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:07,190
on this one little tangent of um the
future of psychedelics so engineering

1398
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:07,200
future of psychedelics so engineering
 

1399
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,549
future of psychedelics so engineering
new psychedelics

1400
00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:08,559
new psychedelics
 

1401
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:11,510
new psychedelics
can you comment on maybe the the

1402
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:11,520
can you comment on maybe the the
 

1403
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,110
can you comment on maybe the the
chemistry and the biology of how

1404
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:13,120
chemistry and the biology of how
 

1405
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,190
chemistry and the biology of how
psychedelics work and where is the space

1406
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:15,200
psychedelics work and where is the space
 

1407
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,789
psychedelics work and where is the space
of possible

1408
00:25:16,789 --> 00:25:16,799
of possible
 

1409
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:18,390
of possible
engineering of psychedelics and what

1410
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:18,400
engineering of psychedelics and what
 

1411
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,669
engineering of psychedelics and what
kind of things might they unlock

1412
00:25:21,669 --> 00:25:21,679
kind of things might they unlock
 

1413
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:25,190
kind of things might they unlock
in terms of the possible places our mind

1414
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:25,200
in terms of the possible places our mind
 

1415
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,470
in terms of the possible places our mind
would be able to go and the

1416
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:28,480
would be able to go and the
 

1417
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:32,390
would be able to go and the
the effects of that of improving health

1418
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:32,400
the effects of that of improving health
 

1419
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,470
the effects of that of improving health
but maybe at the basic level of

1420
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:34,480
but maybe at the basic level of
 

1421
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,669
but maybe at the basic level of
chemistry

1422
00:25:35,669 --> 00:25:35,679
chemistry
 

1423
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:36,950
chemistry
and the space of what could be

1424
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:36,960
and the space of what could be
 

1425
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,870
and the space of what could be
engineered

1426
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:38,880
engineered
 

1427
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,430
engineered
well you you reminded me it's not i'll

1428
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:41,440
well you you reminded me it's not i'll
 

1429
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,710
well you you reminded me it's not i'll
get to exactly what you said but you

1430
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:42,720
get to exactly what you said but you
 

1431
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,830
get to exactly what you said but you
reminded me of

1432
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:43,840
reminded me of
 

1433
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:47,430
reminded me of
a talk i heard by buck mr fuller

1434
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:47,440
a talk i heard by buck mr fuller
 

1435
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,830
a talk i heard by buck mr fuller
shortly before he died and what he

1436
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:49,840
shortly before he died and what he
 

1437
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:50,789
shortly before he died and what he
talked about

1438
00:25:50,789 --> 00:25:50,799
talked about
 

1439
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:55,269
talked about
is how technology was making things

1440
00:25:55,269 --> 00:25:55,279
is how technology was making things
 

1441
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:58,230
is how technology was making things
ever smaller you know that we are able

1442
00:25:58,230 --> 00:25:58,240
ever smaller you know that we are able
 

1443
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,990
ever smaller you know that we are able
to pack more and more information into

1444
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:00,000
to pack more and more information into
 

1445
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,310
to pack more and more information into
smaller and smaller spaces

1446
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:02,320
smaller and smaller spaces
 

1447
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,470
smaller and smaller spaces
and that we're developing technologies

1448
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:04,480
and that we're developing technologies
 

1449
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,789
and that we're developing technologies
of communications with people you know

1450
00:26:06,789 --> 00:26:06,799
of communications with people you know
 

1451
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:07,190
of communications with people you know
we now

1452
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:07,200
we now
 

1453
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,630
we now
know the internet and things like that

1454
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:08,640
know the internet and things like that
 

1455
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,430
know the internet and things like that
but what he said is that he thought the

1456
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:11,440
but what he said is that he thought the
 

1457
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:15,350
but what he said is that he thought the
eventual uh evolution of this sort of

1458
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:15,360
eventual uh evolution of this sort of
 

1459
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,710
eventual uh evolution of this sort of
research would move from this

1460
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:17,720
research would move from this
 

1461
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:21,750
research would move from this
miniaturization to telepathy

1462
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:21,760
miniaturization to telepathy
 

1463
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,549
miniaturization to telepathy
yeah and so it's like a shocking thing

1464
00:26:24,549 --> 00:26:24,559
yeah and so it's like a shocking thing
 

1465
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:25,990
yeah and so it's like a shocking thing
for somebody like scientific like that

1466
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:26,000
for somebody like scientific like that
 

1467
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,350
for somebody like scientific like that
to say that yeah

1468
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:27,360
to say that yeah
 

1469
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:31,269
to say that yeah
um so will we unlock those parts

1470
00:26:31,269 --> 00:26:31,279
um so will we unlock those parts
 

1471
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:32,549
um so will we unlock those parts
where i talked about the collective

1472
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:32,559
where i talked about the collective
 

1473
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:35,590
where i talked about the collective
unconscious will we be able to

1474
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:35,600
unconscious will we be able to
 

1475
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:39,190
unconscious will we be able to
more consciously explore those areas

1476
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:39,200
more consciously explore those areas
 

1477
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,990
more consciously explore those areas
so i think that that's a possibility

1478
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:42,000
so i think that that's a possibility
 

1479
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,110
so i think that that's a possibility
there was

1480
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:43,120
there was
 

1481
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,990
there was

at the same time we will move to uh

1566
00:28:12,149 --> 00:28:12,159
at the same time we will move to uh
 

1567
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:15,350

the new approaches to oncology
where you know you you do um genetic

1572
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:21,360
where you know you you do um genetic
 

1573
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,190
where you know you you do um genetic
analysis of different kind of tumors and

1574
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:23,200
analysis of different kind of tumors and
 

1575
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,789
analysis of different kind of tumors and
then you have certain kind of

1576
00:28:24,789 --> 00:28:24,799
then you have certain kind of
 

1577
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:26,470
then you have certain kind of
chemotherapy agents and you do like

1578
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:26,480
chemotherapy agents and you do like
 

1579
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,310
chemotherapy agents and you do like
personalized chemotherapy i think we

1580
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:28,320
personalized chemotherapy i think we
 

1581
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,350
personalized chemotherapy i think we
will have

1582
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:29,360
will have
 

1583
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,950

more like personalized psychedelic
 

1585
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,350
more like personalized psychedelic
therapy but it'll be more like a

1586
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:33,360
therapy but it'll be more like a
 

1587
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,029
therapy but it'll be more like a
sequence of different drugs that people

1588

go through over an extended period of
 

1591
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,590
go through over an extended period of
time and then you kind of customize

1592
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:39,600
time and then you kind of customize
 

1593
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,269
time and then you kind of customize
what's next and sometimes you'll combine

1594
00:28:41,269 --> 00:28:41,279
what's next and sometimes you'll combine
 

1595
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:43,510
what's next and sometimes you'll combine
different drugs together like this

00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:34,549
what's really
important to us and both

1644
00:29:34,549 --> 00:29:34,559
important to us and both
 

1645
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:37,350
important to us and both
um focusing us on things and also

1646
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:37,360
um focusing us on things and also
 

1647
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:40,389
um focusing us on things and also
helping us to ignore a lot of things

1648
00:29:40,389 --> 00:29:40,399
helping us to ignore a lot of things
 

1649
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:43,190
helping us to ignore a lot of things
and the classic psychedelics all weaken

1650
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:43,200
and the classic psychedelics all weaken
 

1651
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,830
and the classic psychedelics all weaken
the energy in this default mode system

1652
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:45,840
the energy in this default mode system
 

1653
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,350
the energy in this default mode system
and therefore you get this flood of

1654
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:47,360
and therefore you get this flood of
 

1655
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,789
and therefore you get this flood of
information that you're not normally

1656
00:29:48,789 --> 00:29:48,799
information that you're not normally
 

1657
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:49,830
information that you're not normally
paying attention to

1658
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:49,840
paying attention to
 

1659
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,990
paying attention to
and then you start seeing in more

1660
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:52,000
and then you start seeing in more
 

1661
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,549
and then you start seeing in more
creative ways or more connected

1662
00:29:54,549 --> 00:29:54,559
creative ways or more connected
 

1663
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:57,269
creative ways or more connected
you actually move to beyond the verbal

1664
00:29:57,269 --> 00:29:57,279
you actually move to beyond the verbal
 

1665
00:29:57,279 --> 00:29:59,190
you actually move to beyond the verbal
kind of thinking into sort of

1666
00:29:59,190 --> 00:29:59,200
kind of thinking into sort of
 

1667
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,470
kind of thinking into sort of
symbolic thinking a lot of times um

1668
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:02,480
symbolic thinking a lot of times um
 

1669
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,070
symbolic thinking a lot of times um
and that's where you sometimes get these

1670
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:04,080
and that's where you sometimes get these
 

1671
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,990
and that's where you sometimes get these
uh mystical sense of connection how it's

1672
00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:06,000
uh mystical sense of connection how it's
 

1673
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:06,950
uh mystical sense of connection how it's
all one and

1674
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:06,960
all one and
 

1675
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:11,190
all one and
you get the sense also of

1676
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:11,200
you get the sense also of
 

1677
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,110
you get the sense also of
how big the universe is and how small

1678
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:13,120
how big the universe is and how small
 

1679
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,510
how big the universe is and how small
each one of us is

1680
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:15,520
each one of us is
 

1681
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,990
each one of us is
so there's a lot of work that sasha

1682
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:18,000
so there's a lot of work that sasha
 

1683
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,590
so there's a lot of work that sasha
shulkin and albert hoffman

1684
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:19,600
shulkin and albert hoffman
 

1685
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,750
shulkin and albert hoffman
who invented lsd and first synthesize

1686
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:21,760
who invented lsd and first synthesize
 

1687
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,110
who invented lsd and first synthesize
psilocybin and what they call structure

1688
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:23,120
psilocybin and what they call structure
 

1689
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,870
psilocybin and what they call structure
activity relationships

1690
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:24,880
activity relationships
 

1691
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,669
activity relationships
what is the structural molecule and then

1692
00:30:27,669 --> 00:30:27,679
what is the structural molecule and then
 

1693
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:29,510
what is the structural molecule and then
how do you predict

1694
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:29,520
how do you predict
 

1695
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,350
how do you predict
what that new molecule that never

1696
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:31,360
what that new molecule that never
 

1697
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,190
what that new molecule that never
existed before is going to do

1698
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:33,200
existed before is going to do
 

1699
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,950
existed before is going to do
once you actually take it and

1700
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:36,960
once you actually take it and
 

1701
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:40,230
once you actually take it and
you can get close but you never really

1702
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:40,240
you can get close but you never really
 

1703
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:40,630
you can get close but you never really
know

1704
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:40,640
know
 

1705
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,430
know
until you actually take the drug and the

1706
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:43,440
until you actually take the drug and the
 

1707
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,870
until you actually take the drug and the
way that

1708
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:44,880
way that
 

1709
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,990
way that
sasha ran his experiments is that he

1710
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:48,000
sasha ran his experiments is that he
 

1711
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,950
sasha ran his experiments is that he
would take the drugs himself first

1712
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:50,960
would take the drugs himself first
 

1713
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,870
would take the drugs himself first
in low doses and he would sort of you

1714
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:52,880
in low doses and he would sort of you
 

1715
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:55,269
in low doses and he would sort of you
know step up the doses to have more

1716
00:30:55,269 --> 00:30:55,279
know step up the doses to have more
 

1717
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:56,549
know step up the doses to have more
experiences if he thought it was

1718
00:30:56,549 --> 00:30:56,559
experiences if he thought it was
 

1719
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:57,830
experiences if he thought it was
valuable he'd share it with his wife

1720
00:30:57,830 --> 00:30:57,840
valuable he'd share it with his wife
 

1721
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,669
valuable he'd share it with his wife
anne

1722
00:30:59,669 --> 00:30:59,679
anne
 

1723
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:01,509
anne
but then what they would do is if they

1724
00:31:01,509 --> 00:31:01,519
but then what they would do is if they
 

1725
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:03,430
but then what they would do is if they
both thought it was valuable they had a

1726
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:03,440
both thought it was valuable they had a
 

1727
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,509
both thought it was valuable they had a
group of 12 people that they were with

1728
00:31:05,509 --> 00:31:05,519
group of 12 people that they were with
 

1729
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:07,269
group of 12 people that they were with
for many many years

1730
00:31:07,269 --> 00:31:07,279
for many many years
 

1731
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:09,029
for many many years
and they would distribute these new drug

1732
00:31:09,029 --> 00:31:09,039
and they would distribute these new drug
 

1733
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:10,710
and they would distribute these new drug
to these 12 people

1734
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:10,720
to these 12 people
 

1735
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,750
to these 12 people
and they would get the different

1736
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:11,760
and they would get the different
 

1737
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,470
and they would get the different
perspectives and he felt that 12 was

1738
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:14,480
perspectives and he felt that 12 was
 

1739
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,149
perspectives and he felt that 12 was
like a minimum number you know because

1740
00:31:16,149 --> 00:31:16,159
like a minimum number you know because
 

1741
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:17,669
like a minimum number you know because
we're so unique how each of us see

1742
00:31:17,669 --> 00:31:17,679
we're so unique how each of us see
 

1743
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:19,909
we're so unique how each of us see
things but then you kind of get a little

1744
00:31:19,909 --> 00:31:19,919
things but then you kind of get a little
 

1745
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:21,590
things but then you kind of get a little
bit of a consensus on how a lot of

1746
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:21,600
bit of a consensus on how a lot of
 

1747
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,870
bit of a consensus on how a lot of
people are going to see it and then if

1748
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:22,880
people are going to see it and then if
 

1749
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,909
people are going to see it and then if
that

1750
00:31:23,909 --> 00:31:23,919
that
 

1751
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:25,590
that
12 people were positive about it then

1752
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:25,600
12 people were positive about it then
 

1753
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,269
12 people were positive about it then
they would turn it over to leo zeff

1754
00:31:27,269 --> 00:31:27,279
they would turn it over to leo zeff
 

1755
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:29,269
they would turn it over to leo zeff
who he called the secret chief the

1756
00:31:29,269 --> 00:31:29,279
who he called the secret chief the
 

1757
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:30,470
who he called the secret chief the
leader of the underground psychedelic

1758
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:30,480
leader of the underground psychedelic
 

1759
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,990
leader of the underground psychedelic
therapy movement and then he would start

1760
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:32,000
therapy movement and then he would start
 

1761
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,430
therapy movement and then he would start
exploring it in therapy so

1762
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:35,440
exploring it in therapy so
 

1763
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:38,389
exploring it in therapy so
there's um still a lot of mysteries as

1764
00:31:38,389 --> 00:31:38,399
there's um still a lot of mysteries as
 

1765
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:40,470
there's um still a lot of mysteries as
far as structure activity relationships

1766
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:40,480
far as structure activity relationships
 

1767
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:40,950
far as structure activity relationships
and

1768
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:40,960
and
 

1769
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,310
and
it's not going to be the case that

1770
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:42,320
it's not going to be the case that
 

1771
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,990
it's not going to be the case that
people go into the lab and

1772
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:44,000
people go into the lab and
 

1773
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,750
people go into the lab and
they tinker with molecules and they know

1774
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:45,760
they tinker with molecules and they know
 

1775
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:48,710
they tinker with molecules and they know
exactly what they're going to get

1776
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:48,720
exactly what they're going to get
 

1777
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,750
exactly what they're going to get
and a lot of it has to do with the not

1778
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:51,760
and a lot of it has to do with the not
 

1779
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,269
and a lot of it has to do with the not
so much

1780
00:31:53,269 --> 00:31:53,279
so much
 

1781
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:55,110
so much
chemistry as morphology you could say

1782
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:55,120
chemistry as morphology you could say
 

1783
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,029
chemistry as morphology you could say
the shape of the molecule and how does

1784
00:31:57,029 --> 00:31:57,039
the shape of the molecule and how does
 

1785
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:57,350
the shape of the molecule and how does
that

1786
00:31:57,350 --> 00:31:57,360
that
 

1787
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,669
that
interact with receptor sites and so

1788
00:31:59,669 --> 00:31:59,679
interact with receptor sites and so
 

1789
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:00,789
interact with receptor sites and so
we're getting better at

1790
00:32:00,789 --> 00:32:00,799
we're getting better at
 

1791
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:03,909
we're getting better at
modeling all of that and how does that

1792
00:32:03,909 --> 00:32:03,919
modeling all of that and how does that
 

1793
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:05,909
modeling all of that and how does that
interaction relate to the

1794
00:32:05,909 --> 00:32:05,919
interaction relate to the
 

1795
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:08,149
interaction relate to the
the the morphing of the human experience

1796
00:32:08,149 --> 00:32:08,159
the the morphing of the human experience
 

1797
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:10,470
the the morphing of the human experience
and deeply understanding that

1798
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:10,480
and deeply understanding that
 

1799
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,389
and deeply understanding that
perhaps there's no equations yet for

1800
00:32:12,389 --> 00:32:12,399
perhaps there's no equations yet for
 

1801
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:14,310
perhaps there's no equations yet for
that kind of thing you really have to

1802
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:14,320
that kind of thing you really have to
 

1803
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:17,110
that kind of thing you really have to
build up intuition by experiencing it

1804
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:17,120
build up intuition by experiencing it
 

1805
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,870
build up intuition by experiencing it
and over time and

1806
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:18,880
and over time and
 

1807
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,789
and over time and
sort of subjective self-report like

1808
00:32:20,789 --> 00:32:20,799
sort of subjective self-report like
 

1809
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:22,149
sort of subjective self-report like
trying to build

1810
00:32:22,149 --> 00:32:22,159
trying to build
 

1811
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:23,669
trying to build
an understanding of the effects of the

1812
00:32:23,669 --> 00:32:23,679
an understanding of the effects of the
 

1813
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:25,990
an understanding of the effects of the
different chemistries yeah yeah you can

1814
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:26,000
different chemistries yeah yeah you can
 

1815
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,310
different chemistries yeah yeah you can
you can have approximate ideas but to

1816
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:28,320
you can have approximate ideas but to
 

1817
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,389
you can have approximate ideas but to
know exactly so

1818
00:32:30,389 --> 00:32:30,399
know exactly so
 

1819
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:32,710
know exactly so
you know when i first tried mdma which

1820
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:32,720
you know when i first tried mdma which
 

1821
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,990
you know when i first tried mdma which
was 1982

1822
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:34,000
was 1982
 

1823
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,870
was 1982
and this was after i had done lots of

1824
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:36,880
and this was after i had done lots of
 

1825
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,350
and this was after i had done lots of
lsd and masculine

1826
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:39,360
lsd and masculine
 

1827
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:43,269
lsd and masculine
and mushrooms um i was shocked at how

1828
00:32:43,269 --> 00:32:43,279
and mushrooms um i was shocked at how
 

1829
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:45,669
and mushrooms um i was shocked at how
different it was than these other

1830
00:32:45,669 --> 00:32:45,679
different it was than these other
 

1831
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:46,549
different it was than these other
substances

1832
00:32:46,549 --> 00:32:46,559
substances
 

1833
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:50,070
substances
and yet how profound it was so are there

1834
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:50,080
and yet how profound it was so are there
 

1835
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,789
and yet how profound it was so are there
whole new kind of categories of classes

1836
00:32:52,789 --> 00:32:52,799
whole new kind of categories of classes
 

1837
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:54,710
whole new kind of categories of classes
of drugs that we're not aware of that

1838
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:54,720
of drugs that we're not aware of that
 

1839
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,470
of drugs that we're not aware of that
would be

1840
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:56,480
would be
 

1841
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:01,029
would be
not so much this like eco-dissolution or

1842
00:33:01,029 --> 00:33:01,039
not so much this like eco-dissolution or
 

1843
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:03,830
not so much this like eco-dissolution or
emotional well what mdma does is uh

1844
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:03,840
emotional well what mdma does is uh
 

1845
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,750
emotional well what mdma does is uh
reduces activity in the amygdala

1846
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:05,760
reduces activity in the amygdala
 

1847
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,310
reduces activity in the amygdala
the fear processing part of the brain so

1848
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:08,320
the fear processing part of the brain so
 

1849
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,990
the fear processing part of the brain so
it's not just chemistry but it

1850
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:10,000
it's not just chemistry but it
 

1851
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,909
it's not just chemistry but it
it routes energy throughout the brain in

1852
00:33:11,909 --> 00:33:11,919
it routes energy throughout the brain in
 

1853
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:13,990
it routes energy throughout the brain in
a different way it increases activity in

1854
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:14,000
a different way it increases activity in
 

1855
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,750
a different way it increases activity in
the prefrontal cortex

1856
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:15,760
the prefrontal cortex
 

1857
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,669
the prefrontal cortex
so you think more logically though that

1858
00:33:17,669 --> 00:33:17,679
so you think more logically though that
 

1859
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:19,509
so you think more logically though that
i think has an enormous

1860
00:33:19,509 --> 00:33:19,519
i think has an enormous
 

1861
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:22,870
i think has an enormous
impact on the effect of mdma the other

1862
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:22,880
impact on the effect of mdma the other
 

1863
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:23,509
impact on the effect of mdma the other
thing it does

1864
00:33:23,509 --> 00:33:23,519
thing it does
 

1865
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:25,509
thing it does
is it increases connectivity between the

1866
00:33:25,509 --> 00:33:25,519
is it increases connectivity between the
 

1867
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:27,430
is it increases connectivity between the
amygdala and the hippocampus so it helps

1868
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:27,440
amygdala and the hippocampus so it helps
 

1869
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,789
amygdala and the hippocampus so it helps
facilitate

1870
00:33:28,789 --> 00:33:28,799
facilitate
 

1871
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:30,870
facilitate
um processing of things into long-term

1872
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:30,880
um processing of things into long-term
 

1873
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,149
um processing of things into long-term
memory

1874
00:33:32,149 --> 00:33:32,159
memory
 

1875
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:34,870
memory
um and with ptsd trauma is like never in

1876
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:34,880
um and with ptsd trauma is like never in
 

1877
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,590
um and with ptsd trauma is like never in
the past it's always about to happen so

1878
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:37,600
the past it's always about to happen so
 

1879
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,590
the past it's always about to happen so
will we one time develop drugs that

1880
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:39,600
will we one time develop drugs that
 

1881
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,830
will we one time develop drugs that
would even be specific to

1882
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:41,840
would even be specific to
 

1883
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,149
would even be specific to
certain kind of memories we're working

1884
00:33:44,149 --> 00:33:44,159
certain kind of memories we're working
 

1885
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:46,310
certain kind of memories we're working
with a woman rachel yehuda

1886
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:46,320
with a woman rachel yehuda
 

1887
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:50,070
with a woman rachel yehuda
who is at the bronx va

1888
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:50,080
who is at the bronx va
 

1889
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:53,269
who is at the bronx va
and she's done some studies that are

1890
00:33:53,269 --> 00:33:53,279
and she's done some studies that are
 

1891
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:55,669
and she's done some studies that are
with the epigenetics of trauma so she's

1892
00:33:55,669 --> 00:33:55,679
with the epigenetics of trauma so she's
 

1893
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:57,190
with the epigenetics of trauma so she's
worked with holocaust survivors and

1894
00:33:57,190 --> 00:33:57,200
worked with holocaust survivors and
 

1895
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,710
worked with holocaust survivors and
their children

1896
00:33:58,710 --> 00:33:58,720
their children
 

1897
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:02,070
their children
and she has identified um

1898
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:02,080
and she has identified um
 

1899
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,630
and she has identified um
epigenetic mechanisms by which trauma is

1900
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:04,640
epigenetic mechanisms by which trauma is
 

1901
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,070
epigenetic mechanisms by which trauma is
passed from generation to the

1902
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:06,080
passed from generation to the
 

1903
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,350
passed from generation to the

1904
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:07,360
generations
 

1905
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:10,470
generations
sort of like set points for anxiety fear

1906
00:34:10,470 --> 00:34:10,480
sort of like set points for anxiety fear
 

1907
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:10,950
sort of like set points for anxiety fear
certain

1908
00:34:10,950 --> 00:34:10,960
certain
 

1909
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,990
certain
things like that but the question is can

1910
00:34:13,990 --> 00:34:14,000
things like that but the question is can
 

1911
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,990
things like that but the question is can
you actually transmit memories

1912
00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:16,000
you actually transmit memories
 

1913
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,270
you actually transmit memories
from one generation to the next now

1914
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:19,280
from one generation to the next now
 

1915
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:23,750
from one generation to the next now
this is not um dna

1916
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:23,760

 

1917
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,510

changes which happen over a very long

1918
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:25,520
changes which happen over a very long
 

1919
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,950
changes which happen over a very long

some experiences your epigenetics what

1926
00:34:33,109 --> 00:34:33,119
some experiences your epigenetics what
 

1927
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:34,950
some experiences your epigenetics what
turns on the genes or turns off certain

1928
00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:34,960
turns on the genes or turns off certain
 

1929
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:35,829
turns on the genes or turns off certain
genes that can

1930
00:34:35,829 --> 00:34:35,839
genes that can
 

1931
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:38,470
genes that can
be impacted and that's what we know now

1932
00:34:38,470 --> 00:34:38,480
be impacted and that's what we know now
 

1933
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,310
be impacted and that's what we know now
can be transmitted from generation to

1934
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:40,320
can be transmitted from generation to
 

1935
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,829
can be transmitted from generation to

either by the father or the mother
 

1939
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,750
either by the father or the mother

through the sperm or the egg
 

1941
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,869
through the sperm or the egg
so it's it's pretty um remarkable so

1942
00:34:48,869 --> 00:34:48,879
so it's it's pretty um remarkable so
 

1943
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:49,990
so it's it's pretty um remarkable so
what what rachel's going to

1944
00:34:49,990 --> 00:34:50,000
what what rachel's going to
 

1945
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,349
what what rachel's going to
try to do is mdma research for ptsd

1946
00:34:53,349 --> 00:34:53,359
try to do is mdma research for ptsd
 

1947
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:55,589
try to do is mdma research for ptsd
and look at these epigenetic markers

1948
00:34:55,589 --> 00:34:55,599
and look at these epigenetic markers
 

1949
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:57,670
and look at these epigenetic markers
before and after and see if they change

1950
00:34:57,670 --> 00:34:57,680
before and after and see if they change
 

1951
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:01,030
before and after and see if they change
as a consequence of therapy so

1952
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:01,040
as a consequence of therapy so
 

1953
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:04,630
as a consequence of therapy so
will we develop one day certain kind of

1954
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:04,640
will we develop one day certain kind of
 

1955
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,030
will we develop one day certain kind of
chemicals that will be able to bring

1956
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:07,040
chemicals that will be able to bring
 

1957
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,589
chemicals that will be able to bring
certain kind of memories to the surface

1958
00:35:09,589 --> 00:35:09,599
certain kind of memories to the surface
 

1959
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:12,790
certain kind of memories to the surface
um that's not inconceivable the

1960
00:35:12,790 --> 00:35:12,800
um that's not inconceivable the
 

1961
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,750
um that's not inconceivable the
epigenetic

1962
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:13,760
epigenetic
 

1963
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,430
epigenetic
angle is fascinating that there will be

1964
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:15,440
angle is fascinating that there will be
 

1965
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:18,069
angle is fascinating that there will be
these epigenetic perturbations that lead

1966
00:35:18,069 --> 00:35:18,079
these epigenetic perturbations that lead
 

1967
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:18,630
these epigenetic perturbations that lead
to

1968
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:18,640
to
 

1969
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:21,750
to
memories living from one generation to

1970
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:21,760
memories living from one generation to
 

1971
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,790
memories living from one generation to
the other

1972
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:22,800
the other
 

1973
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,390
the other
and then bringing those memories to the

1974
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:24,400
and then bringing those memories to the
 

1975
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,829
and then bringing those memories to the
surface and using

1976
00:35:27,829 --> 00:35:27,839

 

1977
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:30,870

using that as signal to understand what

1978
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:30,880
using that as signal to understand what
 

1979
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,790
using that as signal to understand what
exactly the psychedelics bring

1980
00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:32,800
exactly the psychedelics bring
 

1981
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,910
exactly the psychedelics bring
to the surface and not yeah yeah now the

1982
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:35,920
to the surface and not yeah yeah now the
 

1983
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:36,710
to the surface and not yeah yeah now the
other

1984
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:36,720
other
 

1985
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,470
other
portion of that though is culture i mean

1986
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:38,480
portion of that though is culture i mean
 

1987
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,990
portion of that though is culture i mean
culture is where we store all these

1988
00:35:39,990 --> 00:35:40,000
culture is where we store all these
 

1989
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:40,630
culture is where we store all these
memories

1990
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:40,640
memories
 

1991
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,950
memories
and in the stories that we get passed

1992
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:42,960
and in the stories that we get passed
 

1993
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,150
and in the stories that we get passed
down

1994
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:44,160
down
 

1995
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,470
down
especially with a lot of shared you talk

1996
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:46,480
especially with a lot of shared you talk
 

1997
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,790
especially with a lot of shared you talk
about the holocaust or world war two

1998
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:48,800
about the holocaust or world war two
 

1999
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,829
about the holocaust or world war two
where it is um

2000
00:35:51,829 --> 00:35:51,839
where it is um
 

2001
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:53,670
where it is um
it's deeply ingrained in the culture the

2002
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:53,680
it's deeply ingrained in the culture the
 

2003
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,270
it's deeply ingrained in the culture the
impact of those events

2004
00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:55,280
impact of those events
 

2005
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,030
impact of those events
and sort of in aggregate the different

2006
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:57,040
and sort of in aggregate the different
 

2007
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,310
and sort of in aggregate the different
perspectives on that

2008
00:35:58,310 --> 00:35:58,320
perspectives on that
 

2009
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:01,270
perspectives on that
particular event create a set of stories

2010
00:36:01,270 --> 00:36:01,280
particular event create a set of stories
 

2011
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,030
particular event create a set of stories
that you can plug into

2012
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:03,040
that you can plug into
 

2013
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,750
that you can plug into
and then they kind of resonate with some

2014
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:05,760
and then they kind of resonate with some
 

2015
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,670
and then they kind of resonate with some
aspect of you that creates a memory

2016
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:07,680
aspect of you that creates a memory
 

2017
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:08,550
aspect of you that creates a memory
that's

2018
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:08,560
that's
 

2019
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,310
that's
connected to like when i think about

2020
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:10,320
connected to like when i think about
 

2021
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,990
connected to like when i think about
world war ii and the holocaust

2022
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:12,000
world war ii and the holocaust
 

2023
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,150
world war ii and the holocaust
i think about my own family but in some

2024
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:14,160
i think about my own family but in some
 

2025
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,589
i think about my own family but in some
sense

2026
00:36:15,589 --> 00:36:15,599
sense
 

2027
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:17,589
sense
it's also resonating with stories of

2028
00:36:17,589 --> 00:36:17,599
it's also resonating with stories of
 

2029
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:18,870
it's also resonating with stories of
many others

2030
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:18,880
many others
 

2031
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,349
many others
so it's like somehow the two echo each

2032
00:36:21,349 --> 00:36:21,359
so it's like somehow the two echo each
 

2033
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:21,910
so it's like somehow the two echo each
other

2034
00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:21,920
other
 

2035
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,829
other
and i'm just providing my own little

2036
00:36:23,829 --> 00:36:23,839
and i'm just providing my own little
 

2037
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:24,950
and i'm just providing my own little
flavor on top

2038
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:24,960
flavor on top
 

2039
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,349
flavor on top
the the meat of the stories are probably

2040
00:36:27,349 --> 00:36:27,359
the the meat of the stories are probably
 

2041
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:29,190
the the meat of the stories are probably
those that are shared with others

2042
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:29,200
those that are shared with others
 

2043
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,109
those that are shared with others
it's plugging into the collective

2044
00:36:31,109 --> 00:36:31,119
it's plugging into the collective
 

2045
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:32,710
it's plugging into the collective
unconscious that that's

2046
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:32,720
unconscious that that's
 

2047
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:35,349
unconscious that that's
um that's really fascinating really

2048
00:36:35,349 --> 00:36:35,359
um that's really fascinating really
 

2049
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:36,150
um that's really fascinating really
plugging into

2050
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:36,160
plugging into
 

2051
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:39,750
plugging into
like precisely plugging into particular

2052
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:39,760
like precisely plugging into particular
 

2053
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,630
like precisely plugging into particular
memories

2054
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:40,640
memories
 

2055
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:44,069
memories
as a way to uh to to uh

2056

as a way to uh to to uh
 

2057
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:47,430
as a way to uh to to uh
deal with trauma and ptsd that kind of

2058
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:47,440
deal with trauma and ptsd that kind of
 

2059
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:47,829
deal with trauma and ptsd that kind of
thing

2060
00:36:47,829 --> 00:36:47,839
thing
 

2061
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:50,069
thing
yeah i'll just have that the most

very motivated by irrational factors and
 

2129
00:37:59,040 --> 00:37:59,510
very motivated by irrational factors and
so

2130
00:37:59,510 --> 00:37:59,520
so
 

2131
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,829
so
i i just feel that this this kind of

2132
00:38:02,829 --> 00:38:02,839
i i just feel that this this kind of
 

2133
00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:04,950
i i just feel that this this kind of
multi-generational transmission of the

2134
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:04,960
multi-generational transmission of the
 

2135
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,349
multi-generational transmission of the
story of the irrational

2136
00:38:07,349 --> 00:38:07,359
story of the irrational
 

2137
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:10,710
story of the irrational
you know being a murderous factor

2138
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:10,720
you know being a murderous factor
 

2139
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:14,230
you know being a murderous factor
and something i needed to respond to

2140
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:14,240
and something i needed to respond to
 

2141
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:17,670
and something i needed to respond to
was deeply ingrained and i i would say

2142
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:17,680
was deeply ingrained and i i would say
 

2143
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,829
was deeply ingrained and i i would say
my guess is you know more culturally

2144
00:38:19,829 --> 00:38:19,839
my guess is you know more culturally
 

2145
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:21,430
my guess is you know more culturally
than this epigenetic

2146
00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:21,440
than this epigenetic
 

2147
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,870
than this epigenetic
mechanism yes yeah but your sense is

2148

mechanism yes yeah but your sense is
that

2150
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:25,280
that

system and then i just thought wow just
 

2277
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,109
system and then i just thought wow just
how many billions of years does it take

2278
00:40:57,109 --> 00:40:57,119
how many billions of years does it take
 

2279
00:40:57,119 --> 00:40:58,390
how many billions of years does it take
to reach this point

2280
00:40:58,390 --> 00:40:58,400
to reach this point
 

2281
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,990
to reach this point
self-awareness and all this and it was

2282
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:00,000

thought
um and this is where this kind of um

2288

um and this is where this kind of um
 

2289
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:07,270

next day but it was that acknowledgement
 

2309
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:27,349
next day but it was that acknowledgement
that each of us carries these potentials

2310
00:41:27,349 --> 00:41:27,359
that each of us carries these potentials
 

2311
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:29,589
that each of us carries these potentials
and what we activate is what matters but

2312
00:41:29,589 --> 00:41:29,599
and what we activate is what matters but

the dmt trip itself and what it's like
starting from the very basic geometric

2322
00:41:41,589 --> 00:41:41,599
starting from the very basic geometric
 

2323
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:43,829
starting from the very basic geometric
shapes and then launching

2324
00:41:43,829 --> 00:41:43,839
shapes and then launching
 

2325
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:46,950
shapes and then launching
yourself into the context of the

2326
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:46,960
yourself into the context of the
 

2327
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:49,349
yourself into the context of the
enormity of space and time in the human

00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:16,710
dmt
have 10 15 minutes experience while we

2354
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:16,720
have 10 15 minutes experience while we
 

2355

closed our eyes and you know everybody
 

2357

closed our eyes and you know everybody
else was just chatting and then the

2358
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:19,680
else was just chatting and then the
 

2359
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,750
else was just chatting and then the
person who did the dmt would come back

2360
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:21,760
person who did the dmt would come back
 

2361
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:24,470
person who did the dmt would come back
and tell their story what happened and

and tell their story what happened and
and then

2364
00:42:24,870 --> 00:42:24,880
and then
 

2365
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,069
and then
we'd think about it for a bit and then

2366
00:42:26,069 --> 00:42:26,079
we'd think about it for a bit and then
 

2367
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:27,829
we'd think about it for a bit and then
pass the pipe to the next person and so

2368
00:42:27,829 --> 00:42:27,839
pass the pipe to the next person and so
 

2369
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:28,950
pass the pipe to the next person and so
this was like a whole

2370
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:28,960
this was like a whole
 

2371
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:31,430
this was like a whole
evening you know and so even the

2372
00:42:31,430 --> 00:42:31,440
evening you know and so even the
 

2373
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:32,550
evening you know and so even the
starting to interrupt even the

2374
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:32,560
starting to interrupt even the
 

2375
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:34,069
starting to interrupt even the
conversations themselves then

2376
00:42:34,069 --> 00:42:34,079
conversations themselves then
 

2377
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:36,710
conversations themselves then
is part of the experience exactly yes

2378
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:36,720
is part of the experience exactly yes
 

2379
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,309
is part of the experience exactly yes
yes because it's also what you bring

2380
00:42:38,309 --> 00:42:38,319
yes because it's also what you bring
 

2381
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:38,870
yes because it's also what you bring
back

2382
00:42:38,870 --> 00:42:38,880
back
 

2383
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,550
back
right i mean i think that's particularly

2384
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:40,560
right i mean i think that's particularly
 

2385
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,950
right i mean i think that's particularly
for therapy you know it's not so much

2386
00:42:42,950 --> 00:42:42,960
for therapy you know it's not so much
 

2387
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,109
for therapy you know it's not so much
about what the experience is

2388
00:42:45,109 --> 00:42:45,119
about what the experience is
 

2389
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:47,910
about what the experience is
but it's what you bring back and what do

2390
00:42:47,910 --> 00:42:47,920
but it's what you bring back and what do
 

2391
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:50,150
but it's what you bring back and what do
you integrate and then also

2392
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:50,160
you integrate and then also
 

2393
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:52,230
you integrate and then also
um how do you learn how to do these

2394
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:52,240
um how do you learn how to do these
 

2395
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:54,630
um how do you learn how to do these
things on your own without the drugs

2396
00:42:54,630 --> 00:42:54,640
things on your own without the drugs
 

2397
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,230
things on your own without the drugs
there is this way because we're saying

2398
00:42:56,230 --> 00:42:56,240
there is this way because we're saying
 

2399
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,589
there is this way because we're saying
it's it's sort of a core human

2400
00:42:57,589 --> 00:42:57,599
it's it's sort of a core human
 

2401
00:42:57,599 --> 00:42:58,230
it's it's sort of a core human
experience

2402
00:42:58,230 --> 00:42:58,240
experience
 

2403
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:01,109
experience
the drug is the mediator but can we do

2404
00:43:01,109 --> 00:43:01,119
the drug is the mediator but can we do
 

2405
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:03,109
the drug is the mediator but can we do
this on our own and once you've seen it

2406
00:43:03,109 --> 00:43:03,119
this on our own and once you've seen it
 

2407
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:05,349
this on our own and once you've seen it
and felt it then you have a little bit

2408
00:43:05,349 --> 00:43:05,359
and felt it then you have a little bit
 

2409
00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:06,950
and felt it then you have a little bit
better sense to

2410
00:43:06,950 --> 00:43:06,960
better sense to
 

2411
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:09,109
better sense to
recreate it on your own although you

2412
00:43:09,109 --> 00:43:09,119
recreate it on your own although you
 

2413
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:10,710
recreate it on your own although you
know i've had dreams where i've been

2414
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:10,720
know i've had dreams where i've been
 

2415
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:11,750
know i've had dreams where i've been
doing lsd

2416
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:11,760
doing lsd
 

2417
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:14,470
doing lsd
and tripping and it was just incredible

2418
00:43:14,470 --> 00:43:14,480
and tripping and it was just incredible
 

2419
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:15,109
and tripping and it was just incredible
it was

2420
00:43:15,109 --> 00:43:15,119
it was
 

2421
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:17,910
it was
i was tripping in my dreams but i had

2422
00:43:17,910 --> 00:43:17,920
i was tripping in my dreams but i had
 

2423
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:19,670
i was tripping in my dreams but i had
not taken lsd

2424
00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:19,680
not taken lsd
 

2425
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,910
not taken lsd
so there's this way in which we do that

2426
00:43:21,910 --> 00:43:21,920
so there's this way in which we do that
 

2427
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:22,790
so there's this way in which we do that
so i

2428
00:43:22,790 --> 00:43:22,800
so i
 

2429
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:26,069
so i
i would say that from the dmt experience

2430
00:43:26,069 --> 00:43:26,079
i would say that from the dmt experience
 

2431
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:27,510
i would say that from the dmt experience
the sense of safety that's what i was

2432
00:43:27,510 --> 00:43:27,520
the sense of safety that's what i was
 

2433
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:29,190
the sense of safety that's what i was
trying to get at with this

2434
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:29,200
trying to get at with this
 

2435
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:30,630
trying to get at with this
group of us and this group of friends

2436
00:43:30,630 --> 00:43:30,640
group of us and this group of friends
 

2437
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:32,390
group of us and this group of friends
trying to do this common exploration

2438
00:43:32,390 --> 00:43:32,400
trying to do this common exploration
 

2439
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:33,349
trying to do this common exploration
that

2440
00:43:33,349 --> 00:43:33,359
that
 

2441
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:35,270
that
if you have this sense of safety you're

2442
00:43:35,270 --> 00:43:35,280
if you have this sense of safety you're
 

2443
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,710
if you have this sense of safety you're
incredibly

2444
00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:36,720
incredibly
 

2445
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:40,069
incredibly
vulnerable because you are

2446
00:43:40,069 --> 00:43:40,079
vulnerable because you are
 

2447
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:43,109
vulnerable because you are
giving up your um awareness really of

2448
00:43:43,109 --> 00:43:43,119
giving up your um awareness really of
 

2449
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:44,710
giving up your um awareness really of

2463
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:01,990
reluctant to
volunteer for vaccines because they

2464
00:44:01,990 --> 00:44:02,000
volunteer for vaccines because they
 

2465
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,670
volunteer for vaccines because they
haven't had that sense of safety

2466

this idea of psychedelics displacing our
 

2587

this idea of psychedelics displacing our
ego as the center of the universe

and to realize that we are just rotating

2590
00:46:32,390 --> 00:46:32,400
and to realize that we are just rotating
 

2591
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,309
and to realize that we are just rotating
about on something much bigger

2592
00:46:34,309 --> 00:46:34,319
about on something much bigger
 

2593
00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:36,950
about on something much bigger
than our individual life you know our

2594
00:46:36,950 --> 00:46:36,960
than our individual life you know our
 

2595
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:37,510
than our individual life you know our
ego is

2596
00:46:37,510 --> 00:46:37,520
ego is
 

2597
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:39,750
ego is
is designed almost to protect this body

2598
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:39,760
is designed almost to protect this body
 

2599
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:41,270
is designed almost to protect this body
while we're alive

2600
00:46:41,270 --> 00:46:41,280
while we're alive
 

2601
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:42,630
while we're alive
and you can understand all the good

2602
00:46:42,630 --> 00:46:42,640
and you can understand all the good
 

2603
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:45,030
and you can understand all the good
reasons why that is

2604
00:46:45,030 --> 00:46:45,040
reasons why that is
 

2605
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:47,349
reasons why that is
but it also disconnects us from this

2606
00:46:47,349 --> 00:46:47,359
but it also disconnects us from this
 

2607
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:48,550
but it also disconnects us from this
bigger reality

2608
00:46:48,550 --> 00:46:48,560
bigger reality
 

2609
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:50,870
bigger reality
and so the psychedelics dmt by knocking

2610
00:46:50,870 --> 00:46:50,880

sort of conundrum the same challenge

2678
00:47:55,670 --> 00:47:55,680
sort of conundrum the same challenge
 

2679
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:57,510
sort of conundrum the same challenge
that i was unable to overcome this idea

2773
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:36,470
then you kind of push it aside and then
a couple hours later you come back to it

2774

or you come back to it press news every
 

2777
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:39,349
or you come back to it press news every
once in a while

00:49:39,349 --> 00:49:39,359
once in a while

once in a while
if you're not ready it's hard to do that

00:49:41,349 --> 00:49:41,359
if you're not ready it's hard to do that
 

2781

this kind of membrane between the

coming up
um it's very difficult to negotiate

2810
00:50:09,990 --> 00:50:10,000
um it's very difficult to negotiate
 

2811
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,829
um it's very difficult to negotiate

you've talked about that you first began

2818
00:50:19,990 --> 00:50:20,000
you've talked about that you first began

health myths around psychedelics when

2822
00:50:24,309 --> 00:50:24,319
health myths around psychedelics when
 

2823
00:50:24,319 --> 00:50:25,670
health myths around psychedelics when
you learned that the book

2824
00:50:25,670 --> 00:50:25,680
you learned that the book
 

2825
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:27,990

00:50:29,670 --> 00:50:29,680
written by ken gizzy when
 

2829
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:31,430
written by ken gizzy when
he was in part under the influence of

2830
00:50:31,430 --> 00:50:31,440
he was in part under the influence of
 

2831
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:32,710
he was in part under the influence of
lsd

2832
00:50:32,710 --> 00:50:32,720
lsd
 

2833
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:35,750
lsd
so how do you think lsd helped him ken

2834
00:50:35,750 --> 00:50:35,760
so how do you think lsd helped him ken
 

2835
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:36,390
so how do you think lsd helped him ken
keys in

2836
00:50:36,390 --> 00:50:36,400
keys in
 

2837
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:39,510
keys in
writing uh that incredible book

2838
00:50:39,510 --> 00:50:39,520
writing uh that incredible book
 

2839
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:42,390
writing uh that incredible book
yeah um there's a a process that's

2840
00:50:42,390 --> 00:50:42,400
yeah um there's a a process that's
 

2841
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:44,950
yeah um there's a a process that's
called semantic priming

2842
00:50:44,950 --> 00:50:44,960
called semantic priming
 

2843
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:47,109
called semantic priming
and so what what that means is that i i

2844
00:50:47,109 --> 00:50:47,119
and so what what that means is that i i
 

2845
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:47,990
and so what what that means is that i i
say um

2846
00:50:47,990 --> 00:50:48,000
say um
 

2847
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,990
say um
night you say day you know there's kind

2848
00:50:49,990 --> 00:50:50,000
night you say day you know there's kind
 

2849
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,750
night you say day you know there's kind
of normal patterns

2850
00:50:51,750 --> 00:50:51,760
of normal patterns
 

2851
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:54,069
of normal patterns
of kind of you say one word what kind of

2852
00:50:54,069 --> 00:50:54,079
of kind of you say one word what kind of
 

2853
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:55,430
of kind of you say one word what kind of
words come to you

2854
00:50:55,430 --> 00:50:55,440
words come to you
 

2855
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:58,390
words come to you
next and so they've done some research

2856
00:50:58,390 --> 00:50:58,400
next and so they've done some research
 

2857
00:50:58,400 --> 00:50:59,990
next and so they've done some research
they meaning scientists have done some

2858
00:50:59,990 --> 00:51:00,000
they meaning scientists have done some
 

2859
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,270
they meaning scientists have done some
research

2860
00:51:01,270 --> 00:51:01,280
research
 

2861
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:04,630
research
where you give people a psychedelic

2862
00:51:04,630 --> 00:51:04,640
where you give people a psychedelic
 

2863
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:07,349
where you give people a psychedelic
and then you do this semantic priming

2864
00:51:07,349 --> 00:51:07,359
and then you do this semantic priming
 

2865
00:51:07,359 --> 00:51:08,230
and then you do this semantic priming
and what you

2866
00:51:08,230 --> 00:51:08,240
and what you
 

2867
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:10,349
and what you
find is they have a wider range of

2868
00:51:10,349 --> 00:51:10,359
find is they have a wider range of
 

2869
00:51:10,359 --> 00:51:11,990
find is they have a wider range of
associations

2870
00:51:11,990 --> 00:51:12,000
associations
 

2871
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,589
associations
than they normally would when they're

2872
00:51:13,589 --> 00:51:13,599
than they normally would when they're
 

2873
00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:15,670
than they normally would when they're
not under psychedelics

2874
00:51:15,670 --> 00:51:15,680
not under psychedelics
 

2875
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:18,950
not under psychedelics
so i think for ken kesey um

2876
00:51:18,950 --> 00:51:18,960
so i think for ken kesey um
 

2877
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:22,150
so i think for ken kesey um
he was able with psychedelics to get

2878
00:51:22,150 --> 00:51:22,160
he was able with psychedelics to get
 

2879
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:25,750
he was able with psychedelics to get
like um a deeper kind of emotional

2880
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:25,760
like um a deeper kind of emotional
 

2881
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:27,349
like um a deeper kind of emotional
connection to some of these

2882
00:51:27,349 --> 00:51:27,359
connection to some of these
 

2883
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:28,950
connection to some of these
states of mind that people were in the

2884
00:51:28,950 --> 00:51:28,960
states of mind that people were in the
 

2885
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:31,589
states of mind that people were in the
instant this mental institution

2886
00:51:31,589 --> 00:51:31,599
instant this mental institution
 

2887
00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:34,870
instant this mental institution
and that he could explore them more

2888
00:51:34,870 --> 00:51:34,880
and that he could explore them more
 

2889
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:37,990
and that he could explore them more
in-depth and more eloquently and and

2890
00:51:37,990 --> 00:51:38,000
in-depth and more eloquently and and
 

2891
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,750
in-depth and more eloquently and and
and also one of the things he talked

2892
00:51:39,750 --> 00:51:39,760
and also one of the things he talked
 

2893
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:41,750
and also one of the things he talked
about was the fog machine

2894
00:51:41,750 --> 00:51:41,760
about was the fog machine
 

2895
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:45,270
about was the fog machine
was you know how um people's minds were

2896
00:51:45,270 --> 00:51:45,280
was you know how um people's minds were
 

2897
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:47,430
was you know how um people's minds were
sort of clouded by the people that ran

2898
00:51:47,430 --> 00:51:47,440
sort of clouded by the people that ran
 

2899
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:48,710
sort of clouded by the people that ran
the institution and this

2900
00:51:48,710 --> 00:51:48,720
the institution and this
 

2901
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:51,190
the institution and this
the fog machine would be coming in so i

2902
00:51:51,190 --> 00:51:51,200
the fog machine would be coming in so i
 

2903
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:51,990
the fog machine would be coming in so i
think

2904
00:51:51,990 --> 00:51:52,000
think
 

2905
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:56,390
think
the um imagery and the metaphors

2906
00:51:56,390 --> 00:51:56,400
the um imagery and the metaphors
 

2907
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:58,710
the um imagery and the metaphors
that he used a lot in the book could

2908
00:51:58,710 --> 00:51:58,720
that he used a lot in the book could
 

2909
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:00,870
that he used a lot in the book could
come to him during lsd experiences

2910
00:52:00,870 --> 00:52:00,880
come to him during lsd experiences
 

2911
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:04,150
come to him during lsd experiences
and and then now he wasn't doing um

2912
00:52:04,150 --> 00:52:04,160
and and then now he wasn't doing um
 

2913
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:07,109
and and then now he wasn't doing um
you know very when you're writing you

2914
00:52:07,109 --> 00:52:07,119
you know very when you're writing you
 

2915
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:09,430
you know very when you're writing you
have to be

2916
00:52:09,430 --> 00:52:09,440
have to be
 

2917
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:13,030
have to be
literate uh you have to be able to write

2918
00:52:13,030 --> 00:52:13,040
literate uh you have to be able to write
 

2919
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:14,309
literate uh you have to be able to write
you know so it would be more like

2920
00:52:14,309 --> 00:52:14,319
you know so it would be more like
 

2921
00:52:14,319 --> 00:52:16,470
you know so it would be more like
beginning and ends of lsd trips instead

2922
00:52:16,470 --> 00:52:16,480
beginning and ends of lsd trips instead
 

2923
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:17,589
beginning and ends of lsd trips instead
of at the peak

2924
00:52:17,589 --> 00:52:17,599
of at the peak
 

2925
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:19,510
of at the peak
but i think you would get a lot of these

2926
00:52:19,510 --> 00:52:19,520
but i think you would get a lot of these
 

2927
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:20,630
but i think you would get a lot of these
um

2928
00:52:20,630 --> 00:52:20,640
um
 

2929
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:22,549
um
the feeling tones or the images the

2930
00:52:22,549 --> 00:52:22,559
the feeling tones or the images the
 

2931
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:25,270
the feeling tones or the images the
metaphors i think he would get

2932
00:52:25,270 --> 00:52:25,280
metaphors i think he would get
 

2933
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:27,589
metaphors i think he would get
these extent also lsd lasts so long you

and so i think that ken kesey was
 

2963
00:53:03,839 --> 00:53:07,430
and so i think that ken kesey was
able to channel these what lsd did to

i think of course you start with
um helping people

3054
00:54:53,030 --> 00:54:53,040
um helping people
 

3055
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:55,430
um helping people
uh deal with trauma and then the next

3056
00:54:55,430 --> 00:54:55,440
uh deal with trauma and then the next
 

3057
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:56,789
uh deal with trauma and then the next
step is

3058
00:54:56,789 --> 00:54:56,799
step is
 

3059
00:54:56,799 --> 00:55:00,470
step is
people who have moved past their trauma

3060
00:55:00,470 --> 00:55:00,480

idea of psychedelics for vision quest

3076
00:55:17,109 --> 00:55:17,119
idea of psychedelics for vision quest
 

3077
00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:19,670
idea of psychedelics for vision quest
particularly for younger people you know

3078
00:55:19,670 --> 00:55:19,680
particularly for younger people you know
 

3079
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:20,309
particularly for younger people you know
when you're

3080
00:55:20,309 --> 00:55:20,319
when you're
 

3081
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:22,789
when you're
sort of moving into this adulting kind

3082
00:55:22,789 --> 00:55:22,799
sort of moving into this adulting kind
 

3083
00:55:22,799 --> 00:55:24,470
sort of moving into this adulting kind
of phase and you have to figure out what

3084
00:55:24,470 --> 00:55:24,480
of phase and you have to figure out what

3096
00:55:38,950 --> 00:55:38,960
way to help you
 

3097
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:41,430
way to help you
find your calling or find your vision or

3098
00:55:41,430 --> 00:55:41,440
find your calling or find your vision or
 

3099
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:44,150
find your calling or find your vision or
find your unique leverage point

3100
00:55:44,150 --> 00:55:44,160
find your unique leverage point
 

3101
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:45,829
find your unique leverage point
i think we'll see that more and more as

3102
00:55:45,829 --> 00:55:45,839
i think we'll see that more and more as
 

3103
00:55:45,839 --> 00:55:48,309
i think we'll see that more and more as
our culture evolves and gets healthier

3104
00:55:48,309 --> 00:55:48,319
our culture evolves and gets healthier
 

3105
00:55:48,319 --> 00:55:50,069
our culture evolves and gets healthier
around the use of psychedelics it says

3106
00:55:50,069 --> 00:55:50,079
around the use of psychedelics it says
 

3107
00:55:50,079 --> 00:55:51,910
around the use of psychedelics it says
both the science

3108
00:55:51,910 --> 00:55:51,920
both the science
 

3109
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:54,069
both the science
uh having the rigor of understanding how

3110
00:55:54,069 --> 00:55:54,079
uh having the rigor of understanding how
 

3111
00:55:54,079 --> 00:55:55,910
uh having the rigor of understanding how
to do it safely and the culture catching

3112
00:55:55,910 --> 00:55:55,920
to do it safely and the culture catching
 

3113
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:56,630
to do it safely and the culture catching
up

3114
00:55:56,630 --> 00:55:56,640
up
 

3115
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:59,750
up
to the fact that this is uh both safe

3116
00:55:59,750 --> 00:55:59,760
to the fact that this is uh both safe
 

3117
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:03,510
to the fact that this is uh both safe
and uh like very useful

3118
00:56:03,510 --> 00:56:03,520
and uh like very useful
 

3119
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:05,589
and uh like very useful
yeah although i would question this idea

3120
00:56:05,589 --> 00:56:05,599
yeah although i would question this idea
 

3121
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:07,190
yeah although i would question this idea
of safety

3122
00:56:07,190 --> 00:56:07,200
of safety
 

3123
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:10,069
of safety
um so so we can understand physiological

3124
00:56:10,069 --> 00:56:10,079
um so so we can understand physiological
 

3125
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:11,270
um so so we can understand physiological
risks

3126
00:56:11,270 --> 00:56:11,280
risks
 

3127
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:13,430
risks
and we can minimize them and i think

3128
00:56:13,430 --> 00:56:13,440
and we can minimize them and i think
 

3129
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:14,950
and we can minimize them and i think
there's very minimal

3130
00:56:14,950 --> 00:56:14,960
there's very minimal
 

3131
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:16,710
there's very minimal
physiological risks from the classic

3132
00:56:16,710 --> 00:56:16,720
physiological risks from the classic
 

3133
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:18,390
physiological risks from the classic
psychedelics virtually none

3134
00:56:18,390 --> 00:56:18,400
psychedelics virtually none
 

3135
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:23,750
psychedelics virtually none
or for even mdma under safe conditions

3136
00:56:23,750 --> 00:56:23,760
or for even mdma under safe conditions
 

3137
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:27,270
or for even mdma under safe conditions
psychological risks are

3138
00:56:27,270 --> 00:56:27,280
psychological risks are
 

3139
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:30,230
psychological risks are
harder to address but we can do that

3140
00:56:30,230 --> 00:56:30,240
harder to address but we can do that
 

3141
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:32,870
harder to address but we can do that
through the sense of safety and support

3142
00:56:32,870 --> 00:56:32,880
through the sense of safety and support
 

3143
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:36,390
through the sense of safety and support
but i think there's um a level of risk

3144
00:56:36,390 --> 00:56:36,400
but i think there's um a level of risk
 

3145
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:39,750
but i think there's um a level of risk
there that we shouldn't overlook

3146
00:56:39,750 --> 00:56:39,760
there that we shouldn't overlook
 

3147
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:42,069
there that we shouldn't overlook
and so you know to make a drug into a

3148
00:56:42,069 --> 00:56:42,079
and so you know to make a drug into a
 

3149
00:56:42,079 --> 00:56:44,069
and so you know to make a drug into a
medicine what we have to do is prove

3150
00:56:44,069 --> 00:56:44,079
medicine what we have to do is prove
 

3151
00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:46,390
medicine what we have to do is prove
to the satisfaction of the fda and other

3152
00:56:46,390 --> 00:56:46,400
to the satisfaction of the fda and other
 

3153
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:47,589
to the satisfaction of the fda and other
regulatory agencies

3154
00:56:47,589 --> 00:56:47,599
regulatory agencies
 

3155
00:56:47,599 --> 00:56:50,870
regulatory agencies
that things are safe and efficacious but

3156
00:56:50,870 --> 00:56:50,880
that things are safe and efficacious but
 

3157
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:52,789
that things are safe and efficacious but
even though they use those words proving

3158
00:56:52,789 --> 00:56:52,799
even though they use those words proving
 

3159
00:56:52,799 --> 00:56:55,750
even though they use those words proving
safety and safe and efficacious

3160
00:56:55,750 --> 00:56:55,760
safety and safe and efficacious
 

3161
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:57,990
safety and safe and efficacious
it's in relationship to the disease that

3162
00:56:57,990 --> 00:56:58,000
it's in relationship to the disease that
 

3163
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,910
it's in relationship to the disease that
you're trying to treat and you accept a

3164
00:56:59,910 --> 00:56:59,920
you're trying to treat and you accept a
 

3165
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:01,670
you're trying to treat and you accept a
certain amount of risk

3166
00:57:01,670 --> 00:57:01,680
certain amount of risk
 

3167
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:04,789
certain amount of risk
so it's the risk benefit ratio rather

3168
00:57:04,789 --> 00:57:04,799
so it's the risk benefit ratio rather
 

3169
00:57:04,799 --> 00:57:05,430
so it's the risk benefit ratio rather
than

3170
00:57:05,430 --> 00:57:05,440
than
 

3171
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:10,230
than
pure safety yeah absolutely

3172
00:57:10,230 --> 00:57:10,240
pure safety yeah absolutely
 

3173
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:12,549
pure safety yeah absolutely

uh lessons we should take away from it

3186
00:57:27,589 --> 00:57:27,599
uh lessons we should take away from it
 

3187
00:57:27,599 --> 00:57:31,910
uh lessons we should take away from it

give a big talk to something like lsd
 

3207
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:51,270
give a big talk to something like lsd
and then they

3208
00:57:51,270 --> 00:57:51,280
and then they
 

3209
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:53,030

themselves or
 

3213
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:57,270
themselves or
can you spray lsd over the battlefield

3214
00:57:57,270 --> 00:57:57,280
can you spray lsd over the battlefield
 

3215
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:58,789
can you spray lsd over the battlefield
and have everybody tripping and drop

3216
00:57:58,789 --> 00:57:58,799
and have everybody tripping and drop
 

3217
00:57:58,799 --> 00:58:00,630
and have everybody tripping and drop
their weapons and then you just walk up

3218
00:58:00,630 --> 00:58:00,640
their weapons and then you just walk up
 

3219
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:00,870
their weapons and then you just walk up
and

3220
00:58:00,870 --> 00:58:00,880
and
 

3221
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:03,430
and
you know nobody dies and you've won you

3222
00:58:03,430 --> 00:58:03,440
you know nobody dies and you've won you
 

3223
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:04,230
you know nobody dies and you've won you
know the battle

3224
00:58:04,230 --> 00:58:04,240
know the battle
 

3225
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:07,349
know the battle
so so it's a fascinating concept yeah

3226
00:58:07,349 --> 00:58:07,359
so so it's a fascinating concept yeah
 

3227
00:58:07,359 --> 00:58:09,670
so so it's a fascinating concept yeah
they call it non-lethal incapacitance

3228
00:58:09,670 --> 00:58:09,680
they call it non-lethal incapacitance
 

3229
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:12,390
they call it non-lethal incapacitance
and i think that's how uh one way to win

3230
00:58:12,390 --> 00:58:12,400
and i think that's how uh one way to win
 

3231
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:13,109
and i think that's how uh one way to win
a war is

3232
00:58:13,109 --> 00:58:13,119
a war is
 

3233
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:16,150
a war is
uh to enforce peace

3234
00:58:16,150 --> 00:58:16,160
uh to enforce peace
 

3235
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:17,910
uh to enforce peace
to get everybody not caring about the

3236
00:58:17,910 --> 00:58:17,920
to get everybody not caring about the
 

3237
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:19,430
to get everybody not caring about the
war but yes well i

3238
00:58:19,430 --> 00:58:19,440
war but yes well i
 

3239
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:21,030
war but yes well i
think gandhi said something even better

3240
00:58:21,030 --> 00:58:21,040
think gandhi said something even better
 

3241
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:22,710
think gandhi said something even better
which is that the true way to win a war

3242
00:58:22,710 --> 00:58:22,720
which is that the true way to win a war
 

3243
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:24,390
which is that the true way to win a war
is to turn your enemy into your friend

3244
00:58:24,390 --> 00:58:24,400
is to turn your enemy into your friend
 

3245
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:24,870
is to turn your enemy into your friend
yes

3246
00:58:24,870 --> 00:58:24,880
yes
 

3247
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:27,430
yes
that's a beautiful way to put it yeah um

3248
00:58:27,430 --> 00:58:27,440
that's a beautiful way to put it yeah um
 

3249
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:27,910
that's a beautiful way to put it yeah um
but

3250
00:58:27,910 --> 00:58:27,920
but
 

3251
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:30,069
but
mk ultra was really nefarious and it was

3252
00:58:30,069 --> 00:58:30,079
mk ultra was really nefarious and it was
 

3253
00:58:30,079 --> 00:58:31,670
mk ultra was really nefarious and it was
part of our military and it was done in

3254
00:58:31,670 --> 00:58:31,680
part of our military and it was done in
 

3255
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:33,190
part of our military and it was done in
secret and um

3256
00:58:33,190 --> 00:58:33,200
secret and um
 

3257
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:35,670
secret and um

improvisations and they could do this
 

3441

01:01:35,750 --> 01:01:35,760
incredible
 

3443
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:38,309
incredible
work that i think the the the

3444
01:01:38,309 --> 01:01:38,319

sustainability of the grateful dead as a
 

3447
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:44,230
sustainability of the grateful dead as a
group was a testimony testament to the

group was a testimony testament to the
 

3449
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:45,430
group was a testimony testament to the
power of the lsd

3450
01:01:45,430 --> 01:01:45,440
power of the lsd
 

3451
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:47,109
power of the lsd
experiences and that might have never

3452
01:01:47,109 --> 01:01:47,119
experiences and that might have never
 

3453
01:01:47,119 --> 01:01:50,230
experiences and that might have never
happened if not for mk ultra

3454

um we talked before about are these

3476
01:02:15,430 --> 01:02:15,440
um we talked before about are these
 

3477
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:18,150
um we talked before about are these
drugs somehow rather

3478
01:02:18,150 --> 01:02:18,160
drugs somehow rather
 

3479
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:19,510
drugs somehow rather
producing a certain kind of drug

3480
01:02:19,510 --> 01:02:19,520
producing a certain kind of drug
 

3481
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:21,510
producing a certain kind of drug
experience or do they bring out what's

3482
01:02:21,510 --> 01:02:21,520
experience or do they bring out what's
 

3483
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:22,950
experience or do they bring out what's
within

3484
01:02:22,950 --> 01:02:22,960
within
 

3485
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:25,510
within
so we have this experience yeah on the

3486
01:02:25,510 --> 01:02:25,520
so we have this experience yeah on the
 

3487
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:27,190
so we have this experience yeah on the
one hand ken kesey and he

3488
01:02:27,190 --> 01:02:27,200
one hand ken kesey and he
 

3489
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:29,589
one hand ken kesey and he
sort of took positive things out of this

3490
01:02:29,589 --> 01:02:29,599
sort of took positive things out of this
 

3491
01:02:29,599 --> 01:02:30,789
sort of took positive things out of this
um on the other hand

3492
01:02:30,789 --> 01:02:30,799
um on the other hand
 

3493
01:02:30,799 --> 01:02:34,710
um on the other hand
um you know we can um

3494
01:02:34,710 --> 01:02:34,720
um you know we can um
 

3495
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:37,029
um you know we can um
get this uh opposition to the modern

3496
01:02:37,029 --> 01:02:37,039
get this uh opposition to the modern
 

3497
01:02:37,039 --> 01:02:39,349
get this uh opposition to the modern
world to technology and to the point of

3498
01:02:39,349 --> 01:02:39,359
world to technology and to the point of
 

3499
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:39,670
world to technology and to the point of
uh

3500
01:02:39,670 --> 01:02:39,680
uh
 

3501
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:42,230
uh
creating bombs to try to go after it so

3502
01:02:42,230 --> 01:02:42,240
creating bombs to try to go after it so
 

3503
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:43,270
creating bombs to try to go after it so
that

3504
01:02:43,270 --> 01:02:43,280
that
 

3505
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:45,510
that
the experience is not in the drug it's

3506
01:02:45,510 --> 01:02:45,520
the experience is not in the drug it's
 

3507
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:47,670
the experience is not in the drug it's
this interaction between

3508
01:02:47,670 --> 01:02:47,680
this interaction between
 

3509
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:52,150
this interaction between
the drug the person the context and so

3510
01:02:52,150 --> 01:02:52,160
the drug the person the context and so
 

3511
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:55,829
the drug the person the context and so
we can heal people with psychedelics or

3512
01:02:55,829 --> 01:02:55,839
we can heal people with psychedelics or
 

3513
01:02:55,839 --> 01:02:57,349
we can heal people with psychedelics or
people can be driven crazy with

3514
01:02:57,349 --> 01:02:57,359
people can be driven crazy with
 

3515
01:02:57,359 --> 01:02:59,349
people can be driven crazy with
psychedelics

3516
01:02:59,349 --> 01:02:59,359
psychedelics
 

3517
01:02:59,359 --> 01:03:02,630
psychedelics
it depends again on the context and so

3518
01:03:02,630 --> 01:03:02,640
it depends again on the context and so
 

3519
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:04,710
it depends again on the context and so
i think it's both these things can be

3520
01:03:04,710 --> 01:03:04,720
i think it's both these things can be
 

3521
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:06,630
i think it's both these things can be
true and i think it was really good that

3522
01:03:06,630 --> 01:03:06,640
true and i think it was really good that
 

3523
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:07,270
true and i think it was really good that
you kind of

3524
01:03:07,270 --> 01:03:07,280
you kind of
 

3525
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:10,230
you kind of
highlighted this that there is this um

3526
01:03:10,230 --> 01:03:10,240
highlighted this that there is this um
 

3527
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:11,270
highlighted this that there is this um
polarities

3528
01:03:11,270 --> 01:03:11,280
polarities
 

3529
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:13,510
polarities
and that it's not in the drug it's in

3530
01:03:13,510 --> 01:03:13,520
and that it's not in the drug it's in
 

3531
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:14,309
and that it's not in the drug it's in
the the

3532
01:03:14,309 --> 01:03:14,319
the the
 

3533
01:03:14,319 --> 01:03:16,390
the the
other factors and it's who they were

3534
01:03:16,390 --> 01:03:16,400
other factors and it's who they were
 

3535
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:18,390
other factors and it's who they were
beforehand and then how you use that

3536
01:03:18,390 --> 01:03:18,400
beforehand and then how you use that
 

3537
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:19,670
beforehand and then how you use that
experience so

3538
01:03:19,670 --> 01:03:19,680
experience so
 

3539
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:21,750
experience so
all that's to say is if we put lsd in

3540
01:03:21,750 --> 01:03:21,760
all that's to say is if we put lsd in
 

3541
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:23,349
all that's to say is if we put lsd in
the water and everybody we're going to

3542
01:03:23,349 --> 01:03:23,359
the water and everybody we're going to
 

3543
01:03:23,359 --> 01:03:24,950
the water and everybody we're going to
get it it doesn't mean that all of a

3544
01:03:24,950 --> 01:03:24,960
get it it doesn't mean that all of a
 

3545
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:25,910
get it it doesn't mean that all of a
sudden everybody's going to have a

3546
01:03:25,910 --> 01:03:25,920
sudden everybody's going to have a
 

3547
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:28,150
sudden everybody's going to have a
mystical experience and then that's

3548
01:03:28,150 --> 01:03:28,160
mystical experience and then that's
 

3549
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:29,990
mystical experience and then that's
you know all we need to do and humanity

3550
01:03:29,990 --> 01:03:30,000
you know all we need to do and humanity
 

3551
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:31,349
you know all we need to do and humanity
is spiritualized or

3552
01:03:31,349 --> 01:03:31,359
is spiritualized or
 

3553
01:03:31,359 --> 01:03:33,270
is spiritualized or
end war and all of this it's it's not

3554
01:03:33,270 --> 01:03:33,280
end war and all of this it's it's not
 

3555
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:34,470
end war and all of this it's it's not
about

3556
01:03:34,470 --> 01:03:34,480
about
 

3557
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:37,270
about
the drug and that that actually is why

3558
01:03:37,270 --> 01:03:37,280
the drug and that that actually is why
 

3559
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:38,390
the drug and that that actually is why
for me

3560
01:03:38,390 --> 01:03:38,400
for me
 

3561
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:41,430
for me
um we've also talked about um

3562
01:03:41,430 --> 01:03:41,440
um we've also talked about um
 

3563
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:43,750
um we've also talked about um
engineering new psychedelics and all the

3564
01:03:43,750 --> 01:03:43,760
engineering new psychedelics and all the
 

3565
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:44,789
engineering new psychedelics and all the
people that are going to be trying

3566
01:03:44,789 --> 01:03:44,799
people that are going to be trying
 

3567
01:03:44,799 --> 01:03:46,390
people that are going to be trying
for-profit companies to develop and

3568
01:03:46,390 --> 01:03:46,400
for-profit companies to develop and
 

3569
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:47,910
for-profit companies to develop and
patent new psychedelics

3570
01:03:47,910 --> 01:03:47,920
patent new psychedelics
 

3571
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:50,390
patent new psychedelics
for me the most important challenge is

3572
01:03:50,390 --> 01:03:50,400
for me the most important challenge is
 

3573
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:53,750
for me the most important challenge is
new cultural contexts

3574
01:03:53,750 --> 01:03:53,760
new cultural contexts
 

3575
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:57,589
new cultural contexts
that can create legality safety support

3576
01:03:57,589 --> 01:03:57,599
that can create legality safety support
 

3577
01:03:57,599 --> 01:03:59,510
that can create legality safety support
for the existing psychedelics that we

3578
01:03:59,510 --> 01:03:59,520
for the existing psychedelics that we
 

3579
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:00,789
for the existing psychedelics that we
already have

3580
01:04:00,789 --> 01:04:00,799

and that's a cautionary tale that it's
 

3615

and that's a cautionary tale that it's
not in the drug it's in the context

not in the drug it's in the context

i think this um for people that have had
 

3679
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:42,789
i think this um for people that have had
difficult psychedelic experiences

3680
01:05:42,789 --> 01:05:42,799
difficult psychedelic experiences
 

3681
01:05:42,799 --> 01:05:45,430
difficult psychedelic experiences
um mdma helps them integrate them we've

3682
01:05:45,430 --> 01:05:45,440
um mdma helps them integrate them we've
 

3683
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:46,870
um mdma helps them integrate them we've
worked with people that had

3684
01:05:46,870 --> 01:05:46,880
worked with people that had
 

3685
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:49,109
worked with people that had
a difficult lsd experience 40 years

3686
01:05:49,109 --> 01:05:49,119
a difficult lsd experience 40 years
 

3687
01:05:49,119 --> 01:05:50,150
a difficult lsd experience 40 years
before

3688
01:05:50,150 --> 01:05:50,160
before
 

3689
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:52,150
before
and are still able to get back to that

3690
01:05:52,150 --> 01:05:52,160
and are still able to get back to that
 

3691
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:53,589
and are still able to get back to that
under the influence of mdma

3692
01:05:53,589 --> 01:05:53,599
under the influence of mdma
 

3693
01:05:53,599 --> 01:05:55,829
under the influence of mdma
and work out some of the conflicts that

3694
01:05:55,829 --> 01:05:55,839
and work out some of the conflicts that
 

3695
01:05:55,839 --> 01:05:58,630
and work out some of the conflicts that
they weren't able to resolve

3696
01:05:58,630 --> 01:05:58,640
they weren't able to resolve
 

3697
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:02,870
they weren't able to resolve
all those decades before so i think that

3698
01:06:02,870 --> 01:06:02,880
all those decades before so i think that
 

3699
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:04,789
all those decades before so i think that
psychedelics could have been helpful in

3700
01:06:04,789 --> 01:06:04,799
psychedelics could have been helpful in
 

3701
01:06:04,799 --> 01:06:07,670
psychedelics could have been helpful in

3703
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:10,789
a different context for ted kazinski
but the other big part of it is that

3704
01:06:10,789 --> 01:06:10,799
but the other big part of it is that
 

3705
01:06:10,799 --> 01:06:13,029
but the other big part of it is that
people have to be willing to cooperate

3706
01:06:13,029 --> 01:06:13,039
people have to be willing to cooperate
 

3707
01:06:13,039 --> 01:06:14,710
people have to be willing to cooperate
with the experience we talked about

3708
01:06:14,710 --> 01:06:14,720
with the experience we talked about
 

3709
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:15,990
with the experience we talked about
resistance

3710
01:06:15,990 --> 01:06:16,000
resistance
 

3711
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,470
resistance
so people can resist these things it's

3712
01:06:18,470 --> 01:06:18,480
so people can resist these things it's
 

3713

um write-up of this experiment so
 

4427
01:18:20,719 --> 01:18:23,110
um write-up of this experiment so
what they did is in a sense a little bit

three years later after the experiment
 

4435
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:28,950
three years later after the experiment
or four years in time magazine it said

not this guy and they uh
 

4447
01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:41,510
not this guy and they uh
minimized the risks so there was a bit

4448
01:18:41,510 --> 01:18:41,520
minimized the risks so there was a bit
 

4449
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:43,430
minimized the risks so there was a bit
of that i think tim was reckless in that

4450
01:18:43,430 --> 01:18:43,440
of that i think tim was reckless in that
 

4451
01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:43,830
of that i think tim was reckless in that
way

4452
01:18:43,830 --> 01:18:43,840
way
 

4453
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:46,229
way
it was underplayed the risks and over

4454
01:18:46,229 --> 01:18:46,239
it was underplayed the risks and over
 

4455
01:18:46,239 --> 01:18:46,870
it was underplayed the risks and over
promised

4456
01:18:46,870 --> 01:18:46,880
promised
 

4457
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:49,669
promised
the benefits and then the concord prison

4458
01:18:49,669 --> 01:18:49,679
the benefits and then the concord prison
 

4459
01:18:49,679 --> 01:18:51,110
the benefits and then the concord prison
experiment

4460
01:18:51,110 --> 01:18:51,120
experiment
 

4461
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:54,709
experiment
it turned out that um tim had fudged the

4462
01:18:54,709 --> 01:18:54,719
it turned out that um tim had fudged the
 

4463
01:18:54,719 --> 01:18:55,189
it turned out that um tim had fudged the
data

4464
01:18:55,189 --> 01:18:55,199
data
 

4465
01:18:55,199 --> 01:18:56,950
data
completely and it wasn't really

4466
01:18:56,950 --> 01:18:56,960
completely and it wasn't really
 

4467
01:18:56,960 --> 01:18:58,550
completely and it wasn't really
successful so

4468
01:18:58,550 --> 01:18:58,560
successful so
 

4469
01:18:58,560 --> 01:19:00,870
successful so
i i fought him for that the outside

4470
01:19:00,870 --> 01:19:00,880
i i fought him for that the outside
 

4471
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:02,229
i i fought him for that the outside
world was doing the opposite

4472
01:19:02,229 --> 01:19:02,239
world was doing the opposite
 

4473
01:19:02,239 --> 01:19:05,189
world was doing the opposite
it was exaggerating the risks and

4474
01:19:05,189 --> 01:19:05,199
it was exaggerating the risks and
 

4475
01:19:05,199 --> 01:19:07,510
it was exaggerating the risks and
blocking resources he felt justified

4476
01:19:07,510 --> 01:19:07,520
blocking resources he felt justified
 

4477
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:09,590
blocking resources he felt justified
to fudge the data yeah because the

4478
01:19:09,590 --> 01:19:09,600
to fudge the data yeah because the
 

4479
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:10,950
to fudge the data yeah because the
outside world was

4480
01:19:10,950 --> 01:19:10,960
outside world was
 

4481
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:13,350
outside world was
fudging in a sense the the response to

4482
01:19:13,350 --> 01:19:13,360
fudging in a sense the the response to
 

4483
01:19:13,360 --> 01:19:14,310
fudging in a sense the the response to
the yeah

4484
01:19:14,310 --> 01:19:14,320
the yeah
 

4485
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:17,910
the yeah
yeah exactly yeah so so that

4486
01:19:17,910 --> 01:19:17,920
yeah exactly yeah so so that
 

4487
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:21,669
yeah exactly yeah so so that
that presents a very nice context um

4488
01:19:21,669 --> 01:19:21,679
that presents a very nice context um
 

4489

4687
01:22:49,199 --> 01:22:51,189
realized this whole new thing about the
heil hitler salute and

4688
01:22:51,189 --> 01:22:51,199
heil hitler salute and
 

4689
01:22:51,199 --> 01:22:53,189
heil hitler salute and
you know he would like push energy out

4690
01:22:53,189 --> 01:22:53,199
you know he would like push energy out
 

4691
01:22:53,199 --> 01:22:54,790
you know he would like push energy out
and then everybody would do the salute

4692
01:22:54,790 --> 01:22:54,800
and then everybody would do the salute
 

4693
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:56,709
and then everybody would do the salute
back to him and so it's like the one to

4694
01:22:56,709 --> 01:22:56,719
back to him and so it's like the one to
 

4695
01:22:56,719 --> 01:22:58,470
back to him and so it's like the one to
the many and the many to the one giving

4696
01:22:58,470 --> 01:22:58,480
the many and the many to the one giving
 

4697
01:22:58,480 --> 01:22:59,990
the many and the many to the one giving
all these people giving away their power

4698
01:22:59,990 --> 01:23:00,000
all these people giving away their power
 

4699
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:01,750
all these people giving away their power
and then how it would just sort of

4700
01:23:01,750 --> 01:23:01,760
and then how it would just sort of
 

4701
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:03,510
and then how it would just sort of
ratchet up in intensity like these

4702
01:23:03,510 --> 01:23:03,520
ratchet up in intensity like these
 

4703
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:04,870
ratchet up in intensity like these

where
 

5093
01:29:20,639 --> 01:29:22,149
where
maybe more people are going to gravitate

stories coming out that would change
 

5101
01:29:28,080 --> 01:29:30,470
stories coming out that would change
that so maps does the psychedelic harm

5102
01:29:30,470 --> 01:29:30,480
that so maps does the psychedelic harm
 

5103
01:29:30,480 --> 01:29:31,430
that so maps does the psychedelic harm
reduction we do

5104
01:29:31,430 --> 01:29:31,440
reduction we do

that's what you and i are doing right
 

5109
01:29:34,719 --> 01:29:36,950
that's what you and i are doing right
now we're doing that now

5110
01:29:36,950 --> 01:29:36,960
now we're doing that now
 

5111
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:40,149
now we're doing that now
so but and but also research towards

5112
01:29:40,149 --> 01:29:40,159
so but and but also research towards
 

5113
01:29:40,159 --> 01:29:42,070
so but and but also research towards
well the research now is done in the

5114
01:29:42,070 --> 01:29:42,080
well the research now is done in the
 

5115
01:29:42,080 --> 01:29:43,669
well the research now is done in the
benefit corp in the benefit

5116
01:29:43,669 --> 01:29:43,679
benefit corp in the benefit
 

5117
01:29:43,679 --> 01:29:45,510
benefit corp in the benefit
yeah so so what happens is people donate

5118
01:29:45,510 --> 01:29:45,520
yeah so so what happens is people donate
 

5119
01:29:45,520 --> 01:29:47,189
yeah so so what happens is people donate
to maps get a tax deduction

5120
01:29:47,189 --> 01:29:47,199
to maps get a tax deduction
 

5121
01:29:47,199 --> 01:29:48,870
to maps get a tax deduction
maps transfers the money or you could

5122
01:29:48,870 --> 01:29:48,880
maps transfers the money or you could
 

5123
01:29:48,880 --> 01:29:50,709
maps transfers the money or you could
say invests in the benefit corp

5124
01:29:50,709 --> 01:29:50,719
say invests in the benefit corp
 

5125
01:29:50,719 --> 01:29:52,390
say invests in the benefit corp
yes the benefit corp will do the

5126
01:29:52,390 --> 01:29:52,400
yes the benefit corp will do the
 

5127
01:29:52,400 --> 01:29:53,910
yes the benefit corp will do the
research and then

5128
01:29:53,910 --> 01:29:53,920
research and then
 

5129
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:56,229
research and then
maps is the sponsor but then we will

5130
01:29:56,229 --> 01:29:56,239
maps is the sponsor but then we will
 

5131
01:29:56,239 --> 01:29:58,070
maps is the sponsor but then we will
license the sale of mdma to the benefit

5132
01:29:58,070 --> 01:29:58,080
license the sale of mdma to the benefit
 

5133
01:29:58,080 --> 01:29:58,709

corp so

5134
01:29:58,709 --> 01:29:58,719
corp so
 

5135
01:29:58,719 --> 01:30:00,550
corp so
got it but but the research had done

5136
01:30:00,550 --> 01:30:00,560
got it but but the research had done
 

5137
01:30:00,560 --> 01:30:02,390
got it but but the research had done
with an eye towards creating something

with an eye towards creating something
that has a big impact versus just

5140
01:30:04,070 --> 01:30:04,080
that has a big impact versus just
 

5141
01:30:04,080 --> 01:30:06,070
that has a big impact versus just
research for knowledge sake

5142
01:30:06,070 --> 01:30:06,080
research for knowledge sake
 

5143
01:30:06,080 --> 01:30:09,350
research for knowledge sake
yeah yeah because um

5144
01:30:09,350 --> 01:30:09,360
yeah yeah because um
 

5145
01:30:09,360 --> 01:30:12,229

the brain is the most
 

5153
01:30:17,280 --> 01:30:19,350
the brain is the most
uh complex thing we know in the in the

5154
01:30:19,350 --> 01:30:19,360
uh complex thing we know in the in the
 

5155
01:30:19,360 --> 01:30:20,950
uh complex thing we know in the in the
universe

what is the extents of our brain

5168
01:30:30,790 --> 01:30:30,800
what is the extents of our brain
 

5169
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:31,990
what is the extents of our brain
you know how does the brain actually

5170
01:30:31,990 --> 01:30:32,000
you know how does the brain actually
 

5171
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:33,669
you know how does the brain actually
work do you ask chemistry questions you

5172
01:30:33,669 --> 01:30:33,679
work do you ask chemistry questions you
 

5173
01:30:33,679 --> 01:30:34,550
work do you ask chemistry questions you
know so

5174
01:30:34,550 --> 01:30:34,560
know so
 

5175
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:36,470
know so
if it's just the pursuit of knowledge

that is an endless thing and how does

5178
01:30:38,390 --> 01:30:38,400
that is an endless thing and how does
 

5179
01:30:38,400 --> 01:30:40,149
that is an endless thing and how does
that end the drug war how does that help

5180
01:30:40,149 --> 01:30:40,159

let me ask another question
to further answer the so so that's where

5244
01:31:48,070 --> 01:31:48,080
to further answer the so so that's where
 

5245
01:31:48,080 --> 01:31:49,669
to further answer the so so that's where
the drug policy arm comes in

5246
01:31:49,669 --> 01:31:49,679
the drug policy arm comes in
 

5247
01:31:49,679 --> 01:31:52,070
the drug policy arm comes in
the drug policy reform so you should be

5248
01:31:52,070 --> 01:31:52,080
the drug policy reform so you should be
 

5249
01:31:52,080 --> 01:31:53,350
the drug policy reform so you should be
able to get

5250
01:31:53,350 --> 01:31:53,360
able to get
 

5251
01:31:53,360 --> 01:31:55,030
able to get
access to psychedelics for your own

5252
01:31:55,030 --> 01:31:55,040
access to psychedelics for your own
 

5253
01:31:55,040 --> 01:31:57,669
access to psychedelics for your own
personal growth yes but that's not

5254
01:31:57,669 --> 01:31:57,679
personal growth yes but that's not
 

5255
01:31:57,679 --> 01:32:00,790
personal growth yes but that's not
medicine so that's why we need

5256
01:32:00,790 --> 01:32:00,800
medicine so that's why we need
 

5257
01:32:00,800 --> 01:32:03,350
medicine so that's why we need
to medicalize to have things covered by

5258
01:32:03,350 --> 01:32:03,360
to medicalize to have things covered by
 

5259
01:32:03,360 --> 01:32:04,550
to medicalize to have things covered by
insurance

5260
01:32:04,550 --> 01:32:04,560
insurance
 

5261
01:32:04,560 --> 01:32:06,470
insurance
to change people's attitudes the public

5262
01:32:06,470 --> 01:32:06,480
to change people's attitudes the public
 

5263
01:32:06,480 --> 01:32:08,229
to change people's attitudes the public
attitudes and then

5264
01:32:08,229 --> 01:32:08,239
attitudes and then
 

5265
01:32:08,239 --> 01:32:11,030
attitudes and then
we get this subsequent drug policy

5266
01:32:11,030 --> 01:32:11,040
we get this subsequent drug policy
 

5267
01:32:11,040 --> 01:32:11,669
we get this subsequent drug policy
reform

5268
01:32:11,669 --> 01:32:11,679
reform
 

5269
01:32:11,679 --> 01:32:13,189
reform
and and we're talking about it in terms

5270
01:32:13,189 --> 01:32:13,199
and and we're talking about it in terms
 

5271
01:32:13,199 --> 01:32:15,350
and and we're talking about it in terms
of licensed legalization so my view is

5272
01:32:15,350 --> 01:32:15,360
of licensed legalization so my view is
 

5273
01:32:15,360 --> 01:32:17,110
of licensed legalization so my view is
you should get a license to

5274
01:32:17,110 --> 01:32:17,120
you should get a license to
 

5275
01:32:17,120 --> 01:32:18,870
you should get a license to
do psychedelics you get a little

5276
01:32:18,870 --> 01:32:18,880
do psychedelics you get a little
 

5277
01:32:18,880 --> 01:32:20,470
do psychedelics you get a little
education stuff and then then you should

5278
01:32:20,470 --> 01:32:20,480
education stuff and then then you should
 

5279
01:32:20,480 --> 01:32:21,830
education stuff and then then you should
be able to buy it and do it on your own

5280
01:32:21,830 --> 01:32:21,840
be able to buy it and do it on your own
 

5281
01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:23,350
be able to buy it and do it on your own
so let me rephrase the question

5282
01:32:23,350 --> 01:32:23,360

5283
01:32:23,360 --> 01:32:26,070
so let me rephrase the question
more specifically so when can i if i

5284
01:32:26,070 --> 01:32:26,080
more specifically so when can i if i
 

5285

01:33:28,560 --> 01:33:30,470
insurance they have to be a little bit
careful about malpractice if they're

5350
01:33:30,470 --> 01:33:30,480
careful about malpractice if they're
 

5351
01:33:30,480 --> 01:33:33,750
careful about malpractice if they're
but i think the end of 2023 is when

5352
01:33:33,750 --> 01:33:33,760
but i think the end of 2023 is when
 

5353
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:35,510
but i think the end of 2023 is when
you will be able to do that now there's

5354
01:33:35,510 --> 01:33:35,520
you will be able to do that now there's
 

5355
01:33:35,520 --> 01:33:37,430
you will be able to do that now there's
actually another program

5356
01:33:37,430 --> 01:33:37,440
actually another program
 

5357
01:33:37,440 --> 01:33:40,310
actually another program
very limited called expanded access

5358
01:33:40,310 --> 01:33:40,320
very limited called expanded access
 

5359
01:33:40,320 --> 01:33:42,550
very limited called expanded access
which is compassionate use

5360
01:33:42,550 --> 01:33:42,560
which is compassionate use
 

5361
01:33:42,560 --> 01:33:44,390
which is compassionate use
which means that and we have approval

5362
01:33:44,390 --> 01:33:44,400
which means that and we have approval
 

5363
01:33:44,400 --> 01:33:45,590
which means that and we have approval
for 50 people

5364
01:33:45,590 --> 01:33:45,600
for 50 people
 

5365
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:47,510
for 50 people
for compassionate use right now we think

5366
01:33:47,510 --> 01:33:47,520
for compassionate use right now we think
 

5367
01:33:47,520 --> 01:33:48,950
for compassionate use right now we think
that'll grow

5368
01:33:48,950 --> 01:33:48,960
that'll grow
 

5369
01:33:48,960 --> 01:33:50,790
that'll grow
so that's going to open up in about two

5370
01:33:50,790 --> 01:33:50,800
so that's going to open up in about two
 

5371
01:33:50,800 --> 01:33:52,470
so that's going to open up in about two
months and so those are

5372
01:33:52,470 --> 01:33:52,480
months and so those are
 

5373
01:33:52,480 --> 01:33:54,070
months and so those are
people with ptsd they have to be

5374
01:33:54,070 --> 01:33:54,080
people with ptsd they have to be
 

5375

people with ptsd they have to be
treatment resistant nothing has worked

5376
01:33:55,669 --> 01:33:55,679
treatment resistant nothing has worked
 

5377
01:33:55,679 --> 01:33:56,790
treatment resistant nothing has worked
for them and they can

5378
01:33:56,790 --> 01:33:56,800
for them and they can
 

5379
01:33:56,800 --> 01:33:59,510
for them and they can
access mdma while we're doing the phase

5380
01:33:59,510 --> 01:33:59,520
access mdma while we're doing the phase
 

5381
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:00,629
access mdma while we're doing the phase
three studies

5382
01:34:00,629 --> 01:34:00,639
three studies
 

5383
01:34:00,639 --> 01:34:03,030
three studies
wow and but they have to pay for it

5384
01:34:03,030 --> 01:34:03,040
wow and but they have to pay for it
 

5385
01:34:03,040 --> 01:34:04,229
wow and but they have to pay for it
themselves we're not

01:34:05,669 --> 01:34:05,679
the sponsor has to pay for all the
 

5389
01:34:05,679 --> 01:34:08,149
the sponsor has to pay for all the
research but expanded access

5390
01:34:08,149 --> 01:34:08,159
research but expanded access
 

5391
01:34:08,159 --> 01:34:09,750
research but expanded access
because there's no control group

5392
01:34:09,750 --> 01:34:09,760
because there's no control group
 

5393
01:34:09,760 --> 01:34:11,590
because there's no control group

think that'll start in a couple months
 

5399
01:34:15,360 --> 01:34:17,110
think that'll start in a couple months
but it's very limited it's limited to

certain cities there's also a program
 

5403
01:34:18,719 --> 01:34:20,470
certain cities there's also a program
called right to try

5404
01:34:20,470 --> 01:34:20,480
called right to try

psilocybin
for life-threatening illness because

for life-threatening illness because
 

5431
01:34:44,719 --> 01:34:46,470
for life-threatening illness because
there has been studies with psilocybin

5432

there has been studies with psilocybin
 

5433

01:35:01,990 --> 01:35:02,000
drugs somewhere when will that happen
 

5449
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:03,910
drugs somewhere when will that happen
you know we already are starting to see

5450
01:35:03,910 --> 01:35:03,920
you know we already are starting to see
 

5451
01:35:03,920 --> 01:35:06,629
you know we already are starting to see
the decriminalization in certain areas

5452
01:35:06,629 --> 01:35:06,639
the decriminalization in certain areas
 

5453
01:35:06,639 --> 01:35:09,189
the decriminalization in certain areas
of plants psychedelics

5454
01:35:09,189 --> 01:35:09,199
of plants psychedelics
 

5455
01:35:09,199 --> 01:35:12,070
of plants psychedelics
and we see overall drug drug crim like

5456
01:35:12,070 --> 01:35:12,080
and we see overall drug drug crim like
 

5457
01:35:12,080 --> 01:35:13,430
and we see overall drug drug crim like
that passed in oregon

5458
01:35:13,430 --> 01:35:13,440
that passed in oregon
 

5459
01:35:13,440 --> 01:35:15,990
that passed in oregon
so that any drug is now it's not legal

5460
01:35:15,990 --> 01:35:16,000
so that any drug is now it's not legal
 

5461
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:16,629
so that any drug is now it's not legal
you can't

5462
01:35:16,629 --> 01:35:16,639
you can't
 

5463
01:35:16,639 --> 01:35:19,830
you can't
really fully set up clinics to

5464
01:35:19,830 --> 01:35:19,840
really fully set up clinics to
 

5465
01:35:19,840 --> 01:35:21,669
really fully set up clinics to
offer it to people or there's no legal

5466
01:35:21,669 --> 01:35:21,679
offer it to people or there's no legal
 

5467
01:35:21,679 --> 01:35:23,189
offer it to people or there's no legal
supply like that but

5468
01:35:23,189 --> 01:35:23,199
supply like that but
 

5469
01:35:23,199 --> 01:35:25,350
supply like that but
it's decriminalized so my sense of

5470
01:35:25,350 --> 01:35:25,360
it's decriminalized so my sense of
 

5471
01:35:25,360 --> 01:35:27,590
it's decriminalized so my sense of
things is based a lot on watching what

5472
01:35:27,590 --> 01:35:27,600
things is based a lot on watching what
 

5473
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:29,030
things is based a lot on watching what
happened with medical marijuana and

5474
01:35:29,030 --> 01:35:29,040
happened with medical marijuana and
 

5475
01:35:29,040 --> 01:35:30,709
happened with medical marijuana and
marijuana legalization so we're sitting

5476
01:35:30,709 --> 01:35:30,719
marijuana legalization so we're sitting
 

5477
01:35:30,719 --> 01:35:32,470
marijuana legalization so we're sitting
here in massachusetts where marijuana is

5478
01:35:32,470 --> 01:35:32,480
here in massachusetts where marijuana is
 

5479
01:35:32,480 --> 01:35:33,590
here in massachusetts where marijuana is
legal

5480
01:35:33,590 --> 01:35:33,600
legal
 

5481
01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:35,189
legal
but what happened first was medical

5482
01:35:35,189 --> 01:35:35,199
but what happened first was medical
 

5483
01:35:35,199 --> 01:35:36,870
but what happened first was medical
marijuana so

5484
01:35:36,870 --> 01:35:36,880
marijuana so
 

5485
01:35:36,880 --> 01:35:40,070
marijuana so
what we see is that medicalization

5486
01:35:40,070 --> 01:35:40,080
what we see is that medicalization
 

5487
01:35:40,080 --> 01:35:42,470
what we see is that medicalization
by demonstrating that under certain

5488
01:35:42,470 --> 01:35:42,480
by demonstrating that under certain
 

5489
01:35:42,480 --> 01:35:45,189
by demonstrating that under certain
contexts the risks are

5490
01:35:45,189 --> 01:35:45,199
contexts the risks are
 

5491
01:35:45,199 --> 01:35:48,149
contexts the risks are
much less than the benefits and then

5492
01:35:48,149 --> 01:35:48,159
much less than the benefits and then
 

5493
01:35:48,159 --> 01:35:49,270
much less than the benefits and then
there are benefits

5494
01:35:49,270 --> 01:35:49,280
there are benefits
 

5495
01:35:49,280 --> 01:35:51,109
there are benefits
and then people hear stories about

5496
01:35:51,109 --> 01:35:51,119
and then people hear stories about
 

5497
01:35:51,119 --> 01:35:52,950
and then people hear stories about
people that gotten better

5498
01:35:52,950 --> 01:35:52,960
people that gotten better
 

5499
01:35:52,960 --> 01:35:54,709
people that gotten better
and then that changes their minds then

5500
01:35:54,709 --> 01:35:54,719
and then that changes their minds then
 

5501
01:35:54,719 --> 01:35:56,070
and then that changes their minds then
eventually that builds up to

5502
01:35:56,070 --> 01:35:56,080
eventually that builds up to
 

5503
01:35:56,080 --> 01:35:57,590
eventually that builds up to
why are we throwing people in jail

5504
01:35:57,590 --> 01:35:57,600
why are we throwing people in jail
 

5505
01:35:57,600 --> 01:35:59,109
why are we throwing people in jail
shifts to culture yeah

5506
01:35:59,109 --> 01:35:59,119
shifts to culture yeah
 

5507
01:35:59,119 --> 01:36:01,109
shifts to culture yeah
yeah so i think that what we're going to

5508
01:36:01,109 --> 01:36:01,119
yeah so i think that what we're going to
 

5509
01:36:01,119 --> 01:36:02,550
yeah so i think that what we're going to

in 2035
 

5555
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:46,550
in 2035
is when i think that we will move to

5556
01:36:46,550 --> 01:36:46,560
is when i think that we will move to
 

5557
01:36:46,560 --> 01:36:48,390
is when i think that we will move to
licensed legalization

5558
01:36:48,390 --> 01:36:48,400
licensed legalization
 

5559
01:36:48,400 --> 01:36:50,550
licensed legalization
which is when you will have the option

5560
01:36:50,550 --> 01:36:50,560
which is when you will have the option
 

5561
01:36:50,560 --> 01:36:53,030
which is when you will have the option
of just going somewhere

5562
01:36:53,030 --> 01:36:53,040
of just going somewhere
 

5563
01:36:53,040 --> 01:36:55,350
of just going somewhere
once you've done this educational stuff

5564
01:36:55,350 --> 01:36:55,360
once you've done this educational stuff
 

5565
01:36:55,360 --> 01:36:56,070
once you've done this educational stuff
potentially

5566
01:36:56,070 --> 01:36:56,080
potentially
 

5567
01:36:56,080 --> 01:36:58,870
potentially
i also think it would be better to have

5568
01:36:58,870 --> 01:36:58,880
i also think it would be better to have
 

5569
01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:00,550
i also think it would be better to have
the opportunity for people to go

5570
01:37:00,550 --> 01:37:00,560
the opportunity for people to go
 

5571
01:37:00,560 --> 01:37:03,750
the opportunity for people to go
for free paid for by tax money to these

5572
01:37:03,750 --> 01:37:03,760
for free paid for by tax money to these
 

5573
01:37:03,760 --> 01:37:05,189
for free paid for by tax money to these
clinics and you have your first

5574
01:37:05,189 --> 01:37:05,199
clinics and you have your first
 

5575
01:37:05,199 --> 01:37:06,629
clinics and you have your first
experience with psychedelics under

5576
01:37:06,629 --> 01:37:06,639
experience with psychedelics under
 

5577
01:37:06,639 --> 01:37:07,990
experience with psychedelics under
supervision

5578
01:37:07,990 --> 01:37:08,000
supervision
 

5579
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:09,669
supervision
and you know what you're getting into

5580
01:37:09,669 --> 01:37:09,679
and you know what you're getting into
 

5581
01:37:09,679 --> 01:37:11,750
and you know what you're getting into
you've you know

5582
01:37:11,750 --> 01:37:11,760
you've you know
 

5583
01:37:11,760 --> 01:37:13,430
you've you know
to ask the questionnaire what the risks

5584
01:37:13,430 --> 01:37:13,440
to ask the questionnaire what the risks
 

5585
01:37:13,440 --> 01:37:14,550
to ask the questionnaire what the risks
are with the drugs then you get your

5586
01:37:14,550 --> 01:37:14,560
are with the drugs then you get your
 

5587
01:37:14,560 --> 01:37:15,669
are with the drugs then you get your
license

5588
01:37:15,669 --> 01:37:15,679
license
 

5589
01:37:15,679 --> 01:37:17,910
license
so 2035 is when i think that'll happen

5590
01:37:17,910 --> 01:37:17,920
so 2035 is when i think that'll happen
 

5591
01:37:17,920 --> 01:37:19,669
so 2035 is when i think that'll happen
and the clinics will be sites of these

5592
01:37:19,669 --> 01:37:19,679
and the clinics will be sites of these
 

5593
01:37:19,679 --> 01:37:20,870
and the clinics will be sites of these
initiations

5594
01:37:20,870 --> 01:37:20,880
initiations
 

5595
01:37:20,880 --> 01:37:23,189
initiations
yes and so be a safe environment just

5596
01:37:23,189 --> 01:37:23,199
yes and so be a safe environment just
 

5597
01:37:23,199 --> 01:37:24,550
yes and so be a safe environment just
like you said all the things that are

5598
01:37:24,550 --> 01:37:24,560
like you said all the things that are
 

5599
01:37:24,560 --> 01:37:25,590
like you said all the things that are
actually

5600
01:37:25,590 --> 01:37:25,600
actually
 

5601
01:37:25,600 --> 01:37:27,750
actually
uh maximize the likelihood of a pleasant

5602
01:37:27,750 --> 01:37:27,760
uh maximize the likelihood of a pleasant
 

5603
01:37:27,760 --> 01:37:30,070
uh maximize the likelihood of a pleasant
experience and all those kinds of things

5604
01:37:30,070 --> 01:37:30,080
experience and all those kinds of things
 

5605
01:37:30,080 --> 01:37:32,950
experience and all those kinds of things
it is a frustratingly slow process and

5606
01:37:32,950 --> 01:37:32,960
it is a frustratingly slow process and
 

5607
01:37:32,960 --> 01:37:33,189
it is a frustratingly slow process and
the

5608
01:37:33,189 --> 01:37:33,199
the
 

5609
01:37:33,199 --> 01:37:35,750
the
fda being part of that process is very

5610
01:37:35,750 --> 01:37:35,760
fda being part of that process is very
 

5611
01:37:35,760 --> 01:37:37,430
fda being part of that process is very
frustrating that

5612
01:37:37,430 --> 01:37:37,440
frustrating that
 

5613
01:37:37,440 --> 01:37:40,470
frustrating that
of course there's there's benefits but

5614
01:37:40,470 --> 01:37:40,480
of course there's there's benefits but
 

5615
01:37:40,480 --> 01:37:42,950
of course there's there's benefits but
uh boy well i wish you could move a lot

5616
01:37:42,950 --> 01:37:42,960
uh boy well i wish you could move a lot
 

5617
01:37:42,960 --> 01:37:43,910
uh boy well i wish you could move a lot
faster

5618
01:37:43,910 --> 01:37:43,920
faster
 

5619
01:37:43,920 --> 01:37:45,750
faster
yeah well one thing that i've learned

5620
01:37:45,750 --> 01:37:45,760
yeah well one thing that i've learned
 

5621
01:37:45,760 --> 01:37:49,669
yeah well one thing that i've learned
from being a parent

5622
01:37:49,669 --> 01:37:49,679
from being a parent
 

5623
01:37:49,679 --> 01:37:52,709
from being a parent
is that when you have little kids it

5624
01:37:52,709 --> 01:37:52,719
is that when you have little kids it
 

5625
01:37:52,719 --> 01:37:55,270
is that when you have little kids it
seems like they'll be with you forever

5626
01:37:55,270 --> 01:37:55,280
seems like they'll be with you forever
 

5627
01:37:55,280 --> 01:37:57,590
seems like they'll be with you forever
but then when they grow up and they go

5628
01:37:57,590 --> 01:37:57,600
but then when they grow up and they go
 

5629
01:37:57,600 --> 01:37:59,350
but then when they grow up and they go
to college and they leave you look back

5630
01:37:59,350 --> 01:37:59,360
to college and they leave you look back
 

5631
01:37:59,360 --> 01:38:00,629
to college and they leave you look back
and like where did that

5632
01:38:00,629 --> 01:38:00,639
and like where did that
 

5633
01:38:00,639 --> 01:38:03,669
and like where did that
20 years ago you know so

5634
01:38:03,669 --> 01:38:03,679
20 years ago you know so
 

5635
01:38:03,679 --> 01:38:05,189
20 years ago you know so
we're still dealing with the legacy of

5636
01:38:05,189 --> 01:38:05,199
we're still dealing with the legacy of
 

5637
01:38:05,199 --> 01:38:07,350
we're still dealing with the legacy of
the civil war and slavery in america

5638
01:38:07,350 --> 01:38:07,360
the civil war and slavery in america
 

5639
01:38:07,360 --> 01:38:10,629
the civil war and slavery in america
yeah so actually a 20-year plan is not

5640
01:38:10,629 --> 01:38:10,639
yeah so actually a 20-year plan is not
 

5641
01:38:10,639 --> 01:38:11,510
yeah so actually a 20-year plan is not
that long

5642
01:38:11,510 --> 01:38:11,520
that long
 

5643
01:38:11,520 --> 01:38:14,790
that long
so while we say um

5644
01:38:14,790 --> 01:38:14,800
so while we say um
 

5645
01:38:14,800 --> 01:38:17,430
so while we say um
it's frustratingly slow and it is you

5646
01:38:17,430 --> 01:38:17,440
it's frustratingly slow and it is you
 

5647
01:38:17,440 --> 01:38:19,350
it's frustratingly slow and it is you
know i mean it's 50 years

01:38:41,910 --> 01:38:41,920
that mdma
 

5671
01:38:41,920 --> 01:38:43,669
that mdma
stay in schedule three it's it's

5672
01:38:43,669 --> 01:38:43,679
stay in schedule three it's it's
 

5673
01:38:43,679 --> 01:38:45,270
stay in schedule three it's it's
tremendously sad

5674
01:38:45,270 --> 01:38:45,280
tremendously sad
 

5675
01:38:45,280 --> 01:38:48,390
tremendously sad
at the same time culture evolves slowly

5676
01:38:48,390 --> 01:38:48,400
at the same time culture evolves slowly
 

5677
01:38:48,400 --> 01:38:49,830
at the same time culture evolves slowly
you know you read the bible or you read

5678
01:38:49,830 --> 01:38:49,840
you know you read the bible or you read
 

5679
01:38:49,840 --> 01:38:51,030
you know you read the bible or you read
all the stuff we're not that different

5680
01:38:51,030 --> 01:38:51,040
all the stuff we're not that different
 

5681
01:38:51,040 --> 01:38:53,189
all the stuff we're not that different
from people thousands of years ago

5682
01:38:53,189 --> 01:38:53,199
from people thousands of years ago
 

5683
01:38:53,199 --> 01:38:56,229
from people thousands of years ago
so how are we going to really evolve

5684
01:38:56,229 --> 01:38:56,239
so how are we going to really evolve
 

5685
01:38:56,239 --> 01:38:58,470
so how are we going to really evolve
enough over the next couple decades so

5686
01:38:58,470 --> 01:38:58,480
enough over the next couple decades so
 

5687
01:38:58,480 --> 01:38:59,990
enough over the next couple decades so
we don't destroy the planet and don't

5688
01:38:59,990 --> 01:39:00,000
we don't destroy the planet and don't
 

5689
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:01,350
we don't destroy the planet and don't
kill each other

5690
01:39:01,350 --> 01:39:01,360
kill each other
 

5691
01:39:01,360 --> 01:39:03,910
kill each other
that's why i think psychedelics have an

5692
01:39:03,910 --> 01:39:03,920
that's why i think psychedelics have an
 

5693
01:39:03,920 --> 01:39:05,109
that's why i think psychedelics have an
important role to play

5694
01:39:05,109 --> 01:39:05,119
important role to play
 

5695
01:39:05,119 --> 01:39:06,470
important role to play
that's why i've devoted my life to

5696
01:39:06,470 --> 01:39:06,480
that's why i've devoted my life to
 

5697
01:39:06,480 --> 01:39:09,030
that's why i've devoted my life to
psychedelics and it is frustratingly

5698
01:39:09,030 --> 01:39:09,040
psychedelics and it is frustratingly
 

5699
01:39:09,040 --> 01:39:09,590
psychedelics and it is frustratingly
slow

5700
01:39:09,590 --> 01:39:09,600
slow
 

5701
01:39:09,600 --> 01:39:12,950
slow
and what i said to myself is our whole

5702
01:39:12,950 --> 01:39:12,960
and what i said to myself is our whole
 

5703

effort has not been fast enough can we

5704
01:39:15,510 --> 01:39:15,520
effort has not been fast enough can we
 

5705
01:39:15,520 --> 01:39:18,550
effort has not been fast enough can we
talk a little bit about ptsd and mdma

5706
01:39:18,550 --> 01:39:18,560
talk a little bit about ptsd and mdma
 

5707
01:39:18,560 --> 01:39:21,910
talk a little bit about ptsd and mdma
there's this fascinating uh paper

5708
01:39:21,910 --> 01:39:21,920
there's this fascinating uh paper
 

5709
01:39:21,920 --> 01:39:25,030
there's this fascinating uh paper
came out on a fascinating study that

5710
01:39:25,030 --> 01:39:25,040
came out on a fascinating study that
 

5711
01:39:25,040 --> 01:39:26,390
came out on a fascinating study that
you're a part of

5712

you're a part of
 

5713
01:39:26,400 --> 01:39:28,310
you're a part of
that's a phase three study can you

5714
01:39:28,310 --> 01:39:28,320
that's a phase three study can you
 

5715
01:39:28,320 --> 01:39:29,669
that's a phase three study can you
describe what the study is can you

5716
01:39:29,669 --> 01:39:29,679
describe what the study is can you
 

5717
01:39:29,679 --> 01:39:31,669
describe what the study is can you
describe what phase three means

5718
01:39:31,669 --> 01:39:31,679
describe what phase three means
 

5719
01:39:31,679 --> 01:39:34,709
describe what phase three means
can you describe um what the findings

5720
01:39:34,709 --> 01:39:34,719
can you describe um what the findings
 

5721
01:39:34,719 --> 01:39:35,990
can you describe um what the findings
are and why it's

5722
01:39:35,990 --> 01:39:36,000
are and why it's
 

5723
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:39,109
are and why it's
in fact so important and impactful yeah

5724
01:39:39,109 --> 01:39:39,119
in fact so important and impactful yeah
 

5725
01:39:39,119 --> 01:39:41,189
in fact so important and impactful yeah
this study came out may 10th in nature

5726
01:39:41,189 --> 01:39:41,199
this study came out may 10th in nature

medicine

5728
01:39:41,750 --> 01:39:41,760
medicine
 

5729
01:39:41,760 --> 01:39:43,830
medicine
so one of the highest impact factors in

5730
01:39:43,830 --> 01:39:43,840
so one of the highest impact factors in
 

5731
01:39:43,840 --> 01:39:46,149
so one of the highest impact factors in
medicine journals it was tremendous

5732
01:39:46,149 --> 01:39:46,159
medicine journals it was tremendous
 

5733
01:39:46,159 --> 01:39:48,950
medicine journals it was tremendous
so to make a drug into a medicine the

5734
01:39:48,950 --> 01:39:48,960
so to make a drug into a medicine the
 

5735
01:39:48,960 --> 01:39:50,229
so to make a drug into a medicine the
first thing you need to do

5736
01:39:50,229 --> 01:39:50,239
first thing you need to do
 

5737
01:39:50,239 --> 01:39:53,189
first thing you need to do
is what are called non-clinical or

5738
01:39:53,189 --> 01:39:53,199
is what are called non-clinical or
 

5739
01:39:53,199 --> 01:39:54,709
is what are called non-clinical or
pre-clinical studies meaning

5740
01:39:54,709 --> 01:39:54,719
pre-clinical studies meaning
 

5741
01:39:54,719 --> 01:39:57,430
pre-clinical studies meaning
safety established in animals what does

5742
01:39:57,430 --> 01:39:57,440
safety established in animals what does
 

5743
01:39:57,440 --> 01:39:58,310
safety established in animals what does
the drug do

5744
01:39:58,310 --> 01:39:58,320
the drug do
 

5745
01:39:58,320 --> 01:39:59,990
the drug do
what are the side effects in animals

5746
01:39:59,990 --> 01:40:00,000
what are the side effects in animals
 

5747
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:01,510
what are the side effects in animals
where do you see the risks and

5748
01:40:01,510 --> 01:40:01,520
where do you see the risks and
 

5749
01:40:01,520 --> 01:40:03,990
where do you see the risks and
then you negotiate with fda to do phase

5750
01:40:03,990 --> 01:40:04,000
then you negotiate with fda to do phase
 

5751
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:05,510
then you negotiate with fda to do phase
one studies

5752
01:40:05,510 --> 01:40:05,520
one studies
 

5753
01:40:05,520 --> 01:40:07,350
one studies
and phase one studies where you move

5754
01:40:07,350 --> 01:40:07,360
and phase one studies where you move
 

5755
01:40:07,360 --> 01:40:09,189
and phase one studies where you move
from animals to humans

5756
01:40:09,189 --> 01:40:09,199
from animals to humans
 

5757
01:40:09,199 --> 01:40:12,310
from animals to humans
and those are more safety studies and

5758
01:40:12,310 --> 01:40:12,320
and those are more safety studies and
 

5759
01:40:12,320 --> 01:40:14,550
and those are more safety studies and
trying to describe what the drug does so

5760
01:40:14,550 --> 01:40:14,560
trying to describe what the drug does so
 

5761
01:40:14,560 --> 01:40:15,590
trying to describe what the drug does so
that you can

5762
01:40:15,590 --> 01:40:15,600
that you can
 

5763
01:40:15,600 --> 01:40:17,510
that you can
determine if there is potential medical

5764
01:40:17,510 --> 01:40:17,520
determine if there is potential medical
 

5765
01:40:17,520 --> 01:40:19,189
determine if there is potential medical
value there

5766
01:40:19,189 --> 01:40:19,199
value there
 

5767
01:40:19,199 --> 01:40:22,709
value there
certain drugs like cancer drugs

5768
01:40:22,709 --> 01:40:22,719
certain drugs like cancer drugs
 

5769
01:40:22,719 --> 01:40:25,750
certain drugs like cancer drugs
are so toxic

5770
01:40:25,750 --> 01:40:25,760
are so toxic
 

5771
01:40:25,760 --> 01:40:29,030
are so toxic
that um you don't have phase one studies

5772
01:40:29,030 --> 01:40:29,040
that um you don't have phase one studies
 

5773
01:40:29,040 --> 01:40:30,550
that um you don't have phase one studies
in healthy volunteers

5774
01:40:30,550 --> 01:40:30,560
in healthy volunteers
 

5775
01:40:30,560 --> 01:40:33,270
in healthy volunteers
it's like phase one slash two where it's

5776
01:40:33,270 --> 01:40:33,280
it's like phase one slash two where it's
 

5777
01:40:33,280 --> 01:40:35,189
it's like phase one slash two where it's
you you bring in the patients

5778
01:40:35,189 --> 01:40:35,199
you you bring in the patients
 

5779
01:40:35,199 --> 01:40:36,709
you you bring in the patients
but you still are doing sort of dose

5780
01:40:36,709 --> 01:40:36,719
but you still are doing sort of dose
 

5781
01:40:36,719 --> 01:40:38,709
but you still are doing sort of dose
response safety studies

5782
01:40:38,709 --> 01:40:38,719
response safety studies
 

5783
01:40:38,719 --> 01:40:40,870
response safety studies
but you use patients but most phase 1

5784
01:40:40,870 --> 01:40:40,880
but you use patients but most phase 1
 

5785
01:40:40,880 --> 01:40:43,030
but you use patients but most phase 1
studies are healthy volunteers

5786
01:40:43,030 --> 01:40:43,040
studies are healthy volunteers
 

5787
01:40:43,040 --> 01:40:45,350
studies are healthy volunteers
phase 2 are where you start bringing in

5788
01:40:45,350 --> 01:40:45,360
phase 2 are where you start bringing in
 

5789
01:40:45,360 --> 01:40:46,790
phase 2 are where you start bringing in
the patients

5790
01:40:46,790 --> 01:40:46,800
the patients
 

5791
01:40:46,800 --> 01:40:49,189
the patients
and you start experimenting with various

5792
01:40:49,189 --> 01:40:49,199
and you start experimenting with various
 

5793
01:40:49,199 --> 01:40:49,990
and you start experimenting with various
different things the

5794
01:40:49,990 --> 01:40:50,000
different things the
 

5795
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,149
different things the
purpose of phase two is really just to

5796
01:40:52,149 --> 01:40:52,159
purpose of phase two is really just to
 

5797
01:40:52,159 --> 01:40:53,510
purpose of phase two is really just to
design phase three

5798
01:40:53,510 --> 01:40:53,520
design phase three
 

5799
01:40:53,520 --> 01:40:56,390
design phase three
now again i'm sort of putting out of the

5800
01:40:56,390 --> 01:40:56,400
now again i'm sort of putting out of the
 

5801
01:40:56,400 --> 01:40:58,149
now again i'm sort of putting out of the
picture in another area's mechanism of

5802
01:40:58,149 --> 01:40:58,159
picture in another area's mechanism of
 

5803
01:40:58,159 --> 01:40:59,990
picture in another area's mechanism of
action how do these drugs work

5804
01:40:59,990 --> 01:41:00,000
action how do these drugs work
 

5805
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:01,669
action how do these drugs work
phase two you're trying to figure out

5806
01:41:01,669 --> 01:41:01,679
phase two you're trying to figure out
 

5807
01:41:01,679 --> 01:41:04,229
phase two you're trying to figure out
what they do

5808
01:41:04,229 --> 01:41:04,239
what they do
 

5809
01:41:04,239 --> 01:41:06,149
what they do
who your patient population is what are

5810
01:41:06,149 --> 01:41:06,159
who your patient population is what are
 

5811
01:41:06,159 --> 01:41:07,270
who your patient population is what are
the risks who do you

5812
01:41:07,270 --> 01:41:07,280
the risks who do you
 

5813
01:41:07,280 --> 01:41:09,590
the risks who do you
include who do you exclude what are the

5814
01:41:09,590 --> 01:41:09,600
include who do you exclude what are the
 

5815
01:41:09,600 --> 01:41:11,669
include who do you exclude what are the
doses what is your treatment

5816
01:41:11,669 --> 01:41:11,679
doses what is your treatment
 

5817
01:41:11,679 --> 01:41:14,790
doses what is your treatment
what are your measures

5818
01:41:14,790 --> 01:41:14,800
what are your measures
 

5819
01:41:14,800 --> 01:41:17,990
what are your measures
in our case it was um you know how do

5820
01:41:17,990 --> 01:41:18,000
in our case it was um you know how do
 

5821
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:19,430
in our case it was um you know how do
you do a double blind study

5822
01:41:19,430 --> 01:41:19,440
you do a double blind study
 

5823
01:41:19,440 --> 01:41:21,750
you do a double blind study
that was a big part of phase two that's

5824
01:41:21,750 --> 01:41:21,760
that was a big part of phase two that's
 

5825
01:41:21,760 --> 01:41:23,030
that was a big part of phase two that's
a big challenge for

5826
01:41:23,030 --> 01:41:23,040
a big challenge for
 

5827
01:41:23,040 --> 01:41:24,950
a big challenge for
psychedelic drugs any kind of drugs that

5828
01:41:24,950 --> 01:41:24,960
psychedelic drugs any kind of drugs that
 

5829
01:41:24,960 --> 01:41:27,030
psychedelic drugs any kind of drugs that
have a real strong effect

5830
01:41:27,030 --> 01:41:27,040
have a real strong effect
 

5831
01:41:27,040 --> 01:41:28,390
have a real strong effect
you know how do you do a double blind

5832
01:41:28,390 --> 01:41:28,400
you know how do you do a double blind
 

5833
01:41:28,400 --> 01:41:30,310
you know how do you do a double blind
study a double blind side to interrupt

5834
01:41:30,310 --> 01:41:30,320
study a double blind side to interrupt
 

5835
01:41:30,320 --> 01:41:33,669
study a double blind side to interrupt
would mean that the patient should know

5836
01:41:33,669 --> 01:41:33,679
would mean that the patient should know
 

5837
01:41:33,679 --> 01:41:35,510
would mean that the patient should know
should not be aware whether it's a

5838
01:41:35,510 --> 01:41:35,520
should not be aware whether it's a
 

5839
01:41:35,520 --> 01:41:37,270
should not be aware whether it's a
placebo or not

5840
01:41:37,270 --> 01:41:37,280
placebo or not
 

5841
01:41:37,280 --> 01:41:39,189
placebo or not
and the research and the researcher does

5842
01:41:39,189 --> 01:41:39,199
and the research and the researcher does
 

5843
01:41:39,199 --> 01:41:40,390
and the research and the researcher does
not is not aware

5844
01:41:40,390 --> 01:41:40,400
not is not aware
 

5845
01:41:40,400 --> 01:41:42,470
not is not aware
and so for that lack of awareness when

5846
01:41:42,470 --> 01:41:42,480
and so for that lack of awareness when
 

5847
01:41:42,480 --> 01:41:43,830
and so for that lack of awareness when
the effect is really strong is very

5848
01:41:43,830 --> 01:41:43,840
the effect is really strong is very
 

5849
01:41:43,840 --> 01:41:45,430
the effect is really strong is very
difficult to do on both the researcher

5850
01:41:45,430 --> 01:41:45,440
difficult to do on both the researcher
 

5851
01:41:45,440 --> 01:41:45,990
difficult to do on both the researcher
and the patient

5852
01:41:45,990 --> 01:41:46,000
and the patient
 

5853
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,870
and the patient
side yes and sometimes fascinating they

5854
01:41:48,870 --> 01:41:48,880
side yes and sometimes fascinating they
 

5855
01:41:48,880 --> 01:41:50,470
side yes and sometimes fascinating they
talk about triple blind

5856
01:41:50,470 --> 01:41:50,480
talk about triple blind
 

5857
01:41:50,480 --> 01:41:52,709
talk about triple blind
so the other part is the raters that

5858
01:41:52,709 --> 01:41:52,719
so the other part is the raters that
 

5859
01:41:52,719 --> 01:41:54,470
so the other part is the raters that
evaluate the symptoms and

5860
01:41:54,470 --> 01:41:54,480
evaluate the symptoms and
 

5861
01:41:54,480 --> 01:41:56,390
evaluate the symptoms and
before and after so you ideally want

5862
01:41:56,390 --> 01:41:56,400
before and after so you ideally want
 

5863
01:41:56,400 --> 01:41:58,310
before and after so you ideally want
triple blind do you want the patients

5864
01:41:58,310 --> 01:41:58,320
triple blind do you want the patients
 

5865
01:41:58,320 --> 01:42:01,270
triple blind do you want the patients
the researchers and the evaluators of

01:42:01,270 --> 01:42:01,280
the researchers and the evaluators of
 

5867
01:42:01,280 --> 01:42:02,390
the researchers and the evaluators of
the outcomes

01:42:02,390 --> 01:42:02,400
the outcomes
 

5869
01:42:02,400 --> 01:42:05,189
the outcomes
all of them not to know what the drug

5870
01:42:05,189 --> 01:42:05,199
all of them not to know what the drug
 

5871
01:42:05,199 --> 01:42:06,629
all of them not to know what the drug
whether it was drug or placebo and

01:42:06,629 --> 01:42:06,639
whether it was drug or placebo and
 

5873
01:42:06,639 --> 01:42:07,510
whether it was drug or placebo and
that's to reduce

5874
01:42:07,510 --> 01:42:07,520
that's to reduce
 

5875
01:42:07,520 --> 01:42:11,189
that's to reduce
experiment or bias so

5876
01:42:11,189 --> 01:42:11,199
experiment or bias so
 

5877
01:42:11,199 --> 01:42:13,189
experiment or bias so
and then then you move to phase three

5878
01:42:13,189 --> 01:42:13,199
and then then you move to phase three
 

5879
01:42:13,199 --> 01:42:15,669
and then then you move to phase three
once you've figured out how to design

01:42:15,669 --> 01:42:15,679
once you've figured out how to design

criminalization of mdma in 85
 

5903
01:42:38,080 --> 01:42:40,149
criminalization of mdma in 85
we had five different protocols that

5904
01:42:40,149 --> 01:42:40,159
we had five different protocols that
 

5905
01:42:40,159 --> 01:42:42,629
we had five different protocols that
were rejected by the fda

5906
01:42:42,629 --> 01:42:42,639
were rejected by the fda
 

5907
01:42:42,639 --> 01:42:44,550
were rejected by the fda
for studying with mdma and these were

5908
01:42:44,550 --> 01:42:44,560
for studying with mdma and these were
 

5909
01:42:44,560 --> 01:42:46,950
for studying with mdma and these were
all various phase one studies

5910

all various phase one studies
 

5911
01:42:46,960 --> 01:42:48,629
all various phase one studies
they came from harvard from uc san

all over and they were all rejected 1992

5918
01:42:57,510 --> 01:42:57,520
all over and they were all rejected 1992
 

5919
01:42:57,520 --> 01:42:59,669
all over and they were all rejected 1992
um six years after we started we got the

5920
01:42:59,669 --> 01:42:59,679
um six years after we started we got the
 

5921
01:42:59,679 --> 01:43:00,950
um six years after we started we got the
first permission

5922
01:43:00,950 --> 01:43:00,960
first permission
 

5923
01:43:00,960 --> 01:43:04,149
first permission
for phase one and that took us through

5924
01:43:04,149 --> 01:43:04,159
for phase one and that took us through
 

5925
01:43:04,159 --> 01:43:05,750
for phase one and that took us through
much of the 90s

5926
01:43:05,750 --> 01:43:05,760
much of the 90s
 

5927
01:43:05,760 --> 01:43:07,669
much of the 90s
again things are slow because we have to

5928
01:43:07,669 --> 01:43:07,679
again things are slow because we have to
 

5929
01:43:07,679 --> 01:43:10,790
again things are slow because we have to
raise the money through donations and

5930
01:43:10,790 --> 01:43:10,800
raise the money through donations and
 

5931
01:43:10,800 --> 01:43:13,590
raise the money through donations and
and then in 1999 is when we started the

5932
01:43:13,590 --> 01:43:13,600
and then in 1999 is when we started the
 

5933
01:43:13,600 --> 01:43:14,390
and then in 1999 is when we started the
work with

5934
01:43:14,390 --> 01:43:14,400
work with
 

5935
01:43:14,400 --> 01:43:21,109
work with
ptsd and that then took us till

5936
01:43:21,109 --> 01:43:21,119

 

5937
01:43:21,119 --> 01:43:24,149

which is when we had the end of phase 2

5940
01:43:26,229 --> 01:43:26,239
which is when we had the end of phase 2
 

5941
01:43:26,239 --> 01:43:27,430
which is when we had the end of phase 2
meeting with fda

5942
01:43:27,430 --> 01:43:27,440
meeting with fda
 

5943
01:43:27,440 --> 01:43:30,149
meeting with fda
so it took 30 years from the start of

5944
01:43:30,149 --> 01:43:30,159
so it took 30 years from the start of
 

5945
01:43:30,159 --> 01:43:32,310
so it took 30 years from the start of
maps to the end of phase 2 meeting with

5949
01:43:33,280 --> 01:43:35,590

01:43:40,390 --> 01:43:40,400
was several different key points
 

5955
01:43:40,400 --> 01:43:42,709
was several different key points
the drugs that are available right now

and they failed in combat related ptsd
 

5973
01:43:59,840 --> 01:44:01,709

they get hypothermia and they die from

5992
01:44:20,070 --> 01:44:20,080
they get hypothermia and they die from
 

5993
01:44:20,080 --> 01:44:22,229
they get hypothermia and they die from
overheating which is true and can happen

5994
01:44:22,229 --> 01:44:22,239
overheating which is true and can happen
 

5995
01:44:22,239 --> 01:44:24,550
overheating which is true and can happen
from pure mdma

5996
01:44:24,550 --> 01:44:24,560
from pure mdma
 

5997
01:44:24,560 --> 01:44:26,229
from pure mdma
or that sometimes people have heard

5998
01:44:26,229 --> 01:44:26,239
or that sometimes people have heard
 

5999
01:44:26,239 --> 01:44:28,470
or that sometimes people have heard
about needing to cool down

6000
01:44:28,470 --> 01:44:28,480
about needing to cool down
 

6001
01:44:28,480 --> 01:44:31,270
about needing to cool down
and so they drink water and then while

6002
01:44:31,270 --> 01:44:31,280
and so they drink water and then while
 

6003
01:44:31,280 --> 01:44:31,669
and so they drink water and then while
they're

6004
01:44:31,669 --> 01:44:31,679
they're
 

6005
01:44:31,679 --> 01:44:33,350
they're
dancing all night and then they drink

6006
01:44:33,350 --> 01:44:33,360
dancing all night and then they drink
 

6007
01:44:33,360 --> 01:44:35,030
dancing all night and then they drink
too much water and then they dilute

6008
01:44:35,030 --> 01:44:35,040
too much water and then they dilute
 

6009
01:44:35,040 --> 01:44:36,310
too much water and then they dilute
their blood and they die from

6010
01:44:36,310 --> 01:44:36,320
their blood and they die from
 

6011
01:44:36,320 --> 01:44:37,750
their blood and they die from
hyponatremia

6012
01:44:37,750 --> 01:44:37,760
hyponatremia
 

6013
01:44:37,760 --> 01:44:40,070
hyponatremia
so there are risks of mdma but we

6014
01:44:40,070 --> 01:44:40,080
so there are risks of mdma but we
 

6015
01:44:40,080 --> 01:44:42,070
so there are risks of mdma but we
discovered that in a therapeutic setting

6016
01:44:42,070 --> 01:44:42,080
discovered that in a therapeutic setting
 

6017
01:44:42,080 --> 01:44:43,830
discovered that in a therapeutic setting
we can control all those risks those

6018
01:44:43,830 --> 01:44:43,840
we can control all those risks those
 

6019
01:44:43,840 --> 01:44:45,830
we can control all those risks those
things don't happen at all

6020
01:44:45,830 --> 01:44:45,840
things don't happen at all
 

6021
01:44:45,840 --> 01:44:48,070
things don't happen at all
so we discovered safety we could we

6022
01:44:48,070 --> 01:44:48,080
so we discovered safety we could we
 

6023
01:44:48,080 --> 01:44:50,709
so we discovered safety we could we
could demonstrate safety

6024
01:44:50,709 --> 01:44:50,719
could demonstrate safety
 

6025
01:44:50,719 --> 01:44:53,910
could demonstrate safety
we also figured out that our measure

6026
01:44:53,910 --> 01:44:53,920
we also figured out that our measure
 

6027
01:44:53,920 --> 01:44:56,470
we also figured out that our measure
the caps the clinician-administered ptsd

6028
01:44:56,470 --> 01:44:56,480
the caps the clinician-administered ptsd
 

6029
01:44:56,480 --> 01:44:57,990
the caps the clinician-administered ptsd
scale that it's the

6030
01:44:57,990 --> 01:44:58,000
scale that it's the
 

6031
01:44:58,000 --> 01:44:59,510
scale that it's the
gold standard all over the world for

6032
01:44:59,510 --> 01:44:59,520
gold standard all over the world for
 

6033
01:44:59,520 --> 01:45:01,350
gold standard all over the world for
measuring ptsd symptoms it's what the

6034
01:45:01,350 --> 01:45:01,360
measuring ptsd symptoms it's what the
 

6035
01:45:01,360 --> 01:45:02,390
measuring ptsd symptoms it's what the
fda and the e may

fda and the e may
 

6037
01:45:02,400 --> 01:45:04,870
fda and the e may
require we discovered that it was a good

6038
01:45:04,870 --> 01:45:04,880
require we discovered that it was a good
 

6039
01:45:04,880 --> 01:45:06,790
require we discovered that it was a good
measure for us and that we could show

6040
01:45:06,790 --> 01:45:06,800
measure for us and that we could show
 

6041
01:45:06,800 --> 01:45:09,910
measure for us and that we could show
changes in that the other

what we discovered is that that's not

01:45:50,960 --> 01:45:52,870
what we discovered is that that's not
the case for mdma

6092
01:45:52,870 --> 01:45:52,880
the case for mdma
 

6093
01:45:52,880 --> 01:45:55,990
the case for mdma
that people do score fairly high on the

6094
01:45:55,990 --> 01:45:56,000
that people do score fairly high on the
 

6095
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:57,750
that people do score fairly high on the
scales of mystical experience not as

high
 

6099
01:45:58,000 --> 01:45:59,750
high
as they do with the classic psychedelics

6100
01:45:59,750 --> 01:45:59,760
as they do with the classic psychedelics
 

6101
01:45:59,760 --> 01:46:01,750
as they do with the classic psychedelics
but they do score pretty high

6102
01:46:01,750 --> 01:46:01,760
but they do score pretty high
 

6103
01:46:01,760 --> 01:46:04,950
but they do score pretty high
on average and a significant number of

on average and a significant number of
 

6105
01:46:04,960 --> 01:46:05,590
on average and a significant number of
them have

01:46:05,590 --> 01:46:05,600
them have
 

6107
01:46:05,600 --> 01:46:06,790
them have
over the cutoff for what would be

01:46:06,790 --> 01:46:06,800
over the cutoff for what would be
 

6109
01:46:06,800 --> 01:46:09,109
over the cutoff for what would be
considered a full mystical experience

6110
01:46:09,109 --> 01:46:09,119
considered a full mystical experience
 

6111
01:46:09,119 --> 01:46:11,189
considered a full mystical experience
so enough to say that we could look at a

6112
01:46:11,189 --> 01:46:11,199
so enough to say that we could look at a
 

6113
01:46:11,199 --> 01:46:13,590
so enough to say that we could look at a
correlation and we didn't find any

6114
01:46:13,590 --> 01:46:13,600
correlation and we didn't find any
 

6115
01:46:13,600 --> 01:46:15,270
correlation and we didn't find any
the other thing that we discovered and

6116
01:46:15,270 --> 01:46:15,280
the other thing that we discovered and
 

6117
01:46:15,280 --> 01:46:16,870
the other thing that we discovered and
this was

6118
01:46:16,870 --> 01:46:16,880
this was
 

6119
01:46:16,880 --> 01:46:19,030
this was
more humbling i would say for me

6120
01:46:19,030 --> 01:46:19,040
more humbling i would say for me
 

6121
01:46:19,040 --> 01:46:19,910
more humbling i would say for me
personally

6122
01:46:19,910 --> 01:46:19,920
personally
 

6123
01:46:19,920 --> 01:46:21,830
personally
is that my dissertation at the kennedy

6124
01:46:21,830 --> 01:46:21,840
is that my dissertation at the kennedy
 

6125
01:46:21,840 --> 01:46:24,149
is that my dissertation at the kennedy
school a big part of it was on the

6126
01:46:24,149 --> 01:46:24,159
school a big part of it was on the
 

6127
01:46:24,159 --> 01:46:25,990
school a big part of it was on the
it's about the regulation of the medical

6128
01:46:25,990 --> 01:46:26,000
it's about the regulation of the medical
 

6129
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:27,750
it's about the regulation of the medical
use of psychedelics and marijuana

6130
01:46:27,750 --> 01:46:27,760
use of psychedelics and marijuana
 

6131
01:46:27,760 --> 01:46:29,430
use of psychedelics and marijuana
big part of my dissertation was how to

6132
01:46:29,430 --> 01:46:29,440
big part of my dissertation was how to
 

6133
01:46:29,440 --> 01:46:30,790
big part of my dissertation was how to
do the double-blind

6134
01:46:30,790 --> 01:46:30,800
do the double-blind
 

6135
01:46:30,800 --> 01:46:32,629
do the double-blind
study and i thought i'd solve the

6136
01:46:32,629 --> 01:46:32,639
study and i thought i'd solve the
 

6137
01:46:32,639 --> 01:46:34,390
study and i thought i'd solve the
problem and i persuaded my

6138
01:46:34,390 --> 01:46:34,400
problem and i persuaded my
 

6139
01:46:34,400 --> 01:46:36,070
problem and i persuaded my
dissertation committee that i'd solved

6140
01:46:36,070 --> 01:46:36,080
dissertation committee that i'd solved
 

6141
01:46:36,080 --> 01:46:37,430
dissertation committee that i'd solved
the problem

6142
01:46:37,430 --> 01:46:37,440
the problem
 

6143
01:46:37,440 --> 01:46:40,070
the problem
and the solution was therapy with

6144
01:46:40,070 --> 01:46:40,080
and the solution was therapy with
 

6145
01:46:40,080 --> 01:46:41,189
and the solution was therapy with
low-dose mdma

6146
01:46:41,189 --> 01:46:41,199
low-dose mdma
 

6147
01:46:41,199 --> 01:46:44,390
low-dose mdma
versus therapy with full-dose mdma and

6148
01:46:44,390 --> 01:46:44,400
versus therapy with full-dose mdma and
 

6149
01:46:44,400 --> 01:46:45,510
versus therapy with full-dose mdma and
everybody knows that they're going to

6150
01:46:45,510 --> 01:46:45,520
everybody knows that they're going to
 

6151
01:46:45,520 --> 01:46:47,990
everybody knows that they're going to
get mdma most of these people have never

6152
01:46:47,990 --> 01:46:48,000
get mdma most of these people have never
 

6153
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:49,109
get mdma most of these people have never
done it before

6154
01:46:49,109 --> 01:46:49,119
done it before
 

6155
01:46:49,119 --> 01:46:50,709
done it before
they'll be confused about is at full

6156
01:46:50,709 --> 01:46:50,719
they'll be confused about is at full
 

6157
01:46:50,719 --> 01:46:52,550
they'll be confused about is at full
dose or low dose

6158
01:46:52,550 --> 01:46:52,560
dose or low dose
 

6159
01:46:52,560 --> 01:46:55,750
dose or low dose
and then the challenge is uh to pick a

6160
01:46:55,750 --> 01:46:55,760
and then the challenge is uh to pick a
 

6161
01:46:55,760 --> 01:46:57,189
and then the challenge is uh to pick a
dose that's

6162
01:46:57,189 --> 01:46:57,199
dose that's
 

6163
01:46:57,199 --> 01:46:59,270
dose that's
high enough so that there is this

6164
01:46:59,270 --> 01:46:59,280
high enough so that there is this
 

6165
01:46:59,280 --> 01:47:01,350
high enough so that there is this
confusion but not so high that it's so

6166
01:47:01,350 --> 01:47:01,360
confusion but not so high that it's so
 

6167
01:47:01,360 --> 01:47:02,709
confusion but not so high that it's so
therapeutic that we can't tell the

6168
01:47:02,709 --> 01:47:02,719
therapeutic that we can't tell the
 

6169
01:47:02,719 --> 01:47:04,709
therapeutic that we can't tell the
difference between the groups

6170
01:47:04,709 --> 01:47:04,719
difference between the groups
 

6171
01:47:04,719 --> 01:47:07,750
difference between the groups
so we we studied zero meaning inactive

6172
01:47:07,750 --> 01:47:07,760
so we we studied zero meaning inactive
 

6173
01:47:07,760 --> 01:47:09,270
so we we studied zero meaning inactive
placebo

6174
01:47:09,270 --> 01:47:09,280
placebo
 

6175
01:47:09,280 --> 01:47:11,350

6181
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:19,910
100 milligrams 125 and 150.
what we discovered is that my

6182
01:47:19,910 --> 01:47:19,920
what we discovered is that my
 

6183
01:47:19,920 --> 01:47:22,709
what we discovered is that my
dissertation was wrong and that

6184
01:47:22,709 --> 01:47:22,719
dissertation was wrong and that
 

6185
01:47:22,719 --> 01:47:24,390
dissertation was wrong and that
there is no good solution to the

6186
01:47:24,390 --> 01:47:24,400
there is no good solution to the
 

6187
01:47:24,400 --> 01:47:26,790
there is no good solution to the
double-blind problem

6188
01:47:26,790 --> 01:47:26,800
double-blind problem
 

6189
01:47:26,800 --> 01:47:30,709
double-blind problem
um what we found is that to our surprise

6190
01:47:30,709 --> 01:47:30,719
um what we found is that to our surprise
 

6191
01:47:30,719 --> 01:47:33,350
um what we found is that to our surprise
actually was that 75 milligrams was an

6192
01:47:33,350 --> 01:47:33,360
actually was that 75 milligrams was an
 

6193
01:47:33,360 --> 01:47:34,709
actually was that 75 milligrams was an
effective dose

6194
01:47:34,709 --> 01:47:34,719
effective dose
 

6195
01:47:34,719 --> 01:47:37,510
effective dose
oh wow we didn't think that i mean the

6196
01:47:37,510 --> 01:47:37,520
oh wow we didn't think that i mean the
 

6197
01:47:37,520 --> 01:47:38,950
oh wow we didn't think that i mean the
normal doses like

6198
01:47:38,950 --> 01:47:38,960
normal doses like
 

6199
01:47:38,960 --> 01:47:41,030
normal doses like
full dose is like 125 milligrams

6200
01:47:41,030 --> 01:47:41,040
full dose is like 125 milligrams
 

6201
01:47:41,040 --> 01:47:42,470
full dose is like 125 milligrams
something like that

6202
01:47:42,470 --> 01:47:42,480
something like that
 

6203
01:47:42,480 --> 01:47:45,430
something like that
but 75 milligrams was an effective dose

6204
01:47:45,430 --> 01:47:45,440
but 75 milligrams was an effective dose
 

6205
01:47:45,440 --> 01:47:47,830
but 75 milligrams was an effective dose
and we discovered that the lower doses

6206
01:47:47,830 --> 01:47:47,840
and we discovered that the lower doses
 

6207
01:47:47,840 --> 01:47:49,990
and we discovered that the lower doses
so i was i was half right you could say

6208
01:47:49,990 --> 01:47:50,000
so i was i was half right you could say
 

6209
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:51,109
so i was i was half right you could say
the the doses

6210
01:47:51,109 --> 01:47:51,119
the the doses
 

6211
01:47:51,119 --> 01:47:54,709
the the doses
of 25 30 40 50 they they could

6212
01:47:54,709 --> 01:47:54,719
of 25 30 40 50 they they could
 

6213
01:47:54,719 --> 01:47:57,430
of 25 30 40 50 they they could
produce enough confusion that you could

6214
01:47:57,430 --> 01:47:57,440
produce enough confusion that you could
 

6215
01:47:57,440 --> 01:47:58,870
produce enough confusion that you could
say that they were successful at

6216
01:47:58,870 --> 01:47:58,880
say that they were successful at
 

6217
01:47:58,880 --> 01:48:00,390
say that they were successful at
blinding not perfectly but

6218
01:48:00,390 --> 01:48:00,400
blinding not perfectly but
 

6219
01:48:00,400 --> 01:48:03,189
blinding not perfectly but
enough confusion so that people

6220
01:48:03,189 --> 01:48:03,199
enough confusion so that people
 

6221
01:48:03,199 --> 01:48:04,149
enough confusion so that people
therapists couldn't

6222
01:48:04,149 --> 01:48:04,159
therapists couldn't
 

6223
01:48:04,159 --> 01:48:06,390
therapists couldn't
know for sure so that so that there was

6224
01:48:06,390 --> 01:48:06,400
know for sure so that so that there was
 

6225
01:48:06,400 --> 01:48:09,669
know for sure so that so that there was
this reduction of bias you could say

6226
01:48:09,669 --> 01:48:09,679
this reduction of bias you could say
 

6227
01:48:09,679 --> 01:48:13,109
this reduction of bias you could say
but what we discovered again to

6228
01:48:13,109 --> 01:48:13,119
but what we discovered again to
 

6229
01:48:13,119 --> 01:48:15,430
but what we discovered again to
to our surprise was that the low doses

6230
01:48:15,430 --> 01:48:15,440
to our surprise was that the low doses
 

6231
01:48:15,440 --> 01:48:17,350
to our surprise was that the low doses
made people uncomfortable

6232
01:48:17,350 --> 01:48:17,360
made people uncomfortable
 

6233
01:48:17,360 --> 01:48:20,550
made people uncomfortable
they they stimulated them

6234
01:48:20,550 --> 01:48:20,560
they they stimulated them
 

6235
01:48:20,560 --> 01:48:23,990
they they stimulated them
but they didn't reduce the fear and so

6236
01:48:23,990 --> 01:48:24,000
but they didn't reduce the fear and so
 

6237
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,790
but they didn't reduce the fear and so
people still got better with the therapy

6238
01:48:26,790 --> 01:48:26,800
people still got better with the therapy
 

6239
01:48:26,800 --> 01:48:29,270
people still got better with the therapy
with low-dose mdma but if we gave them

6240
01:48:29,270 --> 01:48:29,280
with low-dose mdma but if we gave them
 

6241
01:48:29,280 --> 01:48:32,149
with low-dose mdma but if we gave them
therapy with inactive placebo they did

6242
01:48:32,149 --> 01:48:32,159
therapy with inactive placebo they did
 

6243
01:48:32,159 --> 01:48:33,830
therapy with inactive placebo they did
even better

6244
01:48:33,830 --> 01:48:33,840
even better
 

6245
01:48:33,840 --> 01:48:35,590
even better
than if we gave them therapy with

6246
01:48:35,590 --> 01:48:35,600
than if we gave them therapy with
 

6247
01:48:35,600 --> 01:48:37,350
than if we gave them therapy with
low-dose mdma

6248
01:48:37,350 --> 01:48:37,360
low-dose mdma
 

6249
01:48:37,360 --> 01:48:40,229
low-dose mdma
so we we call it an anti-therapeutic

6250
01:48:40,229 --> 01:48:40,239
so we we call it an anti-therapeutic
 

6251
01:48:40,239 --> 01:48:41,030
so we we call it an anti-therapeutic
effect

6252
01:48:41,030 --> 01:48:41,040
effect
 

6253
01:48:41,040 --> 01:48:43,109
effect
well i don't mean to imply that they got

6254
01:48:43,109 --> 01:48:43,119
well i don't mean to imply that they got
 

6255
01:48:43,119 --> 01:48:45,350
well i don't mean to imply that they got
worse but it made people uncomfortable

6256
01:48:45,350 --> 01:48:45,360
worse but it made people uncomfortable
 

6257
01:48:45,360 --> 01:48:47,590
worse but it made people uncomfortable
people didn't like it you know but we

6258
01:48:47,590 --> 01:48:47,600
people didn't like it you know but we
 

6259
01:48:47,600 --> 01:48:49,830
people didn't like it you know but we
would still help them make some progress

6260
01:48:49,830 --> 01:48:49,840
would still help them make some progress
 

6261
01:48:49,840 --> 01:48:52,229
would still help them make some progress
so we had the blinding but what what it

6262
01:48:52,229 --> 01:48:52,239
so we had the blinding but what what it
 

6263
01:48:52,239 --> 01:48:54,310
so we had the blinding but what what it
meant by reducing the effect of

6264
01:48:54,310 --> 01:48:54,320
meant by reducing the effect of
 

6265
01:48:54,320 --> 01:48:56,310
meant by reducing the effect of
therapy with inactive placebo is that it

6266
01:48:56,310 --> 01:48:56,320
therapy with inactive placebo is that it
 

6267
01:48:56,320 --> 01:48:58,229
therapy with inactive placebo is that it
would make it easier for us to find a

6268
01:48:58,229 --> 01:48:58,239
would make it easier for us to find a
 

6269
01:48:58,239 --> 01:49:01,030
would make it easier for us to find a
difference between the two groups

6270
01:49:01,030 --> 01:49:01,040
difference between the two groups
 

6271
01:49:01,040 --> 01:49:03,270
difference between the two groups
and so the real question is if you can

6272
01:49:03,270 --> 01:49:03,280
and so the real question is if you can
 

6273
01:49:03,280 --> 01:49:04,709
and so the real question is if you can
do it with therapy

6274
01:49:04,709 --> 01:49:04,719
do it with therapy
 

6275
01:49:04,719 --> 01:49:08,390
do it with therapy
why bother at a drug so we went to the

6276
01:49:08,390 --> 01:49:08,400
why bother at a drug so we went to the
 

6277
01:49:08,400 --> 01:49:09,189
why bother at a drug so we went to the
fda

6278
01:49:09,189 --> 01:49:09,199
fda
 

6279
01:49:09,199 --> 01:49:11,270
fda
and and so this was what we discovered

6280
01:49:11,270 --> 01:49:11,280
and and so this was what we discovered
 

6281
01:49:11,280 --> 01:49:13,030
and and so this was what we discovered
during phase two we went to the fda at

6282
01:49:13,030 --> 01:49:13,040
during phase two we went to the fda at
 

6283
01:49:13,040 --> 01:49:13,990
during phase two we went to the fda at
this end of phase two

6284
01:49:13,990 --> 01:49:14,000
this end of phase two
 

6285
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,310
this end of phase two
meeting and we said we can give you

6286
01:49:16,310 --> 01:49:16,320
meeting and we said we can give you
 

6287
01:49:16,320 --> 01:49:17,589
meeting and we said we can give you
blinding

6288
01:49:17,589 --> 01:49:17,599
blinding
 

6289
01:49:17,599 --> 01:49:20,310
blinding
but it will make it easier for us to

6290
01:49:20,310 --> 01:49:20,320
but it will make it easier for us to
 

6291
01:49:20,320 --> 01:49:21,990
but it will make it easier for us to
find a difference between the two groups

6292
01:49:21,990 --> 01:49:22,000
find a difference between the two groups
 

6293
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:23,189
find a difference between the two groups
and so we suggest

6294
01:49:23,189 --> 01:49:23,199
and so we suggest
 

6295
01:49:23,199 --> 01:49:26,310
and so we suggest
that we do therapy with inactive placebo

6296
01:49:26,310 --> 01:49:26,320
that we do therapy with inactive placebo
 

6297
01:49:26,320 --> 01:49:29,430
that we do therapy with inactive placebo
versus therapy with full dose mdma

6298
01:49:29,430 --> 01:49:29,440
versus therapy with full dose mdma
 

6299
01:49:29,440 --> 01:49:31,669
versus therapy with full dose mdma
that will cause a problem because most

6300
01:49:31,669 --> 01:49:31,679
that will cause a problem because most
 

6301
01:49:31,679 --> 01:49:33,350
that will cause a problem because most
people will be able to tell what they've

6302
01:49:33,350 --> 01:49:33,360
people will be able to tell what they've
 

6303
01:49:33,360 --> 01:49:33,750
people will be able to tell what they've
got

6304
01:49:33,750 --> 01:49:33,760
got
 

6305
01:49:33,760 --> 01:49:37,030
got
yeah what um tom lawforn a doctor who

6306
01:49:37,030 --> 01:49:37,040
yeah what um tom lawforn a doctor who
 

6307
01:49:37,040 --> 01:49:38,790
yeah what um tom lawforn a doctor who
used to be head of psychiatry products

6308
01:49:38,790 --> 01:49:38,800
used to be head of psychiatry products
 

6309
01:49:38,800 --> 01:49:40,070
used to be head of psychiatry products
at fda is our

6310
01:49:40,070 --> 01:49:40,080
at fda is our
 

6311
01:49:40,080 --> 01:49:42,790
at fda is our
main advisor so the first thing he said

6312
01:49:42,790 --> 01:49:42,800
main advisor so the first thing he said
 

6313
01:49:42,800 --> 01:49:44,629
main advisor so the first thing he said
is that the double blind fails in

6314
01:49:44,629 --> 01:49:44,639
is that the double blind fails in
 

6315
01:49:44,639 --> 01:49:47,350
is that the double blind fails in
practice a lot even with ssris

6316
01:49:47,350 --> 01:49:47,360
practice a lot even with ssris
 

6317
01:49:47,360 --> 01:49:49,350
practice a lot even with ssris
because there are certain side effects

6318
01:49:49,350 --> 01:49:49,360
because there are certain side effects
 

6319
01:49:49,360 --> 01:49:50,950
because there are certain side effects
that you have with these drugs and the

6320
01:49:50,950 --> 01:49:50,960
that you have with these drugs and the
 

6321
01:49:50,960 --> 01:49:52,550
that you have with these drugs and the
doctors who are doing these research

6322
01:49:52,550 --> 01:49:52,560
doctors who are doing these research
 

6323
01:49:52,560 --> 01:49:53,270
doctors who are doing these research
when you're

6324
01:49:53,270 --> 01:49:53,280
when you're
 

6325
01:49:53,280 --> 01:49:55,510
when you're
reporting your side effects they can say

6326
01:49:55,510 --> 01:49:55,520
reporting your side effects they can say
 

6327
01:49:55,520 --> 01:49:57,030
reporting your side effects they can say
oh that's probably you got the active

6328
01:49:57,030 --> 01:49:57,040
oh that's probably you got the active
 

6329
01:49:57,040 --> 01:49:58,790
oh that's probably you got the active
drug instead of the placebo so

6330
01:49:58,790 --> 01:49:58,800
drug instead of the placebo so
 

6331
01:49:58,800 --> 01:50:01,109
drug instead of the placebo so
the double blind is in theory is

6332
01:50:01,109 --> 01:50:01,119
the double blind is in theory is
 

6333
01:50:01,119 --> 01:50:03,350
the double blind is in theory is
terrific but in practice

6334
01:50:03,350 --> 01:50:03,360
terrific but in practice
 

6335
01:50:03,360 --> 01:50:05,750
terrific but in practice
it doesn't always work quite as well yes

6336
01:50:05,750 --> 01:50:05,760
it doesn't always work quite as well yes
 

6337
01:50:05,760 --> 01:50:07,990
it doesn't always work quite as well yes
and so what tom said is that there are

6338
01:50:07,990 --> 01:50:08,000
and so what tom said is that there are
 

6339
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:08,790
and so what tom said is that there are
two

6340
01:50:08,790 --> 01:50:08,800
two
 

6341
01:50:08,800 --> 01:50:10,950
two
main approaches that they think are

6342
01:50:10,950 --> 01:50:10,960
main approaches that they think are
 

6343
01:50:10,960 --> 01:50:13,189
main approaches that they think are
important to reduce bias

6344
01:50:13,189 --> 01:50:13,199
important to reduce bias
 

6345
01:50:13,199 --> 01:50:16,070
important to reduce bias
the first one is easy to do it's called

6346
01:50:16,070 --> 01:50:16,080
the first one is easy to do it's called
 

6347
01:50:16,080 --> 01:50:17,750
the first one is easy to do it's called
random assignment

6348
01:50:17,750 --> 01:50:17,760
random assignment
 

6349
01:50:17,760 --> 01:50:19,669
random assignment
so you know sometimes there are studies

6350
01:50:19,669 --> 01:50:19,679
so you know sometimes there are studies
 

6351
01:50:19,679 --> 01:50:21,430
so you know sometimes there are studies
where you know you'll you'll treat a

6352
01:50:21,430 --> 01:50:21,440
where you know you'll you'll treat a
 

6353
01:50:21,440 --> 01:50:23,350
where you know you'll you'll treat a
bunch of people

6354
01:50:23,350 --> 01:50:23,360
bunch of people
 

6355
01:50:23,360 --> 01:50:25,189
bunch of people
with something and some fraction of them

6356
01:50:25,189 --> 01:50:25,199
with something and some fraction of them
 

6357
01:50:25,199 --> 01:50:27,030
with something and some fraction of them
will get better and some won't and then

6358
01:50:27,030 --> 01:50:27,040
will get better and some won't and then
 

6359
01:50:27,040 --> 01:50:27,589
will get better and some won't and then
you say

6360
01:50:27,589 --> 01:50:27,599
you say
 

6361
01:50:27,599 --> 01:50:29,270
you say
okay all those who didn't get better who

6362
01:50:29,270 --> 01:50:29,280
okay all those who didn't get better who
 

6363
01:50:29,280 --> 01:50:31,750
okay all those who didn't get better who
volunteers to get this new treatment

6364
01:50:31,750 --> 01:50:31,760
volunteers to get this new treatment
 

6365
01:50:31,760 --> 01:50:33,109
volunteers to get this new treatment
and then you give them the new treatment

6366
01:50:33,109 --> 01:50:33,119
and then you give them the new treatment
 

6367
01:50:33,119 --> 01:50:34,629
and then you give them the new treatment
but the people that volunteer are more

6368
01:50:34,629 --> 01:50:34,639
but the people that volunteer are more
 

6369
01:50:34,639 --> 01:50:36,470
but the people that volunteer are more
likely to want to get better they're not

6370
01:50:36,470 --> 01:50:36,480
likely to want to get better they're not
 

6371
01:50:36,480 --> 01:50:38,629
likely to want to get better they're not
representative sample of everybody that

6372
01:50:38,629 --> 01:50:38,639
representative sample of everybody that
 

6373
01:50:38,639 --> 01:50:40,629
representative sample of everybody that
has these so when you have random

6374
01:50:40,629 --> 01:50:40,639
has these so when you have random
 

6375
01:50:40,639 --> 01:50:41,589
has these so when you have random
assignment

6376
01:50:41,589 --> 01:50:41,599
assignment
 

6377
01:50:41,599 --> 01:50:44,310
assignment
everybody is similarly motivated and has

6378
01:50:44,310 --> 01:50:44,320
everybody is similarly motivated and has
 

6379
01:50:44,320 --> 01:50:45,910
everybody is similarly motivated and has
meets the same inclusion exclusion

6380
01:50:45,910 --> 01:50:45,920
meets the same inclusion exclusion
 

6381
01:50:45,920 --> 01:50:47,189
meets the same inclusion exclusion
criteria

6382
01:50:47,189 --> 01:50:47,199
criteria
 

6383
01:50:47,199 --> 01:50:49,189
criteria
so that's what we talked of course we

6384
01:50:49,189 --> 01:50:49,199
so that's what we talked of course we
 

6385
01:50:49,199 --> 01:50:50,390
so that's what we talked of course we
need random assignment

6386
01:50:50,390 --> 01:50:50,400
need random assignment
 

6387
01:50:50,400 --> 01:50:53,669
need random assignment
the other part was when the bias double

6388
01:50:53,669 --> 01:50:53,679
the other part was when the bias double
 

6389
01:50:53,679 --> 01:50:55,830
the other part was when the bias double
blind doesn't work as well

6390
01:50:55,830 --> 01:50:55,840
blind doesn't work as well
 

6391
01:50:55,840 --> 01:50:59,750
blind doesn't work as well
then the system of independent raiders

6392
01:50:59,750 --> 01:50:59,760
then the system of independent raiders
 

6393
01:50:59,760 --> 01:51:02,629
then the system of independent raiders
is especially important of how you do

6394
01:51:02,629 --> 01:51:02,639
is especially important of how you do
 

6395
01:51:02,639 --> 01:51:03,669
is especially important of how you do
that so we

6396
01:51:03,669 --> 01:51:03,679
that so we
 

6397
01:51:03,679 --> 01:51:07,109
that so we
have over a pool of raiders

6398
01:51:07,109 --> 01:51:07,119
have over a pool of raiders
 

6399
01:51:07,119 --> 01:51:09,589
have over a pool of raiders
over 20 of them and we do this monthly

6400
01:51:09,589 --> 01:51:09,599
over 20 of them and we do this monthly
 

6401
01:51:09,599 --> 01:51:11,750
over 20 of them and we do this monthly
in inter-rater reliability tests

6402
01:51:11,750 --> 01:51:11,760
in inter-rater reliability tests
 

6403
01:51:11,760 --> 01:51:14,310
in inter-rater reliability tests
to make sure that they um you know

6404
01:51:14,310 --> 01:51:14,320
to make sure that they um you know
 

6405
01:51:14,320 --> 01:51:15,830
to make sure that they um you know
evaluate the so that they're given a

6406
01:51:15,830 --> 01:51:15,840
evaluate the so that they're given a
 

6407
01:51:15,840 --> 01:51:17,750
evaluate the so that they're given a
videotape of a ptsd patient and then

6408
01:51:17,750 --> 01:51:17,760
videotape of a ptsd patient and then
 

6409
01:51:17,760 --> 01:51:19,510
videotape of a ptsd patient and then
they're supposed to rate them

6410
01:51:19,510 --> 01:51:19,520
they're supposed to rate them
 

6411
01:51:19,520 --> 01:51:21,109
they're supposed to rate them
according to their symptoms and then

6412
01:51:21,109 --> 01:51:21,119
according to their symptoms and then
 

6413
01:51:21,119 --> 01:51:23,109
according to their symptoms and then
then we sort of make sure that we've got

6414
01:51:23,109 --> 01:51:23,119
then we sort of make sure that we've got
 

6415
01:51:23,119 --> 01:51:23,430
then we sort of make sure that we've got
this

6416
01:51:23,430 --> 01:51:23,440
this
 

6417
01:51:23,440 --> 01:51:26,790
this
calibrated raider pool and it's all done

6418
01:51:26,790 --> 01:51:26,800
calibrated raider pool and it's all done
 

6419
01:51:26,800 --> 01:51:27,910
calibrated raider pool and it's all done
by zoom by

6420
01:51:27,910 --> 01:51:27,920
by zoom by
 

6421
01:51:27,920 --> 01:51:29,510
by zoom by
telemedicine and they're randomly

6422
01:51:29,510 --> 01:51:29,520
telemedicine and they're randomly
 

6423
01:51:29,520 --> 01:51:31,350
telemedicine and they're randomly
assigned to the next person that needs a

6424
01:51:31,350 --> 01:51:31,360
assigned to the next person that needs a
 

6425
01:51:31,360 --> 01:51:32,470
assigned to the next person that needs a
rating

6426
01:51:32,470 --> 01:51:32,480
rating
 

6427
01:51:32,480 --> 01:51:34,470
rating
so they said 20 raiders yeah so we've

6428
01:51:34,470 --> 01:51:34,480
so they said 20 raiders yeah so we've
 

6429
01:51:34,480 --> 01:51:35,750
so they said 20 raiders yeah so we've
got like 20 raiders

6430
01:51:35,750 --> 01:51:35,760
got like 20 raiders
 

6431
01:51:35,760 --> 01:51:38,790
got like 20 raiders
and um we want what we want to do is is

6432
01:51:38,790 --> 01:51:38,800
and um we want what we want to do is is
 

6433
01:51:38,800 --> 01:51:41,030
and um we want what we want to do is is
make it so that each raider sees each

6434
01:51:41,030 --> 01:51:41,040
make it so that each raider sees each
 

6435
01:51:41,040 --> 01:51:41,990
make it so that each raider sees each
patient

6436
01:51:41,990 --> 01:51:42,000
patient
 

6437
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,709
patient
only once maybe twice but but not

6438
01:51:44,709 --> 01:51:44,719
only once maybe twice but but not
 

6439
01:51:44,719 --> 01:51:47,030
only once maybe twice but but not
tracking them through the study

6440
01:51:47,030 --> 01:51:47,040
tracking them through the study
 

6441
01:51:47,040 --> 01:51:48,950
tracking them through the study
so that guys to reduce the bias in the

6442
01:51:48,950 --> 01:51:48,960
so that guys to reduce the bias in the
 

6443
01:51:48,960 --> 01:51:50,470
so that guys to reduce the bias in the
raiders that they they don't know where

6444
01:51:50,470 --> 01:51:50,480
raiders that they they don't know where
 

6445
01:51:50,480 --> 01:51:52,070
raiders that they they don't know where
this person is in the study

6446
01:51:52,070 --> 01:51:52,080
this person is in the study
 

6447
01:51:52,080 --> 01:51:55,910
this person is in the study
yes um and then and so

6448
01:51:55,910 --> 01:51:55,920
yes um and then and so
 

6449
01:51:55,920 --> 01:51:59,189
yes um and then and so
there's a fellow um bob temple who's

6450
01:51:59,189 --> 01:51:59,199
there's a fellow um bob temple who's
 

6451
01:51:59,199 --> 01:52:01,189
there's a fellow um bob temple who's
like the old wise man at the fda

6452
01:52:01,189 --> 01:52:01,199
like the old wise man at the fda
 

6453
01:52:01,199 --> 01:52:03,990
like the old wise man at the fda
he's been there since 1972 he was in

6454
01:52:03,990 --> 01:52:04,000
he's been there since 1972 he was in
 

6455
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:05,750
he's been there since 1972 he was in
charge of the office of science policy

6456
01:52:05,750 --> 01:52:05,760
charge of the office of science policy
 

6457
01:52:05,760 --> 01:52:07,270
charge of the office of science policy
and they brought him into the final

6458
01:52:07,270 --> 01:52:07,280
and they brought him into the final
 

6459
01:52:07,280 --> 01:52:08,149
and they brought him into the final
meeting of this

6460
01:52:08,149 --> 01:52:08,159
meeting of this
 

6461
01:52:08,159 --> 01:52:11,270
meeting of this
um process where we are trying to design

6462
01:52:11,270 --> 01:52:11,280
um process where we are trying to design
 

6463
01:52:11,280 --> 01:52:13,350
um process where we are trying to design
phase three so once fda said yes you can

6464
01:52:13,350 --> 01:52:13,360
phase three so once fda said yes you can
 

6465
01:52:13,360 --> 01:52:14,470
phase three so once fda said yes you can
go to phase three

6466
01:52:14,470 --> 01:52:14,480
go to phase three
 

6467
01:52:14,480 --> 01:52:17,750
go to phase three
that was november 29 2016.

6468
01:52:17,750 --> 01:52:17,760
that was november 29 2016.
 

6469
01:52:17,760 --> 01:52:20,390
that was november 29 2016.
we then negotiated for eight months on

6470
01:52:20,390 --> 01:52:20,400
we then negotiated for eight months on
 

6471
01:52:20,400 --> 01:52:22,550
we then negotiated for eight months on
the design of phase three and all of the

6472
01:52:22,550 --> 01:52:22,560
the design of phase three and all of the
 

6473
01:52:22,560 --> 01:52:24,390
the design of phase three and all of the
other information this is fascinating

6474
01:52:24,390 --> 01:52:24,400
other information this is fascinating
 

6475
01:52:24,400 --> 01:52:26,629
other information this is fascinating
it's gonna need this process of design

6476
01:52:26,629 --> 01:52:26,639
it's gonna need this process of design
 

6477
01:52:26,639 --> 01:52:27,750
it's gonna need this process of design
ah it was

6478
01:52:27,750 --> 01:52:27,760
ah it was
 

6479
01:52:27,760 --> 01:52:30,310
ah it was
you know to the extent that i have any

6480
01:52:30,310 --> 01:52:30,320
you know to the extent that i have any
 

6481
01:52:30,320 --> 01:52:31,990
you know to the extent that i have any
uh artistic creativity

6482
01:52:31,990 --> 01:52:32,000
uh artistic creativity
 

6483
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:35,430
uh artistic creativity
it's in protocol design i really love

6484
01:52:35,430 --> 01:52:35,440
it's in protocol design i really love
 

6485
01:52:35,440 --> 01:52:37,430
it's in protocol design i really love
that so you enjoy this process i love it

6486
01:52:37,430 --> 01:52:37,440
that so you enjoy this process i love it
 

6487
01:52:37,440 --> 01:52:39,350
that so you enjoy this process i love it
i love it because it's always trade-offs

6488
01:52:39,350 --> 01:52:39,360
i love it because it's always trade-offs
 

6489
01:52:39,360 --> 01:52:39,910
i love it because it's always trade-offs
and it's

6490
01:52:39,910 --> 01:52:39,920
and it's
 

6491
01:52:39,920 --> 01:52:42,790
and it's
um yeah it's you know and i acknowledge

6492
01:52:42,790 --> 01:52:42,800
um yeah it's you know and i acknowledge
 

6493
01:52:42,800 --> 01:52:43,270
um yeah it's you know and i acknowledge
you know

6494
01:52:43,270 --> 01:52:43,280
you know
 

6495
01:52:43,280 --> 01:52:45,990
you know
that we are all biased and so how do you

6496
01:52:45,990 --> 01:52:46,000
that we are all biased and so how do you
 

6497
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:47,109
that we are all biased and so how do you
there's something beautiful

6498
01:52:47,109 --> 01:52:47,119
there's something beautiful
 

6499
01:52:47,119 --> 01:52:50,149
there's something beautiful
about the scientific process designed to

6500
01:52:50,149 --> 01:52:50,159
about the scientific process designed to
 

6501
01:52:50,159 --> 01:52:51,350
about the scientific process designed to
get you to the truth

6502
01:52:51,350 --> 01:52:51,360
get you to the truth
 

6503
01:52:51,360 --> 01:52:53,990
get you to the truth
um especially when that scientific

6504
01:52:53,990 --> 01:52:54,000
um especially when that scientific
 

6505
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:55,830
um especially when that scientific
process is trying to get to the truth of

6506
01:52:55,830 --> 01:52:55,840
process is trying to get to the truth of
 

6507
01:52:55,840 --> 01:52:56,470
process is trying to get to the truth of
the human

6508
01:52:56,470 --> 01:52:56,480
the human
 

6509
01:52:56,480 --> 01:52:58,870
the human
organism which is so complicated so it's

6510
01:52:58,870 --> 01:52:58,880
organism which is so complicated so it's
 

6511
01:52:58,880 --> 01:53:00,790
organism which is so complicated so it's
very difficult to uh

6512
01:53:00,790 --> 01:53:00,800
very difficult to uh
 

6513
01:53:00,800 --> 01:53:03,030
very difficult to uh
to dissect to do to get the the the

6514
01:53:03,030 --> 01:53:03,040
to dissect to do to get the the the
 

6515
01:53:03,040 --> 01:53:04,310
to dissect to do to get the the the
strong effects

6516
01:53:04,310 --> 01:53:04,320
strong effects
 

6517
01:53:04,320 --> 01:53:06,629
strong effects
and when you're analyzing when you have

6518
01:53:06,629 --> 01:53:06,639
and when you're analyzing when you have
 

6519
01:53:06,639 --> 01:53:07,990
and when you're analyzing when you have
like raiders they're

6520
01:53:07,990 --> 01:53:08,000
like raiders they're
 

6521
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:11,109
like raiders they're
they're watching a video

6522
01:53:11,109 --> 01:53:11,119
they're watching a video
 

6523
01:53:11,119 --> 01:53:13,669
they're watching a video
there's removing subjectivity from that

6524
01:53:13,669 --> 01:53:13,679
there's removing subjectivity from that
 

6525
01:53:13,679 --> 01:53:15,350
there's removing subjectivity from that
is very very challenging

6526
01:53:15,350 --> 01:53:15,360
is very very challenging
 

6527
01:53:15,360 --> 01:53:18,709
is very very challenging
yeah very very much so um

6528
01:53:18,709 --> 01:53:18,719
yeah very very much so um
 

6529
01:53:18,719 --> 01:53:21,030
yeah very very much so um
and so we came to this agreement with

6530
01:53:21,030 --> 01:53:21,040
and so we came to this agreement with
 

6531
01:53:21,040 --> 01:53:21,750
and so we came to this agreement with
fda though

6532
01:53:21,750 --> 01:53:21,760
fda though
 

6533
01:53:21,760 --> 01:53:24,790
fda though
that we would um use this uh independent

6534
01:53:24,790 --> 01:53:24,800
that we would um use this uh independent
 

6535
01:53:24,800 --> 01:53:27,589
that we would um use this uh independent
raider pool and

6536
01:53:27,589 --> 01:53:27,599
raider pool and
 

6537
01:53:27,599 --> 01:53:30,709
raider pool and
and so we learned in in phase two again

6538
01:53:30,709 --> 01:53:30,719
and so we learned in in phase two again
 

6539
01:53:30,719 --> 01:53:32,310
and so we learned in in phase two again
that the double blind there was no

6540
01:53:32,310 --> 01:53:32,320
that the double blind there was no
 

6541
01:53:32,320 --> 01:53:34,149
that the double blind there was no
solution to the double blind problem and

6542
01:53:34,149 --> 01:53:34,159
solution to the double blind problem and
 

6543
01:53:34,159 --> 01:53:35,350
solution to the double blind problem and
and both the fda

6544
01:53:35,350 --> 01:53:35,360
and both the fda
 

6545
01:53:35,360 --> 01:53:37,270
and both the fda
and the european medicines agency in the

6546
01:53:37,270 --> 01:53:37,280
and the european medicines agency in the
 

6547
01:53:37,280 --> 01:53:38,390
and the european medicines agency in the
end agreed

6548
01:53:38,390 --> 01:53:38,400
end agreed
 

6549
01:53:38,400 --> 01:53:40,470
end agreed
that the best design was therapy with

6550
01:53:40,470 --> 01:53:40,480
that the best design was therapy with
 

6551
01:53:40,480 --> 01:53:41,750
that the best design was therapy with
inactive placebo

6552
01:53:41,750 --> 01:53:41,760
inactive placebo
 

6553
01:53:41,760 --> 01:53:43,830
inactive placebo
versus therapy with full dose mdma

6554
01:53:43,830 --> 01:53:43,840
versus therapy with full dose mdma
 

6555
01:53:43,840 --> 01:53:45,589
versus therapy with full dose mdma
accepting the fact that most people will

6556
01:53:45,589 --> 01:53:45,599
accepting the fact that most people will
 

6557
01:53:45,599 --> 01:53:46,709
accepting the fact that most people will
be able to tell

6558
01:53:46,709 --> 01:53:46,719
be able to tell
 

6559
01:53:46,719 --> 01:53:48,390
be able to tell
what whether they got nothing or they

6560
01:53:48,390 --> 01:53:48,400
what whether they got nothing or they
 

6561
01:53:48,400 --> 01:53:50,149
what whether they got nothing or they
got full dose mdma

6562
01:53:50,149 --> 01:53:50,159
got full dose mdma
 

6563
01:53:50,159 --> 01:53:51,830
got full dose mdma
most therapists will be able to tell the

6564
01:53:51,830 --> 01:53:51,840
most therapists will be able to tell the
 

6565
01:53:51,840 --> 01:53:54,070
most therapists will be able to tell the
difference but

6566
01:53:54,070 --> 01:53:54,080
difference but
 

6567
01:53:54,080 --> 01:53:56,149
difference but
that makes a harder test for us to show

6568
01:53:56,149 --> 01:53:56,159
that makes a harder test for us to show
 

6569
01:53:56,159 --> 01:53:57,669
that makes a harder test for us to show
a difference between the two groups

6570
01:53:57,669 --> 01:53:57,679
a difference between the two groups
 

6571
01:53:57,679 --> 01:53:59,510
a difference between the two groups
because we're giving them inactive

6572
01:53:59,510 --> 01:53:59,520
because we're giving them inactive
 

6573
01:53:59,520 --> 01:54:01,430
because we're giving them inactive
placebo and not the anti-therapeutic

6574
01:54:01,430 --> 01:54:01,440
placebo and not the anti-therapeutic
 

6575
01:54:01,440 --> 01:54:03,910
placebo and not the anti-therapeutic
effect of low-dose mdma

6576
01:54:03,910 --> 01:54:03,920
effect of low-dose mdma
 

6577
01:54:03,920 --> 01:54:06,390
effect of low-dose mdma
so once we started phase three so then

6578
01:54:06,390 --> 01:54:06,400
so once we started phase three so then
 

6579
01:54:06,400 --> 01:54:08,149
so once we started phase three so then
we were able to start

6580
01:54:08,149 --> 01:54:08,159
we were able to start
 

6581
01:54:08,159 --> 01:54:11,589
we were able to start
in 2018 phase three and the paper

6582
01:54:11,589 --> 01:54:11,599
in 2018 phase three and the paper
 

6583
01:54:11,599 --> 01:54:13,589
in 2018 phase three and the paper
in nature medicine that just came out

6584
01:54:13,589 --> 01:54:13,599
in nature medicine that just came out
 

6585
01:54:13,599 --> 01:54:15,189
in nature medicine that just came out
was the

6586
01:54:15,189 --> 01:54:15,199
was the
 

6587
01:54:15,199 --> 01:54:18,149
was the
results of our first phase three study

6588
01:54:18,149 --> 01:54:18,159
results of our first phase three study
 

6589
01:54:18,159 --> 01:54:18,550
results of our first phase three study
we

6590
01:54:18,550 --> 01:54:18,560
we
 

6591
01:54:18,560 --> 01:54:20,629
we
came to agreement with fda that we would

6592
01:54:20,629 --> 01:54:20,639
came to agreement with fda that we would
 

6593
01:54:20,639 --> 01:54:21,589
came to agreement with fda that we would
do two

6594
01:54:21,589 --> 01:54:21,599
do two
 

6595
01:54:21,599 --> 01:54:23,910
do two
phase three studies each would have 100

6596
01:54:23,910 --> 01:54:23,920
phase three studies each would have 100
 

6597
01:54:23,920 --> 01:54:25,830
phase three studies each would have 100
persons in them

6598
01:54:25,830 --> 01:54:25,840
persons in them
 

6599
01:54:25,840 --> 01:54:28,870
persons in them
and what the fda said to us is that they

6600
01:54:28,870 --> 01:54:28,880
and what the fda said to us is that they
 

6601
01:54:28,880 --> 01:54:30,470
and what the fda said to us is that they
thought that we could prove

6602
01:54:30,470 --> 01:54:30,480
thought that we could prove
 

6603
01:54:30,480 --> 01:54:33,750
thought that we could prove
efficacy with smaller numbers than they

6604
01:54:33,750 --> 01:54:33,760
efficacy with smaller numbers than they
 

6605
01:54:33,760 --> 01:54:36,390
efficacy with smaller numbers than they
wanted to see for safety

6606
01:54:36,390 --> 01:54:36,400
wanted to see for safety
 

6607
01:54:36,400 --> 01:54:38,070
wanted to see for safety
the reason they said that is that in

6608
01:54:38,070 --> 01:54:38,080
the reason they said that is that in
 

6609
01:54:38,080 --> 01:54:41,270
the reason they said that is that in
phase two we had a large effect size

6610
01:54:41,270 --> 01:54:41,280
phase two we had a large effect size
 

6611
01:54:41,280 --> 01:54:43,669
phase two we had a large effect size
so from a statistical point of view the

6612
01:54:43,669 --> 01:54:43,679
so from a statistical point of view the
 

6613
01:54:43,679 --> 01:54:44,470
so from a statistical point of view the
bigger of an

6614
01:54:44,470 --> 01:54:44,480
bigger of an
 

6615
01:54:44,480 --> 01:54:47,589
bigger of an
effect that you're looking for the fewer

6616
01:54:47,589 --> 01:54:47,599
effect that you're looking for the fewer
 

6617
01:54:47,599 --> 01:54:49,430
effect that you're looking for the fewer
number of people you need to get

6618
01:54:49,430 --> 01:54:49,440
number of people you need to get
 

6619
01:54:49,440 --> 01:54:51,189
number of people you need to get
statistical significance

6620
01:54:51,189 --> 01:54:51,199
statistical significance
 

6621
01:54:51,199 --> 01:54:52,629
statistical significance
when you're trying to find small

6622
01:54:52,629 --> 01:54:52,639
when you're trying to find small
 

6623
01:54:52,639 --> 01:54:54,390
when you're trying to find small
differences you need large numbers of

6624
01:54:54,390 --> 01:54:54,400
differences you need large numbers of
 

6625
01:54:54,400 --> 01:54:55,669
differences you need large numbers of
people to

6626
01:54:55,669 --> 01:54:55,679
people to
 

6627
01:54:55,679 --> 01:54:59,750
people to
sort of work out the noise um

6628
01:54:59,750 --> 01:54:59,760
sort of work out the noise um
 

6629
01:54:59,760 --> 01:55:02,149
sort of work out the noise um
so we were we came to agreement on two

6630
01:55:02,149 --> 01:55:02,159
so we were we came to agreement on two
 

6631
01:55:02,159 --> 01:55:04,870
so we were we came to agreement on two
100 person phase three studies

6632
01:55:04,870 --> 01:55:04,880
100 person phase three studies
 

6633
01:55:04,880 --> 01:55:06,950
100 person phase three studies
uh and the idea is that it's very

6634
01:55:06,950 --> 01:55:06,960
uh and the idea is that it's very
 

6635
01:55:06,960 --> 01:55:08,070
uh and the idea is that it's very
possible that the

6636
01:55:08,070 --> 01:55:08,080
possible that the
 

6637
01:55:08,080 --> 01:55:09,830
possible that the
the first part the first study would

6638
01:55:09,830 --> 01:55:09,840
the first part the first study would
 

6639
01:55:09,840 --> 01:55:11,109
the first part the first study would
show the efficacy

6640
01:55:11,109 --> 01:55:11,119
show the efficacy
 

6641
01:55:11,119 --> 01:55:13,430
show the efficacy
because the effect is so strong yeah

6642
01:55:13,430 --> 01:55:13,440
because the effect is so strong yeah
 

6643
01:55:13,440 --> 01:55:15,189
because the effect is so strong yeah
yeah and the second but but also

6644
01:55:15,189 --> 01:55:15,199
yeah and the second but but also
 

6645
01:55:15,199 --> 01:55:18,229
yeah and the second but but also
safety as well so so you know one of the

6646
01:55:18,229 --> 01:55:18,239
safety as well so so you know one of the
 

6647
01:55:18,239 --> 01:55:19,990
safety as well so so you know one of the
things we also realized when you work

6648
01:55:19,990 --> 01:55:20,000
things we also realized when you work
 

6649
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,229
things we also realized when you work
with a highly stigmatized drug

6650
01:55:22,229 --> 01:55:22,239
with a highly stigmatized drug
 

6651
01:55:22,239 --> 01:55:25,589
with a highly stigmatized drug
in the midst of still you know the drug

6652
01:55:25,589 --> 01:55:25,599
in the midst of still you know the drug
 

6653
01:55:25,599 --> 01:55:27,589
in the midst of still you know the drug
war and prohibition that we need

6654
01:55:27,589 --> 01:55:27,599
war and prohibition that we need
 

6655
01:55:27,599 --> 01:55:31,270
war and prohibition that we need
highly sympathetic subjects

6656
01:55:31,270 --> 01:55:31,280
highly sympathetic subjects
 

6657
01:55:31,280 --> 01:55:33,910
highly sympathetic subjects
and we need to make the best case we can

6658
01:55:33,910 --> 01:55:33,920
and we need to make the best case we can
 

6659
01:55:33,920 --> 01:55:35,189
and we need to make the best case we can
which means we need to work with the

6660
01:55:35,189 --> 01:55:35,199
which means we need to work with the
 

6661
01:55:35,199 --> 01:55:36,950
which means we need to work with the
hardest cases

6662
01:55:36,950 --> 01:55:36,960
hardest cases
 

6663
01:55:36,960 --> 01:55:39,030
hardest cases
so that this is really needed and so we

6664
01:55:39,030 --> 01:55:39,040
so that this is really needed and so we
 

6665
01:55:39,040 --> 01:55:40,790
so that this is really needed and so we
end up enrolling people

6666
01:55:40,790 --> 01:55:40,800
end up enrolling people
 

6667
01:55:40,800 --> 01:55:44,950
end up enrolling people
the first study was chronic severe ptsd

6668
01:55:44,950 --> 01:55:44,960
the first study was chronic severe ptsd
 

6669
01:55:44,960 --> 01:55:47,350
the first study was chronic severe ptsd
and unlike many studies of ptsd we

6670
01:55:47,350 --> 01:55:47,360
and unlike many studies of ptsd we
 

6671
01:55:47,360 --> 01:55:48,790
and unlike many studies of ptsd we
enroll people that have previously

6672
01:55:48,790 --> 01:55:48,800
enroll people that have previously
 

6673
01:55:48,800 --> 01:55:50,550
enroll people that have previously
attempted suicide

6674
01:55:50,550 --> 01:55:50,560
attempted suicide
 

6675
01:55:50,560 --> 01:55:53,189
attempted suicide
wow so we have multiple people that have

6676
01:55:53,189 --> 01:55:53,199
wow so we have multiple people that have
 

6677
01:55:53,199 --> 01:55:54,629
wow so we have multiple people that have
tried to kill themselves

6678
01:55:54,629 --> 01:55:54,639
tried to kill themselves
 

6679
01:55:54,639 --> 01:55:56,870
tried to kill themselves
that we felt like um if we were to

6680
01:55:56,870 --> 01:55:56,880
that we felt like um if we were to
 

6681
01:55:56,880 --> 01:55:58,310
that we felt like um if we were to
exclude them what are we doing

6682
01:55:58,310 --> 01:55:58,320
exclude them what are we doing
 

6683
01:55:58,320 --> 01:55:59,350
exclude them what are we doing
those are the people that need it the

6684
01:55:59,350 --> 01:55:59,360
those are the people that need it the
 

6685
01:55:59,360 --> 01:56:02,070
those are the people that need it the
most so

6686
01:56:02,070 --> 01:56:02,080
most so
 

6687
01:56:02,080 --> 01:56:04,229
most so
we we came to this agreement with fda

6688
01:56:04,229 --> 01:56:04,239
we we came to this agreement with fda
 

6689
01:56:04,239 --> 01:56:05,830
we we came to this agreement with fda
we're going to work with

6690
01:56:05,830 --> 01:56:05,840
we're going to work with
 

6691
01:56:05,840 --> 01:56:09,030
we're going to work with
chronic severe ptsd patients

6692
01:56:09,030 --> 01:56:09,040
chronic severe ptsd patients
 

6693
01:56:09,040 --> 01:56:10,229
chronic severe ptsd patients
including those that had attempted

6694
01:56:10,229 --> 01:56:10,239
including those that had attempted
 

6695
01:56:10,239 --> 01:56:12,550
including those that had attempted
suicide and

6696
01:56:12,550 --> 01:56:12,560
suicide and
 

6697
01:56:12,560 --> 01:56:14,790
suicide and
we would do these two 100 person studies

6698
01:56:14,790 --> 01:56:14,800
we would do these two 100 person studies
 

6699
01:56:14,800 --> 01:56:15,830
we would do these two 100 person studies
and

6700
01:56:15,830 --> 01:56:15,840
and
 

6701
01:56:15,840 --> 01:56:17,910
and
we also negotiated what's called an

6702
01:56:17,910 --> 01:56:17,920
we also negotiated what's called an
 

6703
01:56:17,920 --> 01:56:19,750
we also negotiated what's called an
interim analysis

6704
01:56:19,750 --> 01:56:19,760
interim analysis
 

6705
01:56:19,760 --> 01:56:22,629
interim analysis
so what that means is that when the

6706
01:56:22,629 --> 01:56:22,639
so what that means is that when the
 

6707
01:56:22,639 --> 01:56:23,189
so what that means is that when the
study

6708
01:56:23,189 --> 01:56:23,199
study
 

6709
01:56:23,199 --> 01:56:26,390
study
is um underway

6710
01:56:26,390 --> 01:56:26,400
is um underway
 

6711
01:56:26,400 --> 01:56:28,790
is um underway
um and often big big studies they have

6712
01:56:28,790 --> 01:56:28,800
um and often big big studies they have
 

6713
01:56:28,800 --> 01:56:30,310
um and often big big studies they have
this kind of interim analysis

6714
01:56:30,310 --> 01:56:30,320
this kind of interim analysis
 

6715
01:56:30,320 --> 01:56:32,310
this kind of interim analysis
where what you do is and for us we

6716
01:56:32,310 --> 01:56:32,320
where what you do is and for us we
 

6717
01:56:32,320 --> 01:56:34,149
where what you do is and for us we
negotiated when we had 60

6718
01:56:34,149 --> 01:56:34,159
negotiated when we had 60
 

6719
01:56:34,159 --> 01:56:36,070
negotiated when we had 60
or 60 people had reached the primary

6720
01:56:36,070 --> 01:56:36,080
or 60 people had reached the primary
 

6721
01:56:36,080 --> 01:56:37,270
or 60 people had reached the primary
outcome measure

6722
01:56:37,270 --> 01:56:37,280
outcome measure
 

6723
01:56:37,280 --> 01:56:39,990
outcome measure
and all hundred had been enrolled then

6724
01:56:39,990 --> 01:56:40,000
and all hundred had been enrolled then
 

6725
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:41,990
and all hundred had been enrolled then
we would take a look at the data

6726
01:56:41,990 --> 01:56:42,000
we would take a look at the data
 

6727
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:45,990
we would take a look at the data
and if the statistical analysis that we

6728
01:56:45,990 --> 01:56:46,000
and if the statistical analysis that we
 

6729
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:46,950
and if the statistical analysis that we
did

6730
01:56:46,950 --> 01:56:46,960
did
 

6731
01:56:46,960 --> 01:56:51,350
did
was showing you know based on a certain

6732
01:56:51,350 --> 01:56:51,360
was showing you know based on a certain
 

6733
01:56:51,360 --> 01:56:53,189
was showing you know based on a certain
effect size that we chose based on what

6734
01:56:53,189 --> 01:56:53,199
effect size that we chose based on what
 

6735
01:56:53,199 --> 01:56:54,870
effect size that we chose based on what
we saw in phase two

6736
01:56:54,870 --> 01:56:54,880
we saw in phase two
 

6737
01:56:54,880 --> 01:56:56,629
we saw in phase two
the interim analysis is for what's

6738
01:56:56,629 --> 01:56:56,639
the interim analysis is for what's
 

6739
01:56:56,639 --> 01:56:59,109
the interim analysis is for what's
called sample size re-estimation

6740
01:56:59,109 --> 01:56:59,119
called sample size re-estimation
 

6741
01:56:59,119 --> 01:57:00,629
called sample size re-estimation
so what it means is if the results

6742
01:57:00,629 --> 01:57:00,639
so what it means is if the results
 

6743
01:57:00,639 --> 01:57:01,990
so what it means is if the results
aren't as good as you thought they would

6744
01:57:01,990 --> 01:57:02,000
aren't as good as you thought they would
 

6745
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:03,990
aren't as good as you thought they would
you can add more people

6746
01:57:03,990 --> 01:57:04,000
you can add more people
 

6747
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:06,070
you can add more people
and then you'll get statistical

6748
01:57:06,070 --> 01:57:06,080
and then you'll get statistical
 

6749
01:57:06,080 --> 01:57:07,589
and then you'll get statistical
significance

6750
01:57:07,589 --> 01:57:07,599
significance
 

6751
01:57:07,599 --> 01:57:09,030
significance
it means that your effect isn't as

6752
01:57:09,030 --> 01:57:09,040
it means that your effect isn't as
 

6753
01:57:09,040 --> 01:57:11,030
it means that your effect isn't as
strong as you thought it'll be harder to

6754
01:57:11,030 --> 01:57:11,040
strong as you thought it'll be harder to
 

6755
01:57:11,040 --> 01:57:13,109
strong as you thought it'll be harder to
get insurance to coverage but fda will

6756
01:57:13,109 --> 01:57:13,119
get insurance to coverage but fda will
 

6757
01:57:13,119 --> 01:57:14,310
get insurance to coverage but fda will
still approve it

6758
01:57:14,310 --> 01:57:14,320
still approve it
 

6759
01:57:14,320 --> 01:57:17,189
still approve it
because fdl also believes that these are

6760
01:57:17,189 --> 01:57:17,199
because fdl also believes that these are
 

6761
01:57:17,199 --> 01:57:17,589
because fdl also believes that these are
group

6762
01:57:17,589 --> 01:57:17,599
group
 

6763
01:57:17,599 --> 01:57:19,750
group
averages there may be some people that

6764
01:57:19,750 --> 01:57:19,760
averages there may be some people that
 

6765
01:57:19,760 --> 01:57:21,350
averages there may be some people that
will later figure out respond better

6766
01:57:21,350 --> 01:57:21,360
will later figure out respond better
 

6767
01:57:21,360 --> 01:57:22,390
will later figure out respond better
than others

6768
01:57:22,390 --> 01:57:22,400
than others
 

6769
01:57:22,400 --> 01:57:23,669
than others
so they'll approve it if it's

6770
01:57:23,669 --> 01:57:23,679
so they'll approve it if it's
 

6771
01:57:23,679 --> 01:57:25,589
so they'll approve it if it's
statistically significant even if it has

6772
01:57:25,589 --> 01:57:25,599
statistically significant even if it has
 

6773
01:57:25,599 --> 01:57:27,189
statistically significant even if it has
a low effect size

6774
01:57:27,189 --> 01:57:27,199
a low effect size
 

6775
01:57:27,199 --> 01:57:30,629
a low effect size
the ssris have low effect size so

6776
01:57:30,629 --> 01:57:30,639
the ssris have low effect size so
 

6777
01:57:30,639 --> 01:57:34,550
the ssris have low effect size so
we did the interim analysis in march of

6778
01:57:34,550 --> 01:57:34,560
we did the interim analysis in march of
 

6779
01:57:34,560 --> 01:57:35,750
we did the interim analysis in march of
2020

6780
01:57:35,750 --> 01:57:35,760
2020
 

6781
01:57:35,760 --> 01:57:38,070
2020
and what we discovered to our delight

6782
01:57:38,070 --> 01:57:38,080
and what we discovered to our delight
 

6783
01:57:38,080 --> 01:57:38,950
and what we discovered to our delight
was that

6784
01:57:38,950 --> 01:57:38,960
was that
 

6785
01:57:38,960 --> 01:57:41,589
was that
um we did not need to add any subjects

6786
01:57:41,589 --> 01:57:41,599
um we did not need to add any subjects
 

6787
01:57:41,599 --> 01:57:43,830
um we did not need to add any subjects
that's all we were told we weren't told

6788
01:57:43,830 --> 01:57:43,840
that's all we were told we weren't told
 

6789
01:57:43,840 --> 01:57:46,149
that's all we were told we weren't told
like what is the results we were just

6790
01:57:46,149 --> 01:57:46,159
like what is the results we were just
 

6791
01:57:46,159 --> 01:57:47,589
like what is the results we were just
told all we were going to get is a

6792
01:57:47,589 --> 01:57:47,599
told all we were going to get is a
 

6793
01:57:47,599 --> 01:57:48,149
told all we were going to get is a
number

6794
01:57:48,149 --> 01:57:48,159

6795
01:57:48,159 --> 01:57:50,070
number
zero or you need to add x numbers of

6796
01:57:50,070 --> 01:57:50,080
zero or you need to add x numbers of
 

6797
01:57:50,080 --> 01:57:51,510
zero or you need to add x numbers of
people to the study to get the

6798
01:57:51,510 --> 01:57:51,520
people to the study to get the
 

6799
01:57:51,520 --> 01:57:53,589
people to the study to get the
statistical significance that's right

6800
01:57:53,589 --> 01:57:53,599
statistical significance that's right
 

6801
01:57:53,599 --> 01:57:55,270
statistical significance that's right
around the time that covet hit

6802
01:57:55,270 --> 01:57:55,280
around the time that covet hit
 

6803
01:57:55,280 --> 01:57:57,750
around the time that covet hit
and lockdowns happened and we ended up

6804
01:57:57,750 --> 01:57:57,760
and lockdowns happened and we ended up
 

6805
01:57:57,760 --> 01:57:59,910
and lockdowns happened and we ended up
negotiating with fda that we would end

6806
01:57:59,910 --> 01:57:59,920
negotiating with fda that we would end
 

6807
01:57:59,920 --> 01:58:04,709
negotiating with fda that we would end
the study with 90 people instead of 100.

6808
01:58:04,709 --> 01:58:04,719

 

6809
01:58:04,719 --> 01:58:06,310

it took a while for us to end up doing

6810
01:58:06,310 --> 01:58:06,320
it took a while for us to end up doing
 

6811
01:58:06,320 --> 01:58:08,310
it took a while for us to end up doing
that so the paper that we just published

6812
01:58:08,310 --> 01:58:08,320
that so the paper that we just published
 

6813
01:58:08,320 --> 01:58:11,350
that so the paper that we just published
is on the results of 90 people i think

6814
01:58:11,350 --> 01:58:11,360
is on the results of 90 people i think
 

6815
01:58:11,360 --> 01:58:14,229
is on the results of 90 people i think
it was 46 in the mdma group 44 in the

6816
01:58:14,229 --> 01:58:14,239
it was 46 in the mdma group 44 in the
 

6817
01:58:14,239 --> 01:58:17,750
it was 46 in the mdma group 44 in the
placebo group and what we

6818
01:58:17,750 --> 01:58:17,760
placebo group and what we
 

6819
01:58:17,760 --> 01:58:21,030
placebo group and what we
discovered was that the study worked

6820
01:58:21,030 --> 01:58:21,040
discovered was that the study worked
 

6821
01:58:21,040 --> 01:58:23,189
discovered was that the study worked
better than we had even hoped

6822
01:58:23,189 --> 01:58:23,199
better than we had even hoped
 

6823
01:58:23,199 --> 01:58:25,830
better than we had even hoped
so the first thing is that you look at

6824
01:58:25,830 --> 01:58:25,840
so the first thing is that you look at
 

6825
01:58:25,840 --> 01:58:27,589
so the first thing is that you look at
statistical significance you have to get

6826
01:58:27,589 --> 01:58:27,599
statistical significance you have to get
 

6827
01:58:27,599 --> 01:58:28,470
statistical significance you have to get
0.05

6828
01:58:28,470 --> 01:58:28,480
0.05
 

6829
01:58:28,480 --> 01:58:30,149
0.05
which basically means a nickel out of a

6830
01:58:30,149 --> 01:58:30,159
which basically means a nickel out of a
 

6831
01:58:30,159 --> 01:58:32,310
which basically means a nickel out of a
dollar a 1 in 20 chance

6832
01:58:32,310 --> 01:58:32,320
dollar a 1 in 20 chance
 

6833
01:58:32,320 --> 01:58:33,830
dollar a 1 in 20 chance
that the difference between the two

6834
01:58:33,830 --> 01:58:33,840
that the difference between the two
 

6835
01:58:33,840 --> 01:58:36,229
that the difference between the two
groups is due to some random factor

6836
01:58:36,229 --> 01:58:36,239
groups is due to some random factor
 

6837
01:58:36,239 --> 01:58:38,070
groups is due to some random factor
rather than to your intervention

6838
01:58:38,070 --> 01:58:38,080
rather than to your intervention
 

6839
01:58:38,080 --> 01:58:40,950
rather than to your intervention
and in this case the the placebo group

6840
01:58:40,950 --> 01:58:40,960
and in this case the the placebo group
 

6841
01:58:40,960 --> 01:58:42,790
and in this case the the placebo group
gets therapy

6842
01:58:42,790 --> 01:58:42,800
gets therapy
 

6843
01:58:42,800 --> 01:58:45,189
gets therapy
and then with inactive placebo and then

6844
01:58:45,189 --> 01:58:45,199
and then with inactive placebo and then
 

6845
01:58:45,199 --> 01:58:46,709
and then with inactive placebo and then
the

6846
01:58:46,709 --> 01:58:46,719
the
 

6847
01:58:46,719 --> 01:58:49,990
the
group gets mdma with active placebo so

6848
01:58:49,990 --> 01:58:50,000
group gets mdma with active placebo so
 

6849
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:52,870
group gets mdma with active placebo so
you have to get .05 there's another

6850
01:58:52,870 --> 01:58:52,880
you have to get .05 there's another
 

6851
01:58:52,880 --> 01:58:53,910
you have to get .05 there's another
measure

6852
01:58:53,910 --> 01:58:53,920
measure
 

6853
01:58:53,920 --> 01:58:55,750
measure
that the fda uses sometimes called

6854
01:58:55,750 --> 01:58:55,760
that the fda uses sometimes called
 

6855
01:58:55,760 --> 01:58:57,990
that the fda uses sometimes called
robust which means

6856
01:58:57,990 --> 01:58:58,000
robust which means
 

6857
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:00,149
robust which means
one in a thousand instead of one in

6858
01:59:00,149 --> 01:59:00,159
one in a thousand instead of one in
 

6859
01:59:00,159 --> 01:59:01,990
one in a thousand instead of one in
twenty one in a thousand and if you get

6860
01:59:01,990 --> 01:59:02,000
twenty one in a thousand and if you get
 

6861
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:03,030
twenty one in a thousand and if you get
a robust

6862
01:59:03,030 --> 01:59:03,040
a robust
 

6863
01:59:03,040 --> 01:59:06,550
a robust

and you meet some other criteria they

6866
01:59:09,669 --> 01:59:09,679
and you meet some other criteria they
 

6867
01:59:09,679 --> 01:59:11,669
and you meet some other criteria they
might agree to approve the drug on the

01:59:11,679 --> 01:59:12,550
might agree to approve the drug on the
basis of just

01:59:12,550 --> 01:59:12,560
basis of just

01:59:12,560 --> 01:59:15,030
basis of just
one phase three study instead of two

6872
01:59:15,030 --> 01:59:15,040
one phase three study instead of two
 

6873
01:59:15,040 --> 01:59:15,990
one phase three study instead of two
because when you think about

6874
01:59:15,990 --> 01:59:16,000
because when you think about
 

6875
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:18,390
because when you think about
it a one in 20 chance for your first

6876
01:59:18,390 --> 01:59:18,400
it a one in 20 chance for your first
 

6877
01:59:18,400 --> 01:59:19,030
it a one in 20 chance for your first
seconds to

6878
01:59:19,030 --> 01:59:19,040
seconds to
 

6879
01:59:19,040 --> 01:59:21,189
seconds to
a phase three study a one in 20 chance

a phase three study a one in 20 chance
 

6881
01:59:21,199 --> 01:59:23,189
a phase three study a one in 20 chance
for your second phase three study you

6882
01:59:23,189 --> 01:59:23,199
for your second phase three study you
 

6883
01:59:23,199 --> 01:59:24,790
for your second phase three study you
multiply that together it's one in four

6884
01:59:24,790 --> 01:59:24,800
multiply that together it's one in four
 

6885
01:59:24,800 --> 01:59:25,750
multiply that together it's one in four
hundred

6886
01:59:25,750 --> 01:59:25,760
hundred
 

6887
01:59:25,760 --> 01:59:30,790

6889
01:59:30,800 --> 01:59:34,950

that's pretty good so robust .001 is

6890
01:59:34,950 --> 01:59:34,960
that's pretty good so robust .001 is
 

6891
01:59:34,960 --> 01:59:36,310
that's pretty good so robust .001 is
even better than

6892
01:59:36,310 --> 01:59:36,320
even better than
 

6893
01:59:36,320 --> 01:59:38,629
even better than
two independent phase three studies each

6894
01:59:38,629 --> 01:59:38,639
two independent phase three studies each
 

6895
01:59:38,639 --> 01:59:41,109
two independent phase three studies each
at .05

6896
01:59:41,109 --> 01:59:41,119
at .05
 

6897
01:59:41,119 --> 01:59:43,109
at .05
what we ended up getting was one in ten

6898
01:59:43,109 --> 01:59:43,119
what we ended up getting was one in ten
 

6899
01:59:43,119 --> 01:59:44,149
what we ended up getting was one in ten
thousand point zero

6900
01:59:44,149 --> 01:59:44,159

6901
01:59:44,159 --> 01:59:47,430

zero zero one outrageous

6902
01:59:47,430 --> 01:59:47,440
zero zero one outrageous
 

6903
01:59:47,440 --> 01:59:50,149
zero zero one outrageous
yeah you know incredibly so that's a

6904
01:59:50,149 --> 01:59:50,159
yeah you know incredibly so that's a
 

6905
01:59:50,159 --> 01:59:51,669
yeah you know incredibly so that's a
measure of both the difference between

6906
01:59:51,669 --> 01:59:51,679
measure of both the difference between
 

6907
01:59:51,679 --> 01:59:54,470
measure of both the difference between
the two groups and the variability

6908
01:59:54,470 --> 01:59:54,480
the two groups and the variability
 

6909
01:59:54,480 --> 01:59:57,189
the two groups and the variability
and so what it meant is that we had

6910
01:59:57,189 --> 01:59:57,199
and so what it meant is that we had
 

6911
01:59:57,199 --> 01:59:58,709
and so what it meant is that we had
minimal variability

6912
01:59:58,709 --> 01:59:58,719
minimal variability
 

6913
01:59:58,719 --> 02:00:01,350
minimal variability
that most people who got to mba got

6914
02:00:01,350 --> 02:00:01,360
that most people who got to mba got
 

6915
02:00:01,360 --> 02:00:01,990
that most people who got to mba got
quite a large

6916
02:00:01,990 --> 02:00:02,000
quite a large
 

6917
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:03,910
quite a large
amount of benefit from it and most

6918
02:00:03,910 --> 02:00:03,920
amount of benefit from it and most
 

6919
02:00:03,920 --> 02:00:05,109
amount of benefit from it and most
people who got the placebo

6920
02:00:05,109 --> 02:00:05,119
people who got the placebo
 

6921
02:00:05,119 --> 02:00:06,629
people who got the placebo
were more or less in the same range as

6922
02:00:06,629 --> 02:00:06,639
were more or less in the same range as
 

6923
02:00:06,639 --> 02:00:08,790
were more or less in the same range as
well that's really exciting by the way i

6924
02:00:08,790 --> 02:00:08,800
well that's really exciting by the way i
 

6925
02:00:08,800 --> 02:00:09,410
well that's really exciting by the way i
mean

6926
02:00:09,410 --> 02:00:09,420
mean
 

6927
02:00:09,420 --> 02:00:11,189
mean
[Laughter]

6928
02:00:11,189 --> 02:00:11,199
[Laughter]
 

6929
02:00:11,199 --> 02:00:13,669
[Laughter]
mean i i i suppose it's exciting from a

6930
02:00:13,669 --> 02:00:13,679
mean i i i suppose it's exciting from a
 

6931
02:00:13,679 --> 02:00:14,470
mean i i i suppose it's exciting from a
perspective of

6932
02:00:14,470 --> 02:00:14,480
perspective of
 

6933
02:00:14,480 --> 02:00:17,270
perspective of
approval by the fda maybe perhaps that's

6934
02:00:17,270 --> 02:00:17,280
approval by the fda maybe perhaps that's
 

6935
02:00:17,280 --> 02:00:19,589
approval by the fda maybe perhaps that's
the way you're seeing it but it's also

6936
02:00:19,589 --> 02:00:19,599
the way you're seeing it but it's also
 

6937
02:00:19,599 --> 02:00:23,030
the way you're seeing it but it's also
exciting because it's it has a chance to

6938
02:00:23,030 --> 02:00:23,040
exciting because it's it has a chance to
 

6939
02:00:23,040 --> 02:00:24,870
exciting because it's it has a chance to
help people that are truly suffering

6940
02:00:24,870 --> 02:00:24,880
help people that are truly suffering
 

6941
02:00:24,880 --> 02:00:28,229
help people that are truly suffering
yeah well if we can get one in uh 10

6942
02:00:28,229 --> 02:00:28,239
yeah well if we can get one in uh 10
 

6943
02:00:28,239 --> 02:00:31,270
yeah well if we can get one in uh 10
000 in the first phase three study

6944
02:00:31,270 --> 02:00:31,280
000 in the first phase three study
 

6945
02:00:31,280 --> 02:00:33,189
000 in the first phase three study
chances are we can get one in 20 in the

6946
02:00:33,189 --> 02:00:33,199
chances are we can get one in 20 in the
 

6947
02:00:33,199 --> 02:00:34,310
chances are we can get one in 20 in the
second

6948
02:00:34,310 --> 02:00:34,320
second
 

6949
02:00:34,320 --> 02:00:36,390
second
so it's really going to be about safety

6950
02:00:36,390 --> 02:00:36,400
so it's really going to be about safety
 

6951
02:00:36,400 --> 02:00:38,310
so it's really going to be about safety
for us in the second phase three study

6952
02:00:38,310 --> 02:00:38,320
for us in the second phase three study
 

6953
02:00:38,320 --> 02:00:41,510
for us in the second phase three study
yeah now you can have

6954
02:00:41,510 --> 02:00:41,520
yeah now you can have
 

6955
02:00:41,520 --> 02:00:45,669
yeah now you can have
a large p value a large significance

6956
02:00:45,669 --> 02:00:45,679
a large p value a large significance
 

6957
02:00:45,679 --> 02:00:48,229
a large p value a large significance
but you could have an effect that's not

6958
02:00:48,229 --> 02:00:48,239
but you could have an effect that's not
 

6959
02:00:48,239 --> 02:00:49,589
but you could have an effect that's not
very significant

6960
02:00:49,589 --> 02:00:49,599
very significant
 

6961
02:00:49,599 --> 02:00:51,270
very significant
it's not clinically significant you can

6962
02:00:51,270 --> 02:00:51,280
it's not clinically significant you can
 

6963
02:00:51,280 --> 02:00:53,350
it's not clinically significant you can
have statistical significance without

6964
02:00:53,350 --> 02:00:53,360
have statistical significance without
 

6965
02:00:53,360 --> 02:00:56,470
have statistical significance without
clinical significance and as i said the

6966
02:00:56,470 --> 02:00:56,480
clinical significance and as i said the
 

6967
02:00:56,480 --> 02:00:58,070
clinical significance and as i said the
the more people you get in the study you

6968
02:00:58,070 --> 02:00:58,080
the more people you get in the study you
 

6969
02:00:58,080 --> 02:00:59,830
the more people you get in the study you
can find smaller and smaller differences

6970
02:00:59,830 --> 02:00:59,840
can find smaller and smaller differences
 

6971
02:00:59,840 --> 02:01:01,910
can find smaller and smaller differences
between two groups

6972
02:01:01,910 --> 02:01:01,920
between two groups
 

6973
02:01:01,920 --> 02:01:05,350
between two groups
now we showed that we had um

6974
02:01:05,350 --> 02:01:05,360
now we showed that we had um
 

6975
02:01:05,360 --> 02:01:08,229
now we showed that we had um
a very large effect size so effect size

6976
02:01:08,229 --> 02:01:08,239
a very large effect size so effect size
 

6977
02:01:08,239 --> 02:01:09,189
a very large effect size so effect size
is based on

6978
02:01:09,189 --> 02:01:09,199
is based on
 

6979
02:01:09,199 --> 02:01:11,830
is based on
um that scale you mentioned well well

6980
02:01:11,830 --> 02:01:11,840
um that scale you mentioned well well
 

6981
02:01:11,840 --> 02:01:13,510
um that scale you mentioned well well
the scale of the effect size

6982
02:01:13,510 --> 02:01:13,520
the scale of the effect size
 

6983
02:01:13,520 --> 02:01:17,189
the scale of the effect size
is based on standard deviations

6984
02:01:17,189 --> 02:01:17,199
is based on standard deviations
 

6985
02:01:17,199 --> 02:01:19,910
is based on standard deviations
so an effect size of one means that your

6986
02:01:19,910 --> 02:01:19,920
so an effect size of one means that your
 

6987
02:01:19,920 --> 02:01:21,990
so an effect size of one means that your
results are one standard deviation away

6988
02:01:21,990 --> 02:01:22,000
results are one standard deviation away
 

6989
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:24,229
results are one standard deviation away
from the norm that's considered very

6990
02:01:24,229 --> 02:01:24,239
from the norm that's considered very
 

6991
02:01:24,239 --> 02:01:25,910
from the norm that's considered very
large

6992
02:01:25,910 --> 02:01:25,920
large
 

6993
02:01:25,920 --> 02:01:28,950
large
the the ssris because they have they

6994
02:01:28,950 --> 02:01:28,960
the the ssris because they have they
 

6995
02:01:28,960 --> 02:01:31,350
the the ssris because they have they
were like .3.4

6996
02:01:31,350 --> 02:01:31,360
were like .3.4
 

6997
02:01:31,360 --> 02:01:33,350
were like .3.4
effect size that's considered small

6998
02:01:33,350 --> 02:01:33,360
effect size that's considered small
 

6999
02:01:33,360 --> 02:01:35,189
effect size that's considered small
effect size medium is starting to be

7000
02:01:35,189 --> 02:01:35,199
effect size medium is starting to be
 

7001
02:01:35,199 --> 02:01:36,950
effect size medium is starting to be
around 0.6

7002
02:01:36,950 --> 02:01:36,960
around 0.6
 

7003
02:01:36,960 --> 02:01:41,430
around 0.6
and 0.8 and above are large effect sizes

7004
02:01:41,430 --> 02:01:41,440
and 0.8 and above are large effect sizes
 

7005
02:01:41,440 --> 02:01:44,870
and 0.8 and above are large effect sizes
we had what's called placebo subtracted

7006
02:01:44,870 --> 02:01:44,880
we had what's called placebo subtracted
 

7007
02:01:44,880 --> 02:01:46,310
we had what's called placebo subtracted
effect size there's two different ways

7008
02:01:46,310 --> 02:01:46,320
effect size there's two different ways
 

7009
02:01:46,320 --> 02:01:47,990
effect size there's two different ways
to look at it placebo subtracted means

7010
02:01:47,990 --> 02:01:48,000
to look at it placebo subtracted means
 

7011
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:49,270
to look at it placebo subtracted means
you kind of look at the difference

7012
02:01:49,270 --> 02:01:49,280
you kind of look at the difference
 

7013
02:01:49,280 --> 02:01:49,990
you kind of look at the difference
between your two

7014
02:01:49,990 --> 02:01:50,000
between your two
 

7015
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:53,270
between your two
groups and and what that is for us since

7016
02:01:53,270 --> 02:01:53,280
groups and and what that is for us since
 

7017
02:01:53,280 --> 02:01:54,870
groups and and what that is for us since
one group had therapy and one had

7018
02:01:54,870 --> 02:01:54,880
one group had therapy and one had
 

7019
02:01:54,880 --> 02:01:57,589
one group had therapy and one had
therapy plus mdma the placebo subtracted

7020
02:01:57,589 --> 02:01:57,599
therapy plus mdma the placebo subtracted
 

7021
02:01:57,599 --> 02:01:58,790
therapy plus mdma the placebo subtracted
effect size

7022
02:01:58,790 --> 02:01:58,800
effect size
 

7023
02:01:58,800 --> 02:02:01,830
effect size
is basically the effect of just the mdma

7024
02:02:01,830 --> 02:02:01,840
is basically the effect of just the mdma
 

7025
02:02:01,840 --> 02:02:03,109
is basically the effect of just the mdma
because you've kind of washed out the

7026
02:02:03,109 --> 02:02:03,119
because you've kind of washed out the
 

7027
02:02:03,119 --> 02:02:05,189
because you've kind of washed out the
therapy that was 0.91

7028
02:02:05,189 --> 02:02:05,199
therapy that was 0.91
 

7029
02:02:05,199 --> 02:02:08,070
therapy that was 0.91
so we had a large effect size which was

7030
02:02:08,070 --> 02:02:08,080
so we had a large effect size which was
 

7031
02:02:08,080 --> 02:02:08,470
so we had a large effect size which was
different

7032
02:02:08,470 --> 02:02:08,480
different
 

7033
02:02:08,480 --> 02:02:11,270
different
wow over so 0.91 over the just the

7034
02:02:11,270 --> 02:02:11,280
wow over so 0.91 over the just the
 

7035
02:02:11,280 --> 02:02:13,030
wow over so 0.91 over the just the
therapy so over the placebo

7036
02:02:13,030 --> 02:02:13,040
therapy so over the placebo
 

7037
02:02:13,040 --> 02:02:16,390
therapy so over the placebo
yeah wow now when we do the

7038
02:02:16,390 --> 02:02:16,400
yeah wow now when we do the
 

7039
02:02:16,400 --> 02:02:18,709
yeah wow now when we do the
within group meaning the group that just

7040
02:02:18,709 --> 02:02:18,719
within group meaning the group that just
 

7041
02:02:18,719 --> 02:02:19,830
within group meaning the group that just
got the

7042
02:02:19,830 --> 02:02:19,840
got the
 

7043
02:02:19,840 --> 02:02:22,470
got the
mdma plus therapy look at their baseline

7044
02:02:22,470 --> 02:02:22,480
mdma plus therapy look at their baseline
 

7045
02:02:22,480 --> 02:02:23,830
mdma plus therapy look at their baseline
and their outcomes

7046
02:02:23,830 --> 02:02:23,840
and their outcomes
 

7047
02:02:23,840 --> 02:02:25,350
and their outcomes
that's another way to look at it and

7048
02:02:25,350 --> 02:02:25,360
that's another way to look at it and
 

7049
02:02:25,360 --> 02:02:26,709
that's another way to look at it and
that's what's going to actually happen

7050
02:02:26,709 --> 02:02:26,719
that's what's going to actually happen
 

7051
02:02:26,719 --> 02:02:27,990
that's what's going to actually happen
in practice because people are going to

7052
02:02:27,990 --> 02:02:28,000
in practice because people are going to
 

7053
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:29,910
in practice because people are going to
get mdma plus

7054
02:02:29,910 --> 02:02:29,920
get mdma plus
 

7055
02:02:29,920 --> 02:02:32,950
get mdma plus
therapy that's 2.1 effect size two

7056
02:02:32,950 --> 02:02:32,960
therapy that's 2.1 effect size two
 

7057
02:02:32,960 --> 02:02:34,950
therapy that's 2.1 effect size two
standard deviations away from the norm

7058
02:02:34,950 --> 02:02:34,960
standard deviations away from the norm
 

7059
02:02:34,960 --> 02:02:38,149
standard deviations away from the norm
is enormous effect size yeah

7060
02:02:38,149 --> 02:02:38,159
is enormous effect size yeah
 

7061
02:02:38,159 --> 02:02:42,070
is enormous effect size yeah
the other part is that we had

7062
02:02:42,070 --> 02:02:42,080
the other part is that we had
 

7063
02:02:42,080 --> 02:02:44,470
the other part is that we had
no effect by sight which is very

7064
02:02:44,470 --> 02:02:44,480
no effect by sight which is very
 

7065
02:02:44,480 --> 02:02:46,229
no effect by sight which is very
important so we had 15 sites two in

7066
02:02:46,229 --> 02:02:46,239
important so we had 15 sites two in
 

7067
02:02:46,239 --> 02:02:48,310
important so we had 15 sites two in
israel two in canada 11 throughout the

7068
02:02:48,310 --> 02:02:48,320
israel two in canada 11 throughout the
 

7069
02:02:48,320 --> 02:02:50,709
israel two in canada 11 throughout the
united states

7070
02:02:50,709 --> 02:02:50,719
united states
 

7071
02:02:50,719 --> 02:02:53,189
united states
the fda looks at is there a side effect

7072
02:02:53,189 --> 02:02:53,199
the fda looks at is there a side effect
 

7073
02:02:53,199 --> 02:02:54,790
the fda looks at is there a side effect
because what that might mean is maybe

7074
02:02:54,790 --> 02:02:54,800
because what that might mean is maybe
 

7075
02:02:54,800 --> 02:02:56,070
because what that might mean is maybe
you've got all your patients

7076
02:02:56,070 --> 02:02:56,080
you've got all your patients
 

7077
02:02:56,080 --> 02:02:57,589
you've got all your patients
or most of your patients going to this

7078
02:02:57,589 --> 02:02:57,599
or most of your patients going to this
 

7079
02:02:57,599 --> 02:02:59,510
or most of your patients going to this
one site which is these highly

7080
02:02:59,510 --> 02:02:59,520
one site which is these highly
 

7081
02:02:59,520 --> 02:03:01,589
one site which is these highly
experienced therapists and they're like

7082
02:03:01,589 --> 02:03:01,599
experienced therapists and they're like
 

7083
02:03:01,599 --> 02:03:03,030
experienced therapists and they're like
you know hippies from way back

7084
02:03:03,030 --> 02:03:03,040
you know hippies from way back
 

7085
02:03:03,040 --> 02:03:04,149
you know hippies from way back
and they're super experienced with

7086
02:03:04,149 --> 02:03:04,159
and they're super experienced with
 

7087
02:03:04,159 --> 02:03:06,310
and they're super experienced with
psychedelics and you know and they're

7088
02:03:06,310 --> 02:03:06,320
psychedelics and you know and they're
 

7089
02:03:06,320 --> 02:03:07,669
psychedelics and you know and they're
they're getting great results but nobody

7090
02:03:07,669 --> 02:03:07,679
they're getting great results but nobody
 

7091
02:03:07,679 --> 02:03:09,109
they're getting great results but nobody
else gets good results

7092
02:03:09,109 --> 02:03:09,119
else gets good results
 

7093
02:03:09,119 --> 02:03:11,350
else gets good results
so we had no effect by sight which means

7094
02:03:11,350 --> 02:03:11,360
so we had no effect by sight which means
 

7095
02:03:11,360 --> 02:03:12,229
so we had no effect by sight which means
that's incredible

7096
02:03:12,229 --> 02:03:12,239
that's incredible
 

7097
02:03:12,239 --> 02:03:13,910
that's incredible
that we've been able to train all these

7098
02:03:13,910 --> 02:03:13,920
that we've been able to train all these
 

7099
02:03:13,920 --> 02:03:16,629
that we've been able to train all these
new therapists we had about um

7100
02:03:16,629 --> 02:03:16,639
new therapists we had about um
 

7101
02:03:16,639 --> 02:03:18,709
new therapists we had about um
about 80 therapists working at all these

7102
02:03:18,709 --> 02:03:18,719
about 80 therapists working at all these
 

7103
02:03:18,719 --> 02:03:20,229
about 80 therapists working at all these
15 sites

7104
02:03:20,229 --> 02:03:20,239
15 sites
 

7105
02:03:20,239 --> 02:03:23,430
15 sites
we also discovered that there's a group

7106
02:03:23,430 --> 02:03:23,440
we also discovered that there's a group
 

7107
02:03:23,440 --> 02:03:25,589
we also discovered that there's a group
that's considered to be

7108
02:03:25,589 --> 02:03:25,599
that's considered to be
 

7109
02:03:25,599 --> 02:03:27,430
that's considered to be
very difficult to treat which is called

7110
02:03:27,430 --> 02:03:27,440
very difficult to treat which is called
 

7111
02:03:27,440 --> 02:03:29,830
very difficult to treat which is called
the dissociative subtype

7112
02:03:29,830 --> 02:03:29,840
the dissociative subtype
 

7113
02:03:29,840 --> 02:03:33,030
the dissociative subtype
so when people are traumatized

7114
02:03:33,030 --> 02:03:33,040
so when people are traumatized
 

7115
02:03:33,040 --> 02:03:36,550
so when people are traumatized
one of the ways to psychologically

7116
02:03:36,550 --> 02:03:36,560
one of the ways to psychologically
 

7117
02:03:36,560 --> 02:03:37,669
one of the ways to psychologically
survive that

7118
02:03:37,669 --> 02:03:37,679
survive that
 

7119
02:03:37,679 --> 02:03:39,510
survive that
is you dissociate it's like you're not

7120
02:03:39,510 --> 02:03:39,520
is you dissociate it's like you're not
 

7121
02:03:39,520 --> 02:03:40,950
is you dissociate it's like you're not
there

7122
02:03:40,950 --> 02:03:40,960
there
 

7123
02:03:40,960 --> 02:03:42,709
there
when you do that though it's hard to

7124
02:03:42,709 --> 02:03:42,719
when you do that though it's hard to
 

7125
02:03:42,719 --> 02:03:44,229
when you do that though it's hard to
come back because when you come

7126
02:03:44,229 --> 02:03:44,239
come back because when you come
 

7127
02:03:44,239 --> 02:03:46,310
come back because when you come
back then you get all these painful

7128
02:03:46,310 --> 02:03:46,320
back then you get all these painful
 

7129
02:03:46,320 --> 02:03:48,790
back then you get all these painful
memories and fearful and so

7130
02:03:48,790 --> 02:03:48,800
memories and fearful and so
 

7131
02:03:48,800 --> 02:03:50,550
memories and fearful and so
um the extreme of that is called

7132
02:03:50,550 --> 02:03:50,560
um the extreme of that is called
 

7133
02:03:50,560 --> 02:03:53,030
um the extreme of that is called
dissociative identity disorder

7134
02:03:53,030 --> 02:03:53,040
dissociative identity disorder
 

7135
02:03:53,040 --> 02:03:54,470
dissociative identity disorder
kind of like schizophrenia almost

7136
02:03:54,470 --> 02:03:54,480
kind of like schizophrenia almost
 

7137
02:03:54,480 --> 02:03:56,390
kind of like schizophrenia almost
dissociative identity you're

7138
02:03:56,390 --> 02:03:56,400
dissociative identity you're
 

7139
02:03:56,400 --> 02:03:58,870
dissociative identity you're
so we let people in who are on the

7140
02:03:58,870 --> 02:03:58,880
so we let people in who are on the
 

7141
02:03:58,880 --> 02:03:59,750
so we let people in who are on the
dissociative

7142
02:03:59,750 --> 02:03:59,760
dissociative
 

7143
02:03:59,760 --> 02:04:02,069
dissociative
subtype and those are considered to be

7144
02:04:02,069 --> 02:04:02,079
subtype and those are considered to be
 

7145
02:04:02,079 --> 02:04:03,589
subtype and those are considered to be
the hardest to treat because

7146
02:04:03,589 --> 02:04:03,599
the hardest to treat because
 

7147
02:04:03,599 --> 02:04:06,629
the hardest to treat because
the the theory is that you need to be

7148
02:04:06,629 --> 02:04:06,639
the the theory is that you need to be
 

7149
02:04:06,639 --> 02:04:08,550
the the theory is that you need to be
ego intact as i said the mystical

7150
02:04:08,550 --> 02:04:08,560
ego intact as i said the mystical
 

7151
02:04:08,560 --> 02:04:09,990
ego intact as i said the mystical
experience is not correlated

7152
02:04:09,990 --> 02:04:10,000
experience is not correlated
 

7153
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:11,750
experience is not correlated
with therapeutic outcomes and you need

7154
02:04:11,750 --> 02:04:11,760
with therapeutic outcomes and you need
 

7155
02:04:11,760 --> 02:04:13,910
with therapeutic outcomes and you need
to be talking about what traumatized you

7156
02:04:13,910 --> 02:04:13,920
to be talking about what traumatized you
 

7157
02:04:13,920 --> 02:04:15,589
to be talking about what traumatized you
and working through that and expressing

7158
02:04:15,589 --> 02:04:15,599
and working through that and expressing
 

7159
02:04:15,599 --> 02:04:17,990
and working through that and expressing
it letting it out not keeping it in

7160
02:04:17,990 --> 02:04:18,000
it letting it out not keeping it in
 

7161
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:21,189
it letting it out not keeping it in
so the dissociative subtype

7162
02:04:21,189 --> 02:04:21,199
so the dissociative subtype
 

7163
02:04:21,199 --> 02:04:23,270
so the dissociative subtype
seems like it's harder for them to get

7164
02:04:23,270 --> 02:04:23,280
seems like it's harder for them to get
 

7165
02:04:23,280 --> 02:04:24,870
seems like it's harder for them to get
back into the event because they're so

7166
02:04:24,870 --> 02:04:24,880
back into the event because they're so
 

7167
02:04:24,880 --> 02:04:26,229
back into the event because they're so
dissociated

7168
02:04:26,229 --> 02:04:26,239
dissociated
 

7169
02:04:26,239 --> 02:04:28,149
dissociated
what we showed is that those people did

7170
02:04:28,149 --> 02:04:28,159
what we showed is that those people did
 

7171
02:04:28,159 --> 02:04:30,229
what we showed is that those people did
even better on average than everybody

7172
02:04:30,229 --> 02:04:30,239
even better on average than everybody
 

7173
02:04:30,239 --> 02:04:31,270
even better on average than everybody
else

7174
02:04:31,270 --> 02:04:31,280
else
 

7175
02:04:31,280 --> 02:04:33,750
else
so that mdma is integrative it helps

7176
02:04:33,750 --> 02:04:33,760
so that mdma is integrative it helps
 

7177
02:04:33,760 --> 02:04:34,470
so that mdma is integrative it helps
people

7178
02:04:34,470 --> 02:04:34,480
people
 

7179
02:04:34,480 --> 02:04:37,589
people
who are so separate that they make even

7180
02:04:37,589 --> 02:04:37,599
who are so separate that they make even
 

7181
02:04:37,599 --> 02:04:39,030
who are so separate that they make even
more rapid progress

7182
02:04:39,030 --> 02:04:39,040
more rapid progress
 

7183
02:04:39,040 --> 02:04:41,350
more rapid progress
so it's almost like them dma made it

7184
02:04:41,350 --> 02:04:41,360
so it's almost like them dma made it
 

7185
02:04:41,360 --> 02:04:43,430
so it's almost like them dma made it
more difficult for them to dissociate

7186
02:04:43,430 --> 02:04:43,440
more difficult for them to dissociate
 

7187
02:04:43,440 --> 02:04:45,270
more difficult for them to dissociate
yes yeah or you could say it made it

7188
02:04:45,270 --> 02:04:45,280
yes yeah or you could say it made it
 

7189
02:04:45,280 --> 02:04:47,350
yes yeah or you could say it made it
easier for them to remember

7190
02:04:47,350 --> 02:04:47,360
easier for them to remember
 

7191
02:04:47,360 --> 02:04:49,510
easier for them to remember
yes exactly to reverse the dissociation

7192
02:04:49,510 --> 02:04:49,520
yes exactly to reverse the dissociation
 

7193
02:04:49,520 --> 02:04:51,510
yes exactly to reverse the dissociation
yeah and we find that mdma

7194
02:04:51,510 --> 02:04:51,520
yeah and we find that mdma
 

7195
02:04:51,520 --> 02:04:54,870
yeah and we find that mdma
enhances memory for the trauma so that

7196
02:04:54,870 --> 02:04:54,880
enhances memory for the trauma so that
 

7197
02:04:54,880 --> 02:04:55,750
enhances memory for the trauma so that
you can have these

7198
02:04:55,750 --> 02:04:55,760
you can have these
 

7199
02:04:55,760 --> 02:04:58,069
you can have these
unconscious uh memories or memories that

7200
02:04:58,069 --> 02:04:58,079
unconscious uh memories or memories that
 

7201
02:04:58,079 --> 02:04:59,510
unconscious uh memories or memories that
you cannot remember

7202
02:04:59,510 --> 02:04:59,520
you cannot remember
 

7203
02:04:59,520 --> 02:05:01,430
you cannot remember
that you've suppressed so much but they

7204
02:05:01,430 --> 02:05:01,440
that you've suppressed so much but they
 

7205
02:05:01,440 --> 02:05:02,550
that you've suppressed so much but they
distort your view

7206
02:05:02,550 --> 02:05:02,560
distort your view
 

7207
02:05:02,560 --> 02:05:04,870
distort your view
your filter of the world is distorted by

7208
02:05:04,870 --> 02:05:04,880
your filter of the world is distorted by
 

7209
02:05:04,880 --> 02:05:06,550
your filter of the world is distorted by
these fearful memories that the world

7210
02:05:06,550 --> 02:05:06,560
these fearful memories that the world
 

7211
02:05:06,560 --> 02:05:08,310
these fearful memories that the world
can't be trusted people can't be trusted

7212
02:05:08,310 --> 02:05:08,320
can't be trusted people can't be trusted
 

7213
02:05:08,320 --> 02:05:09,990
can't be trusted people can't be trusted
it's always about to happen

7214
02:05:09,990 --> 02:05:10,000
it's always about to happen
 

7215
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:12,709
it's always about to happen
so we find that mdma increases memory

7216
02:05:12,709 --> 02:05:12,719
so we find that mdma increases memory
 

7217
02:05:12,719 --> 02:05:15,189
so we find that mdma increases memory
for the trauma but by reducing the fear

7218
02:05:15,189 --> 02:05:15,199
for the trauma but by reducing the fear
 

7219
02:05:15,199 --> 02:05:16,390
for the trauma but by reducing the fear
then the memories can come to the

7220
02:05:16,390 --> 02:05:16,400
then the memories can come to the
 

7221
02:05:16,400 --> 02:05:18,149
then the memories can come to the
surface then you can process them let

7222
02:05:18,149 --> 02:05:18,159
surface then you can process them let
 

7223
02:05:18,159 --> 02:05:20,310
surface then you can process them let
out the emotions cry scream shake

7224
02:05:20,310 --> 02:05:20,320
out the emotions cry scream shake
 

7225
02:05:20,320 --> 02:05:24,069
out the emotions cry scream shake
whatever and then through this mdma

7226
02:05:24,069 --> 02:05:24,079
whatever and then through this mdma
 

7227
02:05:24,079 --> 02:05:25,270
whatever and then through this mdma
effect on the amygdala and the

7228
02:05:25,270 --> 02:05:25,280
effect on the amygdala and the
 

7229
02:05:25,280 --> 02:05:27,109
effect on the amygdala and the
hippocampus it helps you

7230
02:05:27,109 --> 02:05:27,119
hippocampus it helps you
 

7231
02:05:27,119 --> 02:05:28,870
hippocampus it helps you
store these memories into long-term

7232
02:05:28,870 --> 02:05:28,880
store these memories into long-term
 

7233
02:05:28,880 --> 02:05:30,629
store these memories into long-term
storage so that they're not always about

7234
02:05:30,629 --> 02:05:30,639
storage so that they're not always about
 

7235
02:05:30,639 --> 02:05:32,470
storage so that they're not always about
to happen they're in the past

7236
02:05:32,470 --> 02:05:32,480
to happen they're in the past
 

7237
02:05:32,480 --> 02:05:33,750
to happen they're in the past
they're part of your story but they're

7238
02:05:33,750 --> 02:05:33,760
they're part of your story but they're
 

7239
02:05:33,760 --> 02:05:35,990
they're part of your story but they're
not the whole story so we discovered

7240
02:05:35,990 --> 02:05:36,000
not the whole story so we discovered
 

7241
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:37,990
not the whole story so we discovered
that the dissociative subtype

7242
02:05:37,990 --> 02:05:38,000
that the dissociative subtype
 

7243
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:40,390
that the dissociative subtype
works better now none of this would be

7244
02:05:40,390 --> 02:05:40,400
works better now none of this would be
 

7245
02:05:40,400 --> 02:05:41,109
works better now none of this would be
enough

7246
02:05:41,109 --> 02:05:41,119
enough
 

7247
02:05:41,119 --> 02:05:43,750
enough
unless safety so from a safety

7248
02:05:43,750 --> 02:05:43,760
unless safety so from a safety
 

7249
02:05:43,760 --> 02:05:44,870
unless safety so from a safety
perspective

7250
02:05:44,870 --> 02:05:44,880
perspective
 

7251
02:05:44,880 --> 02:05:46,870
perspective
what we discovered is that there was one

7252
02:05:46,870 --> 02:05:46,880
what we discovered is that there was one
 

7253
02:05:46,880 --> 02:05:48,629
what we discovered is that there was one
woman in the study that attempted to

7254
02:05:48,629 --> 02:05:48,639
woman in the study that attempted to
 

7255
02:05:48,639 --> 02:05:49,350
woman in the study that attempted to
kill herself

7256
02:05:49,350 --> 02:05:49,360
kill herself
 

7257
02:05:49,360 --> 02:05:52,629
kill herself
twice during the study there was another

7258
02:05:52,629 --> 02:05:52,639
twice during the study there was another
 

7259
02:05:52,639 --> 02:05:53,189
twice during the study there was another
woman

7260
02:05:53,189 --> 02:05:53,199
woman
 

7261
02:05:53,199 --> 02:05:56,550
woman
that was so um

7262
02:05:56,550 --> 02:05:56,560
that was so um
 

7263
02:05:56,560 --> 02:05:58,470
that was so um
worried that she might kill herself that

7264
02:05:58,470 --> 02:05:58,480
worried that she might kill herself that
 

7265
02:05:58,480 --> 02:05:59,910
worried that she might kill herself that
the therapy brought these things to the

7266
02:05:59,910 --> 02:05:59,920
the therapy brought these things to the
 

7267
02:05:59,920 --> 02:06:01,510
the therapy brought these things to the
surface that she's been pushing away

7268
02:06:01,510 --> 02:06:01,520
surface that she's been pushing away
 

7269
02:06:01,520 --> 02:06:02,310
surface that she's been pushing away
that she

7270
02:06:02,310 --> 02:06:02,320
that she
 

7271
02:06:02,320 --> 02:06:04,310
that she
checked herself into a hospital in order

7272
02:06:04,310 --> 02:06:04,320
checked herself into a hospital in order
 

7273
02:06:04,320 --> 02:06:06,629
checked herself into a hospital in order
to avoid self-harm

7274
02:06:06,629 --> 02:06:06,639
to avoid self-harm
 

7275
02:06:06,639 --> 02:06:08,390
to avoid self-harm
at the end of the study you know what we

7276
02:06:08,390 --> 02:06:08,400
at the end of the study you know what we
 

7277
02:06:08,400 --> 02:06:09,589
at the end of the study you know what we
learned is both of them were in the

7278
02:06:09,589 --> 02:06:09,599
learned is both of them were in the
 

7279
02:06:09,599 --> 02:06:11,669
learned is both of them were in the
placebo group

7280
02:06:11,669 --> 02:06:11,679
placebo group
 

7281
02:06:11,679 --> 02:06:14,149
placebo group
we didn't have anybody in the mdma group

7282
02:06:14,149 --> 02:06:14,159
we didn't have anybody in the mdma group
 

7283
02:06:14,159 --> 02:06:16,870
we didn't have anybody in the mdma group
attempt to kill themselves

7284
02:06:16,870 --> 02:06:16,880
attempt to kill themselves
 

7285
02:06:16,880 --> 02:06:20,310
attempt to kill themselves
so the mdma is really

7286
02:06:20,310 --> 02:06:20,320
so the mdma is really
 

7287
02:06:20,320 --> 02:06:22,550
so the mdma is really
helpful for giving people a sense of

7288
02:06:22,550 --> 02:06:22,560
helpful for giving people a sense of
 

7289
02:06:22,560 --> 02:06:24,069
helpful for giving people a sense of
hope

7290
02:06:24,069 --> 02:06:24,079
hope
 

7291
02:06:24,079 --> 02:06:26,470
hope
and and that they can somehow process

7292
02:06:26,470 --> 02:06:26,480
and and that they can somehow process
 

7293
02:06:26,480 --> 02:06:27,109
and and that they can somehow process
this

7294
02:06:27,109 --> 02:06:27,119
this
 

7295
02:06:27,119 --> 02:06:28,790
this
now it's not to say that nobody will

7296
02:06:28,790 --> 02:06:28,800
now it's not to say that nobody will
 

7297
02:06:28,800 --> 02:06:30,149
now it's not to say that nobody will
ever commit suicide

7298
02:06:30,149 --> 02:06:30,159
ever commit suicide
 

7299
02:06:30,159 --> 02:06:32,229
ever commit suicide
and that's our big concern in the second

7300
02:06:32,229 --> 02:06:32,239
and that's our big concern in the second
 

7301
02:06:32,239 --> 02:06:34,069
and that's our big concern in the second

phase iii study
 

7303
02:06:34,079 --> 02:06:35,510

as i said it's more going to be about

7304
02:06:35,510 --> 02:06:35,520
as i said it's more going to be about
 

7305
02:06:35,520 --> 02:06:37,189
as i said it's more going to be about
safety than about efficacy we think

7306
02:06:37,189 --> 02:06:37,199
safety than about efficacy we think
 

7307
02:06:37,199 --> 02:06:38,629
safety than about efficacy we think
we'll get the efficacy but

7308
02:06:38,629 --> 02:06:38,639
we'll get the efficacy but
 

7309
02:06:38,639 --> 02:06:41,109
we'll get the efficacy but
we're very concerned about you know

7310
02:06:41,109 --> 02:06:41,119
we're very concerned about you know
 

7311
02:06:41,119 --> 02:06:42,149
we're very concerned about you know

7313
02:06:42,159 --> 02:06:45,589
safety
because we had um problems in the first

7314
02:06:45,589 --> 02:06:45,599
because we had um problems in the first

kill herself twice in the placebo group
 

7319
02:06:48,960 --> 02:06:51,270
kill herself twice in the placebo group
you know it's it's the background for

7320
02:06:51,270 --> 02:06:51,280
you know it's it's the background for
 

7321
02:06:51,280 --> 02:06:52,790
you know it's it's the background for
having ptsd

having ptsd
 

7323
02:06:52,800 --> 02:06:54,709
having ptsd
so there'd have to be a disproportionate

7324
02:06:54,709 --> 02:06:54,719
so there'd have to be a disproportionate
 

7325
02:06:54,719 --> 02:06:56,390
so there'd have to be a disproportionate
number of people in the mdma group

we don't think that's going to happen so

cause nerve terminal degeneration it's
going to be major

significant functional consequences and
 

7383
02:07:46,159 --> 02:07:47,830
significant functional consequences and
back then they were saying that mdm is

back then they were saying that mdm is
 

7385
02:07:47,840 --> 02:07:49,350
back then they were saying that mdm is
too dangerous it should never even be

too dangerous it should never even be

once
 

7391
02:07:51,280 --> 02:07:54,069

because it's poison and brain damage

because it's poison and brain damage
 

7393
02:07:54,079 --> 02:07:55,109
because it's poison and brain damage
well

well
 

7395
02:07:55,119 --> 02:07:56,709
well
we no longer believe that that was

7396
02:07:56,709 --> 02:07:56,719
we no longer believe that that was
 

7397
02:07:56,719 --> 02:07:59,030
we no longer believe that that was
exaggerated that was um

7398
02:07:59,030 --> 02:07:59,040
exaggerated that was um
 

7399
02:07:59,040 --> 02:08:00,870
exaggerated that was um
you know in service of the drug war but

7400
02:08:00,870 --> 02:08:00,880
you know in service of the drug war but
 

7401
02:08:00,880 --> 02:08:03,109
you know in service of the drug war but
we've done in phase two

7402
02:08:03,109 --> 02:08:03,119
we've done in phase two
 

7403
02:08:03,119 --> 02:08:05,990
we've done in phase two
neurocognitive tests before and after in

7404
02:08:05,990 --> 02:08:06,000
neurocognitive tests before and after in
 

7405
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:08,149
neurocognitive tests before and after in
two of our different sites and showed no

7406
02:08:08,149 --> 02:08:08,159
two of our different sites and showed no
 

7407
02:08:08,159 --> 02:08:10,790
two of our different sites and showed no
decline in cognitive functioning so we

7408
02:08:10,790 --> 02:08:10,800
decline in cognitive functioning so we
 

7409
02:08:10,800 --> 02:08:12,229
decline in cognitive functioning so we
we don't think that there's any

7410
02:08:12,229 --> 02:08:12,239
we don't think that there's any
 

7411
02:08:12,239 --> 02:08:15,430
we don't think that there's any
um neurotoxicity happening and the doses

7412
02:08:15,430 --> 02:08:15,440
um neurotoxicity happening and the doses
 

7413
02:08:15,440 --> 02:08:16,550
um neurotoxicity happening and the doses
that we use

7414
02:08:16,550 --> 02:08:16,560
that we use
 

7415
02:08:16,560 --> 02:08:17,990
that we use
there's no obvious functional

7416
02:08:17,990 --> 02:08:18,000
there's no obvious functional
 

7417
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:20,310
there's no obvious functional
consequences people are getting better

7418
02:08:20,310 --> 02:08:20,320
consequences people are getting better
 

7419
02:08:20,320 --> 02:08:22,149
consequences people are getting better
and the other thing that we've learned

7420
02:08:22,149 --> 02:08:22,159
and the other thing that we've learned
 

7421
02:08:22,159 --> 02:08:23,350
and the other thing that we've learned
in um

7422
02:08:23,350 --> 02:08:23,360
in um
 

7423
02:08:23,360 --> 02:08:24,790
in um
phase two and that we still have to

7424
02:08:24,790 --> 02:08:24,800
phase two and that we still have to
 

7425
02:08:24,800 --> 02:08:26,470
phase two and that we still have to
learn from this study so what we showed

7426
02:08:26,470 --> 02:08:26,480
learn from this study so what we showed
 

7427
02:08:26,480 --> 02:08:27,430
learn from this study so what we showed
is that

7428
02:08:27,430 --> 02:08:27,440
is that
 

7429
02:08:27,440 --> 02:08:29,430
is that
um is the durability of the effect we

7430
02:08:29,430 --> 02:08:29,440
um is the durability of the effect we
 

7431
02:08:29,440 --> 02:08:30,709
um is the durability of the effect we
showed that um

7432
02:08:30,709 --> 02:08:30,719
showed that um
 

7433
02:08:30,719 --> 02:08:32,950
showed that um
32 percent of the people that got the

7434
02:08:32,950 --> 02:08:32,960
32 percent of the people that got the
 

7435
02:08:32,960 --> 02:08:35,270
32 percent of the people that got the
therapy without mdma at two months after

therapy without mdma at two months after
 

7437
02:08:35,280 --> 02:08:37,270
therapy without mdma at two months after
the last experimental session no longer

7438
02:08:37,270 --> 02:08:37,280
the last experimental session no longer
 

7439
02:08:37,280 --> 02:08:38,709
the last experimental session no longer
had ptsd

7440
02:08:38,709 --> 02:08:38,719
had ptsd
 

7441
02:08:38,719 --> 02:08:40,310
had ptsd
just with the therapy which is

7442
02:08:40,310 --> 02:08:40,320
just with the therapy which is
 

7443
02:08:40,320 --> 02:08:42,149
just with the therapy which is
phenomenal because these are

7444
02:08:42,149 --> 02:08:42,159
phenomenal because these are
 

7445
02:08:42,159 --> 02:08:44,629
phenomenal because these are
on average 14 years ptsd one-third had

7446
02:08:44,629 --> 02:08:44,639
on average 14 years ptsd one-third had
 

7447
02:08:44,639 --> 02:08:47,910
on average 14 years ptsd one-third had
ptsd over 20 years

7448
02:08:47,910 --> 02:08:47,920
ptsd over 20 years
 

7449
02:08:47,920 --> 02:08:50,950
ptsd over 20 years
and just with the therapy

7450
02:08:50,950 --> 02:08:50,960
and just with the therapy
 

7451
02:08:50,960 --> 02:08:54,229
and just with the therapy
32 no longer had ptsd at the two months

7452
02:08:54,229 --> 02:08:54,239
32 no longer had ptsd at the two months
 

7453
02:08:54,239 --> 02:08:56,310
32 no longer had ptsd at the two months
um however those people that got mdma it

7454
02:08:56,310 --> 02:08:56,320
um however those people that got mdma it
 

7455
02:08:56,320 --> 02:08:58,310
um however those people that got mdma it
was 67 percent

7456
02:08:58,310 --> 02:08:58,320
was 67 percent
 

7457
02:08:58,320 --> 02:09:00,790
was 67 percent
no longer had ptsd you know more than

7458
02:09:00,790 --> 02:09:00,800
no longer had ptsd you know more than
 

7459
02:09:00,800 --> 02:09:02,229
no longer had ptsd you know more than
twice as good

7460
02:09:02,229 --> 02:09:02,239
twice as good
 

7461
02:09:02,239 --> 02:09:04,950
twice as good
in phase two and in phase three we're

7462
02:09:04,950 --> 02:09:04,960
in phase two and in phase three we're
 

7463
02:09:04,960 --> 02:09:07,510
in phase two and in phase three we're
also going to do the 12-month follow-up

7464
02:09:07,510 --> 02:09:07,520
also going to do the 12-month follow-up
 

7465
02:09:07,520 --> 02:09:09,830
also going to do the 12-month follow-up
that's not for the fda that's not for

7466
02:09:09,830 --> 02:09:09,840
that's not for the fda that's not for
 

7467
02:09:09,840 --> 02:09:11,669
that's not for the fda that's not for
approvability that's more for insurance

7468
02:09:11,669 --> 02:09:11,679
approvability that's more for insurance
 

7469
02:09:11,679 --> 02:09:12,310
approvability that's more for insurance
companies

7470
02:09:12,310 --> 02:09:12,320
companies
 

7471
02:09:12,320 --> 02:09:14,149
companies
because this is expensive a lot of

7472
02:09:14,149 --> 02:09:14,159
because this is expensive a lot of
 

7473
02:09:14,159 --> 02:09:16,470
because this is expensive a lot of
therapy time if it fades

7474
02:09:16,470 --> 02:09:16,480
therapy time if it fades
 

7475
02:09:16,480 --> 02:09:17,910
therapy time if it fades
you know if it's great results initially

7476
02:09:17,910 --> 02:09:17,920
you know if it's great results initially
 

7477
02:09:17,920 --> 02:09:19,910
you know if it's great results initially
but then it fades after six months

7478
02:09:19,910 --> 02:09:19,920
but then it fades after six months
 

7479
02:09:19,920 --> 02:09:23,270
but then it fades after six months
what's the point and what we showed

7480
02:09:23,270 --> 02:09:23,280
what's the point and what we showed
 

7481
02:09:23,280 --> 02:09:27,109
what's the point and what we showed
in phase two is that um

7482
02:09:27,109 --> 02:09:27,119
in phase two is that um
 

7483
02:09:27,119 --> 02:09:29,189
in phase two is that um
people keep getting better at the

7484
02:09:29,189 --> 02:09:29,199
people keep getting better at the
 

7485
02:09:29,199 --> 02:09:30,950
people keep getting better at the
two-month follow-up

7486
02:09:30,950 --> 02:09:30,960
two-month follow-up
 

7487
02:09:30,960 --> 02:09:32,950
two-month follow-up
they're doing pretty well but at the 12

7488
02:09:32,950 --> 02:09:32,960
they're doing pretty well but at the 12
 

7489
02:09:32,960 --> 02:09:34,870
they're doing pretty well but at the 12
month follow-up they're even better

7490
02:09:34,870 --> 02:09:34,880
month follow-up they're even better
 

7491
02:09:34,880 --> 02:09:36,709
month follow-up they're even better
so it's durable people have learned how

7492
02:09:36,709 --> 02:09:36,719
so it's durable people have learned how
 

7493
02:09:36,719 --> 02:09:38,229
so it's durable people have learned how
to process trauma

7494
02:09:38,229 --> 02:09:38,239
to process trauma
 

7495
02:09:38,239 --> 02:09:39,510
to process trauma
they keep getting better so we've not

7496
02:09:39,510 --> 02:09:39,520
they keep getting better so we've not
 

7497
02:09:39,520 --> 02:09:41,270
they keep getting better so we've not
reached that point in this phase three

7498
02:09:41,270 --> 02:09:41,280
reached that point in this phase three
 

7499
02:09:41,280 --> 02:09:42,629
reached that point in this phase three
study where everybody's got their one

7500
02:09:42,629 --> 02:09:42,639
study where everybody's got their one
 

7501
02:09:42,639 --> 02:09:43,669
study where everybody's got their one
year follow-up but

7502
02:09:43,669 --> 02:09:43,679
year follow-up but
 

7503
02:09:43,679 --> 02:09:45,350
year follow-up but
we have also done three and a half year

7504
02:09:45,350 --> 02:09:45,360
we have also done three and a half year
 

7505
02:09:45,360 --> 02:09:47,189
we have also done three and a half year
follow-ups to some of the groups that

7506
02:09:47,189 --> 02:09:47,199
follow-ups to some of the groups that
 

7507
02:09:47,199 --> 02:09:48,709
follow-ups to some of the groups that
were in phase two

7508
02:09:48,709 --> 02:09:48,719
were in phase two
 

7509
02:09:48,719 --> 02:09:50,870
were in phase two
and showed that it was durable and we're

7510
02:09:50,870 --> 02:09:50,880
and showed that it was durable and we're
 

7511
02:09:50,880 --> 02:09:51,830
and showed that it was durable and we're
doing a long

7512
02:09:51,830 --> 02:09:51,840
doing a long
 

7513
02:09:51,840 --> 02:09:53,990
doing a long
long-term follow-up now to everybody to

7514
02:09:53,990 --> 02:09:54,000
long-term follow-up now to everybody to
 

7515
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:55,510
long-term follow-up now to everybody to
many of the people in phase two some of

7516
02:09:55,510 --> 02:09:55,520
many of the people in phase two some of
 

7517
02:09:55,520 --> 02:09:57,589
many of the people in phase two some of
them treated 15 years ago

7518
02:09:57,589 --> 02:09:57,599
them treated 15 years ago
 

7519
02:09:57,599 --> 02:09:59,270
them treated 15 years ago
so that's all more for the insurance

7520
02:09:59,270 --> 02:09:59,280
so that's all more for the insurance
 

7521
02:09:59,280 --> 02:10:00,709
so that's all more for the insurance
companies so

7522
02:10:00,709 --> 02:10:00,719
companies so
 

7523
02:10:00,719 --> 02:10:02,709
companies so
basically what we found in the paper

7524
02:10:02,709 --> 02:10:02,719
basically what we found in the paper
 

7525
02:10:02,719 --> 02:10:04,310
basically what we found in the paper
that we just published is that it was

7526
02:10:04,310 --> 02:10:04,320
that we just published is that it was
 

7527
02:10:04,320 --> 02:10:06,790
that we just published is that it was
highly efficacious highly significant

7528
02:10:06,790 --> 02:10:06,800
highly efficacious highly significant
 

7529
02:10:06,800 --> 02:10:08,629
highly efficacious highly significant
no effect by sight works in the hardest

7530
02:10:08,629 --> 02:10:08,639
no effect by sight works in the hardest
 

7531
02:10:08,639 --> 02:10:10,629
no effect by sight works in the hardest
cases

7532
02:10:10,629 --> 02:10:10,639
cases
 

7533
02:10:10,639 --> 02:10:13,189
cases
and the safety record was great that's

7534
02:10:13,189 --> 02:10:13,199
and the safety record was great that's
 

7535
02:10:13,199 --> 02:10:14,550
and the safety record was great that's
an incredible success

7536
02:10:14,550 --> 02:10:14,560
an incredible success
 

7537
02:10:14,560 --> 02:10:17,189
an incredible success
and that's really exciting especially

7538
02:10:17,189 --> 02:10:17,199
and that's really exciting especially
 

7539
02:10:17,199 --> 02:10:18,790
and that's really exciting especially
given that uh the people who've

7540
02:10:18,790 --> 02:10:18,800
given that uh the people who've
 

7541
02:10:18,800 --> 02:10:20,310
given that uh the people who've
committed

7542
02:10:20,310 --> 02:10:20,320
committed
 

7543
02:10:20,320 --> 02:10:22,950
committed
who attempted to commit suicide were let

7544
02:10:22,950 --> 02:10:22,960
who attempted to commit suicide were let
 

7545
02:10:22,960 --> 02:10:24,149
who attempted to commit suicide were let
into the study and

7546
02:10:24,149 --> 02:10:24,159
into the study and
 

7547
02:10:24,159 --> 02:10:26,830
into the study and
so these are is the people who are truly

7548
02:10:26,830 --> 02:10:26,840
so these are is the people who are truly
 

7549
02:10:26,840 --> 02:10:28,149
so these are is the people who are truly
suffering

7550
02:10:28,149 --> 02:10:28,159
suffering
 

7551
02:10:28,159 --> 02:10:31,750
suffering
um i mean

7552
02:10:31,750 --> 02:10:31,760
um i mean
 

7553
02:10:31,760 --> 02:10:36,069
um i mean
that um that's incredibly exciting

7554
02:10:36,069 --> 02:10:36,079
that um that's incredibly exciting
 

7555
02:10:36,079 --> 02:10:37,669
that um that's incredibly exciting
and i mean just to speak to the

7556
02:10:37,669 --> 02:10:37,679
and i mean just to speak to the
 

7557
02:10:37,679 --> 02:10:39,830
and i mean just to speak to the
frustration why things can't move faster

7558
02:10:39,830 --> 02:10:39,840
frustration why things can't move faster
 

7559
02:10:39,840 --> 02:10:41,990
frustration why things can't move faster
but um

7560
02:10:41,990 --> 02:10:42,000
but um
 

7561
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:44,790
but um
but for what it is it's incredibly

7562
02:10:44,790 --> 02:10:44,800
but for what it is it's incredibly
 

7563
02:10:44,800 --> 02:10:45,589
but for what it is it's incredibly
exciting

7564
02:10:45,589 --> 02:10:45,599
exciting
 

7565
02:10:45,599 --> 02:10:48,069
exciting
is there other studies of this nature

7566
02:10:48,069 --> 02:10:48,079
is there other studies of this nature
 

7567
02:10:48,079 --> 02:10:49,910
is there other studies of this nature
that you foresee

7568
02:10:49,910 --> 02:10:49,920
that you foresee
 

7569
02:10:49,920 --> 02:10:51,589
that you foresee
enabling that same kind of positive

7570
02:10:51,589 --> 02:10:51,599
enabling that same kind of positive
 

7571
02:10:51,599 --> 02:10:53,350
enabling that same kind of positive
impact whether it's mdma

7572
02:10:53,350 --> 02:10:53,360
impact whether it's mdma
 

7573
02:10:53,360 --> 02:10:55,270
impact whether it's mdma
for other things like treating addiction

7574
02:10:55,270 --> 02:10:55,280
for other things like treating addiction
 

7575
02:10:55,280 --> 02:10:57,189
for other things like treating addiction
or maybe it's psilocybin

7576
02:10:57,189 --> 02:10:57,199
or maybe it's psilocybin
 

7577
02:10:57,199 --> 02:10:59,669
or maybe it's psilocybin
for uh for other conditions is there

7578
02:10:59,669 --> 02:10:59,679
for uh for other conditions is there
 

7579
02:10:59,679 --> 02:11:01,189
for uh for other conditions is there
something else that's promising

7580
02:11:01,189 --> 02:11:01,199
something else that's promising
 

7581
02:11:01,199 --> 02:11:04,470
something else that's promising
yeah i i think that um

7582
02:11:04,470 --> 02:11:04,480
yeah i i think that um
 

7583
02:11:04,480 --> 02:11:07,350
yeah i i think that um
what we've discovered i don't think is

7584
02:11:07,350 --> 02:11:07,360
what we've discovered i don't think is
 

7585
02:11:07,360 --> 02:11:08,870
what we've discovered i don't think is
unique to mdma

7586
02:11:08,870 --> 02:11:08,880
unique to mdma
 

7587
02:11:08,880 --> 02:11:12,310
unique to mdma
so it's mdma assisted psychotherapy

7588
02:11:12,310 --> 02:11:12,320
so it's mdma assisted psychotherapy
 

7589
02:11:12,320 --> 02:11:15,830
so it's mdma assisted psychotherapy
mdma is ideal for ptsd you know

7590
02:11:15,830 --> 02:11:15,840
mdma is ideal for ptsd you know
 

7591
02:11:15,840 --> 02:11:17,990
mdma is ideal for ptsd you know
maybe it won't work as well for ocd or

7592
02:11:17,990 --> 02:11:18,000
maybe it won't work as well for ocd or
 

7593
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:19,189
maybe it won't work as well for ocd or
other things you know it's very

7594
02:11:19,189 --> 02:11:19,199
other things you know it's very
 

7595
02:11:19,199 --> 02:11:21,430
other things you know it's very

7757
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:01,109
so many young psychiatric residents are
so thrilled by

7758
02:14:01,109 --> 02:14:01,119
so thrilled by
 

7759
02:14:01,119 --> 02:14:03,750
so thrilled by
psychedelics that they really want to

7760
02:14:03,750 --> 02:14:03,760
psychedelics that they really want to
 

7761
02:14:03,760 --> 02:14:04,950
psychedelics that they really want to
get back to

7762
02:14:04,950 --> 02:14:04,960
get back to
 

7763
02:14:04,960 --> 02:14:06,790
get back to
treating people as individuals not just

7764
02:14:06,790 --> 02:14:06,800
treating people as individuals not just
 

7765
02:14:06,800 --> 02:14:08,310
treating people as individuals not just
a bunch of chemicals

7766
02:14:08,310 --> 02:14:08,320
a bunch of chemicals
 

7767
02:14:08,320 --> 02:14:09,910
a bunch of chemicals
yeah that's truly fascinating because

7768
02:14:09,910 --> 02:14:09,920
yeah that's truly fascinating because
 

7769
02:14:09,920 --> 02:14:11,750
yeah that's truly fascinating because
the reason it was appealing to me it was

7770
02:14:11,750 --> 02:14:11,760
the reason it was appealing to me it was
 

7771
02:14:11,760 --> 02:14:12,950
the reason it was appealing to me it was
a way to

7772
02:14:12,950 --> 02:14:12,960
a way to
 

7773
02:14:12,960 --> 02:14:17,350
a way to
to study the human mind and to see ways

7774
02:14:17,350 --> 02:14:17,360
to study the human mind and to see ways
 

7775
02:14:17,360 --> 02:14:20,629
to study the human mind and to see ways
through talking that you can

7776
02:14:20,629 --> 02:14:20,639
through talking that you can
 

7777
02:14:20,639 --> 02:14:24,069
through talking that you can
make people feel better make people

7778
02:14:24,069 --> 02:14:24,079
make people feel better make people
 

7779
02:14:24,079 --> 02:14:25,669
make people feel better make people
better

7780
02:14:25,669 --> 02:14:25,679
better
 

7781
02:14:25,679 --> 02:14:28,870
better
you know make people suffer less and

7782
02:14:28,870 --> 02:14:28,880
you know make people suffer less and
 

7783
02:14:28,880 --> 02:14:30,390
you know make people suffer less and
that that was really exciting at the

7784
02:14:30,390 --> 02:14:30,400
that that was really exciting at the
 

7785
02:14:30,400 --> 02:14:32,550
that that was really exciting at the
time i ended up then going to ai

7786
02:14:32,550 --> 02:14:32,560
time i ended up then going to ai
 

7787
02:14:32,560 --> 02:14:34,790
time i ended up then going to ai
because then i can understand the mind

7788
02:14:34,790 --> 02:14:34,800
because then i can understand the mind
 

7789
02:14:34,800 --> 02:14:37,270
because then i can understand the mind
from that angle but um

7790
02:14:37,270 --> 02:14:37,280
from that angle but um
 

7791
02:14:37,280 --> 02:14:39,109
from that angle but um
it's exciting that that that could be

7792
02:14:39,109 --> 02:14:39,119
it's exciting that that that could be
 

7793
02:14:39,119 --> 02:14:41,990
it's exciting that that that could be
also

7794
02:14:41,990 --> 02:14:42,000

 

7795
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:43,189

revolutionized the field of

7796
02:14:43,189 --> 02:14:43,199
revolutionized the field of
 

7797
02:14:43,199 --> 02:14:45,189
revolutionized the field of
psychotherapy take it from its

7798
02:14:45,189 --> 02:14:45,199
psychotherapy take it from its
 

7799
02:14:45,199 --> 02:14:48,069
psychotherapy take it from its
uh back to its origins to where um a

7800
02:14:48,069 --> 02:14:48,079
uh back to its origins to where um a
 

7801
02:14:48,079 --> 02:14:49,030
uh back to its origins to where um a
psychiatrist

7802
02:14:49,030 --> 02:14:49,040
psychiatrist
 

7803
02:14:49,040 --> 02:14:51,750
psychiatrist
would be a scholar of the mind yeah well

7804
02:14:51,750 --> 02:14:51,760
would be a scholar of the mind yeah well
 

7805
02:14:51,760 --> 02:14:53,270
would be a scholar of the mind yeah well
you know freud talked about

7806
02:14:53,270 --> 02:14:53,280
you know freud talked about
 

7807
02:14:53,280 --> 02:14:54,950
you know freud talked about
dreams as the royal road to the

7808
02:14:54,950 --> 02:14:54,960
dreams as the royal road to the
 

7809
02:14:54,960 --> 02:14:56,310
dreams as the royal road to the
unconscious

7810
02:14:56,310 --> 02:14:56,320
unconscious
 

7811
02:14:56,320 --> 02:14:58,950
unconscious
and there was a lot of we you you really

7812
02:14:58,950 --> 02:14:58,960
and there was a lot of we you you really
 

7813
02:14:58,960 --> 02:15:00,870
and there was a lot of we you you really
spent a lot of time with people

7814
02:15:00,870 --> 02:15:00,880
spent a lot of time with people
 

7815
02:15:00,880 --> 02:15:04,229
spent a lot of time with people
now um right before he died um

7816
02:15:04,229 --> 02:15:04,239
now um right before he died um
 

7817
02:15:04,239 --> 02:15:06,310
now um right before he died um
in in his last book freud wrote

7818
02:15:06,310 --> 02:15:06,320
in in his last book freud wrote
 

7819
02:15:06,320 --> 02:15:08,149
in in his last book freud wrote
something and again this will be a

7820
02:15:08,149 --> 02:15:08,159
something and again this will be a
 

7821
02:15:08,159 --> 02:15:10,310
something and again this will be a
rough paraphrase but he said that in the

7822
02:15:10,310 --> 02:15:10,320
rough paraphrase but he said that in the
 

7823
02:15:10,320 --> 02:15:11,430
rough paraphrase but he said that in the
future

7824
02:15:11,430 --> 02:15:11,440
future
 

7825
02:15:11,440 --> 02:15:15,030
future
we may learn about the energies of the

7826
02:15:15,030 --> 02:15:15,040
we may learn about the energies of the
 

7827
02:15:15,040 --> 02:15:15,589
we may learn about the energies of the
brain

7828
02:15:15,589 --> 02:15:15,599
brain
 

7829
02:15:15,599 --> 02:15:17,510
brain
and there'll be ways with chemicals to

7830
02:15:17,510 --> 02:15:17,520
and there'll be ways with chemicals to
 

7831
02:15:17,520 --> 02:15:19,189
and there'll be ways with chemicals to
influence that that will

7832
02:15:19,189 --> 02:15:19,199
influence that that will
 

7833
02:15:19,199 --> 02:15:22,980
influence that that will
help the therapeutic process yeah

7834
02:15:22,980 --> 02:15:22,990
help the therapeutic process yeah
 

7835
02:15:22,990 --> 02:15:24,390
help the therapeutic process yeah
[Laughter]

7836
02:15:24,390 --> 02:15:24,400
[Laughter]
 

7837
02:15:24,400 --> 02:15:26,950
[Laughter]
so you could say he was uh he was ahead

7838
02:15:26,950 --> 02:15:26,960
so you could say he was uh he was ahead
 

7839
02:15:26,960 --> 02:15:27,750
so you could say he was uh he was ahead
of his time

7840
02:15:27,750 --> 02:15:27,760
of his time
 

7841
02:15:27,760 --> 02:15:30,629
of his time
yeah this study paints a fascinating

7842
02:15:30,629 --> 02:15:30,639
yeah this study paints a fascinating
 

7843
02:15:30,639 --> 02:15:31,270
yeah this study paints a fascinating
picture

7844
02:15:31,270 --> 02:15:31,280
picture
 

7845
02:15:31,280 --> 02:15:34,950
picture
of a future where first for medical

02:15:34,950 --> 02:15:34,960
of a future where first for medical
 

7847
02:15:34,960 --> 02:15:37,830

applications but then also in general

7848
02:15:37,830 --> 02:15:37,840
applications but then also in general
 

7849
02:15:37,840 --> 02:15:39,510

psychedelics of various forms could be

7850
02:15:39,510 --> 02:15:39,520
psychedelics of various forms could be
 

7851
02:15:39,520 --> 02:15:42,229
psychedelics of various forms could be
used by the broader society

7852
02:15:42,229 --> 02:15:42,239
used by the broader society
 

7853
02:15:42,239 --> 02:15:44,470
used by the broader society
forgive the perhaps ridiculous question

7854
02:15:44,470 --> 02:15:44,480
forgive the perhaps ridiculous question
 

7855
02:15:44,480 --> 02:15:45,990
forgive the perhaps ridiculous question
but

7856
02:15:45,990 --> 02:15:46,000
but
 

7857
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:48,830
but
if much of society including our

7858
02:15:48,830 --> 02:15:48,840
if much of society including our

02:15:50,310 --> 02:15:50,320
politicians are
 

7861
02:15:50,320 --> 02:15:53,750
politicians are
um taking psychedelics

7862
02:15:53,750 --> 02:15:53,760
um taking psychedelics
 

7863
02:15:53,760 --> 02:15:56,790
um taking psychedelics
and dissolving their ego and going

7864
02:15:56,790 --> 02:15:56,800
and dissolving their ego and going
 

7865
02:15:56,800 --> 02:15:58,629
and dissolving their ego and going
through this whole process

7866
02:15:58,629 --> 02:15:58,639
through this whole process
 

7867
02:15:58,639 --> 02:16:01,350
through this whole process
how how do you think the world may look

7868
02:16:01,350 --> 02:16:01,360
how how do you think the world may look
 

7869
02:16:01,360 --> 02:16:01,910
how how do you think the world may look
different

7870
02:16:01,910 --> 02:16:01,920
different
 

7871
02:16:01,920 --> 02:16:04,950
different
in 20 30 50 years ah

7872
02:16:04,950 --> 02:16:04,960
in 20 30 50 years ah
 

7873
02:16:04,960 --> 02:16:08,069
in 20 30 50 years ah
okay so um i i said that i think

7874
02:16:08,069 --> 02:16:08,079
okay so um i i said that i think
 

7875
02:16:08,079 --> 02:16:11,030
okay so um i i said that i think
licensed legalization happens in 2035

7876
02:16:11,030 --> 02:16:11,040
licensed legalization happens in 2035
 

7877
02:16:11,040 --> 02:16:11,430
licensed legalization happens in 2035
yes

7878
02:16:11,430 --> 02:16:11,440
yes
 

7879
02:16:11,440 --> 02:16:14,950
yes
right so um and i think by 2050

7880
02:16:14,950 --> 02:16:14,960
right so um and i think by 2050
 

7881
02:16:14,960 --> 02:16:18,229
right so um and i think by 2050
um we will have enough people

7882
02:16:18,229 --> 02:16:18,239
um we will have enough people
 

7883
02:16:18,239 --> 02:16:21,990
um we will have enough people
hopefully spiritualized

7884
02:16:21,990 --> 02:16:22,000
hopefully spiritualized
 

7885
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:25,270
hopefully spiritualized
we're also talking about um we hear so

7886
02:16:25,270 --> 02:16:25,280
we're also talking about um we hear so
 

7887
02:16:25,280 --> 02:16:26,470
we're also talking about um we hear so
much in terms of

7888
02:16:26,470 --> 02:16:26,480
much in terms of
 

7889
02:16:26,480 --> 02:16:28,790
much in terms of
climate change about you know net zero

7890
02:16:28,790 --> 02:16:28,800
climate change about you know net zero
 

7891
02:16:28,800 --> 02:16:29,910
climate change about you know net zero
carbon

7892
02:16:29,910 --> 02:16:29,920
carbon
 

7893
02:16:29,920 --> 02:16:32,950
carbon
so our goal is net zero trauma

7894
02:16:32,950 --> 02:16:32,960
so our goal is net zero trauma
 

7895
02:16:32,960 --> 02:16:34,950
so our goal is net zero trauma
when do we have a world with net zero

7896
02:16:34,950 --> 02:16:34,960
when do we have a world with net zero
 

7897
02:16:34,960 --> 02:16:37,190
when do we have a world with net zero
trauma i mean right now

7898
02:16:37,190 --> 02:16:37,200
trauma i mean right now
 

7899
02:16:37,200 --> 02:16:39,910
trauma i mean right now
you know we have two sites in israel so

7900
02:16:39,910 --> 02:16:39,920
you know we have two sites in israel so
 

7901
02:16:39,920 --> 02:16:41,990
you know we have two sites in israel so
we help a few people but the recent war

7902
02:16:41,990 --> 02:16:42,000
we help a few people but the recent war
 

7903
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:43,750
we help a few people but the recent war
with gaza

7904
02:16:43,750 --> 02:16:43,760
with gaza
 

7905
02:16:43,760 --> 02:16:45,669
with gaza
has traumatized millions of people on

7906
02:16:45,669 --> 02:16:45,679
has traumatized millions of people on
 

7907
02:16:45,679 --> 02:16:46,790
has traumatized millions of people on
both sides

7908
02:16:46,790 --> 02:16:46,800
both sides
 

7909
02:16:46,800 --> 02:16:50,070
both sides
so we are a long way away from net zero

7910
02:16:50,070 --> 02:16:50,080
so we are a long way away from net zero
 

7911
02:16:50,080 --> 02:16:51,429
so we are a long way away from net zero
trauma

7912
02:16:51,429 --> 02:16:51,439
trauma
 

7913
02:16:51,439 --> 02:16:54,950
trauma
um but that's the hope and that's

7914
02:16:54,950 --> 02:16:54,960
um but that's the hope and that's
 

7915
02:16:54,960 --> 02:16:57,910
um but that's the hope and that's
i think possible i think humanity as a

7916
02:16:57,910 --> 02:16:57,920
i think possible i think humanity as a
 

7917
02:16:57,920 --> 02:16:59,110
i think possible i think humanity as a
whole

7918
02:16:59,110 --> 02:16:59,120
whole
 

7919
02:16:59,120 --> 02:17:02,230
whole
um is

7920
02:17:02,230 --> 02:17:02,240
um is
 

7921

a very good chance though that
 

7937

thousands of psychedelic clinics
 

8087
02:19:54,560 --> 02:19:58,070
thousands of psychedelic clinics
um i'm hopeful um and that that's our

8088
02:19:58,070 --> 02:19:58,080
um i'm hopeful um and that that's our
 

8089
02:19:58,080 --> 02:19:59,030
um i'm hopeful um and that that's our
goal

8090
02:19:59,030 --> 02:19:59,040
goal
 

8091
02:19:59,040 --> 02:20:02,469
goal
but in this landscape of um

8092
02:20:02,469 --> 02:20:02,479
but in this landscape of um
 

8093
02:20:02,479 --> 02:20:04,790
but in this landscape of um
pharma companies they make a lot of

8094
02:20:04,790 --> 02:20:04,800
pharma companies they make a lot of
 

8095
02:20:04,800 --> 02:20:05,830
pharma companies they make a lot of
money

8096
02:20:05,830 --> 02:20:05,840
money
 

8097
02:20:05,840 --> 02:20:07,670
money
some people are worried about the impact

8098
02:20:07,670 --> 02:20:07,680
some people are worried about the impact
 

8099
02:20:07,680 --> 02:20:09,030
some people are worried about the impact
of those com you know

8100
02:20:09,030 --> 02:20:09,040
of those com you know
 

8101
02:20:09,040 --> 02:20:11,910
of those com you know
uh a big pharma on the landscape of

8102
02:20:11,910 --> 02:20:11,920
uh a big pharma on the landscape of
 

8103
02:20:11,920 --> 02:20:12,950
uh a big pharma on the landscape of
human trauma

8104

human trauma
 

8105
02:20:12,960 --> 02:20:15,670
human trauma
yeah yeah and so there's of course some

8106
02:20:15,670 --> 02:20:15,680
yeah yeah and so there's of course some
 

8107
02:20:15,680 --> 02:20:17,429
yeah yeah and so there's of course some
companies could do good

8108
02:20:17,429 --> 02:20:17,439
companies could do good
 

8109
02:20:17,439 --> 02:20:22,230
companies could do good
but that's not inherent like um

8110
02:20:22,230 --> 02:20:22,240
but that's not inherent like um
 

8111
02:20:22,240 --> 02:20:23,670
but that's not inherent like um
many of these companies are not

8112
02:20:23,670 --> 02:20:23,680
many of these companies are not
 

8113
02:20:23,680 --> 02:20:25,510
many of these companies are not
optimizing for good they're optimizing

8114
02:20:25,510 --> 02:20:25,520
optimizing for good they're optimizing
 

8115
02:20:25,520 --> 02:20:26,870
optimizing for good they're optimizing
from profit exactly

8116
02:20:26,870 --> 02:20:26,880
from profit exactly
 

8117
02:20:26,880 --> 02:20:29,830
from profit exactly
exactly does this uh rise of for-profit

8118
02:20:29,830 --> 02:20:29,840
exactly does this uh rise of for-profit
 

8119
02:20:29,840 --> 02:20:31,750
exactly does this uh rise of for-profit
pharma companies were eu

8120
02:20:31,750 --> 02:20:31,760
pharma companies were eu
 

8121
02:20:31,760 --> 02:20:34,469
pharma companies were eu
how do you navigate it do we still have

8122
02:20:34,469 --> 02:20:34,479
how do you navigate it do we still have
 

8123
02:20:34,479 --> 02:20:35,910
how do you navigate it do we still have
for-profit companies that

8124
02:20:35,910 --> 02:20:35,920
for-profit companies that
 

8125
02:20:35,920 --> 02:20:39,590
for-profit companies that
basically uh do what uh maps does which

8126
02:20:39,590 --> 02:20:39,600
basically uh do what uh maps does which
 

8127
02:20:39,600 --> 02:20:40,469
basically uh do what uh maps does which
is like

8128
02:20:40,469 --> 02:20:40,479
is like
 

8129
02:20:40,479 --> 02:20:41,990
is like
fight the good fight for the benefit of

8130
02:20:41,990 --> 02:20:42,000
fight the good fight for the benefit of
 

8131

02:20:44,309 --> 02:20:44,319
humanity like what like how do we
 

8133
02:20:44,319 --> 02:20:47,110
humanity like what like how do we
proceed in this in landscape or work

8134
02:20:47,110 --> 02:20:47,120
proceed in this in landscape or work
 

8135
02:20:47,120 --> 02:20:49,510
proceed in this in landscape or work
where drugs can make a lot of money

8136
02:20:49,510 --> 02:20:49,520
where drugs can make a lot of money
 

8137
02:20:49,520 --> 02:20:53,270
where drugs can make a lot of money
well i am concerned overall i think the

8138
02:20:53,270 --> 02:20:53,280
well i am concerned overall i think the
 

8139
02:20:53,280 --> 02:20:55,030
well i am concerned overall i think the
rise of the for-profit

8140
02:20:55,030 --> 02:20:55,040
rise of the for-profit
 

8141
02:20:55,040 --> 02:20:57,110
rise of the for-profit
companies we have to realize is a sign

8142
02:20:57,110 --> 02:20:57,120
companies we have to realize is a sign
 

8143
02:20:57,120 --> 02:20:58,630
companies we have to realize is a sign
of success

8144
02:20:58,630 --> 02:20:58,640
of success
 

8145
02:20:58,640 --> 02:21:01,670
of success
that we have overcome

8146
02:21:01,670 --> 02:21:01,680
that we have overcome
 

8147
02:21:01,680 --> 02:21:04,630
that we have overcome
the regulatory prohibitions we've

8148
02:21:04,630 --> 02:21:04,640
the regulatory prohibitions we've
 

8149
02:21:04,640 --> 02:21:05,349
the regulatory prohibitions we've
overcome

8150
02:21:05,349 --> 02:21:05,359
overcome
 

8151
02:21:05,359 --> 02:21:06,790
overcome
a lot of the public attitudes that are

8152
02:21:06,790 --> 02:21:06,800
a lot of the public attitudes that are
 

8153
02:21:06,800 --> 02:21:09,190
a lot of the public attitudes that are
against it we've demonstrated some

8154
02:21:09,190 --> 02:21:09,200
against it we've demonstrated some
 

8155
02:21:09,200 --> 02:21:10,950
against it we've demonstrated some
success so the rise of the for-profit

8156
02:21:10,950 --> 02:21:10,960
success so the rise of the for-profit
 

8157
02:21:10,960 --> 02:21:12,070
success so the rise of the for-profit
companies

8158
02:21:12,070 --> 02:21:12,080
companies
 

8159
02:21:12,080 --> 02:21:13,590
companies
are a sign of the progress that we've

8160
02:21:13,590 --> 02:21:13,600
are a sign of the progress that we've
 

8161
02:21:13,600 --> 02:21:15,590
are a sign of the progress that we've
made on the other hand turning things

8162
02:21:15,590 --> 02:21:15,600
made on the other hand turning things
 

8163
02:21:15,600 --> 02:21:19,030
made on the other hand turning things
over to profit maximizing companies

8164
02:21:19,030 --> 02:21:19,040
over to profit maximizing companies
 

8165
02:21:19,040 --> 02:21:20,710
over to profit maximizing companies
the big concern is that they're going to

8166
02:21:20,710 --> 02:21:20,720
the big concern is that they're going to
 

8167
02:21:20,720 --> 02:21:22,309
the big concern is that they're going to
try to

8168
02:21:22,309 --> 02:21:22,319
try to
 

8169
02:21:22,319 --> 02:21:25,270
try to
minimize the amount of therapy and make

8170
02:21:25,270 --> 02:21:25,280
minimize the amount of therapy and make
 

8171
02:21:25,280 --> 02:21:26,150
minimize the amount of therapy and make
it so the cost

8172
02:21:26,150 --> 02:21:26,160
it so the cost
 

8173
02:21:26,160 --> 02:21:27,830
it so the cost
is less so insurance companies are more

8174
02:21:27,830 --> 02:21:27,840
is less so insurance companies are more
 

8175
02:21:27,840 --> 02:21:29,510
is less so insurance companies are more
likely to cover it and then that they

8176
02:21:29,510 --> 02:21:29,520
likely to cover it and then that they
 

8177
02:21:29,520 --> 02:21:32,070
likely to cover it and then that they
just sell the most drugs

8178
02:21:32,070 --> 02:21:32,080
just sell the most drugs
 

8179
02:21:32,080 --> 02:21:33,990
just sell the most drugs
the other thing we've seen as an example

8180
02:21:33,990 --> 02:21:34,000
the other thing we've seen as an example
 

8181
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:35,349
the other thing we've seen as an example
of this is s

8182
02:21:35,349 --> 02:21:35,359
of this is s
 

8183
02:21:35,359 --> 02:21:37,110
of this is s
ketamine by johnson johnson for

8184
02:21:37,110 --> 02:21:37,120
ketamine by johnson johnson for
 

8185
02:21:37,120 --> 02:21:38,950
ketamine by johnson johnson for
depression and it's done by a profit

8186
02:21:38,950 --> 02:21:38,960
depression and it's done by a profit
 

8187
02:21:38,960 --> 02:21:40,550
depression and it's done by a profit
maximizing company

8188
02:21:40,550 --> 02:21:40,560
maximizing company
 

8189
02:21:40,560 --> 02:21:41,510
maximizing company
they don't know anything about

8190
02:21:41,510 --> 02:21:41,520
they don't know anything about
 

8191
02:21:41,520 --> 02:21:43,190
they don't know anything about
psychedelic psychotherapy or

8192
02:21:43,190 --> 02:21:43,200
psychedelic psychotherapy or
 

8193
02:21:43,200 --> 02:21:44,790
psychedelic psychotherapy or
psychotherapy at all

8194
02:21:44,790 --> 02:21:44,800
psychotherapy at all
 

8195
02:21:44,800 --> 02:21:47,670
psychotherapy at all
and so they've gotten approval for

8196
02:21:47,670 --> 02:21:47,680
and so they've gotten approval for
 

8197
02:21:47,680 --> 02:21:49,750
and so they've gotten approval for
s-ketamine on the basis of it's just a

8198
02:21:49,750 --> 02:21:49,760
s-ketamine on the basis of it's just a
 

8199
02:21:49,760 --> 02:21:51,910
s-ketamine on the basis of it's just a
pharmacological treatment

8200
02:21:51,910 --> 02:21:51,920
pharmacological treatment
 

8201
02:21:51,920 --> 02:21:55,030
pharmacological treatment
and it's not delivered with therapy the

8202
02:21:55,030 --> 02:21:55,040
and it's not delivered with therapy the
 

8203
02:21:55,040 --> 02:21:57,030
and it's not delivered with therapy the
results fade pretty quickly

8204
02:21:57,030 --> 02:21:57,040
results fade pretty quickly
 

8205
02:21:57,040 --> 02:22:00,150
results fade pretty quickly
so you need to get more ketamine and so

8206
02:22:00,150 --> 02:22:00,160
so you need to get more ketamine and so
 

8207
02:22:00,160 --> 02:22:00,550
so you need to get more ketamine and so
it's

8208
02:22:00,550 --> 02:22:00,560
it's
 

8209
02:22:00,560 --> 02:22:02,230
it's
designed in a way to maximize the

8210
02:22:02,230 --> 02:22:02,240
designed in a way to maximize the
 

8211
02:22:02,240 --> 02:22:03,910
designed in a way to maximize the
profits for the

8212
02:22:03,910 --> 02:22:03,920
profits for the
 

8213
02:22:03,920 --> 02:22:05,510
profits for the
pharmaceutical company but it doesn't

8214
02:22:05,510 --> 02:22:05,520
pharmaceutical company but it doesn't
 

8215
02:22:05,520 --> 02:22:07,670
pharmaceutical company but it doesn't
maximize patient outcomes

8216
02:22:07,670 --> 02:22:07,680
maximize patient outcomes
 

8217
02:22:07,680 --> 02:22:09,270
maximize patient outcomes
what we're seeing though in these

8218
02:22:09,270 --> 02:22:09,280
what we're seeing though in these
 

8219
02:22:09,280 --> 02:22:11,510
what we're seeing though in these
various clinics that are being set up is

8220
02:22:11,510 --> 02:22:11,520
various clinics that are being set up is
 

8221
02:22:11,520 --> 02:22:14,070
various clinics that are being set up is
that a lot of people are realizing

8222
02:22:14,070 --> 02:22:14,080
that a lot of people are realizing
 

8223
02:22:14,080 --> 02:22:17,510
that a lot of people are realizing
that it works better with therapy

8224
02:22:17,510 --> 02:22:17,520
that it works better with therapy
 

8225
02:22:17,520 --> 02:22:19,670
that it works better with therapy
and so the clinics are run by people

8226
02:22:19,670 --> 02:22:19,680
and so the clinics are run by people
 

8227
02:22:19,680 --> 02:22:21,990
and so the clinics are run by people
that are therapists so that when they

8228
02:22:21,990 --> 02:22:22,000
that are therapists so that when they
 

8229
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:23,590
that are therapists so that when they
provide therapy they're making more

8230
02:22:23,590 --> 02:22:23,600
provide therapy they're making more
 

8231
02:22:23,600 --> 02:22:25,270
provide therapy they're making more
money and and then you need less

8232
02:22:25,270 --> 02:22:25,280
money and and then you need less
 

8233
02:22:25,280 --> 02:22:26,469
money and and then you need less
ketamine

8234
02:22:26,469 --> 02:22:26,479
ketamine
 

8235
02:22:26,479 --> 02:22:30,389
ketamine
also ketamine itself s ketamine is a

also ketamine itself s ketamine is a

also ketamine itself s ketamine is a
isomer of ketamine that's been patented

for depression
 

8241
02:22:33,439 --> 02:22:34,950
for depression
and they sell it for hundreds of dollars

8242
02:22:34,950 --> 02:22:34,960
and they sell it for hundreds of dollars
 

8243
02:22:34,960 --> 02:22:37,110
and they sell it for hundreds of dollars
but ketamine itself

02:22:37,110 --> 02:22:37,120
but ketamine itself
 

8245
02:22:37,120 --> 02:22:38,630
but ketamine itself

now there's a bunch of ketamine mills

8274
02:23:02,150 --> 02:23:02,160
now there's a bunch of ketamine mills
 

8275
02:23:02,160 --> 02:23:03,670
now there's a bunch of ketamine mills
you could say that are that are

8276
02:23:03,670 --> 02:23:03,680
you could say that are that are
 

8277
02:23:03,680 --> 02:23:05,349
you could say that are that are
just prescribing the ketamine and then

8278
02:23:05,349 --> 02:23:05,359
just prescribing the ketamine and then
 

8279
02:23:05,359 --> 02:23:07,030
just prescribing the ketamine and then
people are making a lot of money there

8280
02:23:07,030 --> 02:23:07,040
people are making a lot of money there
 

8281
02:23:07,040 --> 02:23:09,830
people are making a lot of money there
so i am worried about that i think the

8282
02:23:09,830 --> 02:23:09,840
so i am worried about that i think the
 

8283
02:23:09,840 --> 02:23:11,270
so i am worried about that i think the
best thing that we can do

8284
02:23:11,270 --> 02:23:11,280
best thing that we can do
 

8285
02:23:11,280 --> 02:23:15,510
best thing that we can do
is create an alternative narrative

8286
02:23:15,510 --> 02:23:15,520
is create an alternative narrative
 

8287
02:23:15,520 --> 02:23:17,429
is create an alternative narrative
a different kind of example we can lead

8288
02:23:17,429 --> 02:23:17,439
a different kind of example we can lead
 

8289
02:23:17,439 --> 02:23:18,710
a different kind of example we can lead
by example we can't make

8290
02:23:18,710 --> 02:23:18,720
by example we can't make
 

8291
02:23:18,720 --> 02:23:20,790
by example we can't make
for-profit companies into benefit

8292
02:23:20,790 --> 02:23:20,800
for-profit companies into benefit
 

8293
02:23:20,800 --> 02:23:22,309
for-profit companies into benefit
corporations

8294
02:23:22,309 --> 02:23:22,319
corporations
 

8295
02:23:22,319 --> 02:23:23,910
corporations
unless they want to do that we can't

8296
02:23:23,910 --> 02:23:23,920
unless they want to do that we can't
 

8297
02:23:23,920 --> 02:23:26,710
unless they want to do that we can't
make them to you know really

8298
02:23:26,710 --> 02:23:26,720
make them to you know really
 

8299
02:23:26,720 --> 02:23:29,030
make them to you know really
maximize patient outcomes but if we

8300
02:23:29,030 --> 02:23:29,040
maximize patient outcomes but if we
 

8301
02:23:29,040 --> 02:23:30,389
maximize patient outcomes but if we
create an example

8302
02:23:30,389 --> 02:23:30,399
create an example
 

8303
02:23:30,399 --> 02:23:32,950
create an example
of something that's different the hope

8304
02:23:32,950 --> 02:23:32,960
of something that's different the hope
 

8305
02:23:32,960 --> 02:23:33,670
of something that's different the hope
is that

8306
02:23:33,670 --> 02:23:33,680
is that
 

8307
02:23:33,680 --> 02:23:35,990
is that
um people will gravitate towards that

8308
02:23:35,990 --> 02:23:36,000
um people will gravitate towards that
 

8309
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:37,270
um people will gravitate towards that
and some of the other

8310
02:23:37,270 --> 02:23:37,280
and some of the other
 

8311
02:23:37,280 --> 02:23:39,190
and some of the other
companies like even now we have exxon

8312
02:23:39,190 --> 02:23:39,200
companies like even now we have exxon
 

8313
02:23:39,200 --> 02:23:41,110
companies like even now we have exxon
and other these uh companies

8314
02:23:41,110 --> 02:23:41,120
and other these uh companies
 

8315
02:23:41,120 --> 02:23:42,870
and other these uh companies
oil companies saying oh we're big into

8316
02:23:42,870 --> 02:23:42,880
oil companies saying oh we're big into
 

8317
02:23:42,880 --> 02:23:44,870
oil companies saying oh we're big into
alternative energy and we're

8318
02:23:44,870 --> 02:23:44,880
alternative energy and we're
 

8319
02:23:44,880 --> 02:23:47,110
alternative energy and we're
you know and that starts with companies

8320
02:23:47,110 --> 02:23:47,120
you know and that starts with companies
 

8321
02:23:47,120 --> 02:23:49,510
you know and that starts with companies
that show an example that uh

8322
02:23:49,510 --> 02:23:49,520
that show an example that uh
 

8323
02:23:49,520 --> 02:23:51,110
that show an example that uh
then communicates to the public that

8324
02:23:51,110 --> 02:23:51,120
then communicates to the public that
 

8325
02:23:51,120 --> 02:23:53,510
then communicates to the public that
this is something exciting and then they

8326
02:23:53,510 --> 02:23:53,520
this is something exciting and then they
 

8327
02:23:53,520 --> 02:23:54,309
this is something exciting and then they
demand of

8328
02:23:54,309 --> 02:23:54,319
demand of
 

8329
02:23:54,319 --> 02:23:56,630
demand of
the same of exxon and so on the public

8330
02:23:56,630 --> 02:23:56,640
the same of exxon and so on the public
 

8331
02:23:56,640 --> 02:23:57,670
the same of exxon and so on the public
demands and

8332
02:23:57,670 --> 02:23:57,680
demands and
 

8333
02:23:57,680 --> 02:23:59,990
demands and
you could say the same thing for the

8334
02:23:59,990 --> 02:24:00,000
you could say the same thing for the
 

8335
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:01,750
you could say the same thing for the
public demanding the

8336
02:24:01,750 --> 02:24:01,760
public demanding the
 

8337
02:24:01,760 --> 02:24:04,950
public demanding the
the big pharma to uh to

8338
02:24:04,950 --> 02:24:04,960
the big pharma to uh to
 

8339
02:24:04,960 --> 02:24:07,670
the big pharma to uh to
optimize for benefit versus optimize for

8340
02:24:07,670 --> 02:24:07,680
optimize for benefit versus optimize for
 

8341
02:24:07,680 --> 02:24:08,230
optimize for benefit versus optimize for
profit

8342
02:24:08,230 --> 02:24:08,240
profit
 

8343
02:24:08,240 --> 02:24:11,030
profit
and maybe giving power to the therapists

8344
02:24:11,030 --> 02:24:11,040
and maybe giving power to the therapists
 

8345
02:24:11,040 --> 02:24:12,790
and maybe giving power to the therapists
more power to the therapist more power

8346
02:24:12,790 --> 02:24:12,800
more power to the therapist more power
 

8347
02:24:12,800 --> 02:24:14,790
more power to the therapist more power
to the doctors that ultimately

8348
02:24:14,790 --> 02:24:14,800
to the doctors that ultimately
 

8349
02:24:14,800 --> 02:24:19,670
to the doctors that ultimately
uh want i think

8350
02:24:19,670 --> 02:24:19,680

 

8351
02:24:19,680 --> 02:24:21,750

incentives are interesting but i think

8352
02:24:21,750 --> 02:24:21,760
incentives are interesting but i think
 

8353
02:24:21,760 --> 02:24:24,070
incentives are interesting but i think
doctors ultimately

8354
02:24:24,070 --> 02:24:24,080
doctors ultimately
 

8355
02:24:24,080 --> 02:24:25,990
doctors ultimately
care more because they're in direct

8356
02:24:25,990 --> 02:24:26,000
care more because they're in direct
 

8357
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:27,270
care more because they're in direct
contact with humans

8358
02:24:27,270 --> 02:24:27,280
contact with humans
 

8359
02:24:27,280 --> 02:24:29,750
contact with humans
they want to make people better it's not

8360
02:24:29,750 --> 02:24:29,760
they want to make people better it's not
 

8361
02:24:29,760 --> 02:24:31,270
they want to make people better it's not
you know sure they want to make money

8362
02:24:31,270 --> 02:24:31,280
you know sure they want to make money
 

8363
02:24:31,280 --> 02:24:33,110
you know sure they want to make money
but they ultimately want to make people

8364
02:24:33,110 --> 02:24:33,120
but they ultimately want to make people
 

8365
02:24:33,120 --> 02:24:35,030
but they ultimately want to make people
feel better because they get to look at

8366
02:24:35,030 --> 02:24:35,040
feel better because they get to look at
 

8367
02:24:35,040 --> 02:24:36,790
feel better because they get to look at
people and it's so joyful

8368
02:24:36,790 --> 02:24:36,800
people and it's so joyful
 

8369
02:24:36,800 --> 02:24:38,710
people and it's so joyful
to make people feel better at the end of

8370
02:24:38,710 --> 02:24:38,720
to make people feel better at the end of
 

8371
02:24:38,720 --> 02:24:41,590
to make people feel better at the end of
the day so giving more power to them

8372
02:24:41,590 --> 02:24:41,600
the day so giving more power to them
 

8373
02:24:41,600 --> 02:24:44,389
the day so giving more power to them
is also perhaps one of the ways that you

8374
02:24:44,389 --> 02:24:44,399
is also perhaps one of the ways that you
 

8375
02:24:44,399 --> 02:24:46,309
is also perhaps one of the ways that you
then incentivize

8376
02:24:46,309 --> 02:24:46,319
then incentivize
 

8377
02:24:46,319 --> 02:24:49,750
then incentivize
uh the the pharma companies that are

8378
02:24:49,750 --> 02:24:49,760
uh the the pharma companies that are
 

8379
02:24:49,760 --> 02:24:52,389
uh the the pharma companies that are
trying to do good because the doctors

8380
02:24:52,389 --> 02:24:52,399
trying to do good because the doctors
 

8381
02:24:52,399 --> 02:24:53,750
trying to do good because the doctors
will choose those companies

8382
02:24:53,750 --> 02:24:53,760
will choose those companies
 

8383
02:24:53,760 --> 02:24:55,510
will choose those companies
yeah now the other part of this is drug

8384
02:24:55,510 --> 02:24:55,520
yeah now the other part of this is drug
 

8385
02:24:55,520 --> 02:24:56,870
yeah now the other part of this is drug
policy reform

8386
02:24:56,870 --> 02:24:56,880
policy reform
 

8387
02:24:56,880 --> 02:24:59,030
policy reform
right so that if we make it so you can

8388
02:24:59,030 --> 02:24:59,040
right so that if we make it so you can
 

8389
02:24:59,040 --> 02:25:01,429
right so that if we make it so you can
buy mdma for 10 or 20 bucks

8390
02:25:01,429 --> 02:25:01,439
buy mdma for 10 or 20 bucks
 

8391
02:25:01,439 --> 02:25:05,030
buy mdma for 10 or 20 bucks
on your own and we've trained people on

8392
02:25:05,030 --> 02:25:05,040
on your own and we've trained people on
 

8393
02:25:05,040 --> 02:25:06,469
on your own and we've trained people on
here's our therapeutic method

8394
02:25:06,469 --> 02:25:06,479
here's our therapeutic method
 

8395
02:25:06,479 --> 02:25:10,309
here's our therapeutic method
here is our ways for peer support

8396
02:25:10,309 --> 02:25:10,319
here is our ways for peer support
 

8397
02:25:10,319 --> 02:25:12,870
here is our ways for peer support
then people have an alternative from

8398
02:25:12,870 --> 02:25:12,880
then people have an alternative from
 

8399
02:25:12,880 --> 02:25:15,030
then people have an alternative from
buying it from the pharma companies

8400
02:25:15,030 --> 02:25:15,040
buying it from the pharma companies
 

8401
02:25:15,040 --> 02:25:18,389
buying it from the pharma companies
so most of the for-profit companies

8402
02:25:18,389 --> 02:25:18,399
so most of the for-profit companies
 

8403
02:25:18,399 --> 02:25:22,230
so most of the for-profit companies
have come to this conclusion that um

8404
02:25:22,230 --> 02:25:22,240
have come to this conclusion that um
 

8405
02:25:22,240 --> 02:25:23,830
have come to this conclusion that um
drug policy reform is bad for their

02:28:20,800 --> 02:28:23,030
we're sinking we're destroying the
planets destroying the environment so

8570
02:28:23,030 --> 02:28:23,040
planets destroying the environment so
 

8571
02:28:23,040 --> 02:28:24,630
planets destroying the environment so
it's um you need a certain amount of

8572
02:28:24,630 --> 02:28:24,640
it's um you need a certain amount of
 

8573
02:28:24,640 --> 02:28:27,110
it's um you need a certain amount of
money to be comfortable

8574
02:28:27,110 --> 02:28:27,120
money to be comfortable
 

8575
02:28:27,120 --> 02:28:29,349
money to be comfortable
to not be at that edge of survival

8576
02:28:29,349 --> 02:28:29,359
to not be at that edge of survival
 

8577
02:28:29,359 --> 02:28:30,469
to not be at that edge of survival
because once you're at that edge of

8578
02:28:30,469 --> 02:28:30,479
because once you're at that edge of
 

8579
02:28:30,479 --> 02:28:31,510
because once you're at that edge of
survival it's hard to think about

8580
02:28:31,510 --> 02:28:31,520
survival it's hard to think about
 

8581
02:28:31,520 --> 02:28:33,510
survival it's hard to think about
anything else but but i'd say to young

8582
02:28:33,510 --> 02:28:33,520
anything else but but i'd say to young
 

8583
02:28:33,520 --> 02:28:36,790
anything else but but i'd say to young
people

8584
02:28:36,790 --> 02:28:36,800

 

8585
02:28:36,800 --> 02:28:38,630

to the extent that you're able to do

8586
02:28:38,630 --> 02:28:38,640
to the extent that you're able to do
 

8587
02:28:38,640 --> 02:28:40,710
to the extent that you're able to do
this and again student debt and all this

8588
02:28:40,710 --> 02:28:40,720
this and again student debt and all this
 

8589
02:28:40,720 --> 02:28:42,630
this and again student debt and all this
kind of stuff is a big problem there too

8590
02:28:42,630 --> 02:28:42,640
kind of stuff is a big problem there too
 

8591
02:28:42,640 --> 02:28:47,349
kind of stuff is a big problem there too
but really just try to

8592
02:28:47,349 --> 02:28:47,359

 

8593
02:28:47,359 --> 02:28:48,950

find this combination of what the world

8594
02:28:48,950 --> 02:28:48,960
find this combination of what the world
 

8595
02:28:48,960 --> 02:28:51,190
find this combination of what the world
needs and what you need the other thing

8596
02:28:51,190 --> 02:28:51,200
needs and what you need the other thing
 

8597
02:28:51,200 --> 02:28:54,230
needs and what you need the other thing
to say to young people is um life is a

8598
02:28:54,230 --> 02:28:54,240
to say to young people is um life is a
 

8599
02:28:54,240 --> 02:28:56,630
to say to young people is um life is a
lot shorter than you think

8600
02:28:56,630 --> 02:28:56,640
lot shorter than you think
 

8601
02:28:56,640 --> 02:28:59,429
lot shorter than you think
that and a 20-year plan is not really

8602
02:28:59,429 --> 02:28:59,439
that and a 20-year plan is not really
 

8603
02:28:59,439 --> 02:29:00,309
that and a 20-year plan is not really
that long

8604
02:29:00,309 --> 02:29:00,319
that long
 

8605
02:29:00,319 --> 02:29:02,550
that long
so if it takes you 20 years to get in a

8606
02:29:02,550 --> 02:29:02,560
so if it takes you 20 years to get in a
 

8607
02:29:02,560 --> 02:29:05,990
so if it takes you 20 years to get in a
position to do what you want to do

8608
02:29:05,990 --> 02:29:06,000
position to do what you want to do
 

8609
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:08,710
position to do what you want to do
go for it you know have long-term plans

8610
02:29:08,710 --> 02:29:08,720
go for it you know have long-term plans
 

8611
02:29:08,720 --> 02:29:09,590
go for it you know have long-term plans
the the other part

8612
02:29:09,590 --> 02:29:09,600
the the other part
 

8613
02:29:09,600 --> 02:29:12,870
the the other part
that was so important for me to um

8614
02:29:12,870 --> 02:29:12,880
that was so important for me to um
 

8615
02:29:12,880 --> 02:29:14,230
that was so important for me to um
