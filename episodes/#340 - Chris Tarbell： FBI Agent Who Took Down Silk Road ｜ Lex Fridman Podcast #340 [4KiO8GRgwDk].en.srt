the project the browser what is the
onion technology behind Tor let's say

954
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:40,980
onion technology behind Tor let's say
 

955
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:42,430
onion technology behind Tor let's say
you want to go to a DOT onion site

956
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:42,440
you want to go to a DOT onion site
 

957
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,750
you want to go to a DOT onion site
you'll you'll put in the dot done you

958
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:44,760
you'll you'll put in the dot done you
 

959
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,310
you'll you'll put in the dot done you
want to go to and your computer will

960
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:46,320
want to go to and your computer will
 

961
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,289
want to go to and your computer will
build uh Communications with a tour

962
00:17:48,289 --> 00:17:48,299
build uh Communications with a tour
 

963
00:17:48,299 --> 00:17:50,150
build uh Communications with a tour
relay which are all publicly available

964
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:50,160
relay which are all publicly available
 

965
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,630
relay which are all publicly available
out there but you'll encrypt it you'll

966
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:53,640
out there but you'll encrypt it you'll
 

967
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,450
out there but you'll encrypt it you'll
put a package around your data and so

968
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:56,460
put a package around your data and so
 

969
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:59,330
put a package around your data and so
it's encrypted and so can't read it it

970
00:17:59,330 --> 00:17:59,340
it's encrypted and so can't read it it
 

971
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:01,909
it's encrypted and so can't read it it
goes to that that first relay that first

972
00:18:01,909 --> 00:18:01,919
goes to that that first relay that first
 

973
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:04,430
goes to that that first relay that first
relay knows about you and then knows

974
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:04,440
relay knows about you and then knows
 

975
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,710
relay knows about you and then knows
about the next relay down the chain and

976
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:06,720
about the next relay down the chain and
 

977
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,630
about the next relay down the chain and
so it takes your data and then encrypts

978
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:08,640
so it takes your data and then encrypts
 

979
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,070
so it takes your data and then encrypts
that on the outside and sends it to

980
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:10,080
that on the outside and sends it to
 

981
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,470
that on the outside and sends it to
relay number two now relay number two

982
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:12,480
relay number two now relay number two
 

983
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,450
relay number two now relay number two
only knows about relay number one it

984
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:14,460
only knows about relay number one it
 

985
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,130
only knows about relay number one it
doesn't know who you are asking for this

986
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:16,140
doesn't know who you are asking for this
 

987
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:17,870
doesn't know who you are asking for this
and it goes through there adding those

988
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:17,880
and it goes through there adding those
 

989
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,970
and it goes through there adding those
layers on top layers of encryption until

990
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:19,980
layers on top layers of encryption until
 

991
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:22,010
layers on top layers of encryption until
it gets where it is that and then even

992
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:22,020
it gets where it is that and then even
 

993
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,990
it gets where it is that and then even
the onion service doesn't know except

994
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:24,000
the onion service doesn't know except
 

995
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,450
the onion service doesn't know except
for the the relay it came from who it's

996
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:26,460
for the the relay it came from who it's
 

997
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:28,549
for the the relay it came from who it's
talking to and so it peels back that

998
00:18:28,549 --> 00:18:28,559
talking to and so it peels back that
 

999
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,409
talking to and so it peels back that
gives you the information puts another

1000
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:30,419
gives you the information puts another
 

1001
00:18:30,419 --> 00:18:33,110
gives you the information puts another
layer back on and so it's it's layers

1002
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:33,120
layer back on and so it's it's layers
 

1003
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,750
layer back on and so it's it's layers
like you're peeling an onion back of the

1004
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:35,760
like you're peeling an onion back of the
 

1005
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,490
like you're peeling an onion back of the
different relays and that encryption

1006
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:37,500
different relays and that encryption
 

1007
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,610
different relays and that encryption
protects uh who the sender is and what

1008
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:40,620
protects uh who the sender is and what
 

1009
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:41,690
protects uh who the sender is and what
information they're saying the more

1010
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:41,700
information they're saying the more
 

1011
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:44,690
information they're saying the more
layers there are the more exponentially

1012
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:44,700
layers there are the more exponentially
 

1013
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,909
layers there are the more exponentially
difficult it is to decrypt it

1014
00:18:46,909 --> 00:18:46,919
difficult it is to decrypt it
 

1015
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:48,770
difficult it is to decrypt it
I mean you get to a place where you

1016
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:48,780
I mean you get to a place where you
 

1017
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,210
I mean you get to a place where you
don't have to have so many layers

1018
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:50,220
don't have to have so many layers
 

1019
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:52,310
don't have to have so many layers
because it doesn't matter anymore it's

1020
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:52,320
because it doesn't matter anymore it's
 

1021
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,470
because it doesn't matter anymore it's
mathematically impossible to decrypt it

1022
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:54,480
mathematically impossible to decrypt it
 

1023
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,409
mathematically impossible to decrypt it
but yeah um you know the more relays you

1024
00:18:57,409 --> 00:18:57,419
but yeah um you know the more relays you
 

1025
00:18:57,419 --> 00:18:58,970
but yeah um you know the more relays you
have the slower it is I mean that's one

1026
00:18:58,970 --> 00:18:58,980
have the slower it is I mean that's one
 

1027
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:01,610
have the slower it is I mean that's one
of the big drawbacks on tour is is how

1028
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:01,620
of the big drawbacks on tour is is how
 

1029
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:03,110
of the big drawbacks on tour is is how
slow it operates

1030
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:03,120
slow it operates
 

1031
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,930
slow it operates
so how do you peel the onion

1032
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:05,940
so how do you peel the onion
 

1033
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,190
so how do you peel the onion
so what what are the different

1034
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:07,200
so what what are the different
 

1035
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,230
so what what are the different
methodologies for trying to get

1036
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:09,240
methodologies for trying to get
 

1037
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,930
methodologies for trying to get
some information from a cyber security

1038
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:11,940
some information from a cyber security
 

1039
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:14,270
some information from a cyber security
perspective on these operations like the

1040
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:14,280
perspective on these operations like the
 

1041
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:17,330
perspective on these operations like the
Silk Road it's very difficult people

1042
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:17,340
Silk Road it's very difficult people
 

1043
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:18,710
Silk Road it's very difficult people
have come up with different techniques

1044
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:18,720
have come up with different techniques
 

1045
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,870
have come up with different techniques
they're um there's been techniques to

1046
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:20,880
they're um there's been techniques to
 

1047
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,150
they're um there's been techniques to
put out in the in the news media about

1048
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:23,160
put out in the in the news media about
 

1049
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,850
put out in the in the news media about
how they do it um running like massive

1050
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:25,860
how they do it um running like massive
 

1051
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,890
how they do it um running like massive
amounts of relays and you're controlling

1052
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:27,900
amounts of relays and you're controlling
 

1053
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,270
amounts of relays and you're controlling
those relays I think I believe someone

1054
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:29,280
those relays I think I believe someone
 

1055
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,190
those relays I think I believe someone
tried that once so there's a technical

1056
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:31,200
tried that once so there's a technical
 

1057
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,289
tried that once so there's a technical
solution and and what about social

1058
00:19:33,289 --> 00:19:33,299
solution and and what about social
 

1059
00:19:33,299 --> 00:19:36,350
solution and and what about social
engineering what about trying to

1060
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:36,360
engineering what about trying to
 

1061
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,049
engineering what about trying to
infiltrate

1062
00:19:38,049 --> 00:19:38,059
infiltrate
 

1063
00:19:38,059 --> 00:19:41,090
infiltrate
the actual humans they're using

1064
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:41,100
the actual humans they're using

Nah The Silk Road and trying to get in

1066
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:43,620
Nah The Silk Road and trying to get in
 

1067
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:44,930
Nah The Silk Road and trying to get in
that way

1068
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:44,940
that way
 

1069
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:46,909
that way
yeah I mean I I definitely could see the

1070
00:19:46,909 --> 00:19:46,919
yeah I mean I I definitely could see the
 

1071
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:48,770
yeah I mean I I definitely could see the
way of doing that and then in this case

1072
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:48,780
way of doing that and then in this case
 

1073
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:51,710
way of doing that and then in this case
uh in our takedown we use that

1074
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:51,720
uh in our takedown we use that
 

1075
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,810
uh in our takedown we use that
um there was one of my partners uh Jared

1076
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:53,820
um there was one of my partners uh Jared
 

1077
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,909
um there was one of my partners uh Jared
Dairy again he was an HSI investigator

1078
00:19:55,909 --> 00:19:55,919
Dairy again he was an HSI investigator
 

1079
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:58,010
Dairy again he was an HSI investigator
and he had worked his way up to be a

1080
00:19:58,010 --> 00:19:58,020
and he had worked his way up to be a
 

1081
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:00,289
and he had worked his way up to be a
system admin on the site

1082
00:20:00,289 --> 00:20:00,299
system admin on the site
 

1083
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:02,150
system admin on the site
um so that did glean quite a bit of

1084
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:02,160
um so that did glean quite a bit of
 

1085
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,010
um so that did glean quite a bit of
information because he was he was inside

1086
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:04,020
information because he was he was inside
 

1087
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:07,010
information because he was he was inside
and talking to uh you know at that time

1088
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:07,020
and talking to uh you know at that time
 

1089
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:09,169
and talking to uh you know at that time
we only know it is DPR or dread pirate

1090
00:20:09,169 --> 00:20:09,179
we only know it is DPR or dread pirate
 

1091
00:20:09,179 --> 00:20:11,090
we only know it is DPR or dread pirate
Roberts uh we didn't know who who that

1092
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:11,100
Roberts uh we didn't know who who that
 

1093
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,770
Roberts uh we didn't know who who that
was yet but but we had that open

1094
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:12,780
was yet but but we had that open
 

1095
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:14,630
was yet but but we had that open
communication

1096
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:14,640
communication
 

1097
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,490
communication
um you know and one of the things you

1098
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:16,500
um you know and one of the things you
 

1099
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,650
um you know and one of the things you
know the technical aspects on that is

1100
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:18,660
know the technical aspects on that is
 

1101
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:22,010
know the technical aspects on that is
there was a jabber server that was uh

1102
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:22,020
there was a jabber server that was uh
 

1103
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,330
there was a jabber server that was uh
that's a communication type of

1104
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:23,340
that's a communication type of
 

1105
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:24,950
that's a communication type of
communication server

1106
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:24,960
communication server
 

1107
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,830
communication server
um that was being used and we knew that

1108
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:27,840
um that was being used and we knew that

people from all walks of life and
understanding criminals

1304
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:07,500
understanding criminals
 

1305
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:10,490
understanding criminals
understanding their mind I think is very

1306
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:10,500
understanding their mind I think is very
 

1307
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,470
understanding their mind I think is very
important

1308
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:12,480
important
 

1309
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,149
important
and I think there's fundamentally

1310
00:24:14,149 --> 00:24:14,159
and I think there's fundamentally
 

1311
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:15,590
and I think there's fundamentally
something different between a criminal

1312
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:15,600
something different between a criminal
 

1313
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,810
something different between a criminal
who's still active versus one that's

1314
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:17,820
who's still active versus one that's
 

1315
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:20,810
who's still active versus one that's
been caught the mind just from observing

1316
00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:20,820
been caught the mind just from observing
 

1317
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:22,130
been caught the mind just from observing
it changes

1318
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:22,140
it changes
 

1319
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:24,950
it changes
completely once you're caught you you

1320
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:24,960
completely once you're caught you you
 

1321
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,049
completely once you're caught you you
have a big shift in your understanding

1322
00:24:27,049 --> 00:24:27,059
have a big shift in your understanding
 

1323
00:24:27,059 --> 00:24:28,730
have a big shift in your understanding
of the world

1324
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:28,740
of the world
 

1325
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:30,470
of the world

1395
00:25:44,039 --> 00:25:46,610
that's gonna take get taken out of
context but I just I think it's a worthy

1396
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:46,620
context but I just I think it's a worthy
 

1397
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:49,370
context but I just I think it's a worthy
effort it's a word it's worthy to go

1398
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:49,380
effort it's a word it's worthy to go
 

1399
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:50,750
effort it's a word it's worthy to go
through the hardship of that to

1400
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:50,760
through the hardship of that to
 

1401
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:53,049
through the hardship of that to
understand the mind of somebody I think

1402
00:25:53,049 --> 00:25:53,059
understand the mind of somebody I think
 

1403
00:25:53,059 --> 00:25:55,850
understand the mind of somebody I think
fundamentally conversations are a

1404
00:25:55,850 --> 00:25:55,860
fundamentally conversations are a
 

1405
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:57,830
fundamentally conversations are a
different thing than the operation of

1406
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:57,840
different thing than the operation of
 

1407
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,690
different thing than the operation of
law enforcement understanding the mind

1408
00:25:59,690 --> 00:25:59,700
law enforcement understanding the mind
 

1409
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:00,769
law enforcement understanding the mind
of a criminal I think is really

1410
00:26:00,769 --> 00:26:00,779
of a criminal I think is really
 

1411
00:26:00,779 --> 00:26:02,630

important I don't know if you're going
 

1413
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,730
important I don't know if you're going
to have the honest conversation that

00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:04,740
to have the honest conversation that
 

1415
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:06,409
to have the honest conversation that
you're looking for I mean it may sound

1417
00:26:06,419 --> 00:26:08,510

they might have
 

1487
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:28,970
they might have
I I know you might say it's just a

I I know you might say it's just a
 

1489

I I know you might say it's just a

narrative but they might have a kind of
 

1491
00:27:32,039 --> 00:27:34,490
narrative but they might have a kind of

the world that they're essentially

the world that they're essentially
attacking the weakness of the cyber

1496
00:27:39,409 --> 00:27:39,419
attacking the weakness of the cyber
 

1497
00:27:39,419 --> 00:27:41,029
attacking the weakness of the cyber
security infrastructure because they

1498
00:27:41,029 --> 00:27:41,039
security infrastructure because they
 

1499
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:43,430
security infrastructure because they
believe ultimately that would lead to a

1500
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:43,440
believe ultimately that would lead to a
 

1501
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,870
believe ultimately that would lead to a
safer world

1502
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:44,880
safer world
 

1503
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,610
safer world
so the attacks will reveal the

1504
00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:46,620
so the attacks will reveal the
 

1505
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:47,810
so the attacks will reveal the
weaknesses

1506
00:27:47,810 --> 00:27:47,820
weaknesses
 

1507
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:50,210
weaknesses
and if they're stealing a bunch of money

1508
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:50,220
and if they're stealing a bunch of money
 

1509
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:52,070
and if they're stealing a bunch of money
that's okay because that's going to

1510
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:52,080
that's okay because that's going to
 

1511
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,810
that's okay because that's going to
enforce you to invest a lot more money

those kinds of things I mean I could I

1520
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:02,100
those kinds of things I mean I could I
 

1521
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:04,970
those kinds of things I mean I could I
could see if you know it's fascinating

1522
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:04,980
could see if you know it's fascinating
 

1523
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:06,830
could see if you know it's fascinating
to explore the mind of a human being

1524
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:06,840
to explore the mind of a human being
 

1525
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:09,230
to explore the mind of a human being
like that because

1526
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:09,240
like that because
 

1527
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,669
like that because
um I think it will help people

1528
00:28:10,669 --> 00:28:10,679
um I think it will help people
 

1529
00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:14,269
um I think it will help people
understand now of course

1530
00:28:14,269 --> 00:28:14,279
understand now of course
 

1531
00:28:14,279 --> 00:28:15,830
understand now of course
uh

1532
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:15,840
uh
 

1533
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,710
uh
it's still a person that's creating a

00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:18,720
it's still a person that's creating a
 

1535
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,269
it's still a person that's creating a
lot of suffering in the world which is a

1536
00:28:20,269 --> 00:28:20,279
lot of suffering in the world which is a
 

1537
00:28:20,279 --> 00:28:22,610
lot of suffering in the world which is a
problem so do you think ethically it's a

1538
00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:22,620
problem so do you think ethically it's a
 

1539
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:23,870
problem so do you think ethically it's a

wasn't even hacking he just was sent a
 

2069
00:37:49,079 --> 00:37:50,810
wasn't even hacking he just was sent a
link and he clicked on it and then 10

2070
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:50,820
link and he clicked on it and then 10
 

2071
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:52,910

million lines of uh of logs there was

2072
00:37:52,910 --> 00:37:52,920
million lines of uh of logs there was
 

2073
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:55,670
million lines of uh of logs there was
one IP address that stuck out

2074
00:37:55,670 --> 00:37:55,680
one IP address that stuck out
 

2075
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,410
one IP address that stuck out
this is fascinating we'll explore

2076
00:37:57,410 --> 00:37:57,420
this is fascinating we'll explore
 

2077
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:59,329
this is fascinating we'll explore
several angles of that so

2078
00:37:59,329 --> 00:37:59,339
several angles of that so
 

2079
00:37:59,339 --> 00:38:00,250
several angles of that so
um

2080
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:00,260
um
 

2081
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:03,730
um
uh what was the process of bringing down

2082
00:38:03,730 --> 00:38:03,740
uh what was the process of bringing down
 

2083
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:07,069
uh what was the process of bringing down
Ross and uh the Silk Road all right so

Ross and uh the Silk Road all right so
 

2085
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:08,450
Ross and uh the Silk Road all right so
that's a long story you want the whole

2086
00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:08,460
that's a long story you want the whole
 

2087
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:09,890
that's a long story you want the whole
thing you want to break it up let's

2088
00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:09,900
thing you want to break it up let's
 

2089
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:11,450
thing you want to break it up let's
start at the beginning

2090
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:11,460
start at the beginning
 

2091
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:15,650
start at the beginning
once we had the information of the chat

2092
00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:15,660
once we had the information of the chat
 

2093
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:17,510
once we had the information of the chat
logs and all that from the server

2094
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:17,520
logs and all that from the server
 

2095
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:20,329
logs and all that from the server
we found the server what's a chat log so

2096
00:38:20,329 --> 00:38:20,339
we found the server what's a chat log so
 

2097
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:22,609
we found the server what's a chat log so
the dot onion was uh running the the

2098
00:38:22,609 --> 00:38:22,619
the dot onion was uh running the the
 

2099
00:38:22,619 --> 00:38:25,430
the dot onion was uh running the the
website the Silk Road was running on a

2100
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:25,440
website the Silk Road was running on a
 

2101
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,930
website the Silk Road was running on a
server in Iceland

2102
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:26,940
server in Iceland
 

2103
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:28,970
server in Iceland
how did you figure that out that was one

2104
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:28,980
how did you figure that out that was one
 

2105
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:31,970
how did you figure that out that was one
of the uh claims that the NSA yeah

2106
00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:31,980
of the uh claims that the NSA yeah
 

2107
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:33,890
of the uh claims that the NSA yeah
that's that's the one that we said that

2108
00:38:33,890 --> 00:38:33,900
that's that's the one that we said that
 

2109
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:35,690
that's that's the one that we said that
yeah I wouldn't tell you if it was the

2110
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:35,700
yeah I wouldn't tell you if it was the
 

2111
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:37,010
yeah I wouldn't tell you if it was the
it's on the internet I mean the internet

2112
00:38:37,010 --> 00:38:37,020
it's on the internet I mean the internet
 

2113
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:38,569
it's on the internet I mean the internet
has their conspiracy theories and all

2114
00:38:38,569 --> 00:38:38,579
has their conspiracy theories and all
 

2115
00:38:38,579 --> 00:38:40,790
has their conspiracy theories and all
that so but you figure out that's the

2116
00:38:40,790 --> 00:38:40,800
that so but you figure out that's the
 

2117
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,530
that so but you figure out that's the
part of the thing you do you it's puzzle

2118
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:42,540
part of the thing you do you it's puzzle
 

2119
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:43,730
part of the thing you do you it's puzzle
pieces you have to put them together

2120
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:43,740
pieces you have to put them together
 

2121
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:45,530
pieces you have to put them together
yeah and look for different pieces of

2122
00:38:45,530 --> 00:38:45,540
yeah and look for different pieces of
 

2123
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:47,210
yeah and look for different pieces of
information and figure out okay so you

2124
00:38:47,210 --> 00:38:47,220
information and figure out okay so you
 

2125
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:48,890
information and figure out okay so you
figure out the servers in Iceland we get

2126
00:38:48,890 --> 00:38:48,900
figure out the servers in Iceland we get
 

2127
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:50,450
figure out the servers in Iceland we get
a copy of it and so we start getting

2128
00:38:50,450 --> 00:38:50,460
a copy of it and so we start getting
 

2129
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:52,490
a copy of it and so we start getting
clues off of that with the physical copy

2130
00:38:52,490 --> 00:38:52,500
clues off of that with the physical copy
 

2131
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,650
clues off of that with the physical copy
of the server yeah we flew you fly over

2132
00:38:54,650 --> 00:38:54,660
of the server yeah we flew you fly over
 

2133
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:56,390
of the server yeah we flew you fly over
there so you you go if you've been

2134
00:38:56,390 --> 00:38:56,400
there so you you go if you've been

of his actions were anti-American I
 

2499
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:29,450
of his actions were anti-American I
don't know if his actions or anything do

2500
00:45:29,450 --> 00:45:29,460
don't know if his actions or anything do
 

2501
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:30,770
don't know if his actions or anything do
you think he could have anticipated the

2502
00:45:30,770 --> 00:45:30,780
you think he could have anticipated the
 

2503
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:32,930
you think he could have anticipated the
the negative consequences of his action

2504
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:32,940
the negative consequences of his action
 

2505
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:35,270
the negative consequences of his action
should we judge him by the consequences

2506
00:45:35,270 --> 00:45:35,280
should we judge him by the consequences
 

2507
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:37,130
should we judge him by the consequences
or the ideals

2508
00:45:37,130 --> 00:45:37,140
or the ideals
 

2509
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:39,950
or the ideals
of the intent of his actions I think we

2510
00:45:39,950 --> 00:45:39,960
of the intent of his actions I think we
 

2511
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:41,569
of the intent of his actions I think we
all get to judge him by base our own

2512
00:45:41,569 --> 00:45:41,579
all get to judge him by base our own
 

2513
00:45:41,579 --> 00:45:44,210
all get to judge him by base our own
beliefs but I believe what he did was

2514
00:45:44,210 --> 00:45:44,220
beliefs but I believe what he did was
 

2515
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:46,370
beliefs but I believe what he did was
wrong can you still man the case that

00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:47,990
wrong can you still man the case that
he's actually

reason I mean he put you know some of
 

2541
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:16,490
reason I mean he put you know some of
our best capabilities

2542
00:46:16,490 --> 00:46:16,500
our best capabilities
 

2543
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:18,950
our best capabilities
um he made them publicly available

2544
00:46:18,950 --> 00:46:18,960
um he made them publicly available
 

2545
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:20,809
um he made them publicly available
um they really kind of set us back in

2546
00:46:20,809 --> 00:46:20,819
um they really kind of set us back in
 

2547
00:46:20,819 --> 00:46:23,329
um they really kind of set us back in
the and this isn't my world at all but

2548
00:46:23,329 --> 00:46:23,339
the and this isn't my world at all but
 

2549
00:46:23,339 --> 00:46:25,250
the and this isn't my world at all but
the offensive side of cyber security

2550
00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:25,260
the offensive side of cyber security
 

2551
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:27,109
the offensive side of cyber security
right so he revealed stuff that he

2552
00:46:27,109 --> 00:46:27,119
right so he revealed stuff that he
 

2553
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:28,790
right so he revealed stuff that he
didn't need to reveal in order to make

2554
00:46:28,790 --> 00:46:28,800
didn't need to reveal in order to make
 

2555
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:33,349
didn't need to reveal in order to make
the point correct the so so you if you

2556
00:46:33,349 --> 00:46:33,359
the point correct the so so you if you
 

2557
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:35,569
the point correct the so so you if you
can imagine a world where he leaked

2558
00:46:35,569 --> 00:46:35,579
can imagine a world where he leaked
 

2559
00:46:35,579 --> 00:46:38,270
can imagine a world where he leaked
stuff that revealed the mass

2560
00:46:38,270 --> 00:46:38,280
stuff that revealed the mass
 

2561
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:40,309
stuff that revealed the mass
surveillance efforts

2562
00:46:40,309 --> 00:46:40,319
surveillance efforts
 

2563
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:44,630
surveillance efforts
and not reveal other stuff

2564
00:46:44,630 --> 00:46:44,640
and not reveal other stuff
 

2565
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:47,329
and not reveal other stuff
is the mass surveillance I mean that's

2566
00:46:47,329 --> 00:46:47,339
is the mass surveillance I mean that's
 

2567
00:46:47,339 --> 00:46:50,030
is the mass surveillance I mean that's
the thing that uh of course there's in

2568
00:46:50,030 --> 00:46:50,040
the thing that uh of course there's in
 

2569
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:51,170
the thing that uh of course there's in
the interpretation of that there's

2570
00:46:51,170 --> 00:46:51,180
the interpretation of that there's
 

2571
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:54,050
the interpretation of that there's
fear-mongering but at the core that was

2572
00:46:54,050 --> 00:46:54,060
fear-mongering but at the core that was
 

2573
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:57,650
fear-mongering but at the core that was
a real shock to people that

2574
00:46:57,650 --> 00:46:57,660
a real shock to people that
 

2575
00:46:57,660 --> 00:46:59,390
a real shock to people that
um it's possible for government to

2576
00:46:59,390 --> 00:46:59,400
um it's possible for government to
 

2577
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:03,650
um it's possible for government to
collect data at scale

2578
00:47:03,650 --> 00:47:03,660

 

2579
00:47:03,660 --> 00:47:05,210

it's surprising to me that people are

2580
00:47:05,210 --> 00:47:05,220
it's surprising to me that people are
 

2581
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:06,710
it's surprising to me that people are
that shocked by it

2582
00:47:06,710 --> 00:47:06,720
that shocked by it
 

2583
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:08,630
that shocked by it
well there's conspiracies and then

2584
00:47:08,630 --> 00:47:08,640
well there's conspiracies and then
 

2585
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:12,530
well there's conspiracies and then
there's like actual uh evidence that

2586
00:47:12,530 --> 00:47:12,540
there's like actual uh evidence that
 

2587
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:14,809
there's like actual uh evidence that
that is happening I mean it's it's a

2588
00:47:14,809 --> 00:47:14,819
that is happening I mean it's it's a
 

2589
00:47:14,819 --> 00:47:17,270
that is happening I mean it's it's a
real there's a lot of reality that

2590
00:47:17,270 --> 00:47:17,280
real there's a lot of reality that
 

2591
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:20,329
real there's a lot of reality that
people ignore but when it hits you in

2592
00:47:20,329 --> 00:47:20,339
people ignore but when it hits you in
 

2593
00:47:20,339 --> 00:47:21,770
people ignore but when it hits you in
the face you realize holy [\h__\h] we're

2594
00:47:21,770 --> 00:47:21,780
the face you realize holy [\h__\h] we're
 

2595
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:24,230
the face you realize holy [\h__\h] we're
living in a new world this is this is

2596
00:47:24,230 --> 00:47:24,240
living in a new world this is this is
 

2597
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:25,730
living in a new world this is this is
the new reality and we have to deal with

2598
00:47:25,730 --> 00:47:25,740
the new reality and we have to deal with
 

2599
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:27,710
the new reality and we have to deal with
that reality just like you work in cyber

2600
00:47:27,710 --> 00:47:27,720
that reality just like you work in cyber
 

2601
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:30,230
that reality just like you work in cyber
security I think it really hasn't hit

2602
00:47:30,230 --> 00:47:30,240
security I think it really hasn't hit
 

2603
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:31,809
security I think it really hasn't hit
most people

2604
00:47:31,809 --> 00:47:31,819
most people
 

2605
00:47:31,819 --> 00:47:36,349
most people
how [\h__\h] we all are in terms of cyber

2606
00:47:36,349 --> 00:47:36,359
how [\h__\h] we all are in terms of cyber
 

2607
00:47:36,359 --> 00:47:39,290
how [\h__\h] we all are in terms of cyber
security okay let me rephrase that how

2608
00:47:39,290 --> 00:47:39,300
security okay let me rephrase that how
 

2609
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:41,210
security okay let me rephrase that how
many dangers there are in the digital

2610
00:47:41,210 --> 00:47:41,220
many dangers there are in the digital
 

2611
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:43,849
many dangers there are in the digital
world how much under attack we all are

2612
00:47:43,849 --> 00:47:43,859
world how much under attack we all are
 

2613
00:47:43,859 --> 00:47:47,030
world how much under attack we all are
and how more uh intensity attacks are

2614
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:47,040
and how more uh intensity attacks are
 

2615
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:49,250
and how more uh intensity attacks are
getting and how difficult the defense is

2616
00:47:49,250 --> 00:47:49,260
getting and how difficult the defense is
 

2617
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:51,710
getting and how difficult the defense is
and how important it is and how much we

2618
00:47:51,710 --> 00:47:51,720
and how important it is and how much we
 

2619
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:52,970
and how important it is and how much we
should value it and all the different

2620
00:47:52,970 --> 00:47:52,980
should value it and all the different
 

2621
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:54,349
should value it and all the different
things we should do at the small and

2622
00:47:54,349 --> 00:47:54,359
things we should do at the small and
 

2623
00:47:54,359 --> 00:47:56,329
things we should do at the small and
large scale to defend like most people

2624
00:47:56,329 --> 00:47:56,339
large scale to defend like most people
 

2625
00:47:56,339 --> 00:47:58,849
large scale to defend like most people
really haven't woken up they think about

2626
00:47:58,849 --> 00:47:58,859
really haven't woken up they think about
 

2627
00:47:58,859 --> 00:48:01,309
really haven't woken up they think about
privacy from tech companies they don't

2628
00:48:01,309 --> 00:48:01,319
privacy from tech companies they don't
 

2629
00:48:01,319 --> 00:48:04,130
privacy from tech companies they don't
think about attacks cyber attacks people

2630
00:48:04,130 --> 00:48:04,140
think about attacks cyber attacks people
 

2631
00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:05,690
think about attacks cyber attacks people
don't think they're a Target and it's it

2632
00:48:05,690 --> 00:48:05,700
don't think they're a Target and it's it
 

2633
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:07,609
don't think they're a Target and it's it
that message definitely have to get out

2634
00:48:07,609 --> 00:48:07,619
that message definitely have to get out
 

2635
00:48:07,619 --> 00:48:09,829
that message definitely have to get out
there I mean you know if you have a

2636
00:48:09,829 --> 00:48:09,839
there I mean you know if you have a
 

2637
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:11,630
there I mean you know if you have a
voice you're a Target if of the place

2638
00:48:11,630 --> 00:48:11,640
voice you're a Target if of the place
 

2639
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:13,250
voice you're a Target if of the place
you work you might be a Target you know

2640
00:48:13,250 --> 00:48:13,260
you work you might be a Target you know
 

2641
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:15,109
you work you might be a Target you know
your husband might work at some place

2642
00:48:15,109 --> 00:48:15,119
your husband might work at some place
 

2643
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:16,790
your husband might work at some place
you know and because now people are

2644
00:48:16,790 --> 00:48:16,800
you know and because now people are
 

2645
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,109
you know and because now people are
working from home so they're going to

2646
00:48:18,109 --> 00:48:18,119
working from home so they're going to
 

2647
00:48:18,119 --> 00:48:19,790
working from home so they're going to
Target you know Target you to get access

2648
00:48:19,790 --> 00:48:19,800
Target you know Target you to get access
 

2649
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:21,890
Target you know Target you to get access
to to his Network in order to get in

2650
00:48:21,890 --> 00:48:21,900
to to his Network in order to get in
 

2651
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:25,190
to to his Network in order to get in
when that same way the idea that the US

2652
00:48:25,190 --> 00:48:25,200
when that same way the idea that the US
 

2653
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,690
when that same way the idea that the US
government or any government could be

2654
00:48:26,690 --> 00:48:26,700
government or any government could be
 

2655
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:29,270
government or any government could be
doing Mass surveillance on its citizens

2656
00:48:29,270 --> 00:48:29,280
doing Mass surveillance on its citizens
 

2657
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:32,630
doing Mass surveillance on its citizens
is um is one that was a wake-up call

2658
00:48:32,630 --> 00:48:32,640
is um is one that was a wake-up call
 

2659
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:36,170
is um is one that was a wake-up call
because you could imagine the ways in

2660
00:48:36,170 --> 00:48:36,180
because you could imagine the ways in
 

2661
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:38,809
because you could imagine the ways in
which that could um

2662
00:48:38,809 --> 00:48:38,819
which that could um
 

2663
00:48:38,819 --> 00:48:41,210
which that could um
be a uh like you could abuse the power

2664
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:41,220
be a uh like you could abuse the power
 

2665
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:43,370
be a uh like you could abuse the power
of that to control a citizenry for

2666
00:48:43,370 --> 00:48:43,380
of that to control a citizenry for
 

2667
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:45,430
of that to control a citizenry for
political reasons and purposes

2668
00:48:45,430 --> 00:48:45,440
political reasons and purposes
 

2669
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:48,410
political reasons and purposes
absolutely you know you could abuse it I

2670
00:48:48,410 --> 00:48:48,420
absolutely you know you could abuse it I
 

2671
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:50,089
absolutely you know you could abuse it I
I think during in the part of the

2672
00:48:50,089 --> 00:48:50,099
I think during in the part of the
 

2673
00:48:50,099 --> 00:48:52,730
I think during in the part of the
Snowden League saw the two NSA guys were

2674
00:48:52,730 --> 00:48:52,740
Snowden League saw the two NSA guys were
 

2675
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:55,670
Snowden League saw the two NSA guys were
uh moderating like their girlfriends and

2676
00:48:55,670 --> 00:48:55,680
uh moderating like their girlfriends and
 

2677
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:56,870
uh moderating like their girlfriends and
there's rules in place for that those

2678
00:48:56,870 --> 00:48:56,880
there's rules in place for that those
 

2679
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:58,010
there's rules in place for that those
people should be punished and for

2680
00:48:58,010 --> 00:48:58,020
people should be punished and for
 

2681
00:48:58,020 --> 00:49:00,650
people should be punished and for
abusing that but how else are we going

2682
00:49:00,650 --> 00:49:00,660
abusing that but how else are we going
 

2683
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:03,109
abusing that but how else are we going
to hear about you know terrorists that

2684
00:49:03,109 --> 00:49:03,119
to hear about you know terrorists that
 

2685
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:04,670
to hear about you know terrorists that
are in the country talking about

2686
00:49:04,670 --> 00:49:04,680
are in the country talking about
 

2687
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:06,050
are in the country talking about
birthday cakes

2688
00:49:06,050 --> 00:49:06,060
birthday cakes
 

2689
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:08,210
birthday cakes
uh and you know that was a case where

2690
00:49:08,210 --> 00:49:08,220
uh and you know that was a case where
 

2691
00:49:08,220 --> 00:49:09,650
uh and you know that was a case where
that that was the trip word that that

2692
00:49:09,650 --> 00:49:09,660
that that was the trip word that that
 

2693
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:11,329
that that was the trip word that that
you know we're gonna go and bomb New

2694
00:49:11,329 --> 00:49:11,339

York City's Subway yeah it's complicated

2696
00:49:13,670 --> 00:49:13,680
York City's Subway yeah it's complicated
 

2697
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:15,290
York City's Subway yeah it's complicated
but it just feels like there should be

2698
00:49:15,290 --> 00:49:15,300
but it just feels like there should be
 

2699
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:17,510
but it just feels like there should be
some balance of transparency there

2700
00:49:17,510 --> 00:49:17,520
some balance of transparency there
 

2701
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:19,250
some balance of transparency there
should be a check in that power

2702
00:49:19,250 --> 00:49:19,260
should be a check in that power
 

2703
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:21,589
should be a check in that power
because like you you know in the name of

2704
00:49:21,589 --> 00:49:21,599
because like you you know in the name of
 

2705
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:23,690
because like you you know in the name of
the war on terror

2706
00:49:23,690 --> 00:49:23,700
the war on terror
 

2707
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:27,050
the war on terror
you can sort of uh sacrifice it there is

2708
00:49:27,050 --> 00:49:27,060
you can sort of uh sacrifice it there is
 

2709
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:28,790
you can sort of uh sacrifice it there is
a trade-off between security and freedom

2710
00:49:28,790 --> 00:49:28,800
a trade-off between security and freedom
 

2711
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:31,069
a trade-off between security and freedom
uh but it just feels like there's a

2712
00:49:31,069 --> 00:49:31,079
uh but it just feels like there's a
 

2713
00:49:31,079 --> 00:49:33,950
uh but it just feels like there's a
giant slippery slope on the sacrificing

2714
00:49:33,950 --> 00:49:33,960
giant slippery slope on the sacrificing
 

2715
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:35,930
giant slippery slope on the sacrificing
of freedom in the name of security it's

2716
00:49:35,930 --> 00:49:35,940
of freedom in the name of security it's
 

2717
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:38,930
of freedom in the name of security it's

yeah that's a tricky balance
 

2777
00:50:37,319 --> 00:50:41,930

infrastructure so the onion name was

2788
00:50:59,089 --> 00:50:59,099
infrastructure so the onion name was
 

2789
00:50:59,099 --> 00:51:00,770
infrastructure so the onion name was
actually running on a server in France

2790
00:51:00,770 --> 00:51:00,780
actually running on a server in France
 

2791
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:03,290
actually running on a server in France
so if you like and it only commuted

2792
00:51:03,290 --> 00:51:03,300
so if you like and it only commuted
 

2793

through a back Channel a VPN to connect

2794
00:51:06,530 --> 00:51:06,540
through a back Channel a VPN to connect
 

2795
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:08,569
through a back Channel a VPN to connect
to the Iceland server

2796
00:51:08,569 --> 00:51:08,579
to the Iceland server
 

2797
00:51:08,579 --> 00:51:10,390
to the Iceland server
um there was a

2798
00:51:10,390 --> 00:51:10,400
um there was a
 

2799
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:13,490
um there was a
Bitcoin like kind of Vault server there

2800
00:51:13,490 --> 00:51:13,500
Bitcoin like kind of Vault server there
 

2801
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:15,589
Bitcoin like kind of Vault server there
was also in Iceland and I think that was

2802
00:51:15,589 --> 00:51:15,599
was also in Iceland and I think that was
 

2803
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:18,710
was also in Iceland and I think that was
so that the admins couldn't get into the

2804
00:51:18,710 --> 00:51:18,720
so that the admins couldn't get into the
 

2805
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:20,630
so that the admins couldn't get into the
Bitcoins the other admins that were

2806
00:51:20,630 --> 00:51:20,640
Bitcoins the other admins that were
 

2807
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:22,069

3172
00:57:59,049 --> 00:57:59,059
you're doing you're this is like a
 

3173
00:57:59,059 --> 00:58:02,930
you're doing you're this is like a
multi-layer interrogation going on uh

3174
00:58:02,930 --> 00:58:02,940
multi-layer interrogation going on uh
 

3175

3177
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:06,290
was there a concern that somebody else
would step in and control the site

3178
00:58:06,290 --> 00:58:06,300

3179
00:58:06,300 --> 00:58:08,569
would step in and control the site
absolutely we we didn't have Insight on

3180
00:58:08,569 --> 00:58:08,579
absolutely we we didn't have Insight on
 

3181
00:58:08,579 --> 00:58:10,849
absolutely we we didn't have Insight on
who exactly I control so it turns out

3182
00:58:10,849 --> 00:58:10,859
who exactly I control so it turns out
 

3183
00:58:10,859 --> 00:58:13,250
who exactly I control so it turns out

00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:16,490
that Russ had like dictatorial control
so he it wasn't easy to delegate to

3186
00:58:16,490 --> 00:58:16,500
so he it wasn't easy to delegate to
 

3187
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:18,829
so he it wasn't easy to delegate to
somebody else he hadn't I think he had

3611
01:06:01,740 --> 01:06:03,410
but there were a lot of dark markets
that popped up after that now we put

3612
01:06:03,410 --> 01:06:03,420
that popped up after that now we put
 

3613
01:06:03,420 --> 01:06:05,030
that popped up after that now we put
playbook out there

3614
01:06:05,030 --> 01:06:05,040
playbook out there
 

3615
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:06,349
playbook out there
yeah

3616
01:06:06,349 --> 01:06:06,359
yeah
 

3617
01:06:06,359 --> 01:06:10,010
yeah
yeah but and also there's a case for uh

3618
01:06:10,010 --> 01:06:10,020
yeah but and also there's a case for uh
 

3619
01:06:10,020 --> 01:06:13,370
yeah but and also there's a case for uh
do you ever think about not taking down

3620
01:06:13,370 --> 01:06:13,380
do you ever think about not taking down
 

3621
01:06:13,380 --> 01:06:16,430
do you ever think about not taking down
if you have not taken down Silk Road you

3622
01:06:16,430 --> 01:06:16,440
if you have not taken down Silk Road you
 

3623
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:19,010
if you have not taken down Silk Road you
could use it because it's a market

3624
01:06:19,010 --> 01:06:19,020
could use it because it's a market
 

3625
01:06:19,020 --> 01:06:21,890
could use it because it's a market
it itself is not necessarily the primary

3626
01:06:21,890 --> 01:06:21,900
it itself is not necessarily the primary
 

3627
01:06:21,900 --> 01:06:24,349
it itself is not necessarily the primary
criminal organization it's a market for

3628
01:06:24,349 --> 01:06:24,359
criminal organization it's a market for
 

3629
01:06:24,359 --> 01:06:27,109
criminal organization it's a market for
criminals so it could be used to track

3630
01:06:27,109 --> 01:06:27,119
criminals so it could be used to track
 

3631
01:06:27,119 --> 01:06:29,870
criminals so it could be used to track
down criminals in the physical world

3632
01:06:29,870 --> 01:06:29,880
down criminals in the physical world
 

3633
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:32,630
down criminals in the physical world
so if you don't take it down given that

3634
01:06:32,630 --> 01:06:32,640
so if you don't take it down given that
 

3635
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:35,390
so if you don't take it down given that
it was you know the central how

3636
01:06:35,390 --> 01:06:35,400
it was you know the central how
 

3637
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:37,970
it was you know the central how
centralized it was it could be used as a

3638
01:06:37,970 --> 01:06:37,980
centralized it was it could be used as a
 

3639
01:06:37,980 --> 01:06:40,910
centralized it was it could be used as a
place to find criminals right as opposed

3640
01:06:40,910 --> 01:06:40,920
place to find criminals right as opposed
 

3641

but throughout the world as a hero
because

4392
01:20:12,169 --> 01:20:12,179
because
 

4393
01:20:12,179 --> 01:20:16,610
because
you look at the way knowledge scientific

4394
01:20:16,610 --> 01:20:16,620
you look at the way knowledge scientific
 

4395
01:20:16,620 --> 01:20:18,590
you look at the way knowledge scientific
knowledge is being put behind paywalls

4396
01:20:18,590 --> 01:20:18,600
knowledge is being put behind paywalls
 

4397
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:21,470
knowledge is being put behind paywalls
it does seem somehow unethical

4398
01:20:21,470 --> 01:20:21,480
it does seem somehow unethical
 

4399
01:20:21,480 --> 01:20:23,990
it does seem somehow unethical
and he basically

4400
01:20:23,990 --> 01:20:24,000
and he basically
 

4401
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,390
and he basically
broke the law

4402
01:20:26,390 --> 01:20:26,400
broke the law
 

4403
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:29,209
broke the law
to do the ethical thing

4404
01:20:29,209 --> 01:20:29,219
to do the ethical thing
 

4405
01:20:29,219 --> 01:20:31,310
to do the ethical thing
now you could challenge it maybe it is

4406
01:20:31,310 --> 01:20:31,320
now you could challenge it maybe it is
 

4407
01:20:31,320 --> 01:20:33,649
now you could challenge it maybe it is
unethical but that you know there's a

4408
01:20:33,649 --> 01:20:33,659
unethical but that you know there's a
 

4409
01:20:33,659 --> 01:20:37,070
unethical but that you know there's a
gray area and to me at least it is

4410
01:20:37,070 --> 01:20:37,080
gray area and to me at least it is
 

4411
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:39,229
gray area and to me at least it is
ethical to me at least he is a hero

4412
01:20:39,229 --> 01:20:39,239
ethical to me at least he is a hero
 

4413
01:20:39,239 --> 01:20:43,130
ethical to me at least he is a hero
because I'm familiar with the paywall

4414
01:20:43,130 --> 01:20:43,140
because I'm familiar with the paywall

because I'm familiar with the paywall
created by uh the institutions that hold

these Publications they're adding very

4418
01:20:50,510 --> 01:20:50,520
these Publications they're adding very
 

4419
01:20:50,520 --> 01:20:51,770
these Publications they're adding very
little value

4420
01:20:51,770 --> 01:20:51,780
little value
 

4421
01:20:51,780 --> 01:20:55,490
little value
so it is basically holding hostage the

4422
01:20:55,490 --> 01:20:55,500
so it is basically holding hostage the
 

4423
01:20:55,500 --> 01:20:58,910
so it is basically holding hostage the
work of millions of brilliant scientists

4424
01:20:58,910 --> 01:20:58,920
work of millions of brilliant scientists
 

4425
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:03,350

they're not actually making that much
money it doesn't make any sense to me it

4432
01:21:09,229 --> 01:21:09,239

01:25:10,850 --> 01:25:10,860
they're taken inside
 

4667
01:25:10,860 --> 01:25:13,070
they're taken inside
um and being dismissed because of

4668
01:25:13,070 --> 01:25:13,080
um and being dismissed because of
 

4669
01:25:13,080 --> 01:25:16,070
um and being dismissed because of
politically motivated actions

4670
01:25:16,070 --> 01:25:16,080
politically motivated actions
 

4671
01:25:16,080 --> 01:25:18,590
politically motivated actions
so do you think it's explicit or just

4672
01:25:18,590 --> 01:25:18,600
so do you think it's explicit or just
 

4673
01:25:18,600 --> 01:25:20,810
so do you think it's explicit or just
pressure just do you think there could

4674
01:25:20,810 --> 01:25:20,820
pressure just do you think there could
 

4675
01:25:20,820 --> 01:25:23,930
pressure just do you think there could
exist just pressure at the higher ups uh

4676
01:25:23,930 --> 01:25:23,940
exist just pressure at the higher ups uh
 

4677
01:25:23,940 --> 01:25:25,790
exist just pressure at the higher ups uh
that has a political leaning and you

4678
01:25:25,790 --> 01:25:25,800
that has a political leaning and you
 

4679
01:25:25,800 --> 01:25:28,310
that has a political leaning and you
kind of maybe don't explicitly order any

4680
01:25:28,310 --> 01:25:28,320
kind of maybe don't explicitly order any
 

4681
01:25:28,320 --> 01:25:29,570
kind of maybe don't explicitly order any
kind of thing but just kind of pressure

4682
01:25:29,570 --> 01:25:29,580
kind of thing but just kind of pressure
 

4683
01:25:29,580 --> 01:25:31,490
kind of thing but just kind of pressure
people to lean one way or the other and

4684
01:25:31,490 --> 01:25:31,500
people to lean one way or the other and
 

4685
01:25:31,500 --> 01:25:33,470
people to lean one way or the other and
and then create a culture that leans one

4686
01:25:33,470 --> 01:25:33,480
and then create a culture that leans one
 

4687
01:25:33,480 --> 01:25:35,030
and then create a culture that leans one
way or the other based on political

4688
01:25:35,030 --> 01:25:35,040
way or the other based on political
 

4689
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:37,370
way or the other based on political
leanings you would really really hope

4690
01:25:37,370 --> 01:25:37,380
leanings you would really really hope
 

4691
01:25:37,380 --> 01:25:39,470
leanings you would really really hope
not but I mean that's seems to be the

01:25:39,470 --> 01:25:39,480
not but I mean that's seems to be the
 

4693
01:25:39,480 --> 01:25:41,209
not but I mean that's seems to be the
narrative that's being written

4694
01:25:41,209 --> 01:25:41,219
narrative that's being written
 

4695
01:25:41,219 --> 01:25:43,430
narrative that's being written
but when you were operating you didn't

4696
01:25:43,430 --> 01:25:43,440
but when you were operating you didn't
 

4697
01:25:43,440 --> 01:25:44,930
but when you were operating you didn't
feel that pressure

4698
01:25:44,930 --> 01:25:44,940
feel that pressure
 

4699
01:25:44,940 --> 01:25:46,970

foreign interference
 

4723
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:15,470
foreign interference
uh and then Facebook

4724
01:26:15,470 --> 01:26:15,480
uh and then Facebook
 

4725
01:26:15,480 --> 01:26:17,689
uh and then Facebook
inferred from that that they're talking

4726
01:26:17,689 --> 01:26:17,699
inferred from that that they're talking
 

4727

inferred from that that they're talking
about Hunter Biden laptop story and

about Hunter Biden laptop story and
 

4729
01:26:20,480 --> 01:26:22,850
about Hunter Biden laptop story and
thereby censored it what do you think

4730
01:26:22,850 --> 01:26:22,860
thereby censored it what do you think
 

4731
01:26:22,860 --> 01:26:25,070
thereby censored it what do you think
about that whole story

about that whole story

01:26:25,080 --> 01:26:27,110
about that whole story
again you asked me when I was in the FBI

4734
01:26:27,110 --> 01:26:27,120
again you asked me when I was in the FBI
 

4735
01:26:27,120 --> 01:26:28,669
again you asked me when I was in the FBI
I wouldn't believed it from being on the

4736
01:26:28,669 --> 01:26:28,679
I wouldn't believed it from being on the
 

4737
01:26:28,679 --> 01:26:30,050
I wouldn't believed it from being on the
inside I wouldn't believe these things

4738
01:26:30,050 --> 01:26:30,060
inside I wouldn't believe these things
 

4739
01:26:30,060 --> 01:26:31,729
inside I wouldn't believe these things
but there's a certain narrative being

4740
01:26:31,729 --> 01:26:31,739
but there's a certain narrative being
 

4741
01:26:31,739 --> 01:26:33,830
but there's a certain narrative being
written that is surprising to me that

4742
01:26:33,830 --> 01:26:33,840
written that is surprising to me that
 

4743
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:36,470
written that is surprising to me that
the FBI is involved in these stories so

4744
01:26:36,470 --> 01:26:36,480
the FBI is involved in these stories so
 

4745
01:26:36,480 --> 01:26:38,629
the FBI is involved in these stories so
but the interesting thing there is

4746
01:26:38,629 --> 01:26:38,639
but the interesting thing there is
 

4747
01:26:38,639 --> 01:26:41,209
but the interesting thing there is
the FBI is saying that they didn't

4748
01:26:41,209 --> 01:26:41,219
the FBI is saying that they didn't
 

4749
01:26:41,219 --> 01:26:42,530
the FBI is saying that they didn't
really make that implication they're

4750
01:26:42,530 --> 01:26:42,540
really make that implication they're
 

4751
01:26:42,540 --> 01:26:44,270
really make that implication they're
saying that there's interference

4752
01:26:44,270 --> 01:26:44,280
saying that there's interference
 

4753
01:26:44,280 --> 01:26:47,149
saying that there's interference
activity happening just watch out and

4754
01:26:47,149 --> 01:26:47,159
activity happening just watch out and
 

4755
01:26:47,159 --> 01:26:49,070
activity happening just watch out and
it's a weird relationship between FBI

4756
01:26:49,070 --> 01:26:49,080
it's a weird relationship between FBI
 

4757
01:26:49,080 --> 01:26:52,310
it's a weird relationship between FBI
and Facebook you could see from the best

4758
01:26:52,310 --> 01:26:52,320
and Facebook you could see from the best
 

4759
01:26:52,320 --> 01:26:53,930
and Facebook you could see from the best
possible interpretation that the FBI

4760
01:26:53,930 --> 01:26:53,940
possible interpretation that the FBI
 

4761
01:26:53,940 --> 01:26:55,970
possible interpretation that the FBI
just wants Facebook to be aware because

4762
01:26:55,970 --> 01:26:55,980
just wants Facebook to be aware because
 

4763
01:26:55,980 --> 01:26:58,669
just wants Facebook to be aware because
it is a powerful platform a platform for

4764
01:26:58,669 --> 01:26:58,679
it is a powerful platform a platform for
 

4765
01:26:58,679 --> 01:27:02,810
it is a powerful platform a platform for
viral spread of misinformation so

4766
01:27:02,810 --> 01:27:02,820
viral spread of misinformation so
 

4767
01:27:02,820 --> 01:27:05,090
viral spread of misinformation so
in the best possible interpretation of

4768
01:27:05,090 --> 01:27:05,100
in the best possible interpretation of
 

4769
01:27:05,100 --> 01:27:07,250
in the best possible interpretation of
it it makes sense for FBI to send some

4770
01:27:07,250 --> 01:27:07,260
it it makes sense for FBI to send some
 

4771
01:27:07,260 --> 01:27:09,169
it it makes sense for FBI to send some
information saying like we we're seeing

4772
01:27:09,169 --> 01:27:09,179
information saying like we we're seeing
 

4773
01:27:09,179 --> 01:27:11,930
information saying like we we're seeing
some shady activity absolutely but it

4774
01:27:11,930 --> 01:27:11,940
some shady activity absolutely but it
 

4775
01:27:11,940 --> 01:27:13,610
some shady activity absolutely but it
seems like all of that somehow escalated

4776
01:27:13,610 --> 01:27:13,620
seems like all of that somehow escalated
 

4777
01:27:13,620 --> 01:27:16,189
seems like all of that somehow escalated
to a political interpretation I mean

4778
01:27:16,189 --> 01:27:16,199
to a political interpretation I mean
 

4779
01:27:16,199 --> 01:27:17,689
to a political interpretation I mean
yeah it sounded like there was a wink

4780

yeah it sounded like there was a wink
 

4781
01:27:17,699 --> 01:27:19,129
yeah it sounded like there was a wink
wink with it

4782
01:27:19,129 --> 01:27:19,139

4785
01:27:22,380 --> 01:27:24,590
um the the I don't know if Mark
meant for that to be that way you know

4786
01:27:24,590 --> 01:27:24,600
meant for that to be that way you know
 

4787
01:27:24,600 --> 01:27:26,750
meant for that to be that way you know
like again are we being social

4788
01:27:26,750 --> 01:27:26,760
like again are we being social

01:27:34,370 --> 01:27:34,380
wonder if the wink wink is direct or
 

4795
01:27:34,380 --> 01:27:36,470
wonder if the wink wink is direct or
it's just culture really you know maybe

01:27:36,470 --> 01:27:36,480
it's just culture really you know maybe
 

4797
01:27:36,480 --> 01:27:38,450
it's just culture really you know maybe
certain people responsible on the

political lean and then certain people
 

4803
01:27:42,179 --> 01:27:44,209
political lean and then certain people
on the FBI side have a political lean

4804
01:27:44,209 --> 01:27:44,219
on the FBI side have a political lean
 

4805

01:27:46,010 --> 01:27:46,020
when they're interacting together and
 

4807
01:27:46,020 --> 01:27:48,229
when they're interacting together and
it's like literally has nothing to do

4808
01:27:48,229 --> 01:27:48,239
it's like literally has nothing to do
 

4809
01:27:48,239 --> 01:27:51,229
it's like literally has nothing to do
with the giant conspiracy theory but

4810
01:27:51,229 --> 01:27:51,239
with the giant conspiracy theory but
 

4811
01:27:51,239 --> 01:27:53,030
with the giant conspiracy theory but
just with a culture that has a

4812
01:27:53,030 --> 01:27:53,040
just with a culture that has a
 

4813
01:27:53,040 --> 01:27:56,149
just with a culture that has a
particular uh political lean during a a

4814
01:27:56,149 --> 01:27:56,159
particular uh political lean during a a
 

4815
01:27:56,159 --> 01:27:58,850
particular uh political lean during a a
particular time in history and so like

01:27:58,850 --> 01:27:58,860
particular time in history and so like
 

4817
01:27:58,860 --> 01:28:01,790
particular time in history and so like
uh maybe it could be a hunter buying

4818
01:28:01,790 --> 01:28:01,800
uh maybe it could be a hunter buying
 

4819
01:28:01,800 --> 01:28:04,970
uh maybe it could be a hunter buying
laptop one time and then it could be uh

4820
01:28:04,970 --> 01:28:04,980
laptop one time and then it could be uh

pharmaceutical companies

4898

pharmaceutical companies
 

4899
01:29:34,639 --> 01:29:37,189
pharmaceutical companies
they all believe

4900
01:29:37,189 --> 01:29:37,199
they all believe
 

4901
01:29:37,199 --> 01:29:39,910

they're doing good

4902
01:29:39,910 --> 01:29:39,920
they're doing good
 

4903
01:29:39,920 --> 01:29:42,590
they're doing good
and I wonder

4904
01:29:42,590 --> 01:29:42,600
and I wonder
 

4905
01:29:42,600 --> 01:29:45,229
and I wonder
because the the idea they have is to

4906
01:29:45,229 --> 01:29:45,239
because the the idea they have is to
 

4907
01:29:45,239 --> 01:29:48,350
because the the idea they have is to
create drugs that help people and do so

4908
01:29:48,350 --> 01:29:48,360
create drugs that help people and do so
 

4909
01:29:48,360 --> 01:29:51,229
create drugs that help people and do so
at scale

4910
01:29:51,229 --> 01:29:51,239

 

4911
01:29:51,239 --> 01:29:53,870

and it's hard to know at which point

4912
01:29:53,870 --> 01:29:53,880
and it's hard to know at which point
 

4913
01:29:53,880 --> 01:29:55,669
and it's hard to know at which point
that can be corrupted it's hard to know

4914
01:29:55,669 --> 01:29:55,679
that can be corrupted it's hard to know
 

4915
01:29:55,679 --> 01:29:57,950
that can be corrupted it's hard to know
when it was corrupted and if it was

4916
01:29:57,950 --> 01:29:57,960
when it was corrupted and if it was
 

4917
01:29:57,960 --> 01:29:59,990
when it was corrupted and if it was
corrupted and where which which drugs

situation that are commenting on it with
 

5337
01:38:11,520 --> 01:38:13,370
situation that are commenting on it with
certainty and that kind of hurts me

5338
01:38:13,370 --> 01:38:13,380
certainty and that kind of hurts me
 

5339
01:38:13,380 --> 01:38:14,810
certainty and that kind of hurts me
because I feel like there's a lot of

01:41:38,159 --> 01:41:40,129
um so maybe someone had a zero day and
then they searched for servers running

5522
01:41:40,129 --> 01:41:40,139
then they searched for servers running
 

5523
01:41:40,139 --> 01:41:42,169
then they searched for servers running
that zero day and then from there let's

5524
01:41:42,169 --> 01:41:42,179
that zero day and then from there let's
 

5525
01:41:42,179 --> 01:41:44,930
that zero day and then from there let's
find a Target I mean one time they went

5526
01:41:44,930 --> 01:41:44,940
find a Target I mean one time they went
 

5527

find a Target I mean one time they went
after a toilet paper company I still

5528
01:41:47,209 --> 01:41:47,219
after a toilet paper company I still
 

5529
01:41:47,219 --> 01:41:48,709
after a toilet paper company I still
don't understand what that toilet paper

5530
01:41:48,709 --> 01:41:48,719
don't understand what that toilet paper
 

5531
01:41:48,719 --> 01:41:50,930
don't understand what that toilet paper
company did but it was an opportunity to

5532
01:41:50,930 --> 01:41:50,940

5533
01:41:50,940 --> 01:41:52,910
company did but it was an opportunity to
make a splash is there some somewhere

make a splash is there some somewhere
 

5535
01:41:52,920 --> 01:41:56,149

for the joke for the lulls it developed

5536
01:41:56,149 --> 01:41:56,159
for the joke for the lulls it developed
 

5537
01:41:56,159 --> 01:41:58,310
for the joke for the lulls it developed
into that so I think the hacktivism and

5538
01:41:58,310 --> 01:41:58,320
into that so I think the hacktivism and
 

5539
01:41:58,320 --> 01:41:59,930
into that so I think the hacktivism and
the anonymous stuff wasn't so much for

5540
01:41:59,930 --> 01:41:59,940
the anonymous stuff wasn't so much for
 

5541
01:41:59,940 --> 01:42:01,250
the anonymous stuff wasn't so much for
the LOLs

5542
01:42:01,250 --> 01:42:01,260
the LOLs
 

5543
01:42:01,260 --> 01:42:02,990

01:42:06,179 --> 01:42:07,550
well together and they formed a crew a
hacking crew and they kind of split off

5550
01:42:07,550 --> 01:42:07,560

5551
01:42:07,560 --> 01:42:09,530
hacking crew and they kind of split off
into their own private channels and that

5552
01:42:09,530 --> 01:42:09,540
into their own private channels and that
 

5553
01:42:09,540 --> 01:42:11,510

you have a sense that there is a
 

5661
01:44:06,119 --> 01:44:08,810
you have a sense that there is a
leadership there's a power play you know

5662
01:44:08,810 --> 01:44:08,820
leadership there's a power play you know
 

5663
01:44:08,820 --> 01:44:10,729
leadership there's a power play you know
it's not someone that you know that says

it's not someone that you know that says
 

5665

it's not someone that you know that says
this is what we're doing all we're doing

this is what we're doing all we're doing
I love the

01:44:14,450 --> 01:44:14,460
I love the
 

5669
01:44:14,460 --> 01:44:17,209
I love the
the philosophical and the technical

5670
01:44:17,209 --> 01:44:17,219
the philosophical and the technical
 

5671
01:44:17,219 --> 01:44:19,490
the philosophical and the technical
aspect of all of this but I think there

5672
01:44:19,490 --> 01:44:19,500
aspect of all of this but I think there
 

5673
01:44:19,500 --> 01:44:21,709
aspect of all of this but I think there
is a slippery slope to where for the

5674
01:44:21,709 --> 01:44:21,719
is a slippery slope to where for the
 

5675
01:44:21,719 --> 01:44:23,810
is a slippery slope to where for the
laws you can actually

5676
01:44:23,810 --> 01:44:23,820
laws you can actually
 

5677
01:44:23,820 --> 01:44:25,850
laws you can actually
really hurt people

5678
01:44:25,850 --> 01:44:25,860
really hurt people
 

5679
01:44:25,860 --> 01:44:28,310
really hurt people
that's that's the terrifying thing when

5680
01:44:28,310 --> 01:44:28,320
that's that's the terrifying thing when
 

5681
01:44:28,320 --> 01:44:29,810
that's that's the terrifying thing when
you attach

5682
01:44:29,810 --> 01:44:29,820
you attach
 

5683
01:44:29,820 --> 01:44:31,970
you attach
I'm actually really terrified of the

5684
01:44:31,970 --> 01:44:31,980
I'm actually really terrified of the
 

5685
01:44:31,980 --> 01:44:34,030
I'm actually really terrified of the
power of the lull

5686
01:44:34,030 --> 01:44:34,040
power of the lull
 

5687
01:44:34,040 --> 01:44:37,250
power of the lull
it's the fun thing somehow becomes a

5688
01:44:37,250 --> 01:44:37,260
it's the fun thing somehow becomes a
 

5689
01:44:37,260 --> 01:44:38,930
it's the fun thing somehow becomes a
slippery slope I haven't quite

5690
01:44:38,930 --> 01:44:38,940
slippery slope I haven't quite
 

5691
01:44:38,940 --> 01:44:41,030
slippery slope I haven't quite
understood the Dynamics of that but even

5692
01:44:41,030 --> 01:44:41,040
understood the Dynamics of that but even
 

5693
01:44:41,040 --> 01:44:44,930
understood the Dynamics of that but even
in myself if you just have fun with a

5694
01:44:44,930 --> 01:44:44,940
in myself if you just have fun with a
 

5695
01:44:44,940 --> 01:44:47,090
in myself if you just have fun with a
thing you lose track of the ethical

5696
01:44:47,090 --> 01:44:47,100
thing you lose track of the ethical
 

5697
01:44:47,100 --> 01:44:49,490
thing you lose track of the ethical
grounding of the thing and so like it

5698
01:44:49,490 --> 01:44:49,500
grounding of the thing and so like it
 

5699
01:44:49,500 --> 01:44:51,470
grounding of the thing and so like it
feels like hacking for fun can just turn

5700
01:44:51,470 --> 01:44:51,480
feels like hacking for fun can just turn
 

5701
01:44:51,480 --> 01:44:54,169
feels like hacking for fun can just turn
it like literally lead to nuclear war

5702
01:44:54,169 --> 01:44:54,179
it like literally lead to nuclear war
 

5703
01:44:54,179 --> 01:44:57,229
it like literally lead to nuclear war
like literally destabilize yeah like

5704
01:44:57,229 --> 01:44:57,239
like literally destabilize yeah like
 

5705
01:44:57,239 --> 01:44:59,510
like literally destabilize yeah like
yada yada yada nuclear war I could see

5706
01:44:59,510 --> 01:44:59,520
yada yada yada nuclear war I could see
 

5707
01:44:59,520 --> 01:45:00,649
yada yada yada nuclear war I could see
it yeah

5708
01:45:00,649 --> 01:45:00,659
it yeah
 

5709
01:45:00,659 --> 01:45:02,810
it yeah
and so I've been more careful with the

5710
01:45:02,810 --> 01:45:02,820
and so I've been more careful with the
 

5711
01:45:02,820 --> 01:45:06,950
and so I've been more careful with the
lull uh uh I I'm very yeah I've been

5712
01:45:06,950 --> 01:45:06,960
lull uh uh I I'm very yeah I've been
 

5713
01:45:06,960 --> 01:45:08,330
lull uh uh I I'm very yeah I've been
more careful about that and I wonder

5714
01:45:08,330 --> 01:45:08,340
more careful about that and I wonder
 

5715
01:45:08,340 --> 01:45:10,149
more careful about that and I wonder
about it because an internet speak

5716
01:45:10,149 --> 01:45:10,159
about it because an internet speak
 

5717
01:45:10,159 --> 01:45:13,490
about it because an internet speak
somehow ethics can be put aside

5718
01:45:13,490 --> 01:45:13,500
somehow ethics can be put aside
 

5719
01:45:13,500 --> 01:45:16,250
somehow ethics can be put aside
uh through the slippery slope of

5720
01:45:16,250 --> 01:45:16,260
uh through the slippery slope of
 

5721
01:45:16,260 --> 01:45:17,689
uh through the slippery slope of
language

5722
01:45:17,689 --> 01:45:17,699

there's a lot of thresholds

5946
01:49:32,689 --> 01:49:32,699
there's a lot of thresholds
 

5947
01:49:32,699 --> 01:49:35,330
there's a lot of thresholds
um so it's not your first investigative

5948
01:49:35,330 --> 01:49:35,340
um so it's not your first investigative
 

5949
01:49:35,340 --> 01:49:37,729
um so it's not your first investigative
tool step you have to identify a problem

5950
01:49:37,729 --> 01:49:37,739
tool step you have to identify a problem
 

5951
01:49:37,739 --> 01:49:40,970
tool step you have to identify a problem
and then show that the lower steps can't

5952
01:49:40,970 --> 01:49:40,980
and then show that the lower steps can't
 

5953
01:49:40,980 --> 01:49:42,770
and then show that the lower steps can't
get you there

5954

get you there
 

5955
01:49:42,780 --> 01:49:45,649
get you there
um but I mean I think we we had an

5956
01:49:45,649 --> 01:49:45,659
um but I mean I think we we had an
 

5957
01:49:45,659 --> 01:49:47,270
um but I mean I think we we had an
undercover going on the squad about all

5958
01:49:47,270 --> 01:49:47,280
undercover going on the squad about all
 

5959
01:49:47,280 --> 01:49:49,850
undercover going on the squad about all
times when one was being shut down or

5960
01:49:49,850 --> 01:49:49,860
times when one was being shut down or
 

5961
01:49:49,860 --> 01:49:51,890
times when one was being shut down or
taken down we were spinning up another

5962
01:49:51,890 --> 01:49:51,900
taken down we were spinning up another
 

5963
01:49:51,900 --> 01:49:55,010
taken down we were spinning up another
one so it's a good tool to have

5964
01:49:55,010 --> 01:49:55,020
one so it's a good tool to have
 

5965
01:49:55,020 --> 01:49:58,010
one so it's a good tool to have
um you know and utilize they're a lot of

so interesting because it's it's such a
 

6853
02:05:23,340 --> 02:05:25,609
so interesting because it's it's such a
strange world it's such a strange world

strange world it's such a strange world
 

6855
02:05:25,619 --> 02:05:28,129
strange world it's such a strange world
because it's it's tough to because you

6856
02:05:28,129 --> 02:05:28,139
because it's it's tough to because you
 

6857
02:05:28,139 --> 02:05:29,390
because it's it's tough to because you
still have to prove it's the same guy

6858
02:05:29,390 --> 02:05:29,400
still have to prove it's the same guy
 

6859
02:05:29,400 --> 02:05:30,470
still have to prove it's the same guy
right

6860
02:05:30,470 --> 02:05:30,480
right
 

6861
02:05:30,480 --> 02:05:33,290
right
because the anonymity yeah I mean we had

6862
02:05:33,290 --> 02:05:33,300
because the anonymity yeah I mean we had
 

6863
02:05:33,300 --> 02:05:35,149
because the anonymity yeah I mean we had
his laptop by the you know by that point

6864
02:05:35,149 --> 02:05:35,159
his laptop by the you know by that point
 

6865
02:05:35,159 --> 02:05:37,250
his laptop by the you know by that point
yeah I know he was saying that helped

6866
02:05:37,250 --> 02:05:37,260
yeah I know he was saying that helped
 

6867
02:05:37,260 --> 02:05:40,609
yeah I know he was saying that helped
again I'm a clue in my world

6868
02:05:40,609 --> 02:05:40,619
again I'm a clue in my world

that's that now that's if you took every

6886
02:05:59,629 --> 02:05:59,639
that's that now that's if you took every
 

6887
02:05:59,639 --> 02:06:02,030
that's that now that's if you took every
charge we had against him and put him

as hunting them down so you're not going
 

7067
02:09:20,340 --> 02:09:22,070
as hunting them down so you're not going
to see the big arrests how much

7068

to see the big arrests how much
state-sponsored

7070
02:09:25,129 --> 02:09:25,139

 

7071
02:09:25,139 --> 02:09:27,669

uh cyber attacks are there do you think

7072
02:09:27,669 --> 02:09:27,679
uh cyber attacks are there do you think
 

7073
02:09:27,679 --> 02:09:30,350
uh cyber attacks are there do you think
more than you can imagine

7074

more than you can imagine
 

7075
02:09:30,360 --> 02:09:32,510
more than you can imagine
and what wait what do you want to say an

7076
02:09:32,510 --> 02:09:32,520
and what wait what do you want to say an
 

7077
02:09:32,520 --> 02:09:34,189
and what wait what do you want to say an
attack you had a successful attack or

7078
02:09:34,189 --> 02:09:34,199
attack you had a successful attack or
 

7079
02:09:34,199 --> 02:09:37,430
attack you had a successful attack or
just a probing probing for information

7080
02:09:37,430 --> 02:09:37,440
just a probing probing for information
 

7081
02:09:37,440 --> 02:09:40,970
just a probing probing for information
just like feeling you know testing that

7082
02:09:40,970 --> 02:09:40,980
just like feeling you know testing that
 

7083
02:09:40,980 --> 02:09:43,129
just like feeling you know testing that
there's where the attack factors are

7084
02:09:43,129 --> 02:09:43,139
there's where the attack factors are
 

7085
02:09:43,139 --> 02:09:45,229
there's where the attack factors are
trying to collect all the possible

7086
02:09:45,229 --> 02:09:45,239
trying to collect all the possible
 

7087
02:09:45,239 --> 02:09:47,030
trying to collect all the possible
attacks put a Windows 7 machine on the

7088
02:09:47,030 --> 02:09:47,040
attacks put a Windows 7 machine on the
 

7089
02:09:47,040 --> 02:09:48,709
attacks put a Windows 7 machine on the
internet forward-facing and put a put a

7090
02:09:48,709 --> 02:09:48,719
internet forward-facing and put a put a
 

7091
02:09:48,719 --> 02:09:50,089
internet forward-facing and put a put a
packet sniffer on there and look at

7092
02:09:50,089 --> 02:09:50,099
packet sniffer on there and look at
 

7093
02:09:50,099 --> 02:09:51,830
packet sniffer on there and look at
where the driver comes from I mean it's

7094
02:09:51,830 --> 02:09:51,840
where the driver comes from I mean it's
 

7095
02:09:51,840 --> 02:09:53,330
where the driver comes from I mean it's
been 24 hours you were going to fill up

7096
02:09:53,330 --> 02:09:53,340
been 24 hours you were going to fill up
 

7097
02:09:53,340 --> 02:09:54,950
been 24 hours you were going to fill up
a hard drive with packets just coming at

7098
02:09:54,950 --> 02:09:54,960
a hard drive with packets just coming at
 

7099
02:09:54,960 --> 02:09:57,410
a hard drive with packets just coming at
it yeah I mean it's it's not hard to to

7100
02:09:57,410 --> 02:09:57,420
it yeah I mean it's it's not hard to to
 

7101
02:09:57,420 --> 02:09:59,750
it yeah I mean it's it's not hard to to
know I mean it's just constantly probing

7102
02:09:59,750 --> 02:09:59,760
know I mean it's just constantly probing
 

7103
02:09:59,760 --> 02:10:01,850
know I mean it's just constantly probing
for entry points into things you know

7104
02:10:01,850 --> 02:10:01,860
for entry points into things you know
 

7105
02:10:01,860 --> 02:10:04,430
for entry points into things you know
you could you could go mad put up

7106
02:10:04,430 --> 02:10:04,440
you could you could go mad put up
 

7107
02:10:04,440 --> 02:10:07,550
you could you could go mad put up
Honeypot draws intrusions should I see

7108
02:10:07,550 --> 02:10:07,560
Honeypot draws intrusions should I see
 

7109
02:10:07,560 --> 02:10:08,990
Honeypot draws intrusions should I see
what messages to see what's out there

7110
02:10:08,990 --> 02:10:09,000
what messages to see what's out there
 

7111
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:10,790
what messages to see what's out there
yeah and it doesn't go anywhere it maybe

7112
02:10:10,790 --> 02:10:10,800
yeah and it doesn't go anywhere it maybe
 

7113
02:10:10,800 --> 02:10:13,430
yeah and it doesn't go anywhere it maybe

what's happening these days the funny
 

7125
02:10:22,860 --> 02:10:26,209
what's happening these days the funny
thing about like because I'm at MIT that

7126
02:10:26,209 --> 02:10:26,219
thing about like because I'm at MIT that
 

7127
02:10:26,219 --> 02:10:28,189
thing about like because I'm at MIT that
attracted even more attention for the

7128
02:10:28,189 --> 02:10:28,199
attracted even more attention for the
 

7129
02:10:28,199 --> 02:10:29,930
attracted even more attention for the
not for the laws but for the technical

7130
02:10:29,930 --> 02:10:29,940
not for the laws but for the technical
 

7131
02:10:29,940 --> 02:10:32,089
not for the laws but for the technical
challenge it seems like people enjoy

7132
02:10:32,089 --> 02:10:32,099
challenge it seems like people enjoy
 

7133
02:10:32,099 --> 02:10:34,310
challenge it seems like people enjoy
hacking MIT it's just the amount of

7134
02:10:34,310 --> 02:10:34,320
hacking MIT it's just the amount of
 

7135
02:10:34,320 --> 02:10:37,129
hacking MIT it's just the amount of
traffic MIT was getting for that in

7136
02:10:37,129 --> 02:10:37,139
traffic MIT was getting for that in
 

7137
02:10:37,139 --> 02:10:38,570
traffic MIT was getting for that in
terms of just the sheer number of

7138
02:10:38,570 --> 02:10:38,580
terms of just the sheer number of
 

7139
02:10:38,580 --> 02:10:40,129
terms of just the sheer number of
attacks from different places is crazy

7140
02:10:40,129 --> 02:10:40,139
attacks from different places is crazy
 

7141
02:10:40,139 --> 02:10:41,990
attacks from different places is crazy
yeah like just like that putting up a

7142
02:10:41,990 --> 02:10:42,000
yeah like just like that putting up a
 

7143
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:44,089
yeah like just like that putting up a
machine seeing what comes NASA used to

7144
02:10:44,089 --> 02:10:44,099
machine seeing what comes NASA used to
 

7145
02:10:44,099 --> 02:10:45,350
machine seeing what comes NASA used to
be the golden ring now everybody got

7146
02:10:45,350 --> 02:10:45,360
be the golden ring now everybody got
 

7147
02:10:45,360 --> 02:10:47,209
be the golden ring now everybody got
NASA that was like the early 90s if you

uh respect
uh because I think in that case it comes

7158
02:10:57,350 --> 02:10:57,360
uh because I think in that case it comes
 

7159
02:10:57,360 --> 02:10:59,689
uh because I think in that case it comes
from a somewhat good place because you

from a somewhat good place because you
know they're not getting any money for

7162
02:11:01,010 --> 02:11:01,020
know they're not getting any money for
 

7163
02:11:01,020 --> 02:11:04,250
know they're not getting any money for
my ID it's more for the challenge

7164
02:11:04,250 --> 02:11:04,260
my ID it's more for the challenge
 

7165
02:11:04,260 --> 02:11:06,169
my ID it's more for the challenge
let me ask you about that about this

7166
02:11:06,169 --> 02:11:06,179
let me ask you about that about this
 

7167
02:11:06,179 --> 02:11:09,350
let me ask you about that about this
world of cyber security

7168
02:11:09,350 --> 02:11:09,360
world of cyber security
 

7169
02:11:09,360 --> 02:11:11,570
world of cyber security
um how big of a threat are cyber attacks

7170
02:11:11,570 --> 02:11:11,580
um how big of a threat are cyber attacks
 

7171
02:11:11,580 --> 02:11:14,330
um how big of a threat are cyber attacks
for companies and for individuals like

7172
02:11:14,330 --> 02:11:14,340
for companies and for individuals like
 

7173
02:11:14,340 --> 02:11:17,390
for companies and for individuals like
let's lay out where are we in this world

7174
02:11:17,390 --> 02:11:17,400
let's lay out where are we in this world
 

7175
02:11:17,400 --> 02:11:20,390
let's lay out where are we in this world
what's out there it's the Wild Wild West

7176
02:11:20,390 --> 02:11:20,400
what's out there it's the Wild Wild West
 

7177
02:11:20,400 --> 02:11:22,750
what's out there it's the Wild Wild West
and it's it's it's

7178
02:11:22,750 --> 02:11:22,760
and it's it's it's
 

7179
02:11:22,760 --> 02:11:25,550
and it's it's it's
uh I mean

7180
02:11:25,550 --> 02:11:25,560
uh I mean
 

7181
02:11:25,560 --> 02:11:28,850
uh I mean
people want the idea of security but

7182
02:11:28,850 --> 02:11:28,860
people want the idea of security but
 

7183
02:11:28,860 --> 02:11:30,109
people want the idea of security but
it's inconvenient so they don't they

7184
02:11:30,109 --> 02:11:30,119
it's inconvenient so they don't they
 

7185
02:11:30,119 --> 02:11:31,790
it's inconvenient so they don't they
push back on it

7186
02:11:31,790 --> 02:11:31,800
push back on it
 

7187
02:11:31,800 --> 02:11:34,750
push back on it
um and there are a lot of opportunistic

7188
02:11:34,750 --> 02:11:34,760
um and there are a lot of opportunistic
 

7189
02:11:34,760 --> 02:11:36,890
um and there are a lot of opportunistic
nation-state financially motivated

7190
02:11:36,890 --> 02:11:36,900
nation-state financially motivated
 

7191
02:11:36,900 --> 02:11:38,629
nation-state financially motivated
hackers hackers for the lulls you got

7192
02:11:38,629 --> 02:11:38,639
hackers hackers for the lulls you got
 

7193
02:11:38,639 --> 02:11:40,430
hackers hackers for the lulls you got
three different tiers there

7194
02:11:40,430 --> 02:11:40,440
three different tiers there
 

7195
02:11:40,440 --> 02:11:43,129
three different tiers there
um and and they're they're on the prowl

7196
02:11:43,129 --> 02:11:43,139
um and and they're they're on the prowl
 

7197
02:11:43,139 --> 02:11:45,109
um and and they're they're on the prowl
they have tools they have really good

7198
02:11:45,109 --> 02:11:45,119
they have tools they have really good
 

7199
02:11:45,119 --> 02:11:47,570
they have tools they have really good
tools that are being used against us

7200
02:11:47,570 --> 02:11:47,580
tools that are being used against us
 

7201
02:11:47,580 --> 02:11:50,270
tools that are being used against us
and I would scale so when you're

7202
02:11:50,270 --> 02:11:50,280
and I would scale so when you're
 

7203
02:11:50,280 --> 02:11:52,669
and I would scale so when you're
thinking of

7204
02:11:52,669 --> 02:11:52,679
thinking of
 

7205
02:11:52,679 --> 02:11:54,589
thinking of
I don't know what's let's talk about

7206
02:11:54,589 --> 02:11:54,599
I don't know what's let's talk about
 

7207
02:11:54,599 --> 02:11:57,589
I don't know what's let's talk about
companies first so say you're you're

7208
02:11:57,589 --> 02:11:57,599
companies first so say you're you're
 

7209
02:11:57,599 --> 02:12:00,290
companies first so say you're you're
talking to um a mid-tier

7210
02:12:00,290 --> 02:12:00,300
talking to um a mid-tier
 

7211
02:12:00,300 --> 02:12:02,390
talking to um a mid-tier
I wonder what the more most interesting

7212
02:12:02,390 --> 02:12:02,400
I wonder what the more most interesting
 

7213
02:12:02,400 --> 02:12:05,330
I wonder what the more most interesting
business is so Google let's let's we can

7214
02:12:05,330 --> 02:12:05,340
business is so Google let's let's we can
 

7215
02:12:05,340 --> 02:12:07,070
business is so Google let's let's we can
look at large tech companies and we can

7216
02:12:07,070 --> 02:12:07,080
look at large tech companies and we can
 

7217
02:12:07,080 --> 02:12:07,930
look at large tech companies and we can
look at

7218
02:12:07,930 --> 02:12:07,940
look at
 

7219
02:12:07,940 --> 02:12:10,910
look at
medium-sized tech companies and like you

7220
02:12:10,910 --> 02:12:10,920
medium-sized tech companies and like you
 

7221
02:12:10,920 --> 02:12:13,490
medium-sized tech companies and like you
were sitting in a room with a CTO with a

7222
02:12:13,490 --> 02:12:13,500
were sitting in a room with a CTO with a
 

7223
02:12:13,500 --> 02:12:14,450
were sitting in a room with a CTO with a
CEO

7224
02:12:14,450 --> 02:12:14,460
CEO
 

7225
02:12:14,460 --> 02:12:17,209
CEO
and the the question is how [\h__\h] are

7226
02:12:17,209 --> 02:12:17,219
and the the question is how [\h__\h] are
 

7227
02:12:17,219 --> 02:12:19,310
and the the question is how [\h__\h] are
we and what should we do what's the low

7228
02:12:19,310 --> 02:12:19,320
we and what should we do what's the low
 

7229
02:12:19,320 --> 02:12:20,810
we and what should we do what's the low
hanging fruit what's what what are the

7230
02:12:20,810 --> 02:12:20,820
hanging fruit what's what what are the
 

7231
02:12:20,820 --> 02:12:23,390
hanging fruit what's what what are the
different strategies and uh those

7232
02:12:23,390 --> 02:12:23,400
different strategies and uh those
 

7233
02:12:23,400 --> 02:12:24,890
different strategies and uh those
companies should consider I mean the

7234
02:12:24,890 --> 02:12:24,900
companies should consider I mean the
 

7235
02:12:24,900 --> 02:12:26,689
companies should consider I mean the
problem is they want a push button they

7236
02:12:26,689 --> 02:12:26,699
problem is they want a push button they
 

7237
02:12:26,699 --> 02:12:28,669
problem is they want a push button they
wanna they wanna out of the box solution

7238
02:12:28,669 --> 02:12:28,679
wanna they wanna out of the box solution
 

7239
02:12:28,679 --> 02:12:30,649
wanna they wanna out of the box solution
that I'm secure you know they want to

7240
02:12:30,649 --> 02:12:30,659
that I'm secure you know they want to
 

7241
02:12:30,659 --> 02:12:32,570
that I'm secure you know they want to
tell people they're secure but and

7242
02:12:32,570 --> 02:12:32,580
tell people they're secure but and
 

7243
02:12:32,580 --> 02:12:34,189
tell people they're secure but and
that's very challenging to have it's

7244
02:12:34,189 --> 02:12:34,199
that's very challenging to have it's
 

7245
02:12:34,199 --> 02:12:35,990
that's very challenging to have it's
impossible but like if I could if

7246
02:12:35,990 --> 02:12:36,000
impossible but like if I could if
 

7247
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:37,689
impossible but like if I could if
someone had it they'd be a billionaire

7248
02:12:37,689 --> 02:12:37,699
someone had it they'd be a billionaire
 

7249
02:12:37,699 --> 02:12:40,310
someone had it they'd be a billionaire
uh you know they'd be Beyond a

7250
02:12:40,310 --> 02:12:40,320
uh you know they'd be Beyond a
 

7251
02:12:40,320 --> 02:12:41,810
uh you know they'd be Beyond a
billionaire you know because that's what

7252
02:12:41,810 --> 02:12:41,820
billionaire you know because that's what
 

7253
02:12:41,820 --> 02:12:44,089
billionaire you know because that's what
everybody wants so it's you know you can

7254
02:12:44,089 --> 02:12:44,099
everybody wants so it's you know you can
 

7255
02:12:44,099 --> 02:12:46,070
everybody wants so it's you know you can
buy all the tools you want it's

7256
02:12:46,070 --> 02:12:46,080
buy all the tools you want it's
 

7257
02:12:46,080 --> 02:12:47,990
buy all the tools you want it's
configuring them the proper way and

7258
02:12:47,990 --> 02:12:48,000
configuring them the proper way and
 

7259
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:49,490
configuring them the proper way and
there's if anyone's trying to tell you

7260
02:12:49,490 --> 02:12:49,500
there's if anyone's trying to tell you
 

7261
02:12:49,500 --> 02:12:52,550
there's if anyone's trying to tell you
uh that there's one solution that fits

7262
02:12:52,550 --> 02:12:52,560
uh that there's one solution that fits
 

7263
02:12:52,560 --> 02:12:54,109
uh that there's one solution that fits
all their snake hole salesman and

7264
02:12:54,109 --> 02:12:54,119
all their snake hole salesman and
 

7265
02:12:54,119 --> 02:12:55,370
all their snake hole salesman and
there's a lot of people in cyber

7266
02:12:55,370 --> 02:12:55,380
there's a lot of people in cyber
 

7267
02:12:55,380 --> 02:12:56,930
there's a lot of people in cyber
security that are staying all salesmen

7268
02:12:56,930 --> 02:12:56,940
security that are staying all salesmen
 

7269
02:12:56,940 --> 02:12:58,850
security that are staying all salesmen
yeah and I feel like there's tools if

7270
02:12:58,850 --> 02:12:58,860
yeah and I feel like there's tools if
 

7271
02:12:58,860 --> 02:13:00,910
yeah and I feel like there's tools if
they're not configured correctly

7272
02:13:00,910 --> 02:13:00,920
they're not configured correctly
 

7273
02:13:00,920 --> 02:13:03,890
they're not configured correctly
they uh they just introduce

7274
02:13:03,890 --> 02:13:03,900
they uh they just introduce
 

7275
02:13:03,900 --> 02:13:05,330
they uh they just introduce
they don't increase security

7276
02:13:05,330 --> 02:13:05,340
they don't increase security
 

7277
02:13:05,340 --> 02:13:07,189
they don't increase security
significantly and they introduce a lot

7278
02:13:07,189 --> 02:13:07,199
significantly and they introduce a lot
 

7279
02:13:07,199 --> 02:13:09,530
significantly and they introduce a lot
of pain for the people they uh decrease

7280
02:13:09,530 --> 02:13:09,540
of pain for the people they uh decrease
 

7281
02:13:09,540 --> 02:13:11,209
of pain for the people they uh decrease
efficiency of the actual work you have

7282
02:13:11,209 --> 02:13:11,219
efficiency of the actual work you have
 

7283
02:13:11,219 --> 02:13:14,270
efficiency of the actual work you have
to do so like uh we had um I was at

7284
02:13:14,270 --> 02:13:14,280
to do so like uh we had um I was at
 

7285
02:13:14,280 --> 02:13:16,430
to do so like uh we had um I was at
Google for a Time

7286
02:13:16,430 --> 02:13:16,440
Google for a Time
 

7287
02:13:16,440 --> 02:13:18,589
Google for a Time
and

7288
02:13:18,589 --> 02:13:18,599
and
 

7289
02:13:18,599 --> 02:13:21,290
and
I think mostly I want to give props to

7290

I think mostly I want to give props to
 

7291
02:13:21,300 --> 02:13:23,149
I think mostly I want to give props to
their security efforts

7292
02:13:23,149 --> 02:13:23,159
their security efforts
 

7293
02:13:23,159 --> 02:13:27,890
their security efforts
but user data so like data that belongs

7294
02:13:27,890 --> 02:13:27,900
but user data so like data that belongs
 

7295
02:13:27,900 --> 02:13:31,189
but user data so like data that belongs
to users is like the holy

7296
02:13:31,189 --> 02:13:31,199
to users is like the holy
 

7297
02:13:31,199 --> 02:13:34,370
to users is like the holy
like the amount of security they have

7298
02:13:34,370 --> 02:13:34,380
like the amount of security they have
 

7299
02:13:34,380 --> 02:13:37,550
like the amount of security they have
around that is incredible so most any

7300
02:13:37,550 --> 02:13:37,560
around that is incredible so most any
 

7301
02:13:37,560 --> 02:13:41,330
around that is incredible so most any
time I had to work with anything even

7302
02:13:41,330 --> 02:13:41,340
time I had to work with anything even
 

7303
02:13:41,340 --> 02:13:43,069
time I had to work with anything even
resembling user days I never got a

7304
02:13:43,069 --> 02:13:43,079
resembling user days I never got a
 

7305
02:13:43,079 --> 02:13:44,569
resembling user days I never got a
chance to work with actual user data

7306
02:13:44,569 --> 02:13:44,579
chance to work with actual user data
 

7307
02:13:44,579 --> 02:13:46,370
chance to work with actual user data
anything resembling that first of all

7308
02:13:46,370 --> 02:13:46,380
anything resembling that first of all
 

7309
02:13:46,380 --> 02:13:48,530
anything resembling that first of all
you have no access to the internet it's

7310
02:13:48,530 --> 02:13:48,540
you have no access to the internet it's
 

7311
02:13:48,540 --> 02:13:50,089
you have no access to the internet it's
impossible to even come close to the

7312
02:13:50,089 --> 02:13:50,099
impossible to even come close to the
 

7313
02:13:50,099 --> 02:13:52,250
impossible to even come close to the
access to the internet and there's so

7314
02:13:52,250 --> 02:13:52,260
access to the internet and there's so
 

7315
02:13:52,260 --> 02:13:56,089
access to the internet and there's so
much pain to actually like interact with

7316
02:13:56,089 --> 02:13:56,099
much pain to actually like interact with
 

7317
02:13:56,099 --> 02:13:59,209
much pain to actually like interact with
that data where it I mean it's it was

7318
02:13:59,209 --> 02:13:59,219
that data where it I mean it's it was
 

7319
02:13:59,219 --> 02:14:02,270
that data where it I mean it's it was
extremely inefficient in places where I

7320
02:14:02,270 --> 02:14:02,280
extremely inefficient in places where I
 

7321
02:14:02,280 --> 02:14:03,709
extremely inefficient in places where I
thought it didn't have to be that

7322
02:14:03,709 --> 02:14:03,719
thought it didn't have to be that
 

7323
02:14:03,719 --> 02:14:05,510
thought it didn't have to be that
inefficient the security was too much

7324
02:14:05,510 --> 02:14:05,520
inefficient the security was too much
 

7325
02:14:05,520 --> 02:14:07,790
inefficient the security was too much
but I have to give respect to that

7326
02:14:07,790 --> 02:14:07,800
but I have to give respect to that
 

7327
02:14:07,800 --> 02:14:09,530
but I have to give respect to that
because you in that case you want to err

7328
02:14:09,530 --> 02:14:09,540
because you in that case you want to err
 

7329
02:14:09,540 --> 02:14:11,030
because you in that case you want to err
on the side of security but that's

7330
02:14:11,030 --> 02:14:11,040
on the side of security but that's
 

7331
02:14:11,040 --> 02:14:13,189
on the side of security but that's
Google yeah they were doing a good job

7332
02:14:13,189 --> 02:14:13,199
Google yeah they were doing a good job
 

7333
02:14:13,199 --> 02:14:15,050
Google yeah they were doing a good job
of this the reputational harm if it got

7334
02:14:15,050 --> 02:14:15,060
of this the reputational harm if it got
 

7335
02:14:15,060 --> 02:14:17,209
of this the reputational harm if it got
out I mean Google you know why is Google

7336
02:14:17,209 --> 02:14:17,219
out I mean Google you know why is Google
 

7337
02:14:17,219 --> 02:14:19,609
out I mean Google you know why is Google
Drive free you know because they want

7338
02:14:19,609 --> 02:14:19,619
Drive free you know because they want
 

7339
02:14:19,619 --> 02:14:21,530
Drive free you know because they want
your data they want you to park your

7340
02:14:21,530 --> 02:14:21,540
your data they want you to park your
 

7341
02:14:21,540 --> 02:14:24,229
your data they want you to park your
data there so you know if the re if they

7342
02:14:24,229 --> 02:14:24,239
data there so you know if the re if they
 

7343
02:14:24,239 --> 02:14:26,689
data there so you know if the re if they
got hacked or leaked information the

7344
02:14:26,689 --> 02:14:26,699
got hacked or leaked information the
 

7345
02:14:26,699 --> 02:14:28,669
got hacked or leaked information the
reputational harm would be tremendous

7346
02:14:28,669 --> 02:14:28,679
reputational harm would be tremendous
 

7347
02:14:28,679 --> 02:14:32,629
reputational harm would be tremendous
but you know for a company that not it's

7348
02:14:32,629 --> 02:14:32,639
but you know for a company that not it's
 

7349
02:14:32,639 --> 02:14:33,890
but you know for a company that not it's
really hard to do that right and the

7350
02:14:33,890 --> 02:14:33,900
really hard to do that right and the
 

7351
02:14:33,900 --> 02:14:36,050
really hard to do that right and the
company's not as big as Google or not as

7352
02:14:36,050 --> 02:14:36,060
company's not as big as Google or not as
 

7353
02:14:36,060 --> 02:14:38,750
company's not as big as Google or not as
tech savvy as Google might have a lot of

7354
02:14:38,750 --> 02:14:38,760
tech savvy as Google might have a lot of
 

7355
02:14:38,760 --> 02:14:39,830
tech savvy as Google might have a lot of
trouble with doing that kind of stuff

7356
02:14:39,830 --> 02:14:39,840
trouble with doing that kind of stuff
 

7357
02:14:39,840 --> 02:14:41,689
trouble with doing that kind of stuff
instead instead of increasing security

7358
02:14:41,689 --> 02:14:41,699
instead instead of increasing security
 

7359
02:14:41,699 --> 02:14:45,589
instead instead of increasing security
they'll just decrease the efficiency

7360
02:14:45,589 --> 02:14:45,599
they'll just decrease the efficiency
 

7361
02:14:45,599 --> 02:14:47,689
they'll just decrease the efficiency
well yeah so so there's a big difference

7362
02:14:47,689 --> 02:14:47,699
well yeah so so there's a big difference
 

7363
02:14:47,699 --> 02:14:49,609
well yeah so so there's a big difference
between I.T and security and

7364
02:14:49,609 --> 02:14:49,619
between I.T and security and
 

7365
02:14:49,619 --> 02:14:50,930
between I.T and security and
unfortunately like these mid-side

7366
02:14:50,930 --> 02:14:50,940
unfortunately like these mid-side
 

7367
02:14:50,940 --> 02:14:52,790
unfortunately like these mid-side
companies they try to stack security

7368
02:14:52,790 --> 02:14:52,800
companies they try to stack security
 

7369
02:14:52,800 --> 02:14:54,709
companies they try to stack security

7379
02:15:01,739 --> 02:15:04,129
data they need to do their job so the
company can grow security is not that

7380

two-factor authentication you know

7436
02:15:57,770 --> 02:15:57,780
two-factor authentication you know
 

7437
02:15:57,780 --> 02:16:00,050
two-factor authentication you know
that's a big thing you know we it's it's

that's a big thing you know we it's it's
 

7439

that's a big thing you know we it's it's
I mean I sound like a broken record

7440
02:16:01,910 --> 02:16:01,920
I mean I sound like a broken record
 

7441
02:16:01,920 --> 02:16:03,589
I mean I sound like a broken record
because this isn't anything new this

7442

because this isn't anything new this
 

7443
02:16:03,599 --> 02:16:04,850
because this isn't anything new this
isn't rocket science the problem is

7444
02:16:04,850 --> 02:16:04,860
isn't rocket science the problem is
 

7445
02:16:04,860 --> 02:16:06,109
isn't rocket science the problem is
we're not implementing it and we're not

we're not implementing it and we're not

us well two-factor authentication is a
 

7453
02:16:12,480 --> 02:16:14,050
us well two-factor authentication is a
good example of something

7454
02:16:14,050 --> 02:16:14,060
good example of something
 

7455
02:16:14,060 --> 02:16:17,270
good example of something
that I just was annoyed by for the

7456
02:16:17,270 --> 02:16:17,280
that I just was annoyed by for the
 

7457
02:16:17,280 --> 02:16:19,669
that I just was annoyed by for the

7458
02:16:19,669 --> 02:16:19,679
longest time because yes it's very good
 

7459
02:16:19,679 --> 02:16:21,890
longest time because yes it's very good
but like it's it seems that it's pretty

7460
02:16:21,890 --> 02:16:21,900
but like it's it seems that it's pretty
 

7461
02:16:21,900 --> 02:16:25,310
but like it's it seems that it's pretty
easy to implement horribly to where it's

7462
02:16:25,310 --> 02:16:25,320
easy to implement horribly to where it's
 

7463
02:16:25,320 --> 02:16:27,530
easy to implement horribly to where it's
like it's not convenient at all for the

7464
02:16:27,530 --> 02:16:27,540
like it's not convenient at all for the
 

7465
02:16:27,540 --> 02:16:29,629
like it's not convenient at all for the
for the legitimate user to use it should

7466
02:16:29,629 --> 02:16:29,639
for the legitimate user to use it should
 

7467
02:16:29,639 --> 02:16:33,049
for the legitimate user to use it should
be trivial to to do uh like to

7468
02:16:33,049 --> 02:16:33,059
be trivial to to do uh like to
 

7469
02:16:33,059 --> 02:16:34,910
be trivial to to do uh like to
authenticate yourself twice should be

7470
02:16:34,910 --> 02:16:34,920
authenticate yourself twice should be
 

7471
02:16:34,920 --> 02:16:37,969
authenticate yourself twice should be
super easy if security if it's slightly

7472
02:16:37,969 --> 02:16:37,979
super easy if security if it's slightly
 

7473
02:16:37,979 --> 02:16:40,190
super easy if security if it's slightly
inconvenient for you it's think about

7474
02:16:40,190 --> 02:16:40,200
inconvenient for you it's think about
 

7475
02:16:40,200 --> 02:16:41,929
inconvenient for you it's think about
how inconvenient is for a hacker and how

7476
02:16:41,929 --> 02:16:41,939
how inconvenient is for a hacker and how
 

7477
02:16:41,939 --> 02:16:42,889
how inconvenient is for a hacker and how
this is just going to move on to the

02:16:42,889 --> 02:16:42,899
this is just going to move on to the
 

7479
02:16:42,899 --> 02:16:44,509
this is just going to move on to the
next person yes yes in theory when

7480
02:16:44,509 --> 02:16:44,519
next person yes yes in theory when
 

7481
02:16:44,519 --> 02:16:48,169
next person yes yes in theory when
implemented extremely well yeah but I I

7482
02:16:48,169 --> 02:16:48,179
implemented extremely well yeah but I I
 

7483
02:16:48,179 --> 02:16:51,110
implemented extremely well yeah but I I
just don't think so I think actually if

7484
02:16:51,110 --> 02:16:51,120
just don't think so I think actually if
 

7485
02:16:51,120 --> 02:16:52,570
just don't think so I think actually if
it's

7486
02:16:52,570 --> 02:16:52,580
it's
 

7487
02:16:52,580 --> 02:16:55,190
it's
inconvenient it shows that system has

7488
02:16:55,190 --> 02:16:55,200
inconvenient it shows that system has

been thought through a lot do you know

7490
02:16:57,770 --> 02:16:57,780
been thought through a lot do you know
 

7491
02:16:57,780 --> 02:16:59,870
been thought through a lot do you know
why we need two-factor authentication

7492
02:16:59,870 --> 02:16:59,880
why we need two-factor authentication
 

7493
02:16:59,880 --> 02:17:01,730
why we need two-factor authentication
people using the same password across

7494
02:17:01,730 --> 02:17:01,740
people using the same password across
 

7495
02:17:01,740 --> 02:17:03,290
people using the same password across
the same site so when one site is

7496
02:17:03,290 --> 02:17:03,300
the same site so when one site is
 

7497
02:17:03,300 --> 02:17:04,969
the same site so when one site is
compromised people just take that

7498
02:17:04,969 --> 02:17:04,979
compromised people just take that
 

7499
02:17:04,979 --> 02:17:06,230
compromised people just take that
username and password it's called

7500
02:17:06,230 --> 02:17:06,240
username and password it's called
 

7501
02:17:06,240 --> 02:17:07,730
username and password it's called
credential stuffing and just stuff it

7502
02:17:07,730 --> 02:17:07,740
credential stuffing and just stuff it
 

7503
02:17:07,740 --> 02:17:09,950
credential stuffing and just stuff it
across the internet so if 10 years ago

7504
02:17:09,950 --> 02:17:09,960
across the internet so if 10 years ago
 

7505
02:17:09,960 --> 02:17:11,810
across the internet so if 10 years ago
when we told everybody don't use the

7506
02:17:11,810 --> 02:17:11,820
when we told everybody don't use the
 

7507
02:17:11,820 --> 02:17:13,129
when we told everybody don't use the
same [\h__\h] password across the

7508
02:17:13,129 --> 02:17:13,139
same [\h__\h] password across the
 

7509
02:17:13,139 --> 02:17:14,990
same [\h__\h] password across the
internet across the frontal sites maybe

7510
02:17:14,990 --> 02:17:15,000
internet across the frontal sites maybe
 

7511
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:16,730
internet across the frontal sites maybe
two-factor wouldn't be needed yeah so

7512
02:17:16,730 --> 02:17:16,740
two-factor wouldn't be needed yeah so
 

7513
02:17:16,740 --> 02:17:18,770
two-factor wouldn't be needed yeah so
you would need to factor if everyone did

7514
02:17:18,770 --> 02:17:18,780
you would need to factor if everyone did
 

7515
02:17:18,780 --> 02:17:21,889
you would need to factor if everyone did
a good job with passwords yeah

7516
02:17:21,889 --> 02:17:21,899
a good job with passwords yeah
 

7517
02:17:21,899 --> 02:17:25,429
a good job with passwords yeah
right but I'm saying like the two Factor

7518
02:17:25,429 --> 02:17:25,439
right but I'm saying like the two Factor
 

7519
02:17:25,439 --> 02:17:27,889
right but I'm saying like the two Factor
authentication it should uh it should be

7520
02:17:27,889 --> 02:17:27,899
authentication it should uh it should be
 

7521
02:17:27,899 --> 02:17:30,950
authentication it should uh it should be
super easy to authenticate myself uh in

7522
02:17:30,950 --> 02:17:30,960
super easy to authenticate myself uh in
 

7523
02:17:30,960 --> 02:17:32,450
super easy to authenticate myself uh in
some with some other device really

7524
02:17:32,450 --> 02:17:32,460
some with some other device really
 

7525
02:17:32,460 --> 02:17:34,910
some with some other device really
quickly like there should be it should

7526
02:17:34,910 --> 02:17:34,920
quickly like there should be it should
 

7527
02:17:34,920 --> 02:17:36,889
quickly like there should be it should
be frictionless like you just hit okay

7528
02:17:36,889 --> 02:17:36,899
be frictionless like you just hit okay
 

7529
02:17:36,899 --> 02:17:39,290
be frictionless like you just hit okay
okay and anything that belongs to me

7530
02:17:39,290 --> 02:17:39,300
okay and anything that belongs to me
 

7531
02:17:39,300 --> 02:17:42,709
okay and anything that belongs to me
yeah and like I should it should very

7532
02:17:42,709 --> 02:17:42,719
yeah and like I should it should very
 

7533
02:17:42,719 --> 02:17:44,990
yeah and like I should it should very
importantly be easy to set up what

7534
02:17:44,990 --> 02:17:45,000
importantly be easy to set up what
 

7535
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:47,509
importantly be easy to set up what
belongs to me uh I don't know the full

7536
02:17:47,509 --> 02:17:47,519
belongs to me uh I don't know the full
 

7537
02:17:47,519 --> 02:17:50,450
belongs to me uh I don't know the full
complexity of the cyber attacks these

7538
02:17:50,450 --> 02:17:50,460
complexity of the cyber attacks these
 

7539
02:17:50,460 --> 02:17:52,370
complexity of the cyber attacks these
platforms are under they're probably

7540
02:17:52,370 --> 02:17:52,380
platforms are under they're probably
 

7541
02:17:52,380 --> 02:17:54,950
platforms are under they're probably
under insane amount of attacks yeah

7542
02:17:54,950 --> 02:17:54,960
under insane amount of attacks yeah
 

7543
02:17:54,960 --> 02:17:57,049
under insane amount of attacks yeah
you've got it right there that people

7544
02:17:57,049 --> 02:17:57,059
you've got it right there that people
 

7545
02:17:57,059 --> 02:17:59,089
you've got it right there that people
have no idea these large companies how

7546
02:17:59,089 --> 02:17:59,099
have no idea these large companies how
 

7547
02:17:59,099 --> 02:18:01,310
have no idea these large companies how
often they're attacked you know on a per

7548
02:18:01,310 --> 02:18:01,320
often they're attacked you know on a per
 

7549
02:18:01,320 --> 02:18:03,410
often they're attacked you know on a per
second basis and they have to fight all

7550
02:18:03,410 --> 02:18:03,420
second basis and they have to fight all
 

7551
02:18:03,420 --> 02:18:05,030
second basis and they have to fight all
that off and pick out the good traffic

7552
02:18:05,030 --> 02:18:05,040
that off and pick out the good traffic
 

7553
02:18:05,040 --> 02:18:08,929
that off and pick out the good traffic
in there so yeah I would there's no way

7554
02:18:08,929 --> 02:18:08,939
in there so yeah I would there's no way
 

7555
02:18:08,939 --> 02:18:11,889
in there so yeah I would there's no way
I'd want to run a large tech company

7556
02:18:11,889 --> 02:18:11,899
I'd want to run a large tech company
 

7557
02:18:11,899 --> 02:18:14,389
I'd want to run a large tech company

what's good advice for to try to protect
 

7563
02:18:19,260 --> 02:18:21,589
what's good advice for to try to protect
yourself from this increasingly

7564
02:18:21,589 --> 02:18:21,599
yourself from this increasingly
 

7565

dangerous world of cyber attacks again

7566
02:18:23,690 --> 02:18:23,700
dangerous world of cyber attacks again
 

7567
02:18:23,700 --> 02:18:25,129
dangerous world of cyber attacks again
educate yourself that you understand

7568
02:18:25,129 --> 02:18:25,139
educate yourself that you understand
 

7569
02:18:25,139 --> 02:18:27,169
educate yourself that you understand
that there is a threat first you have to

7570
02:18:27,169 --> 02:18:27,179
that there is a threat first you have to
 

7571
02:18:27,179 --> 02:18:28,849
that there is a threat first you have to
realize that then then you're going to

7572
02:18:28,849 --> 02:18:28,859
realize that then then you're going to
 

7573
02:18:28,859 --> 02:18:30,169
realize that then then you're going to
step up and you're going to do stuff a

7574
02:18:30,169 --> 02:18:30,179
step up and you're going to do stuff a
 

7575
02:18:30,179 --> 02:18:32,209
step up and you're going to do stuff a
little bit more sometimes I guess think

7576
02:18:32,209 --> 02:18:32,219
little bit more sometimes I guess think
 

7577
02:18:32,219 --> 02:18:33,169
little bit more sometimes I guess think
I could take that to a little bit

7578
02:18:33,169 --> 02:18:33,179
I could take that to a little bit
 

7579
02:18:33,179 --> 02:18:36,230
I could take that to a little bit
extreme I remember one time uh uh my mom

7580
02:18:36,230 --> 02:18:36,240
extreme I remember one time uh uh my mom
 

7581
02:18:36,240 --> 02:18:39,110
extreme I remember one time uh uh my mom
called me and she was uh screaming that

7582
02:18:39,110 --> 02:18:39,120
called me and she was uh screaming that
 

7583
02:18:39,120 --> 02:18:41,929
called me and she was uh screaming that
uh I woke up this morning and I just

7584
02:18:41,929 --> 02:18:41,939
uh I woke up this morning and I just
 

7585
02:18:41,939 --> 02:18:43,490
uh I woke up this morning and I just
clicked on a link and now my phone is

7586
02:18:43,490 --> 02:18:43,500
clicked on a link and now my phone is
 

7587
02:18:43,500 --> 02:18:46,250
clicked on a link and now my phone is
making weird noises and I was like

7588
02:18:46,250 --> 02:18:46,260
making weird noises and I was like
 

7589
02:18:46,260 --> 02:18:47,870
making weird noises and I was like
throw your phone in a glass of water

7590
02:18:47,870 --> 02:18:47,880
throw your phone in a glass of water
 

7591
02:18:47,880 --> 02:18:49,370
throw your phone in a glass of water
just put in a glass of water right now

7592
02:18:49,370 --> 02:18:49,380
just put in a glass of water right now
 

7593
02:18:49,380 --> 02:18:51,950
just put in a glass of water right now
and she's I made my mom cry it was not a

7594
02:18:51,950 --> 02:18:51,960
and she's I made my mom cry it was not a
 

7595
02:18:51,960 --> 02:18:53,570
and she's I made my mom cry it was not a
pleasant thing

7596
02:18:53,570 --> 02:18:53,580
pleasant thing
 

7597
02:18:53,580 --> 02:18:55,549
pleasant thing
um so sometimes I go to a little

7598
02:18:55,549 --> 02:18:55,559
um so sometimes I go to a little
 

7599
02:18:55,559 --> 02:18:57,669
um so sometimes I go to a little
extremes on those ones but but

7600
02:18:57,669 --> 02:18:57,679
extremes on those ones but but
 

7601
02:18:57,679 --> 02:18:59,990
extremes on those ones but but
understanding is a risk and making it a

7602
02:18:59,990 --> 02:19:00,000
understanding is a risk and making it a
 

7603
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:01,429
understanding is a risk and making it a
little bit more a little more difficult

7604
02:19:01,429 --> 02:19:01,439
little bit more a little more difficult
 

7605
02:19:01,439 --> 02:19:03,549
little bit more a little more difficult
to become a victim I mean just

7606
02:19:03,549 --> 02:19:03,559
to become a victim I mean just
 

7607
02:19:03,559 --> 02:19:06,049
to become a victim I mean just
understanding certain things

7608
02:19:06,049 --> 02:19:06,059
understanding certain things
 

7609
02:19:06,059 --> 02:19:08,690
understanding certain things
um you know simple things like you know

7610
02:19:08,690 --> 02:19:08,700
um you know simple things like you know
 

7611
02:19:08,700 --> 02:19:10,549
um you know simple things like you know
as we add more internet of things to

7612
02:19:10,549 --> 02:19:10,559
as we add more internet of things to
 

7613

7667
02:20:05,160 --> 02:20:07,250
guys are making portfolios out of people
uh you know we're figuring out how

7668
02:20:07,250 --> 02:20:07,260
uh you know we're figuring out how
 

7669
02:20:07,260 --> 02:20:08,990
uh you know we're figuring out how
people generate their passwords and kind

7670

people generate their passwords and kind
 

7671
02:20:09,000 --> 02:20:10,429
people generate their passwords and kind
of you know figuring and then it's

7672
02:20:10,429 --> 02:20:10,439
of you know figuring and then it's
 

7673
02:20:10,439 --> 02:20:12,290
of you know figuring and then it's
easier to crack their password

7674
02:20:12,290 --> 02:20:12,300
easier to crack their password
 

7675
02:20:12,300 --> 02:20:14,150
easier to crack their password
you know we're making a dossier on each

7676
02:20:14,150 --> 02:20:14,160
you know we're making a dossier on each
 

7677
02:20:14,160 --> 02:20:16,790
you know we're making a dossier on each
person it's 350 million dossiers just in

7678
02:20:16,790 --> 02:20:16,800
person it's 350 million dossiers just in
 

7679
02:20:16,800 --> 02:20:18,590
person it's 350 million dossiers just in
that one hack Yahoo there was a half a

7680
02:20:18,590 --> 02:20:18,600
that one hack Yahoo there was a half a
 

7681
02:20:18,600 --> 02:20:19,490
that one hack Yahoo there was a half a
billion

7682
02:20:19,490 --> 02:20:19,500
billion
 

7683
02:20:19,500 --> 02:20:21,590
billion
so the the thing a hacker would do with

7684
02:20:21,590 --> 02:20:21,600
so the the thing a hacker would do with
 

7685
02:20:21,600 --> 02:20:24,230
so the the thing a hacker would do with
that is try to find all the link low

7686
02:20:24,230 --> 02:20:24,240
that is try to find all the link low
 

7687
02:20:24,240 --> 02:20:26,210
that is try to find all the link low
hanging fruit like have some kind of

7688
02:20:26,210 --> 02:20:26,220
hanging fruit like have some kind of
 

7689
02:20:26,220 --> 02:20:28,010
hanging fruit like have some kind of
program that

7690
02:20:28,010 --> 02:20:28,020
program that
 

7691
02:20:28,020 --> 02:20:29,750
program that
yeah evaluates the strength of the

7692
02:20:29,750 --> 02:20:29,760
yeah evaluates the strength of the
 

7693
02:20:29,760 --> 02:20:30,950
yeah evaluates the strength of the
passwords

7694
02:20:30,950 --> 02:20:30,960
passwords
 

7695
02:20:30,960 --> 02:20:33,889
passwords
and then finds the weak ones and that

7696
02:20:33,889 --> 02:20:33,899
and then finds the weak ones and that
 

7697
02:20:33,899 --> 02:20:35,210
and then finds the weak ones and that
means that this person is probably the

7698
02:20:35,210 --> 02:20:35,220
means that this person is probably the
 

7699
02:20:35,220 --> 02:20:36,530
means that this person is probably the
kind of person that would use the same

7700
02:20:36,530 --> 02:20:36,540
kind of person that would use the same
 

7701
02:20:36,540 --> 02:20:38,990
kind of person that would use the same
password across multiple or even just

7702

password across multiple or even just
 

7703

um you can go in you know and find a
 

7871
02:23:25,380 --> 02:23:27,110
um you can go in you know and find a
vulnerability read about the white paper

what's wrong with that that software and
then you can go on the internet and find

02:23:30,830 --> 02:23:30,840
then you can go on the internet and find
 

7877
02:23:30,840 --> 02:23:32,510
then you can go on the internet and find
all of the computers that are running

list there's your target list yeah I
 

7883
02:23:36,420 --> 02:23:37,610
list there's your target list yeah I
know the vulnerabilities they're running

7884

know the vulnerabilities they're running
 

7885
02:23:37,620 --> 02:23:40,309

I again not making a Playbook here but

7886
02:23:40,309 --> 02:23:40,319
I again not making a Playbook here but
 

7887
02:23:40,319 --> 02:23:42,770
I again not making a Playbook here but
you know that's how easy it is to to

7888
02:23:42,770 --> 02:23:42,780
you know that's how easy it is to to
 

7889
02:23:42,780 --> 02:23:44,210
you know that's how easy it is to to
find your targets and that's what that's

7890
02:23:44,210 --> 02:23:44,220
find your targets and that's what that's
 

7891
02:23:44,220 --> 02:23:46,490
find your targets and that's what that's
what the the bad guys are doing then the

7892
02:23:46,490 --> 02:23:46,500
what the the bad guys are doing then the
 

7893
02:23:46,500 --> 02:23:48,590
what the the bad guys are doing then the
reverse is tough it's much tougher but

7894
02:23:48,590 --> 02:23:48,600
reverse is tough it's much tougher but
 

7895
02:23:48,600 --> 02:23:50,510
reverse is tough it's much tougher but
it's still doable which is like the

7896
02:23:50,510 --> 02:23:50,520
it's still doable which is like the
 

7897
02:23:50,520 --> 02:23:52,070
it's still doable which is like the
first find the target like if you have

7898
02:23:52,070 --> 02:23:52,080
first find the target like if you have
 

7899
02:23:52,080 --> 02:23:53,809
first find the target like if you have
specific targets

7900
02:23:53,809 --> 02:23:53,819
specific targets
 

7901
02:23:53,819 --> 02:23:56,270
specific targets
uh to to you know hack into a Twitter

7902
02:23:56,270 --> 02:23:56,280
uh to to you know hack into a Twitter
 

7903
02:23:56,280 --> 02:23:58,550
uh to to you know hack into a Twitter
account for example much harder that's

7904
02:23:58,550 --> 02:23:58,560
account for example much harder that's
 

7905
02:23:58,560 --> 02:24:00,290
account for example much harder that's
probably social engineering right that's

7906
02:24:00,290 --> 02:24:00,300
probably social engineering right that's
 

7907
02:24:00,300 --> 02:24:01,849
probably social engineering right that's
probably the best way probably if you if

7908
02:24:01,849 --> 02:24:01,859
probably the best way probably if you if
 

7909
02:24:01,859 --> 02:24:03,230
probably the best way probably if you if
you wanted something specific to that I

7910
02:24:03,230 --> 02:24:03,240
you wanted something specific to that I

the black market you can buy a key

7928
02:24:19,490 --> 02:24:19,500
the black market you can buy a key
 

7929
02:24:19,500 --> 02:24:21,830
the black market you can buy a key
logger that just USB then the mouse

logger that just USB then the mouse
 

7931
02:24:21,840 --> 02:24:23,270
logger that just USB then the mouse
plugs right into it it looks like an

7932
02:24:23,270 --> 02:24:23,280
plugs right into it it looks like an
 

7933
02:24:23,280 --> 02:24:25,010
plugs right into it it looks like an
extension on the mouse if you can even

7934
02:24:25,010 --> 02:24:25,020
extension on the mouse if you can even
 

7935
02:24:25,020 --> 02:24:27,950
extension on the mouse if you can even
find it you can buy the the stuff with a

7936
02:24:27,950 --> 02:24:27,960
find it you can buy the the stuff with a
 

7937
02:24:27,960 --> 02:24:29,870
find it you can buy the the stuff with a
mouse inside of it uh and just plug it

7938
02:24:29,870 --> 02:24:29,880
mouse inside of it uh and just plug it
 

7939
02:24:29,880 --> 02:24:31,490
mouse inside of it uh and just plug it
into somebody's computer and there's a

7940
02:24:31,490 --> 02:24:31,500
into somebody's computer and there's a
 

7941
02:24:31,500 --> 02:24:32,870
into somebody's computer and there's a
key logger that lives in there and calls

7942
02:24:32,870 --> 02:24:32,880
key logger that lives in there and calls
 

7943
02:24:32,880 --> 02:24:35,090
key logger that lives in there and calls
home sends everything you want so I mean

7944
02:24:35,090 --> 02:24:35,100
home sends everything you want so I mean
 

7945
02:24:35,100 --> 02:24:38,210
home sends everything you want so I mean
and it's cheap yeah in grad school

7946
02:24:38,210 --> 02:24:38,220
and it's cheap yeah in grad school
 

7947
02:24:38,220 --> 02:24:41,090
and it's cheap yeah in grad school
um a program to build a bunch of key

7948
02:24:41,090 --> 02:24:41,100
um a program to build a bunch of key
 

7949
02:24:41,100 --> 02:24:42,830
um a program to build a bunch of key
loggers it was fascinating tracking

7950
02:24:42,830 --> 02:24:42,840
loggers it was fascinating tracking
 

7951
02:24:42,840 --> 02:24:45,349
loggers it was fascinating tracking
Mouse just for uh what I was doing as

7952
02:24:45,349 --> 02:24:45,359
Mouse just for uh what I was doing as
 

7953
02:24:45,359 --> 02:24:48,170
Mouse just for uh what I was doing as
part of the research uh I was doing

7954
02:24:48,170 --> 02:24:48,180
part of the research uh I was doing
 

7955
02:24:48,180 --> 02:24:52,730
part of the research uh I was doing
to uh uh to see if by the Dynamics of

7956
02:24:52,730 --> 02:24:52,740
to uh uh to see if by the Dynamics of
 

7957
02:24:52,740 --> 02:24:54,410
to uh uh to see if by the Dynamics of
how you type

7958
02:24:54,410 --> 02:24:54,420
how you type
 

7959
02:24:54,420 --> 02:24:56,030
how you type
and how you move the mouse you can tell

7960
02:24:56,030 --> 02:24:56,040
and how you move the mouse you can tell
 

7961
02:24:56,040 --> 02:24:58,550
and how you move the mouse you can tell
who the person is oh wow that's like

7962
02:24:58,550 --> 02:24:58,560
who the person is oh wow that's like
 

7963
02:24:58,560 --> 02:25:01,910
who the person is oh wow that's like
um it's called the active authentication

7964
02:25:01,910 --> 02:25:01,920
um it's called the active authentication
 

7965
02:25:01,920 --> 02:25:04,130
um it's called the active authentication
like it's basically Biometrics that's

7966
02:25:04,130 --> 02:25:04,140
like it's basically Biometrics that's
 

7967
02:25:04,140 --> 02:25:07,250
like it's basically Biometrics that's
not using bio uh just to see how

7968
02:25:07,250 --> 02:25:07,260
not using bio uh just to see how
 

7969
02:25:07,260 --> 02:25:08,809
not using bio uh just to see how
identifiable that is so it's fascinating

7970
02:25:08,809 --> 02:25:08,819
identifiable that is so it's fascinating
 

7971
02:25:08,819 --> 02:25:10,309
identifiable that is so it's fascinating
to study that but it's also fascinating

7972
02:25:10,309 --> 02:25:10,319
to study that but it's also fascinating
 

7973
02:25:10,319 --> 02:25:12,950
to study that but it's also fascinating
how damn easy it is to install key

7974
02:25:12,950 --> 02:25:12,960
how damn easy it is to install key
 

7975
02:25:12,960 --> 02:25:15,830
how damn easy it is to install key
loggers so I I think is is in natural

7976
02:25:15,830 --> 02:25:15,840
loggers so I I think is is in natural
 

7977
02:25:15,840 --> 02:25:18,349
loggers so I I think is is in natural
what happens is you realize how many

7978
02:25:18,349 --> 02:25:18,359
what happens is you realize how many
 

7979
02:25:18,359 --> 02:25:19,730
what happens is you realize how many
vulnerabilities there are in this world

7980
02:25:19,730 --> 02:25:19,740
vulnerabilities there are in this world
 

7981
02:25:19,740 --> 02:25:22,910
vulnerabilities there are in this world
you do that when you understand bacteria

7982
02:25:22,910 --> 02:25:22,920
you do that when you understand bacteria
 

7983
02:25:22,920 --> 02:25:24,110
you do that when you understand bacteria
and viruses you realize they're

7984
02:25:24,110 --> 02:25:24,120
and viruses you realize they're
 

7985
02:25:24,120 --> 02:25:26,809
and viruses you realize they're
everywhere in the same way with uh I'm

7986
02:25:26,809 --> 02:25:26,819
everywhere in the same way with uh I'm
 

7987
02:25:26,819 --> 02:25:28,370
everywhere in the same way with uh I'm
talking about biological ones and then

7988
02:25:28,370 --> 02:25:28,380
talking about biological ones and then
 

7989
02:25:28,380 --> 02:25:30,290
talking about biological ones and then
you realize that all the vulnerabilities

7990
02:25:30,290 --> 02:25:30,300
you realize that all the vulnerabilities
 

7991
02:25:30,300 --> 02:25:31,490
you realize that all the vulnerabilities
that are out there one of the things

7992
02:25:31,490 --> 02:25:31,500
that are out there one of the things
 

7993
02:25:31,500 --> 02:25:33,530
that are out there one of the things
I've noticed quite a lot is

7994
02:25:33,530 --> 02:25:33,540
I've noticed quite a lot is
 

7995
02:25:33,540 --> 02:25:35,570
I've noticed quite a lot is
how many people don't log out of their

7996
02:25:35,570 --> 02:25:35,580
how many people don't log out of their
 

7997
02:25:35,580 --> 02:25:37,070
how many people don't log out of their
computers

7998
02:25:37,070 --> 02:25:37,080
computers
 

7999
02:25:37,080 --> 02:25:39,530
computers
just how easy physical access the

8000
02:25:39,530 --> 02:25:39,540
just how easy physical access the
 

8001
02:25:39,540 --> 02:25:41,750
just how easy physical access the
systems actually is

8002
02:25:41,750 --> 02:25:41,760
systems actually is
 

8003
02:25:41,760 --> 02:25:44,210
systems actually is
uh like in a lot of places in this world

8004
02:25:44,210 --> 02:25:44,220
uh like in a lot of places in this world
 

8005
02:25:44,220 --> 02:25:46,730
uh like in a lot of places in this world
and I'm not talking about private homes

8006
02:25:46,730 --> 02:25:46,740
and I'm not talking about private homes
 

8007
02:25:46,740 --> 02:25:48,110
and I'm not talking about private homes
I'm talking about companies especially

8008
02:25:48,110 --> 02:25:48,120
I'm talking about companies especially
 

8009
02:25:48,120 --> 02:25:50,690
I'm talking about companies especially
large companies it seems quite trivial

8010
02:25:50,690 --> 02:25:50,700
large companies it seems quite trivial
 

8011
02:25:50,700 --> 02:25:52,250
large companies it seems quite trivial
in certain places that I've been to to

8012
02:25:52,250 --> 02:25:52,260
in certain places that I've been to to
 

8013
02:25:52,260 --> 02:25:54,469
in certain places that I've been to to
walk in and have physical access to a

8014
02:25:54,469 --> 02:25:54,479
walk in and have physical access to a
 

8015
02:25:54,479 --> 02:25:56,750
walk in and have physical access to a
system and that's depressing to me it is

8016
02:25:56,750 --> 02:25:56,760
system and that's depressing to me it is
 

8017
02:25:56,760 --> 02:25:59,210
system and that's depressing to me it is
it just I laugh because uh one of my my

8018
02:25:59,210 --> 02:25:59,220
it just I laugh because uh one of my my
 

8019
02:25:59,220 --> 02:26:02,090
it just I laugh because uh one of my my
partners at naxo that I work at now

8020
02:26:02,090 --> 02:26:02,100
partners at naxo that I work at now
 

8021
02:26:02,100 --> 02:26:04,730
partners at naxo that I work at now
um he worked at a big company like you

8022
02:26:04,730 --> 02:26:04,740
um he worked at a big company like you
 

8023
02:26:04,740 --> 02:26:05,750
um he worked at a big company like you
would know the name as soon as I told

8024
02:26:05,750 --> 02:26:05,760
would know the name as soon as I told
 

8025
02:26:05,760 --> 02:26:07,610
would know the name as soon as I told
you I'm not going to say it um but the

8026
02:26:07,610 --> 02:26:07,620
you I'm not going to say it um but the
 

8027
02:26:07,620 --> 02:26:08,929
you I'm not going to say it um but the
guy who owned the company and the

8028
02:26:08,929 --> 02:26:08,939
guy who owned the company and the
 

8029
02:26:08,939 --> 02:26:10,849
guy who owned the company and the
company has his name on it

8030
02:26:10,849 --> 02:26:10,859
company has his name on it
 

8031
02:26:10,859 --> 02:26:13,550
company has his name on it
um didn't want to ever log into a

8032
02:26:13,550 --> 02:26:13,560
um didn't want to ever log into a
 

8033
02:26:13,560 --> 02:26:14,750
um didn't want to ever log into a
computer just annoyed the [\h__\h] out of

8034
02:26:14,750 --> 02:26:14,760
computer just annoyed the [\h__\h] out of
 

8035
02:26:14,760 --> 02:26:16,730
computer just annoyed the [\h__\h] out of
him so they hired a person that stands

8036
02:26:16,730 --> 02:26:16,740
him so they hired a person that stands
 

8037
02:26:16,740 --> 02:26:18,230
him so they hired a person that stands
next to his computer when he's not there

8038
02:26:18,230 --> 02:26:18,240
next to his computer when he's not there
 

8039
02:26:18,240 --> 02:26:20,750
next to his computer when he's not there
and that's his physical security

8040
02:26:20,750 --> 02:26:20,760
and that's his physical security
 

8041
02:26:20,760 --> 02:26:22,550
and that's his physical security
see that's good that's that's pretty

8042
02:26:22,550 --> 02:26:22,560
see that's good that's that's pretty
 

8043
02:26:22,560 --> 02:26:24,050
see that's good that's that's pretty
good actually so yeah I mean I guess if

8044
02:26:24,050 --> 02:26:24,060
good actually so yeah I mean I guess if
 

8045
02:26:24,060 --> 02:26:26,090
good actually so yeah I mean I guess if
you could afford to do that at least

8046
02:26:26,090 --> 02:26:26,100
you could afford to do that at least
 

8047
02:26:26,100 --> 02:26:27,650
you could afford to do that at least
you're taking your security seriously I

8048
02:26:27,650 --> 02:26:27,660
you're taking your security seriously I
 

8049
02:26:27,660 --> 02:26:28,670
you're taking your security seriously I
feel like there's a lot of people in

8050
02:26:28,670 --> 02:26:28,680
feel like there's a lot of people in
 

8051
02:26:28,680 --> 02:26:30,590
feel like there's a lot of people in
that case would just not have a login

8052
02:26:30,590 --> 02:26:30,600
that case would just not have a login
 

8053
02:26:30,600 --> 02:26:34,190
that case would just not have a login
yeah no the security team there had to

8054
02:26:34,190 --> 02:26:34,200
yeah no the security team there had to
 

8055
02:26:34,200 --> 02:26:37,010
yeah no the security team there had to
really work around to make that work uh

8056
02:26:37,010 --> 02:26:37,020
really work around to make that work uh
 

8057
02:26:37,020 --> 02:26:39,710
really work around to make that work uh
non-compliant with company policy but

8058
02:26:39,710 --> 02:26:39,720
non-compliant with company policy but
 

8059
02:26:39,720 --> 02:26:41,750
non-compliant with company policy but
that's that's interesting the the key

8060
02:26:41,750 --> 02:26:41,760
that's that's interesting the the key
 

8061
02:26:41,760 --> 02:26:44,270
that's that's interesting the the key
log is there's there's a lot of there's

8062
02:26:44,270 --> 02:26:44,280
log is there's there's a lot of there's
 

8063
02:26:44,280 --> 02:26:46,550
log is there's there's a lot of there's
just a lot of threats yeah I mean a lot

8064
02:26:46,550 --> 02:26:46,560
just a lot of threats yeah I mean a lot
 

8065
02:26:46,560 --> 02:26:48,469
just a lot of threats yeah I mean a lot
of ways to get in yeah I mean so you

8066
02:26:48,469 --> 02:26:48,479
of ways to get in yeah I mean so you
 

8067
02:26:48,479 --> 02:26:49,969
of ways to get in yeah I mean so you
can't sit around and worry about someone

8068
02:26:49,969 --> 02:26:49,979
can't sit around and worry about someone
 

8069
02:26:49,979 --> 02:26:51,650
can't sit around and worry about someone
physically gaining access to your

8070
02:26:51,650 --> 02:26:51,660
physically gaining access to your
 

8071
02:26:51,660 --> 02:26:52,969
physically gaining access to your
computer with keylogger and stuff like

8072
02:26:52,969 --> 02:26:52,979
computer with keylogger and stuff like
 

8073
02:26:52,979 --> 02:26:53,990
computer with keylogger and stuff like
that

8074
02:26:53,990 --> 02:26:54,000
that
 

8075
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:55,370
that
um you know if you're traveling to a

8076
02:26:55,370 --> 02:26:55,380

8383
02:32:19,100 --> 02:32:23,030
starting to get involved geopolitically
and probably in terms of cyber

8384
02:32:23,030 --> 02:32:23,040
and probably in terms of cyber
 

8385
02:32:23,040 --> 02:32:25,550
and probably in terms of cyber
um do you worry about this kind of thing

8386
02:32:25,550 --> 02:32:25,560
um do you worry about this kind of thing
 

8387
02:32:25,560 --> 02:32:27,710
um do you worry about this kind of thing
happening in the next decade or two like

8388
02:32:27,710 --> 02:32:27,720
happening in the next decade or two like
 

8389
02:32:27,720 --> 02:32:29,510
happening in the next decade or two like
where it really escalates you know

8390
02:32:29,510 --> 02:32:29,520
where it really escalates you know
 

8391
02:32:29,520 --> 02:32:32,469
where it really escalates you know
people in the in the 1920s

8392
02:32:32,469 --> 02:32:32,479
people in the in the 1920s
 

8393
02:32:32,479 --> 02:32:35,750
people in the in the 1920s
were completely terrible at predicting

8394
02:32:35,750 --> 02:32:35,760
were completely terrible at predicting
 

8395
02:32:35,760 --> 02:32:37,790
were completely terrible at predicting
the World War II

8396
02:32:37,790 --> 02:32:37,800
the World War II
 

8397
02:32:37,800 --> 02:32:40,730
the World War II
do you think we're at the precipice of

8398
02:32:40,730 --> 02:32:40,740
do you think we're at the precipice of
 

8399
02:32:40,740 --> 02:32:43,190
do you think we're at the precipice of
War potentially I think we could be I I

8400
02:32:43,190 --> 02:32:43,200
War potentially I think we could be I I
 

8401
02:32:43,200 --> 02:32:45,889
War potentially I think we could be I I
mean I I would hate to just be

8402
02:32:45,889 --> 02:32:45,899
mean I I would hate to just be
 

8403
02:32:45,899 --> 02:32:48,650
mean I I would hate to just be
you know just fear-mongering out there

8404
02:32:48,650 --> 02:32:48,660
you know just fear-mongering out there
 

8405
02:32:48,660 --> 02:32:50,270
you know just fear-mongering out there
um you know and kovid's over so the next

8406
02:32:50,270 --> 02:32:50,280
um you know and kovid's over so the next
 

8407
02:32:50,280 --> 02:32:51,650
um you know and kovid's over so the next
big thing in the media is war and all

8408
02:32:51,650 --> 02:32:51,660
big thing in the media is war and all
 

8409
02:32:51,660 --> 02:32:55,790
big thing in the media is war and all
that but I mean there's some some Flags

8410
02:32:55,790 --> 02:32:55,800
that but I mean there's some some Flags
 

8411
02:32:55,800 --> 02:32:58,309
that but I mean there's some some Flags
going up that are that are very strange

8412
02:32:58,309 --> 02:32:58,319
going up that are that are very strange
 

8413
02:32:58,319 --> 02:33:00,889
going up that are that are very strange
to me is there a ways to avoid this I

8414
02:33:00,889 --> 02:33:00,899
to me is there a ways to avoid this I
 

8415
02:33:00,899 --> 02:33:02,990
to me is there a ways to avoid this I
hope so I hope smarter people and I are

8416
02:33:02,990 --> 02:33:03,000
hope so I hope smarter people and I are
 

8417
02:33:03,000 --> 02:33:04,429
hope so I hope smarter people and I are
figuring it out I hope people are

8418
02:33:04,429 --> 02:33:04,439
figuring it out I hope people are
 

8419
02:33:04,439 --> 02:33:06,170
figuring it out I hope people are
playing their parts and and talking to

8420
02:33:06,170 --> 02:33:06,180
playing their parts and and talking to
 

8421
02:33:06,180 --> 02:33:07,730
playing their parts and and talking to
the right people

8422
02:33:07,730 --> 02:33:07,740
the right people
 

8423
02:33:07,740 --> 02:33:09,590
the right people
um because that's the war is the last

8424
02:33:09,590 --> 02:33:09,600
um because that's the war is the last
 

8425
02:33:09,600 --> 02:33:11,630
um because that's the war is the last
thing I want well there's two things to

8426
02:33:11,630 --> 02:33:11,640
thing I want well there's two things to
 

8427
02:33:11,640 --> 02:33:13,790
thing I want well there's two things to
be concerned about on the Cyber side one

8428
02:33:13,790 --> 02:33:13,800
be concerned about on the Cyber side one
 

8429
02:33:13,800 --> 02:33:15,830
be concerned about on the Cyber side one
is the actual defense

8430
02:33:15,830 --> 02:33:15,840
is the actual defense
 

8431
02:33:15,840 --> 02:33:18,110
is the actual defense
on the technical side of cyber and the

8432
02:33:18,110 --> 02:33:18,120
on the technical side of cyber and the
 

8433
02:33:18,120 --> 02:33:20,809
on the technical side of cyber and the
other one is the Panic that might happen

8434
02:33:20,809 --> 02:33:20,819
other one is the Panic that might happen
 

8435
02:33:20,819 --> 02:33:24,469
other one is the Panic that might happen
when something like some dramatic event

8436
02:33:24,469 --> 02:33:24,479
when something like some dramatic event
 

8437
02:33:24,479 --> 02:33:26,870
when something like some dramatic event
happened because of cyber some major

8438
02:33:26,870 --> 02:33:26,880
happened because of cyber some major
 

8439
02:33:26,880 --> 02:33:29,150
happened because of cyber some major
hack that becomes public

8440
02:33:29,150 --> 02:33:29,160
hack that becomes public
 

8441
02:33:29,160 --> 02:33:30,889
hack that becomes public
I'm honestly more concerned about the

8442
02:33:30,889 --> 02:33:30,899
I'm honestly more concerned about the
 

8443
02:33:30,899 --> 02:33:33,230
I'm honestly more concerned about the
panic because

8444
02:33:33,230 --> 02:33:33,240
panic because
 

8445
02:33:33,240 --> 02:33:34,969
panic because
I feel like if people don't think about

8446
02:33:34,969 --> 02:33:34,979
I feel like if people don't think about
 

8447
02:33:34,979 --> 02:33:37,370
I feel like if people don't think about
the stuff the Panic can hit harder

8448
02:33:37,370 --> 02:33:37,380
the stuff the Panic can hit harder
 

8449
02:33:37,380 --> 02:33:39,650
the stuff the Panic can hit harder
like if they if they're not conscious

8450
02:33:39,650 --> 02:33:39,660
like if they if they're not conscious
 

8451
02:33:39,660 --> 02:33:41,030
like if they if they're not conscious
about the fact that we're constantly

8452
02:33:41,030 --> 02:33:41,040
about the fact that we're constantly
 

8453
02:33:41,040 --> 02:33:43,550
about the fact that we're constantly
under attack I feel like it'll come like

8454
02:33:43,550 --> 02:33:43,560
under attack I feel like it'll come like
 

8455
02:33:43,560 --> 02:33:45,590
under attack I feel like it'll come like
a much harder surprise

8456
02:33:45,590 --> 02:33:45,600
a much harder surprise
 

8457
02:33:45,600 --> 02:33:48,349
a much harder surprise
yeah I think people will be really

8458
02:33:48,349 --> 02:33:48,359
yeah I think people will be really
 

8459
02:33:48,359 --> 02:33:50,030
yeah I think people will be really
shocked on things I mean so we talked

8460
02:33:50,030 --> 02:33:50,040
shocked on things I mean so we talked
 

8461
02:33:50,040 --> 02:33:51,469
shocked on things I mean so we talked
about low SEC today and low sick was

8462
02:33:51,469 --> 02:33:51,479
about low SEC today and low sick was
 

8463
02:33:51,479 --> 02:33:56,210
about low SEC today and low sick was
2011. they had access into a Waters the

8464
02:33:56,210 --> 02:33:56,220
2011. they had access into a Waters the
 

8465
02:33:56,220 --> 02:33:58,070
2011. they had access into a Waters the
water supply system of a major U.S city

8466
02:33:58,070 --> 02:33:58,080
water supply system of a major U.S city
 

8467
02:33:58,080 --> 02:33:59,929
water supply system of a major U.S city
they didn't do anything with it they

8468
02:33:59,929 --> 02:33:59,939
they didn't do anything with it they
 

8469
02:33:59,939 --> 02:34:01,250
they didn't do anything with it they
were sitting on it in case someone got

8470
02:34:01,250 --> 02:34:01,260
were sitting on it in case someone got
 

8471
02:34:01,260 --> 02:34:03,290
were sitting on it in case someone got
arrested and they were gonna maybe just

8472
02:34:03,290 --> 02:34:03,300
arrested and they were gonna maybe just
 

8473
02:34:03,300 --> 02:34:06,110
arrested and they were gonna maybe just
expose that it's there's insecure maybe

8474
02:34:06,110 --> 02:34:06,120
expose that it's there's insecure maybe
 

8475
02:34:06,120 --> 02:34:07,250
expose that it's there's insecure maybe
they were gonna do something to [\h__\h]

8476
02:34:07,250 --> 02:34:07,260
they were gonna do something to [\h__\h]
 

8477
02:34:07,260 --> 02:34:09,770
they were gonna do something to [\h__\h]
with it I don't know but you know that

8478
02:34:09,770 --> 02:34:09,780
with it I don't know but you know that
 

8479
02:34:09,780 --> 02:34:11,990
with it I don't know but you know that
that's that's 2011. you know I don't

8480
02:34:11,990 --> 02:34:12,000
that's that's 2011. you know I don't
 

8481
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:13,969
that's that's 2011. you know I don't
think it's gotten a lot better since

8482
02:34:13,969 --> 02:34:13,979
think it's gotten a lot better since
 

8483
02:34:13,979 --> 02:34:15,910
think it's gotten a lot better since
then

8484
02:34:15,910 --> 02:34:15,920
then
 

8485
02:34:15,920 --> 02:34:19,130
then
and there's probably nation states or

8486
02:34:19,130 --> 02:34:19,140
and there's probably nation states or
 

8487
02:34:19,140 --> 02:34:22,010
and there's probably nation states or
major organizations that are sitting

8488
02:34:22,010 --> 02:34:22,020
major organizations that are sitting
 

8489
02:34:22,020 --> 02:34:25,250
major organizations that are sitting
secretly on Hacks like 100 a hundred

8490
02:34:25,250 --> 02:34:25,260
secretly on Hacks like 100 a hundred
 

8491
02:34:25,260 --> 02:34:27,170
secretly on Hacks like 100 a hundred
percent they're sitting secretly waiting

8492
02:34:27,170 --> 02:34:27,180
percent they're sitting secretly waiting
 

8493
02:34:27,180 --> 02:34:30,230
percent they're sitting secretly waiting
to expose things

8494
02:34:30,230 --> 02:34:30,240
to expose things
 

8495
02:34:30,240 --> 02:34:31,849
to expose things
I mean I again I don't want to scare

8496
02:34:31,849 --> 02:34:31,859
I mean I again I don't want to scare
 

8497
02:34:31,859 --> 02:34:33,410
I mean I again I don't want to scare
this [\h__\h] out of people but people have

8498
02:34:33,410 --> 02:34:33,420
this [\h__\h] out of people but people have
 

8499
02:34:33,420 --> 02:34:35,030
this [\h__\h] out of people but people have
to understand the Cyber threat I mean

8500
02:34:35,030 --> 02:34:35,040
to understand the Cyber threat I mean
 

8501
02:34:35,040 --> 02:34:38,030
to understand the Cyber threat I mean
there are you know they are there are

8502
02:34:38,030 --> 02:34:38,040
there are you know they are there are
 

8503
02:34:38,040 --> 02:34:40,610
there are you know they are there are
thousands of nation-state hackers in

8504
02:34:40,610 --> 02:34:40,620
thousands of nation-state hackers in
 

8505
02:34:40,620 --> 02:34:42,650
thousands of nation-state hackers in
some countries I mean we have them too

8506
02:34:42,650 --> 02:34:42,660
some countries I mean we have them too
 

8507
02:34:42,660 --> 02:34:44,330
some countries I mean we have them too
we have offensive hackers you know the

8508
02:34:44,330 --> 02:34:44,340
we have offensive hackers you know the
 

8509
02:34:44,340 --> 02:34:46,849
we have offensive hackers you know the
the terrorist attacks of 9 11.

8510
02:34:46,849 --> 02:34:46,859
the terrorist attacks of 9 11.
 

8511
02:34:46,859 --> 02:34:49,309
the terrorist attacks of 9 11.
there's planes that actually hit actual

8512
02:34:49,309 --> 02:34:49,319
there's planes that actually hit actual
 

8513
02:34:49,319 --> 02:34:52,130
there's planes that actually hit actual
buildings and it was visibly clear and

8514
02:34:52,130 --> 02:34:52,140
buildings and it was visibly clear and
 

8515
02:34:52,140 --> 02:34:55,370
buildings and it was visibly clear and
you can trace the information with cyber

8516
02:34:55,370 --> 02:34:55,380
you can trace the information with cyber
 

8517
02:34:55,380 --> 02:34:57,349
you can trace the information with cyber
attacks say something that would result

8518
02:34:57,349 --> 02:34:57,359
attacks say something that would result
 

8519
02:34:57,359 --> 02:35:00,050
attacks say something that would result
in the ex in a major explosion in New

8520
02:35:00,050 --> 02:35:00,060
in the ex in a major explosion in New
 

8521
02:35:00,060 --> 02:35:01,550
in the ex in a major explosion in New
York City

8522
02:35:01,550 --> 02:35:01,560
York City
 

8523
02:35:01,560 --> 02:35:03,770
York City
how the hell do you trace that

8524
02:35:03,770 --> 02:35:03,780
how the hell do you trace that
 

8525
02:35:03,780 --> 02:35:04,849
how the hell do you trace that
like

8526
02:35:04,849 --> 02:35:04,859
like
 

8527
02:35:04,859 --> 02:35:07,010
like
if it's well done it's going to be

8528
02:35:07,010 --> 02:35:07,020
if it's well done it's going to be
 

8529
02:35:07,020 --> 02:35:10,010
if it's well done it's going to be
extremely difficult the problem is

8530
02:35:10,010 --> 02:35:10,020
extremely difficult the problem is
 

8531
02:35:10,020 --> 02:35:12,889
extremely difficult the problem is
it there's so many problems one of which

8532
02:35:12,889 --> 02:35:12,899
it there's so many problems one of which
 

8533
02:35:12,899 --> 02:35:14,929
it there's so many problems one of which
the US government in that case has

8534
02:35:14,929 --> 02:35:14,939
the US government in that case has
 

8535
02:35:14,939 --> 02:35:16,670
the US government in that case has
complete freedom to blame anybody they

8536
02:35:16,670 --> 02:35:16,680
