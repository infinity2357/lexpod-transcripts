if that's true then it removes

if that's true then it removes

theory like uh

454
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:06,560
theory like uh
 

455
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,309

461
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:14,869

that kind of political theorizing

462
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:14,879
that kind of political theorizing
 

463
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,550
that kind of political theorizing
really does say

00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:16,560
really does say
 

465
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,790
really does say
at a given instant we can

466
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:18,800
at a given instant we can
 

467
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,469
at a given instant we can
know pretty much everything that we need

468
00:08:20,469 --> 00:08:20,479
know pretty much everything that we need
 

469
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,869
know pretty much everything that we need
to know at least the big things

470
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:22,879
to know at least the big things
 

471
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:25,909
to know at least the big things
uh and conservatism is the opposite it's

472
00:08:25,909 --> 00:08:25,919
uh and conservatism is the opposite it's
 

473
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:28,309
uh and conservatism is the opposite it's
a it's a it's a traditionalist view

474
00:08:28,309 --> 00:08:28,319
a it's a it's a traditionalist view
 

475
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,710
a it's a it's a traditionalist view
exactly as you say that uh that says

476
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:30,720
exactly as you say that uh that says
 

477
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,190
exactly as you say that uh that says
that history is crucial

478
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:33,200
that history is crucial
 

479
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:33,990
that history is crucial
so

480
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:34,000
so
 

481
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,110
so
iran

482
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:35,120
iran
 

483
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,230
iran
you say that uh history is interesting

484
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:38,240
you say that uh history is interesting
 

485
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,630
you say that uh history is interesting
but perhaps not crucial if in in the

486
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:40,640
but perhaps not crucial if in in the
 

487
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,949
but perhaps not crucial if in in the
context of individualism no i mean i

488
00:08:42,949 --> 00:08:42,959
context of individualism no i mean i
 

489
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:44,630
context of individualism no i mean i
think i think there's a false dichotomy

490
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:44,640
think i think there's a false dichotomy
 

491
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,630

he presented here and and that is that

492
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:46,640
he presented here and and that is that
 

493
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,550
he presented here and and that is that
one view holds that

494
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:48,560
one view holds that
 

495
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,870
one view holds that
uh you can derive any anything from a

uh you can derive any anything from a
 

497
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,030
uh you can derive any anything from a
particular historical path and a kind of

00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:53,040
particular historical path and a kind of
 

499
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,550
particular historical path and a kind of
an empirical view

an empirical view

00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,310
an empirical view
and if we know the history we know where

502
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:56,320
and if we know the history we know where
 

503
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,230
and if we know the history we know where
we should be tomorrow we know what what

504
00:08:58,230 --> 00:08:58,240
we should be tomorrow we know what what
 

505
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,389
we should be tomorrow we know what what
where we should stand today and the the

506
00:09:00,389 --> 00:09:00,399
where we should stand today and the the
 

507
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,790
where we should stand today and the the
other path is we ignore history we

other path is we ignore history we

other path is we ignore history we
ignore facts we know what's going on we

ignore facts we know what's going on we
 

511
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,389
ignore facts we know what's going on we
can derive from some

right now and both are false both of

right now and both are false both of

00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,590
right now and both are false both of
those views in my view are false

those views in my view are false
 

519
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,949
those views in my view are false
and uh you know i'm rand and i i reject

00:09:16,949 --> 00:09:16,959
and uh you know i'm rand and i i reject
 

521

uh uh both of those views and i think
 

523
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,350
uh uh both of those views and i think
the better thinkers of the enlightenment

524
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:21,360
the better thinkers of the enlightenment
 

525
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,509
the better thinkers of the enlightenment
did as well although they sometimes fall

did as well although they sometimes fall
 

527
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,190
did as well although they sometimes fall

rationalists and yom and i uh agree on

rationalists and yom and i uh agree on
 

531
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,110
rationalists and yom and i uh agree on
one thing and that is that kant is is is

532
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:31,120
one thing and that is that kant is is is
 

533
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,389
one thing and that is that kant is is is
one of uh

00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:33,760
you know we've we've we've talked about
 

537
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,310
you know we've we've we've talked about
this in the past alex but we both hate

538
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:36,320
this in the past alex but we both hate
 

539
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,630
this in the past alex but we both hate
cons we both think kant is

540
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:38,640
cons we both think kant is
 

541
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,269
cons we both think kant is
is i at least think kant is probably the

542
00:09:41,269 --> 00:09:41,279
is i at least think kant is probably the
 

543
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,990
is i at least think kant is probably the
the most destructive philosopher

544
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:44,000
the most destructive philosopher
 

545
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,750
the most destructive philosopher
uh since plato

546
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:45,760
uh since plato
 

547
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,910
uh since plato
uh who is pretty destructive himself but

548
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:47,920
uh who is pretty destructive himself but
 

549
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,870
uh who is pretty destructive himself but
um

550
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:48,880
um
 

551
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,630
um
and part of the problem is that kant

552
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:50,640
and part of the problem is that kant
 

553
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,110
and part of the problem is that kant
divorces reason from reality that is he

reason from experience because we don't

00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:57,760
reason from experience because we don't
 

559
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,350
reason from experience because we don't
have direct experience of reality

according to cartwright we we're we're

according to cartwright we we're we're
 

563
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,590
according to cartwright we we're we're

00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:03,600
removed from that direct experience but

i i view kant as the anti-enlightenment
that is i view khan's as the destroyer

the the ultimate but but i i think
 

583
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,630
the the ultimate but but i i think
that's a mistake i think both russo

that's a mistake i think both russo
 

585
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,590
that's a mistake i think both russo
and kant uh fundamentally the goal the

and kant uh fundamentally the goal the

00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,550
indictment
so my view is neither of those options

592
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:32,560
so my view is neither of those options
 

593
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,750
so my view is neither of those options
are the right option that is uh the true

are the right option that is uh the true

reason based reason is not divorce from
 

597
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:39,990
reason based reason is not divorce from

00:10:43,269 --> 00:10:43,279
is a tool it's a faculty of identifying
 

601
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:44,949
is a tool it's a faculty of identifying
and integrating

602
00:10:44,949 --> 00:10:44,959
and integrating
 

603
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:46,949
and integrating
what it's identifying integrating the

00:10:46,949 --> 00:10:46,959
what it's identifying integrating the
 

605
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:48,870
what it's identifying integrating the
facts of reality as

606
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:48,880
facts of reality as
 

607
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,269
facts of reality as
as as as we know them through

00:10:51,269 --> 00:10:51,279
as as as we know them through
 

609
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,350
as as as we know them through
sense perception or through the study of

610
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:53,360
sense perception or through the study of
 

611
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,590
sense perception or through the study of
history through what actually happened

612

history through what actually happened
 

613
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,910
history through what actually happened
so it's the integration of those facts

614
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:57,920
so it's the integration of those facts
 

615
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,310
so it's the integration of those facts
it's the knowledge of that history and

616
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:00,320
it's the knowledge of that history and
 

617
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,949
it's the knowledge of that history and
then what we do is we abstract away

618
00:11:02,949 --> 00:11:02,959
then what we do is we abstract away
 

619
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:05,269
then what we do is we abstract away
principles based on what's worked in the

different paths different actions we
 

627
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:13,190
different paths different actions we
abstract away principles that then can

better based on what they know about the
 

663
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,430
better based on what they know about the
past and what they know about the

664
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:45,440
past and what they know about the
 

665
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,030
past and what they know about the
president what's the difference between

666
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:47,040
president what's the difference between
 

667
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,910
president what's the difference between
studying history

668
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:49,920
studying history
 

669
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,750
studying history
on a journey of reason

670
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:51,760
on a journey of reason
 

671
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,509
on a journey of reason
and tradition

672
00:11:53,509 --> 00:11:53,519
and tradition
 

673
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,430
and tradition
so you mentioned that burke understood

674
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:55,440
so you mentioned that burke understood
 

675
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,110
so you mentioned that burke understood
that reason begins with inherited

676
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:57,120
that reason begins with inherited
 

677
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,269
that reason begins with inherited
tradition yesterday so what's the

678
00:11:59,269 --> 00:11:59,279
tradition yesterday so what's the
 

679
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,509
tradition yesterday so what's the
difference between studying history but

680
00:12:01,509 --> 00:12:01,519
difference between studying history but
 

681
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:04,790
difference between studying history but
then being free to go any way you want

682
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:04,800
then being free to go any way you want
 

683

and
 

685
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,269
and
tradition where it feels more

686
00:12:09,269 --> 00:12:09,279
tradition where it feels more
 

687
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,269
tradition where it feels more
um not i don't want to say a negative

688
00:12:11,269 --> 00:12:11,279
um not i don't want to say a negative
 

689
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:14,310
um not i don't want to say a negative
term like burden but it's uh

690
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:14,320
term like burden but it's uh
 

691
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,230
term like burden but it's uh
there's more of a momentum that forces

692
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:16,240
there's more of a momentum that forces
 

693
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,629
there's more of a momentum that forces
you to go the same way as your ancestors

694
00:12:18,629 --> 00:12:18,639
you to go the same way as your ancestors
 

695
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,790
you to go the same way as your ancestors
it's the recognition that people are

696
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:20,800
it's the recognition that people are
 

697
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,990
it's the recognition that people are
wrong

698
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:22,000
wrong
 

699
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,550

often are wrong and parents

700
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:24,560
often are wrong and parents
 

701
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,310
often are wrong and parents
including your parents including your

your teachers including everybody
 

705
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,150
your teachers including everybody
everybody is potentially wrong

everybody is potentially wrong
 

707
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,870
everybody is potentially wrong
and that that you can't accept anybody

708
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:32,880
and that that you can't accept anybody
 

709
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,629

just because they happen to come before
 

711
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:37,269
just because they happen to come before
you uh that is you have to evaluate and

712
00:12:37,269 --> 00:12:37,279
you uh that is you have to evaluate and
 

713
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:38,550
you uh that is you have to evaluate and
judge and you have to have a standard by

714
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:38,560
judge and you have to have a standard by
 

715
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,069
judge and you have to have a standard by
which they're valued and judged the

716
00:12:40,069 --> 00:12:40,079
which they're valued and judged the
 

717
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:41,829
which they're valued and judged the
actions of those who came before you

718
00:12:41,829 --> 00:12:41,839
actions of those who came before you
 

719
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:43,269
actions of those who came before you
whether they are

720
00:12:43,269 --> 00:12:43,279
whether they are
 

721
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:45,750
whether they are
your parents whether they are the state

722
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:45,760
your parents whether they are the state
 

723
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,509
your parents whether they are the state
in which you happen to be born whether

724
00:12:47,509 --> 00:12:47,519
in which you happen to be born whether

00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:48,470
in which you happen to be born whether
they are

00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:48,480
they are
 

727
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,910
they are
somebody on the other side of planet

728
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:49,920
somebody on the other side of planet
 

729
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,790

earth
 

731
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,470

you can judge them if you have a

732
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:52,480
you can judge them if you have a
 

733
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,069
you can judge them if you have a
standard now my standard and i think the

734
00:12:54,069 --> 00:12:54,079
standard now my standard and i think the
 

735
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:56,550
standard now my standard and i think the
right standard is human well-being that

736
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:56,560
right standard is human well-being that
 

737
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,269
right standard is human well-being that
is

738
00:12:57,269 --> 00:12:57,279
is
 

739
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:59,670
is
that which is good for human beings

740
00:12:59,670 --> 00:12:59,680
that which is good for human beings
 

741
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,389
that which is good for human beings
human beings uh you know is is the

742
00:13:02,389 --> 00:13:02,399
human beings uh you know is is the
 

743
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:05,030
human beings uh you know is is the
standard by which we judge i can say

744
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:05,040
standard by which we judge i can say
 

745
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,750
standard by which we judge i can say
that certain periods of history were bad

746
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:07,760
that certain periods of history were bad
 

747
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,269
that certain periods of history were bad
they happened it's important to study

748
00:13:09,269 --> 00:13:09,279
they happened it's important to study
 

749
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:10,949
they happened it's important to study
them it's important to understand what

750
00:13:10,949 --> 00:13:10,959
them it's important to understand what
 

751
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:13,030
them it's important to understand what
they did that made them bad so we cannot

752
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:13,040
they did that made them bad so we cannot
 

753
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,350
they did that made them bad so we cannot
do that again and i can say certain

754
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:15,360
do that again and i can say certain
 

755
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,110
do that again and i can say certain
cultures certain periods in time were

756
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:17,120
cultures certain periods in time were
 

757
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,110
cultures certain periods in time were
good why because they promoted

758
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:19,120
good why because they promoted
 

759
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,110
good why because they promoted
human well-being and human flourishing

760
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:21,120
human well-being and human flourishing
 

761
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,870
human well-being and human flourishing
that's the standard then derive from

762
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:22,880
that's the standard then derive from
 

763
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,310
that's the standard then derive from
that okay what is it that made a

764
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:24,320
that okay what is it that made a
 

765
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,670
that okay what is it that made a
particular culture

766
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:25,680
particular culture
 

767
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,949
particular culture
good what is it that made that

768
00:13:26,949 --> 00:13:26,959
good what is it that made that
 

769
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:28,389
good what is it that made that
particular culture

770
00:13:28,389 --> 00:13:28,399
particular culture
 

771
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:29,910
particular culture
positive in terms of human well-being

772
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:29,920
positive in terms of human well-being
 

773
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,069
positive in terms of human well-being
and human flourishing what made this bad

774
00:13:32,069 --> 00:13:32,079
and human flourishing what made this bad
 

775
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:33,990
and human flourishing what made this bad
and hopefully from that i can derive a

776
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:34,000
and hopefully from that i can derive a
 

777
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,470
and hopefully from that i can derive a
principle okay if i want human

778
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:36,480
principle okay if i want human
 

779
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,829
principle okay if i want human
flourishing and human well-being in the

780
00:13:37,829 --> 00:13:37,839
flourishing and human well-being in the
 

781
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:40,069
flourishing and human well-being in the
future i want to be more like these guys

782
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:40,079
future i want to be more like these guys
 

783
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:42,550
future i want to be more like these guys
unless those guys i want to derive what

784
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:42,560
unless those guys i want to derive what
 

785
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,310
unless those guys i want to derive what
is the principle that will guide me in

786
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:44,320
is the principle that will guide me in
 

787
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,150
is the principle that will guide me in
the future that's i think how human

788
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:46,160
the future that's i think how human
 

789
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,150
the future that's i think how human
knowledge ultimately develops i think

790
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:48,160
knowledge ultimately develops i think
 

791
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,870
knowledge ultimately develops i think
people often make a mistake just

792
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:50,880
people often make a mistake just
 

793
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,230
people often make a mistake just
i'm not saying you're wrong but lots of

794
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:52,240
i'm not saying you're wrong but lots of
 

795
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,910
i'm not saying you're wrong but lots of
people you know don't actually read the

796
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:53,920
people you know don't actually read the
 

797
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,230
people you know don't actually read the
original sources and so what happens is

798
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:56,240
original sources and so what happens is
 

799
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,550
original sources and so what happens is
uh people will attack conservatives

800
00:13:58,550 --> 00:13:58,560
uh people will attack conservatives
 

801
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,550
uh people will attack conservatives
assuming that conservatives think that

802
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:00,560
assuming that conservatives think that
 

803
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,629
assuming that conservatives think that
whatever comes from the past is right

804
00:14:02,629 --> 00:14:02,639
whatever comes from the past is right
 

805
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:05,030
whatever comes from the past is right
and actually it's it it's very difficult

806
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:05,040
and actually it's it it's very difficult
 

807
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,629
and actually it's it it's very difficult
to find a thinker who actually says

808
00:14:06,629 --> 00:14:06,639
to find a thinker who actually says
 

809
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:09,110
to find a thinker who actually says
something like that the the selden or

810
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:09,120
something like that the the selden or
 

811
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,269
something like that the the selden or
burke the big the the big conservative

812
00:14:11,269 --> 00:14:11,279
burke the big the the big conservative
 

813
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:13,670
burke the big the the big conservative
theorists uh hooker they're they're all

814
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:13,680
theorists uh hooker they're they're all
 

815
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,870
theorists uh hooker they're they're all
people who

816
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:14,880
people who
 

817
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,110
people who
understand that the tradition

818
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:17,120
understand that the tradition
 

819
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,350
understand that the tradition
uh carries with it mistakes that were

820
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:19,360
uh carries with it mistakes that were
 

821
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,710
uh carries with it mistakes that were
made in the past

822
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:20,720
made in the past
 

823
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,269
made in the past
and uh and this is actually i think an

824
00:14:23,269 --> 00:14:23,279
and uh and this is actually i think an
 

825
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,910
and uh and this is actually i think an
important part of of their empiricism

826
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:25,920
important part of of their empiricism
 

827
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,069
important part of of their empiricism
is that they see the search for truth as

828
00:14:28,069 --> 00:14:28,079
is that they see the search for truth as
 

829
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:30,710
is that they see the search for truth as
something a society does by trial and

830
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:30,720
something a society does by trial and
 

831
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,470
something a society does by trial and
error and what that means is that in any

832
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:32,480
error and what that means is that in any
 

833
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,990
error and what that means is that in any
given moment

834
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:34,000
given moment
 

835
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,389
given moment
you have to be aware of the possibility

836
00:14:36,389 --> 00:14:36,399
you have to be aware of the possibility
 

837
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:38,230
you have to be aware of the possibility
that things that you've inherited are

838
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:38,240
that things that you've inherited are
 

839
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,030
that things that you've inherited are
actually false and the job of the

840
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:41,040
actually false and the job of the
 

841
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,269
actually false and the job of the
political thinker or the jurist or the

842
00:14:43,269 --> 00:14:43,279
political thinker or the jurist or the
 

843
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:45,269
political thinker or the jurist or the
the the philosopher

844
00:14:45,269 --> 00:14:45,279
the the philosopher
 

845
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:47,030
the the philosopher
is not to dig in and say you know

846
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:47,040
is not to dig in and say you know
 

847
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,550
is not to dig in and say you know
whatever it is that we've inherited is

848
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:48,560
whatever it is that we've inherited is
 

849
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,590
whatever it is that we've inherited is
right

850
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:49,600
right
 

851
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,870
right
the the job is to look at uh the society

852
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:52,880
the the job is to look at uh the society
 

853
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,790
the the job is to look at uh the society
as a whole and say look we we have this

854
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:54,800
as a whole and say look we we have this
 

855
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,990
as a whole and say look we we have this
job of

856
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:56,000
job of
 

857
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,910
job of
first of all first of all conservation

858
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:57,920
first of all first of all conservation
 

859
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,750
first of all first of all conservation
just making sure that we don't lose good

860
00:14:59,750 --> 00:14:59,760
just making sure that we don't lose good
 

861
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,590
just making sure that we don't lose good
things that we've had and and second

862
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:01,600
things that we've had and and second
 

863
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,269
things that we've had and and second
seeing if we can repair things in order

864
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:03,279
seeing if we can repair things in order
 

865
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:04,310
seeing if we can repair things in order
to

866
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:04,320
to
 

867
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,069
to
to improve them where it's necessary or

868
00:15:06,069 --> 00:15:06,079
to improve them where it's necessary or
 

869
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:07,590
to improve them where it's necessary or
where it's possible

870
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:07,600
where it's possible
 

871
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,990
where it's possible
and that process is actually a creative

872
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:10,000
and that process is actually a creative
 

873
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,990
and that process is actually a creative
process this is a way in which i think

874
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:12,000
process this is a way in which i think
 

875
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,470
process this is a way in which i think
it is similar to euron's philosophy that

876
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:14,480
it is similar to euron's philosophy that
 

877
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,310
it is similar to euron's philosophy that
you take the inherited

878
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:16,320
you take the inherited
 

879
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,829
you take the inherited
uh tradition

880
00:15:17,829 --> 00:15:17,839
uh tradition
 

881
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:20,069
uh tradition
and you look for way that you can shape

882
00:15:20,069 --> 00:15:20,079
and you look for way that you can shape
 

883
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:22,710
and you look for way that you can shape
it in order to make it something uh

884
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:22,720
it in order to make it something uh
 

885
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,470
it in order to make it something uh
better than it was

886
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:24,480
better than it was
 

887
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,790
better than it was
that's that's a that's a baseline for

888
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:26,800
that's that's a that's a baseline for
 

889
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,110
that's that's a that's a baseline for
for what we call conservatism yes the

890
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:29,120
for what we call conservatism yes the
 

891
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,509
for what we call conservatism yes the
comments of the trial and error

892
00:15:31,509 --> 00:15:31,519
comments of the trial and error
 

893
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:33,749
comments of the trial and error
the errors is uh you're proud of the

894
00:15:33,749 --> 00:15:33,759
the errors is uh you're proud of the
 

895
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:34,870
the errors is uh you're proud of the
errors

896
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:34,880
errors
 

897
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,509
errors
it's a feature not a bug so the you

898
00:15:37,509 --> 00:15:37,519
it's a feature not a bug so the you
 

899
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:38,870
it's a feature not a bug so the you
mentioned trial and error a few times

900
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:38,880
mentioned trial and error a few times
 

901
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,230
mentioned trial and error a few times
yesterday it's a really interesting kind

902
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:40,240
yesterday it's a really interesting kind
 

903
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,269
yesterday it's a really interesting kind
of idea

904
00:15:41,269 --> 00:15:41,279
of idea
 

905
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,670
of idea
it's basically accepting that the

906
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:43,680
it's basically accepting that the
 

907
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,550
it's basically accepting that the
journey is going to have flaws as

908
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:46,560
journey is going to have flaws as
 

909
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,990
journey is going to have flaws as
opposed to saying

910
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:48,000
opposed to saying
 

911
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,829
opposed to saying
i mean the uh

912
00:15:49,829 --> 00:15:49,839
i mean the uh
 

913
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:51,590
i mean the uh
the conclusion there is the current

914
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:51,600
the conclusion there is the current
 

915
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,829
the conclusion there is the current
system is flawed and it will always be

916
00:15:53,829 --> 00:15:53,839
system is flawed and it will always be
 

917
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:55,350
system is flawed and it will always be
flawed

918
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:55,360
flawed
 

919
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,430
flawed
and you try to improve it when you

920
00:15:57,430 --> 00:15:57,440
and you try to improve it when you
 

921
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,189
and you try to improve it when you
listen to iran talk there's much more of

922
00:16:01,189 --> 00:16:01,199
listen to iran talk there's much more of
 

923
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:04,069
listen to iran talk there's much more of
optimism for the system being

924
00:16:04,069 --> 00:16:04,079
optimism for the system being
 

925
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:05,910
optimism for the system being
perfect

926
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:05,920
perfect
 

927
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,470
perfect
now or potentially soon or could be

928
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:08,480
now or potentially soon or could be
 

929
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,949
now or potentially soon or could be
perfect and to me the way i heard it is

930
00:16:10,949 --> 00:16:10,959
perfect and to me the way i heard it is
 

931
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:12,230
perfect and to me the way i heard it is
almost like

932
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:12,240
almost like
 

933
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,350
almost like
accepting that the system is flawed and

934
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:15,360
accepting that the system is flawed and
 

935
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,670
accepting that the system is flawed and
through trial and error will improve

936
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:17,680
through trial and error will improve
 

937
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,790
through trial and error will improve
and

938
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:18,800
and
 

939
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,550
and
uh euron says

940
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:20,560
uh euron says
 

941
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,590
uh euron says
no

942
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:21,600
no
 

943
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,509
no
we can have

944
00:16:23,509 --> 00:16:23,519
we can have
 

945
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,590
we can have
a perfection now

946
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:25,600
a perfection now
 

947
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,150
a perfection now
that's why it sounds to me yeah yeah and

948
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:28,160
that's why it sounds to me yeah yeah and
 

949
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,590
that's why it sounds to me yeah yeah and
i think that's right i think the

950
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:29,600
i think that's right i think the
 

951
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,949
i think that's right i think the
difference is that

952
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:30,959
difference is that
 

953
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:33,189
difference is that
at some points just like in science i

954
00:16:33,189 --> 00:16:33,199
at some points just like in science i
 

955
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:34,069
at some points just like in science i
think

956
00:16:34,069 --> 00:16:34,079
think
 

957
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:37,590
think
one can stop the trial and error and say

958
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:37,600
one can stop the trial and error and say
 

959
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,590
one can stop the trial and error and say
i can now see a pattern here i i can see

960
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:41,600
i can now see a pattern here i i can see
 

961
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,350
i can now see a pattern here i i can see
you know that that certain actions lead

962
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:43,360
you know that that certain actions lead
 

963
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,590
you know that that certain actions lead
to bad consequences certain actions lead

964
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:45,600
to bad consequences certain actions lead
 

965
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,310
to bad consequences certain actions lead
to good consequences let me try to let

966
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:48,320
to good consequences let me try to let
 

967
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,710
to good consequences let me try to let
me try to abstract away what is it that

968
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:50,720
me try to abstract away what is it that
 

969
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,350
me try to abstract away what is it that
is good and what is it that are bad

970
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:53,360
is good and what is it that are bad
 

971
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,350
is good and what is it that are bad
and build a system around what is good

972
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:55,360
and build a system around what is good
 

973
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,430
and build a system around what is good
and and reject what is bad i i think

974
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:57,440
and and reject what is bad i i think
 

975
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,790
and and reject what is bad i i think
ultimately if you if you read the

976
00:16:58,790 --> 00:16:58,800
ultimately if you if you read the
 

977
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,990
ultimately if you if you read the
founding fathers and whether we call

978
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:00,000
founding fathers and whether we call
 

979
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,910
founding fathers and whether we call
them conservatives individuals

980
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:01,920
them conservatives individuals
 

981
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,509
them conservatives individuals
what the founding fathers actually did

982
00:17:03,509 --> 00:17:03,519
what the founding fathers actually did
 

983
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:05,029
what the founding fathers actually did
all of them i think is study history

984
00:17:05,029 --> 00:17:05,039
all of them i think is study history
 

985
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:06,949
all of them i think is study history
they all did they all talk about history

986
00:17:06,949 --> 00:17:06,959
they all did they all talk about history
 

987
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,789
they all did they all talk about history
they'll talk about examples of other

988
00:17:08,789 --> 00:17:08,799
they'll talk about examples of other
 

989
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:10,150
they'll talk about examples of other

cultures whether it's
 

991
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,429
cultures whether it's
uh whether they go back to uh uh to the

00:17:13,429 --> 00:17:13,439
uh whether they go back to uh uh to the
 

993
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:15,429
uh whether they go back to uh uh to the
republic in venice or back to the

994
00:17:15,429 --> 00:17:15,439
republic in venice or back to the
 

995
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:17,429
republic in venice or back to the
ancient greeks so

996
00:17:17,429 --> 00:17:17,439
ancient greeks so
 

997
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:19,029
ancient greeks so
they they studied these they they

998
00:17:19,029 --> 00:17:19,039
they they studied these they they
 

999
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,949
they they studied these they they
learned lessons from them they they try

1000
00:17:20,949 --> 00:17:20,959
learned lessons from them they they try
 

1001
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:22,630
learned lessons from them they they try
to figure out what has worked in the

1002
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:22,640
to figure out what has worked in the
 

1003
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,150
to figure out what has worked in the
past and what hasn't and tried to drive

1004
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:24,160
past and what hasn't and tried to drive
 

1005
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,230
past and what hasn't and tried to drive
principles now in my view

1006
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:26,240
principles now in my view
 

1007
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,470
principles now in my view
they got pretty close to what i would

1008
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:28,480
they got pretty close to what i would
 

1009
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,590
they got pretty close to what i would
consider

1010
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:29,600
consider
 

1011
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,110
consider
kind of an ideal

1012
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:31,120
kind of an ideal
 

1013
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,110
kind of an ideal
but they didn't get it completely right

1014
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:33,120
but they didn't get it completely right
 

1015
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,270
but they didn't get it completely right
and and here we sit 200 something years

1016
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:35,280
and and here we sit 200 something years
 

1017
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,669
and and here we sit 200 something years
after uh the declaration and after the

1018
00:17:37,669 --> 00:17:37,679
after uh the declaration and after the
 

1019
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:39,110
after uh the declaration and after the
constitution i think we can look back

1020
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:39,120
constitution i think we can look back
 

1021
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,950
constitution i think we can look back
and say okay well what did they get

1022
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:40,960
and say okay well what did they get
 

1023
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,110
and say okay well what did they get
right what did they get wrong based on

1024
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:43,120
right what did they get wrong based on
 

1025
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,430
right what did they get wrong based on
how is it done and and where the flaws

1026
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:45,440
how is it done and and where the flaws
 

1027
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,750
how is it done and and where the flaws
and where the and we can improve on it

1028
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:47,760
and where the and we can improve on it
 

1029
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,830
and where the and we can improve on it
um i think we can get closer to

1030
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:49,840
um i think we can get closer to
 

1031
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:54,310
um i think we can get closer to
perfection um and uh and and based on

1032
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:54,320
perfection um and uh and and based on
 

1033
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,630
perfection um and uh and and based on
those kind of observations based on that

1034
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:56,640
those kind of observations based on that
 

1035
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,470
those kind of observations based on that
kind of abstraction that kind of

1036
00:17:58,470 --> 00:17:58,480
kind of abstraction that kind of
 

1037
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,590
kind of abstraction that kind of
discovery of what is true just like

1038
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:01,600
discovery of what is true just like
 

1039
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,430
discovery of what is true just like
at some point you do the experiments you

1040
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:03,440
at some point you do the experiments you
 

1041
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,110
at some point you do the experiments you
do the trial and error and now you come

1042
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:05,120
do the trial and error and now you come
 

1043
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,590
do the trial and error and now you come
up with a scientific principle it it is

1044
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:07,600
up with a scientific principle it it is
 

1045
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,190
up with a scientific principle it it is
true that 100 years later you might

1046
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:09,200
true that 100 years later you might
 

1047
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,190
true that 100 years later you might
discover that hey i missed something

1048
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:11,200
discover that hey i missed something
 

1049
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,789
discover that hey i missed something
there's something uh

1050
00:18:12,789 --> 00:18:12,799
there's something uh
 

1051
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:15,110
there's something uh
but to not

1052
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:15,120
but to not
 

1053
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,950
but to not
take the full lesson

1054
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:16,960
take the full lesson
 

1055
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,590
take the full lesson
to insist on incrementalism to insist on

1056
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:19,600
to insist on incrementalism to insist on
 

1057
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,789
to insist on incrementalism to insist on
we're just going to tinker with the

1058
00:18:20,789 --> 00:18:20,799
we're just going to tinker with the
 

1059
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,549
we're just going to tinker with the
system instead of saying no there's

1060
00:18:22,549 --> 00:18:22,559
system instead of saying no there's
 

1061
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,230
system instead of saying no there's
something really wrong

1062
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:24,240
something really wrong
 

1063
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,990
something really wrong
with having a king there's something

1064
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:26,000
with having a king there's something
 

1065
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,350
with having a king there's something
really wrong with

1066
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:27,360
really wrong with
 

1067
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,070
really wrong with
uh not having any representation or

1068
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:30,080
uh not having any representation or
 

1069
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,950
uh not having any representation or
whatever the the standard it needs to be

1070
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:32,960
whatever the the standard it needs to be
 

1071
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,669
whatever the the standard it needs to be
i in the name of we don't want to move

1072
00:18:35,669 --> 00:18:35,679
i in the name of we don't want to move
 

1073
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:37,590
i in the name of we don't want to move
too fast i think is a mistake and the

1074
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:37,600
too fast i think is a mistake and the
 

1075
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,070
too fast i think is a mistake and the
problem with trial and error in

1076
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:40,080
problem with trial and error in
 

1077
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,830
problem with trial and error in
politics

1078
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:41,840
politics
 

1079
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:42,950
politics
is that

1080
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:42,960
is that
 

1081
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,870
is that
we're talking about human life right so

1082
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:44,880
we're talking about human life right so
 

1083
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,230
we're talking about human life right so
so there was a big

1084
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:46,240
so there was a big
 

1085
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,270
so there was a big
trial

1086
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:47,280
trial
 

1087
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,950
trial
around communism

1088
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:48,960
around communism
 

1089
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,789
around communism
and you know 100 million people paid the

1090
00:18:50,789 --> 00:18:50,799
and you know 100 million people paid the
 

1091
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:52,549
and you know 100 million people paid the
price for the trial

1092
00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:52,559
price for the trial
 

1093
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,150
price for the trial
i could have told them in advance as did

1094
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:54,160
i could have told them in advance as did
 

1095
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,470
i could have told them in advance as did
many people that it would not work there

1096
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:56,480
many people that it would not work there
 

1097
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,909
many people that it would not work there
are principles of human nature

1098
00:18:57,909 --> 00:18:57,919
are principles of human nature
 

1099
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,909
are principles of human nature
principles of that we can study from

1100
00:18:59,909 --> 00:18:59,919
principles of that we can study from
 

1101
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:02,789
principles of that we can study from
history principles about economics and

1102
00:19:02,789 --> 00:19:02,799
history principles about economics and
 

1103
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:04,549
history principles about economics and
and other aspects well we know it's not

1104
00:19:04,549 --> 00:19:04,559
and other aspects well we know it's not
 

1105
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:05,590
and other aspects well we know it's not
going to work you don't need to try it

1106
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:05,600
going to work you don't need to try it
 

1107
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,230
going to work you don't need to try it
again you know we've had communal

1108
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:08,240
again you know we've had communal
 

1109
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,070
again you know we've had communal
arrangements throughout history there

1110
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:10,080
arrangements throughout history there
 

1111
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,310
arrangements throughout history there
was an experiment with fascism and and

1112
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:12,320
was an experiment with fascism and and
 

1113
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,830
was an experiment with fascism and and
they've been experiments with all kinds

1114
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:13,840
they've been experiments with all kinds
 

1115
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:17,029
they've been experiments with all kinds
of political systems okay we we've done

1116
00:19:17,029 --> 00:19:17,039
of political systems okay we we've done
 

1117
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:18,789
of political systems okay we we've done
them sad that we did them because many

1118
00:19:18,789 --> 00:19:18,799
them sad that we did them because many
 

1119
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:20,470
them sad that we did them because many
of us knew they wouldn't work

1120
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:20,480
of us knew they wouldn't work
 

1121
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,789
of us knew they wouldn't work
we should learn the lesson and i think

1122
00:19:22,789 --> 00:19:22,799
we should learn the lesson and i think
 

1123
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:25,510
we should learn the lesson and i think
that all of history now converges on one

1124
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:25,520
that all of history now converges on one
 

1125
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,310
that all of history now converges on one
lesson and that is what we need to do is

1126
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:28,320
lesson and that is what we need to do is
 

1127
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,990
lesson and that is what we need to do is
build systems that protect individual

1128
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:30,000
build systems that protect individual
 

1129
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,230
build systems that protect individual
freedom that is the core that's what

1130
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:32,240
freedom that is the core that's what
 

1131
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,669
freedom that is the core that's what
ultimately leads to human flourishing

1132
00:19:33,669 --> 00:19:33,679
ultimately leads to human flourishing
 

1133
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:36,150
ultimately leads to human flourishing
and human success and and and human

1134
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:36,160
and human success and and and human
 

1135
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,230
and human success and and and human
achievement and to the extent that we

1136
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:38,240
achievement and to the extent that we
 

1137
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,830
achievement and to the extent that we
place anything above that individual

1138
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:39,840
place anything above that individual
 

1139
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,270
place anything above that individual

00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,510
kind of as a as a benchmark you'll also
maybe define rationalism

1206
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:49,520
maybe define rationalism

yeah these are two terms that are in

uh compared to one another your own said
that it's an uh that it's a false

that it's an uh that it's a false
 

1217
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,789
that it's an uh that it's a false
dichotomy and and maybe it is a bit

1218
00:21:02,789 --> 00:21:02,799
dichotomy and and maybe it is a bit
 

1219
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:04,230
dichotomy and and maybe it is a bit
exaggerated but that doesn't mean it's

1220
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:04,240
exaggerated but that doesn't mean it's
 

1221
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,789
exaggerated but that doesn't mean it's
not useful for for conceptualizing the

not useful for for conceptualizing the

you take a look at the histories that we

you take a look at the histories that we
have they're not reliable you take a

have they're not reliable you take a
 

1249
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,470
have they're not reliable you take a

very good his baseline is to look
 

1255
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,990
very good his baseline is to look
very critically at the past and say

1256
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:40,000
very critically at the past and say
 

1257
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,549
very critically at the past and say
look i'm evaluating it i i think all in

1258
00:21:42,549 --> 00:21:42,559
look i'm evaluating it i i think all in
 

1259
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:44,390
look i'm evaluating it i i think all in
all it's just not worth very much

we can't learn anything the way that
descartes said i mean there is nothing

1308
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:36,960
descartes said i mean there is nothing
 

1309
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,710
descartes said i mean there is nothing
that's that self-evident and that

1310
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:38,720
that's that self-evident and that
 

1311
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,270
that's that self-evident and that
infallible so so

1312

which is we're going to take a look at

1326
00:22:58,070 --> 00:22:58,080
which is we're going to take a look at
 

1327
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,270
which is we're going to take a look at
human nature at the nature of societies

human nature we're going to try to
 

1331
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,390
human nature we're going to try to
abstract towards

1332
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:04,400
abstract towards
 

1333
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,390

societies we're going to try to do the
 

1337
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:10,230
societies we're going to try to do the
same thing and from there we get you

1338
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:10,240
same thing and from there we get you
 

1339
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,149

recognizing that are some axioms there's
 

1415
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,950
recognizing that are some axioms there's

axioms and based on these empirical
 

1429
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:36,630

evidence we can come to truths

evidence we can come to truths
 

1431
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,310
evidence we can come to truths
just again like we do in science we have

1432
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:38,320
just again like we do in science we have
 

1433
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,909
just again like we do in science we have
certain axioms scientific axioms we have

1434
00:24:39,909 --> 00:24:39,919
certain axioms scientific axioms we have
 

1435
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:41,590
certain axioms scientific axioms we have
certain experiments that we want and

1436
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:41,600
certain experiments that we want and
 

1437
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,430
certain experiments that we want and
then we can come to some identification

1438
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:43,440
then we can come to some identification
 

1439
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,669
then we can come to some identification
of a truth and that truth is always

1440
00:24:45,669 --> 00:24:45,679
of a truth and that truth is always
 

1441
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:46,630
of a truth and that truth is always
going to be challenged by new

1442
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:46,640
going to be challenged by new
 

1443
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,510
going to be challenged by new
information by new knowledge but as long

1444
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:49,520
information by new knowledge but as long
 

1445
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,990
information by new knowledge but as long
as that's what we know that is the that

00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:52,000
as that's what we know that is the that
 

1447
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,149
as that's what we know that is the that
that is what true so truth is contextual

1448
00:24:54,149 --> 00:24:54,159
that is what true so truth is contextual
 

1449
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,669
that is what true so truth is contextual
in the sense that it's contextual it's

conclusion of truth is high so you'd
 

1469
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:13,909
conclusion of truth is high so you'd

1473
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,990

00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:53,600
that's the problem right and then to you
 

1913
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,909
that's the problem right and then to you
you're on the whole step one is the

00:32:55,909 --> 00:32:55,919
you're on the whole step one is the
 

1915
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:58,149
you're on the whole step one is the
problem well it's all a problem b first

2108
00:36:11,109 --> 00:36:11,119
you know ultimately there's very little
 

2109
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:12,790
you know ultimately there's very little
competition there's very little

2110
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:12,800
competition there's very little
 

2111
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,470
competition there's very little
innovation and this is the problem we

2112
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:14,480
innovation and this is the problem we
 

2113
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,910
innovation and this is the problem we
have today in american education which

2114
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:15,920
have today in american education which
 

2115
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,829
have today in american education which
we can get to is there's no competition

2116
00:36:17,829 --> 00:36:17,839
we can get to is there's no competition
 

2117
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:19,750
we can get to is there's no competition
and no innovation we have one

2118
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:19,760
and no innovation we have one
 

2119
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,589
and no innovation we have one
standard fit all and then we have

2120
00:36:21,589 --> 00:36:21,599
standard fit all and then we have
 

2121
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:23,109
standard fit all and then we have
conflicts about what should be taught

2122

3917
01:06:57,039 --> 01:06:59,589
i think the idea pursuit of happiness is
profound because it's a moral statement

profound because it's a moral statement

01:06:59,599 --> 01:07:01,589
profound because it's a moral statement
it's a statement that says that

their lives as they see fit based on how
they

3930
01:07:12,470 --> 01:07:12,480
they
 

3931
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:13,910
they
view happiness they might be right that

3932
01:07:13,910 --> 01:07:13,920
view happiness they might be right that
 

3933
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:15,510
view happiness they might be right that
might be wrong but we're not going to

3934
01:07:15,510 --> 01:07:15,520
might be wrong but we're not going to
 

3935
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:18,230
might be wrong but we're not going to
dictate what happiness entails and

3936
01:07:18,230 --> 01:07:18,240
dictate what happiness entails and
 

3937
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:19,750
dictate what happiness entails and
dictate to people how they should live

3938
01:07:19,750 --> 01:07:19,760

let them figure that out so it has this

3942
01:07:25,910 --> 01:07:25,920
let them figure that out so it has this
 

3943
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:28,390
let them figure that out so it has this
self-interested moral code kind of

3944
01:07:28,390 --> 01:07:28,400
self-interested moral code kind of
 

3945
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:30,069
self-interested moral code kind of
embedded in it so i think it's a it's a

3946
01:07:30,069 --> 01:07:30,079
embedded in it so i think it's a it's a
 

3947
01:07:30,079 --> 01:07:31,510
embedded in it so i think it's a it's a
beautiful statement so i think the

3948
01:07:31,510 --> 01:07:31,520
beautiful statement so i think the
 

3949
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:33,990
beautiful statement so i think the
declaration is key and i i i think there

3950
01:07:33,990 --> 01:07:34,000
declaration is key and i i i think there
 

3951
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,470
declaration is key and i i i think there
was an experiment and the experiment was

3952
01:07:36,470 --> 01:07:36,480
was an experiment and the experiment was

01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:37,430
was an experiment and the experiment was

uh in that period of of uh before the
 

3957
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:41,910
uh in that period of of uh before the
constitution where the experiment was

3958
01:07:41,910 --> 01:07:41,920
constitution where the experiment was
 

3959
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:44,309
constitution where the experiment was
let's let the states let's have a kind

3960
01:07:44,309 --> 01:07:44,319
let's let the states let's have a kind
 

3961
01:07:44,319 --> 01:07:46,710
let's let the states let's have a kind
of a loose confederation uh let's just

3962
01:07:46,710 --> 01:07:46,720
of a loose confederation uh let's just
 

3963
01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:49,109
of a loose confederation uh let's just
the states experiment with with setting

3964
01:07:49,109 --> 01:07:49,119
the states experiment with with setting
 

3965
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:50,870
the states experiment with with setting
up their own constitutions and role of

3966
01:07:50,870 --> 01:07:50,880
up their own constitutions and role of
 

3967
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:53,029
up their own constitutions and role of
government and we won't have any kind of

3968
01:07:53,029 --> 01:07:53,039
government and we won't have any kind of
 

3969
01:07:53,039 --> 01:07:55,829
government and we won't have any kind of
unity and i think what they realized

3970
01:07:55,829 --> 01:07:55,839
unity and i think what they realized
 

3971
01:07:55,839 --> 01:07:57,510
unity and i think what they realized
and i think even jefferson realized is

3972
01:07:57,510 --> 01:07:57,520
and i think even jefferson realized is
 

3973
01:07:57,520 --> 01:08:00,789
and i think even jefferson realized is
that that was not workable because

3974
01:08:00,789 --> 01:08:00,799
that that was not workable because
 

3975
01:08:00,799 --> 01:08:03,029
that that was not workable because
many of the states were starting to

01:08:03,039 --> 01:08:05,430
many of the states were starting to
significantly violate rights there was

significantly violate rights there was
nothing to unify there was nothing to

nothing to unify there was nothing to
 

3981
01:08:07,599 --> 01:08:10,230
nothing to unify there was nothing to

to it because i think it's too easy to
 

4049
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:22,149
to it because i think it's too easy to
interpret it as so i interpret it as

so what's good for the individual is
good for the common welfare but i

4060
01:09:30,870 --> 01:09:30,880
good for the common welfare but i
 

4061
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:33,030
good for the common welfare but i
understand that that is a that's

understand that that is a that's
 

4063
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:34,630
understand that that is a that's
something that is hard for people to

4064
01:09:34,630 --> 01:09:34,640
something that is hard for people to
 

4065
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:36,229
something that is hard for people to
grasp and and not the common

4066
01:09:36,229 --> 01:09:36,239
grasp and and not the common
 

4067
01:09:36,239 --> 01:09:38,630
grasp and and not the common
understanding so i was i i would have

4068
01:09:38,630 --> 01:09:38,640

01:09:40,550 --> 01:09:40,560
skipped the general welfare in order to
 

4071
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:42,309
skipped the general welfare in order to
avoid the fact that now the general

consistent with the the declaration with
a few exceptions the general welfare but

4088
01:09:56,229 --> 01:09:56,239
a few exceptions the general welfare but
 

4089

politically
 

4097
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:04,790
politically
but it's it's a magnificent document the

4098
01:10:04,790 --> 01:10:04,800
but it's it's a magnificent document the
 

4099
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:06,390
but it's it's a magnificent document the
constitution it doesn't quite rise to

4100
01:10:06,390 --> 01:10:06,400
constitution it doesn't quite rise to
 

4101
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:07,910
constitution it doesn't quite rise to
the level i think of the declaration but

it's a magnificent document
because

4106

because
you know and this is the difference i

4108
01:10:12,229 --> 01:10:12,239
you know and this is the difference i

difference
the difference is that the the

government regulation is there was that
was not listed as a right uh in the bill

was not listed as a right uh in the bill
 

4217
01:11:50,239 --> 01:11:52,070
was not listed as a right uh in the bill
even though i think it's clearly covered

4218
01:11:52,070 --> 01:11:52,080
even though i think it's clearly covered
 

4219
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:53,430
even though i think it's clearly covered
under the constitution and certainly

4220
01:11:53,430 --> 01:11:53,440
under the constitution and certainly
 

4221
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:55,270
under the constitution and certainly
under the declaration so there was a

4222
01:11:55,270 --> 01:11:55,280
under the declaration so there was a
 

4223
01:11:55,280 --> 01:11:56,550
under the declaration so there was a
massive mistake done in the bill of

4224
01:11:56,550 --> 01:11:56,560
massive mistake done in the bill of
 

4225
01:11:56,560 --> 01:11:58,229
massive mistake done in the bill of
rights they tried to

4226
01:11:58,229 --> 01:11:58,239
rights they tried to
 

4227
01:11:58,239 --> 01:11:59,830
rights they tried to
cover it with the ninth amendment but it

4228
01:11:59,830 --> 01:11:59,840
cover it with the ninth amendment but it
 

4229
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:03,430
cover it with the ninth amendment but it
never really stuck uh this idea that the

4230
01:12:03,430 --> 01:12:03,440
never really stuck uh this idea that the
 

4231
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:05,590
never really stuck uh this idea that the
non-enumerated rights that that are

4232
01:12:05,590 --> 01:12:05,600
non-enumerated rights that that are
 

4233
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:07,830
non-enumerated rights that that are
still in place so i don't see it as a

4234
01:12:07,830 --> 01:12:07,840
still in place so i don't see it as a
 

4235
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:09,350
still in place so i don't see it as a
second revolution i think it's it's a

4236
01:12:09,350 --> 01:12:09,360
second revolution i think it's it's a
 

4237
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:11,350
second revolution i think it's it's a
it's a it's a fix

01:12:11,350 --> 01:12:11,360
it's a it's a fix
 

4239
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:14,790
it's a it's a fix
to a flaw that happened it's a fix that

01:12:14,790 --> 01:12:14,800
to a flaw that happened it's a fix that
 

4241
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:16,390
to a flaw that happened it's a fix that
uh allowed

4242
01:12:16,390 --> 01:12:16,400

so can you maybe elaborate on
 

4659
01:19:15,679 --> 01:19:18,790
so can you maybe elaborate on
what is the role of cohesion and the

it features the state
 

4681
01:19:40,480 --> 01:19:42,550
it features the state
uh there isn't really a nation other

4682
01:19:42,550 --> 01:19:42,560
uh there isn't really a nation other
 

4683
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:45,430
uh there isn't really a nation other
than the the nation the people is as a

4684
01:19:45,430 --> 01:19:45,440
than the the nation the people is as a
 

4685

than the the nation the people is as a
collective is created by the state and

01:19:48,229 --> 01:19:48,239
collective is created by the state and
 

4687
01:19:48,239 --> 01:19:49,910
collective is created by the state and
when the state disappears then the

4688
01:19:49,910 --> 01:19:49,920
when the state disappears then the
 

4689
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:52,790
when the state disappears then the
collective disappears now i think that

4690
01:19:52,790 --> 01:19:52,800
collective disappears now i think that
 

4691
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:54,630
collective disappears now i think that
when conservatives

of all stripes
 

4695
01:19:56,320 --> 01:19:58,550
of all stripes
look at this kind of thinking that

01:19:58,550 --> 01:19:58,560
look at this kind of thinking that
 

4697
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:00,229
look at this kind of thinking that
there's the individuals and then there's

01:20:00,229 --> 01:20:00,239
there's the individuals and then there's

there's the individuals and then there's
the state

4700

the state
 

4701
01:20:01,440 --> 01:20:03,669
the state
and there really isn't anything else

4702
01:20:03,669 --> 01:20:03,679
and there really isn't anything else
 

4703
01:20:03,679 --> 01:20:05,350
and there really isn't anything else
when they look at that

4704
01:20:05,350 --> 01:20:05,360
when they look at that
 

4705
01:20:05,360 --> 01:20:06,390
when they look at that
they say

4706
01:20:06,390 --> 01:20:06,400
they say
 

4707
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:09,030
they say
even before you get to consequences it's

4708
01:20:09,030 --> 01:20:09,040
even before you get to consequences it's
 

4709
01:20:09,040 --> 01:20:11,510
even before you get to consequences it's
a terrible theory because when we try to

4710
01:20:11,510 --> 01:20:11,520
a terrible theory because when we try to
 

4711
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:13,910
a terrible theory because when we try to
understand any field of inquiry any

4712
01:20:13,910 --> 01:20:13,920
understand any field of inquiry any
 

4713

understand it we try to come up with a
 

4717
01:20:20,719 --> 01:20:22,709
understand it we try to come up with a
small number of

small number of

uh of concepts
and of relations among the concepts

which is supposed to be able to to uh to

explain to illuminate
 

4727
01:20:32,480 --> 01:20:34,470

place in the domain
 

4733
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:38,950
place in the domain
and conservatives look at this

4734
01:20:38,950 --> 01:20:38,960
and conservatives look at this
 

4735
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:41,270
and conservatives look at this
individuals and the state and they say

4736
01:20:41,270 --> 01:20:41,280
individuals and the state and they say
 

4737
01:20:41,280 --> 01:20:44,229
individuals and the state and they say
you're missing most of what's going on

4738
01:20:44,229 --> 01:20:44,239
you're missing most of what's going on
 

4739
01:20:44,239 --> 01:20:46,310
you're missing most of what's going on
in politics

4740
01:20:46,310 --> 01:20:46,320
in politics
 

4741
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:48,790
in politics
also in in in personal human relations

4742
01:20:48,790 --> 01:20:48,800
also in in in personal human relations
 

4743
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:49,910
also in in in personal human relations
as well

4744
01:20:49,910 --> 01:20:49,920
as well
 

4745
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:50,950
as well
but

4746
01:20:50,950 --> 01:20:50,960
but
 

4747
01:20:50,960 --> 01:20:52,070
but
it it just doesn't look like a

4748
01:20:52,070 --> 01:20:52,080
it it just doesn't look like a
 

4749
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:53,669
it it just doesn't look like a
description of human beings it looks

4750
01:20:53,669 --> 01:20:53,679
description of human beings it looks
 

4751
01:20:53,679 --> 01:20:55,590
description of human beings it looks
like a completely artificial thing and

4752
01:20:55,590 --> 01:20:55,600
like a completely artificial thing and
 

4753
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:56,950
like a completely artificial thing and
then conservatives say well look if i

4754
01:20:56,950 --> 01:20:56,960
then conservatives say well look if i
 

4755
01:20:56,960 --> 01:20:59,030
then conservatives say well look if i
went to adopt this artificial thing then

4756
01:20:59,030 --> 01:20:59,040
went to adopt this artificial thing then
 

4757
01:20:59,040 --> 01:21:00,550
went to adopt this artificial thing then
the consequences are horrific because

4758
01:21:00,550 --> 01:21:00,560
the consequences are horrific because
 

4759
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:02,550
the consequences are horrific because
you're not describing reality

4760
01:21:02,550 --> 01:21:02,560
you're not describing reality
 

4761
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:04,709
you're not describing reality
so a conservative reality

4762
01:21:04,709 --> 01:21:04,719
so a conservative reality
 

4763
01:21:04,719 --> 01:21:06,470
so a conservative reality
uh begins with

4764
01:21:06,470 --> 01:21:06,480
uh begins with
 

4765
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:07,590
uh begins with
um

4766
01:21:07,590 --> 01:21:07,600
um
 

4767
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:09,990
um
with an empirical view of what you know

4768
01:21:09,990 --> 01:21:10,000
with an empirical view of what you know
 

4769
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,070
with an empirical view of what you know
what are human beings like and and

4770
01:21:12,070 --> 01:21:12,080
what are human beings like and and
 

4771
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:13,669
what are human beings like and and
the first thing you notice about human

4772
01:21:13,669 --> 01:21:13,679
the first thing you notice about human
 

4773
01:21:13,679 --> 01:21:15,510
the first thing you notice about human
beings or at least the first thing i

4774
01:21:15,510 --> 01:21:15,520
beings or at least the first thing i
 

4775
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:17,350
beings or at least the first thing i
think conservatives notice is that

4776
01:21:17,350 --> 01:21:17,360
think conservatives notice is that
 

4777
01:21:17,360 --> 01:21:19,590
think conservatives notice is that
they're sticky is that they clump they

4778
01:21:19,590 --> 01:21:19,600
they're sticky is that they clump they
 

4779
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:21,750
they're sticky is that they clump they
turn into groups and you take any

4780
01:21:21,750 --> 01:21:21,760
turn into groups and you take any
 

4781
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:23,750
turn into groups and you take any
arbitrary collection of

4782
01:21:23,750 --> 01:21:23,760
arbitrary collection of
 

4783
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:26,470
arbitrary collection of
human beings and set them to a task or

4784
01:21:26,470 --> 01:21:26,480
human beings and set them to a task or
 

4785
01:21:26,480 --> 01:21:28,629
human beings and set them to a task or
even just leave them alone

4786
01:21:28,629 --> 01:21:28,639
even just leave them alone
 

4787
01:21:28,639 --> 01:21:31,990
even just leave them alone
and they they quickly form into groups

4788
01:21:31,990 --> 01:21:32,000
and they they quickly form into groups
 

4789
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:33,510
and they they quickly form into groups
and those groups are always structured

4790
01:21:33,510 --> 01:21:33,520
and those groups are always structured
 

4791
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:35,669
and those groups are always structured
as hierarchies this is this competition

4792
01:21:35,669 --> 01:21:35,679
as hierarchies this is this competition
 

4793
01:21:35,679 --> 01:21:36,870
as hierarchies this is this competition
within the hierarchy who's you know

4794
01:21:36,870 --> 01:21:36,880
within the hierarchy who's you know
 

4795
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:37,910
within the hierarchy who's you know
who's going to be the leader who's going

who's going to be the leader who's going
 

4797
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:39,910
who's going to be the leader who's going
to be number two but

01:21:39,910 --> 01:21:39,920
to be number two but
 

4799
01:21:39,920 --> 01:21:42,070
to be number two but
there are everywhere you look in human

4800
01:21:42,070 --> 01:21:42,080
there are everywhere you look in human
 

4801
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:43,430
there are everywhere you look in human
societies

universally
 

4805
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:47,830
universally
there are groups the groups compete and

there are groups the groups compete and
 

4807
01:21:47,840 --> 01:21:49,189
there are groups the groups compete and
they're high and they're structured

they're high and they're structured
 

4809
01:21:49,199 --> 01:21:50,550
they're high and they're structured
internally as hierarchies and then

internally as hierarchies and then
 

4811
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:52,629
internally as hierarchies and then
they're internal competitions for who

01:24:44,709 --> 01:24:44,719
and they're able to do that even though
 

4975
01:24:44,719 --> 01:24:46,390
and they're able to do that even though
you know often they they hate each other

4976
01:24:46,390 --> 01:24:46,400
you know often they they hate each other
 

4977
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:47,350
you know often they they hate each other
you know like

4978
01:24:47,350 --> 01:24:47,360
you know like
 

4979
01:24:47,360 --> 01:24:48,390
you know like
like we were talking about the the

4980
01:24:48,390 --> 01:24:48,400
like we were talking about the the
 

4981
01:24:48,400 --> 01:24:50,070
like we were talking about the the
american revolution and often they hate

4982
01:24:50,070 --> 01:24:50,080
american revolution and often they hate
 

4983
01:24:50,080 --> 01:24:52,229
american revolution and often they hate
each other and nevertheless they're able

4984
01:24:52,229 --> 01:24:52,239
each other and nevertheless they're able
 

4985
01:24:52,239 --> 01:24:54,550
each other and nevertheless they're able
to come together why how

4986
01:24:54,550 --> 01:24:54,560
to come together why how
 

4987
01:24:54,560 --> 01:24:57,270
to come together why how
and that leads us into questions like

4988
01:24:57,270 --> 01:24:57,280
and that leads us into questions like
 

4989
01:24:57,280 --> 01:24:58,550
and that leads us into questions like
how does

4990
01:24:58,550 --> 01:24:58,560
how does
 

4991
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:00,870
how does
honor the giving of honor by one group

4992
01:25:00,870 --> 01:25:00,880
honor the giving of honor by one group
 

4993
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:02,070
honor the giving of honor by one group
to another

4994
01:25:02,070 --> 01:25:02,080
to another
 

4995
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:05,430
to another
how does that increase the

4996
01:25:05,430 --> 01:25:05,440
how does that increase the
 

4997
01:25:05,440 --> 01:25:07,830
how does that increase the
the mutual loyalty between groups that

4998
01:25:07,830 --> 01:25:07,840
the mutual loyalty between groups that
 

4999
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:09,110
the mutual loyalty between groups that
that are still competing with one

5000
01:25:09,110 --> 01:25:09,120
that are still competing with one
 

5001
01:25:09,120 --> 01:25:10,070
that are still competing with one
another

5002
01:25:10,070 --> 01:25:10,080
another
 

5003
01:25:10,080 --> 01:25:12,709
another
all of these questions i think we have

5004
01:25:12,709 --> 01:25:12,719
all of these questions i think we have
 

5005
01:25:12,719 --> 01:25:14,550
all of these questions i think we have
to answer them in order to be able to

5006
01:25:14,550 --> 01:25:14,560
to answer them in order to be able to
 

5007
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:18,310
to answer them in order to be able to
talk about politics and uh and and i i

5008
01:25:18,310 --> 01:25:18,320
talk about politics and uh and and i i
 

5009
01:25:18,320 --> 01:25:21,110
talk about politics and uh and and i i
think the reason the first reason why

5010
01:25:21,110 --> 01:25:21,120
think the reason the first reason why
 

5011
01:25:21,120 --> 01:25:23,030
think the reason the first reason why
why one should approach politics as a

5012
01:25:23,030 --> 01:25:23,040
why one should approach politics as a
 

5013
01:25:23,040 --> 01:25:24,870
why one should approach politics as a
conservative rather than as an

5014
01:25:24,870 --> 01:25:24,880
conservative rather than as an
 

5015
01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:26,629
conservative rather than as an
individual just because it gives us

5016
01:25:26,629 --> 01:25:26,639
individual just because it gives us
 

5017
01:25:26,639 --> 01:25:28,709
individual just because it gives us
gives us these these theoretical tools

5018
01:25:28,709 --> 01:25:28,719
gives us these these theoretical tools
 

5019
01:25:28,719 --> 01:25:30,550
gives us these these theoretical tools
to be able to talk about reality which

5020
01:25:30,550 --> 01:25:30,560
to be able to talk about reality which
 

5021
01:25:30,560 --> 01:25:32,790
to be able to talk about reality which
we don't have as long as we keep within

5022
01:25:32,790 --> 01:25:32,800
we don't have as long as we keep within
 

5023
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:34,629
we don't have as long as we keep within
the individual's framework as as you're

5024
01:25:34,629 --> 01:25:34,639
the individual's framework as as you're
 

5025
01:25:34,639 --> 01:25:36,870
the individual's framework as as you're
talking the metaphor that's popping up

5026
01:25:36,870 --> 01:25:36,880
talking the metaphor that's popping up
 

5027
01:25:36,880 --> 01:25:40,149
talking the metaphor that's popping up
in my mind and this is also something

5028
01:25:40,149 --> 01:25:40,159
in my mind and this is also something
 

5029
01:25:40,159 --> 01:25:41,990
in my mind and this is also something
that uh bothers me with theoretical

5030
01:25:41,990 --> 01:25:42,000
that uh bothers me with theoretical
 

5031
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:43,110
that uh bothers me with theoretical
physics

5032
01:25:43,110 --> 01:25:43,120
physics
 

5033
01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:44,629
physics
the metaphor is

5034
01:25:44,629 --> 01:25:44,639
the metaphor is
 

5035
01:25:44,639 --> 01:25:46,790
the metaphor is
there's some sense in which there's

5036
01:25:46,790 --> 01:25:46,800
there's some sense in which there's
 

5037
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:48,709
there's some sense in which there's
things called theories of everything

5038
01:25:48,709 --> 01:25:48,719
things called theories of everything
 

5039
01:25:48,719 --> 01:25:51,189
things called theories of everything
where you try to uh describe the basic

5040
01:25:51,189 --> 01:25:51,199
where you try to uh describe the basic
 

5041
01:25:51,199 --> 01:25:52,629
where you try to uh describe the basic
laws of physics how they interact

5042
01:25:52,629 --> 01:25:52,639
laws of physics how they interact
 

5043
01:25:52,639 --> 01:25:54,709
laws of physics how they interact
together and once you do you have a

5044
01:25:54,709 --> 01:25:54,719
together and once you do you have a
 

5045
01:25:54,719 --> 01:25:57,350
together and once you do you have a
sense that you understand all of reality

5046
01:25:57,350 --> 01:25:57,360
sense that you understand all of reality
 

5047
01:25:57,360 --> 01:26:00,310
sense that you understand all of reality
in in a sense you do and that to me when

5048
01:26:00,310 --> 01:26:00,320
in in a sense you do and that to me when
 

5049
01:26:00,320 --> 01:26:02,229
in in a sense you do and that to me when
you that to me is understanding the

5050
01:26:02,229 --> 01:26:02,239
you that to me is understanding the
 

5051
01:26:02,239 --> 01:26:04,790
you that to me is understanding the
individual like how the individual

5052
01:26:04,790 --> 01:26:04,800
individual like how the individual
 

5053
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:06,550
individual like how the individual
behaves in this world but then you're

5054
01:26:06,550 --> 01:26:06,560
behaves in this world but then you're
 

5055
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:09,350
behaves in this world but then you're
saying that they're hey hey you're also

01:26:09,350 --> 01:26:09,360
saying that they're hey hey you're also
 

5057
01:26:09,360 --> 01:26:12,709
saying that they're hey hey you're also
forgetting chemistry biology how all of

5058
01:26:12,709 --> 01:26:12,719
forgetting chemistry biology how all of
 

5059
01:26:12,719 --> 01:26:14,310
forgetting chemistry biology how all of
that actually comes together the

01:26:14,310 --> 01:26:14,320
that actually comes together the

01:26:14,320 --> 01:26:15,590
that actually comes together the

stickiness
 

5063
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:17,990
stickiness
uh the stickiness of molecules and how

5064
01:26:17,990 --> 01:26:18,000
uh the stickiness of molecules and how
 

5065
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:19,830
uh the stickiness of molecules and how
they build different systems and they

5066
01:26:19,830 --> 01:26:19,840
they build different systems and they
 

5067
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:21,590
they build different systems and they
some systems can kill each other some

5068
01:26:21,590 --> 01:26:21,600
some systems can kill each other some
 

5069
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:24,550
some systems can kill each other some
systems can flourish some can make

01:26:24,550 --> 01:26:24,560
systems can flourish some can make

01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:27,430
systems can flourish some can make
pancakes and bananas and some can make

01:26:27,430 --> 01:26:27,440
pancakes and bananas and some can make
 

5073
01:26:27,440 --> 01:26:28,950
pancakes and bananas and some can make
poison and all those kinds of things and

poison and all those kinds of things and
we need to be able to we need to

we need to be able to we need to
 

5077
01:26:30,719 --> 01:26:31,910
we need to be able to we need to
consider

01:26:31,910 --> 01:26:31,920
consider
 

5079
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:33,510
consider

um and uh i guess iran you're saying

5088
01:26:42,470 --> 01:26:42,480
um and uh i guess iran you're saying
 

5089
01:26:42,480 --> 01:26:45,189
um and uh i guess iran you're saying
that no you

5090
01:26:45,189 --> 01:26:45,199
that no you
 

5091
01:26:45,199 --> 01:26:46,470
that no you
you're just like the theoretical

5092
01:26:46,470 --> 01:26:46,480
you're just like the theoretical
 

5093
01:26:46,480 --> 01:26:49,030
you're just like the theoretical
physicist it all starts at the bot like

5094
01:26:49,030 --> 01:26:49,040
physicist it all starts at the bot like
 

5095
01:26:49,040 --> 01:26:51,990
physicist it all starts at the bot like
if you need to preserve the fundamentals

5096

if you need to preserve the fundamentals

of reality
 

5099
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:55,910
of reality
uh which is the individual like the the

5100
01:26:55,910 --> 01:26:55,920
uh which is the individual like the the
 

5101
01:26:55,920 --> 01:26:57,830
uh which is the individual like the the
basic atom

5102
01:26:57,830 --> 01:26:57,840
basic atom
 

5103
01:26:57,840 --> 01:27:00,470

01:27:00,480 --> 01:27:03,350
of human society is the individual to
you so yes so the the basic unit the

01:27:03,350 --> 01:27:03,360
you so yes so the the basic unit the
 

5107
01:27:03,360 --> 01:27:05,990

01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,390
basic model unit the basic ethical unit
in society is the individual and yeah of

01:27:08,390 --> 01:27:08,400
in society is the individual and yeah of
 

5111
01:27:08,400 --> 01:27:10,070
in society is the individual and yeah of
course we form groups

5112
01:27:10,070 --> 01:27:10,080
course we form groups
 

5113
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:11,910
course we form groups
and and you can't understand history

5114
01:27:11,910 --> 01:27:11,920
and and you can't understand history
 

5115
01:27:11,920 --> 01:27:13,910
and and you can't understand history
unless you understand group formation

5116
01:27:13,910 --> 01:27:13,920
unless you understand group formation
 

5117
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:16,149
unless you understand group formation
and group motivation and

01:27:16,149 --> 01:27:16,159
and group motivation and
 

5119
01:27:16,159 --> 01:27:17,830
and group motivation and
and i have a view about what kind of

5120
01:27:17,830 --> 01:27:17,840
and i have a view about what kind of
 

5121
01:27:17,840 --> 01:27:19,669
and i have a view about what kind of
groups should be formed

5122
01:27:19,669 --> 01:27:19,679
groups should be formed
 

5123
01:27:19,679 --> 01:27:21,830
groups should be formed
uh and and politically from a political

uh and and politically from a political
 

5125
01:27:21,840 --> 01:27:24,550
uh and and politically from a political
perspective voluntary ones ones in which

is it
 

5169
01:28:06,639 --> 01:28:08,629
is it
something that's inherent in the group

5170

something that's inherent in the group
 

5171
01:28:08,639 --> 01:28:10,229
something that's inherent in the group
that we can measure

5172
01:28:10,229 --> 01:28:10,239
that we can measure
 

5173
01:28:10,239 --> 01:28:11,910
that we can measure
as goodness and to help with individuals

5174

as goodness and to help with individuals
 

5175
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:14,149
as goodness and to help with individuals
within as long as we can get that that

5176
01:28:14,149 --> 01:28:14,159
within as long as we can get that that
 

5177
01:28:14,159 --> 01:28:15,910
within as long as we can get that that
the group to function well we don't

5178
01:28:15,910 --> 01:28:15,920
the group to function well we don't
 

5179
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:17,110
the group to function well we don't
really care about where the individuals

5180

the the the the goal of creating groups
is the well-being of the individual and

01:28:23,270 --> 01:28:23,280
is the well-being of the individual and
 

5187
01:28:23,280 --> 01:28:24,629
is the well-being of the individual and
that's why it needs to be voluntary and

5188
01:28:24,629 --> 01:28:24,639
that's why it needs to be voluntary and
 

5189
01:28:24,639 --> 01:28:26,790
that's why it needs to be voluntary and
that's why there has to be a way out of

01:28:26,790 --> 01:28:26,800
that's why there has to be a way out of
 

5191
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:28,950
that's why there has to be a way out of

of those sometimes it's costly it's not
 

5193
01:28:28,960 --> 01:28:30,629
of those sometimes it's costly it's not
a cheap out that's why you should really

5194
01:28:30,629 --> 01:28:30,639
a cheap out that's why you should really
 

5195
01:28:30,639 --> 01:28:32,550
a cheap out that's why you should really
think about what groups you you you and

5196
01:28:32,550 --> 01:28:32,560
think about what groups you you you and
 

5197

and after i don't know 3000 years of
kind of known history uh this history

5296
01:30:13,590 --> 01:30:13,600
kind of known history uh this history
 

5297
01:30:13,600 --> 01:30:15,030
kind of known history uh this history
before that but we don't know much about

5298
01:30:15,030 --> 01:30:15,040
before that but we don't know much about
 

5299
01:30:15,040 --> 01:30:17,270
before that but we don't know much about
it 3000 years of known history you can

5300
01:30:17,270 --> 01:30:17,280
it 3000 years of known history you can
 

5301
01:30:17,280 --> 01:30:19,030
it 3000 years of known history you can
sit back and evaluate

5302
01:30:19,030 --> 01:30:19,040
sit back and evaluate
 

5303
01:30:19,040 --> 01:30:20,870
sit back and evaluate
and and i think that's what that's what

5304
01:30:20,870 --> 01:30:20,880
and and i think that's what that's what
 

5305
01:30:20,880 --> 01:30:22,870
and and i think that's what that's what
is done in the enlightenment and and and

5306
01:30:22,870 --> 01:30:22,880
is done in the enlightenment and and and
 

5307
01:30:22,880 --> 01:30:24,629
is done in the enlightenment and and and
you sit back and suddenly we can do it

5308
01:30:24,629 --> 01:30:24,639
you sit back and suddenly we can do it
 

5309
01:30:24,639 --> 01:30:27,189
you sit back and suddenly we can do it
today we can sit back and evaluate what

5310
01:30:27,189 --> 01:30:27,199
today we can sit back and evaluate what
 

5311
01:30:27,199 --> 01:30:28,550
today we can sit back and evaluate what
promotes human flourishing and what

5312
01:30:28,550 --> 01:30:28,560
promotes human flourishing and what
 

5313
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:30,310
promotes human flourishing and what
doesn't and what do we mean by human

5314
01:30:30,310 --> 01:30:30,320
doesn't and what do we mean by human
 

5315
01:30:30,320 --> 01:30:32,149
doesn't and what do we mean by human
flourishing human who's who's

5316
01:30:32,149 --> 01:30:32,159
flourishing human who's who's
 

5317
01:30:32,159 --> 01:30:33,189
flourishing human who's who's

5319
01:30:33,199 --> 01:30:35,590
flourishing
well individual human beings now

5320
01:30:35,590 --> 01:30:35,600
well individual human beings now
 

5321
01:30:35,600 --> 01:30:36,950
well individual human beings now
since i don't believe in a zero-sum

5322
01:30:36,950 --> 01:30:36,960
since i don't believe in a zero-sum
 

5323
01:30:36,960 --> 01:30:38,790
since i don't believe in a zero-sum
world and the world is not zero summit

5324
01:30:38,790 --> 01:30:38,800
world and the world is not zero summit
 

5325
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:40,950
world and the world is not zero summit
we can see that it's it's empirically

5326
01:30:40,950 --> 01:30:40,960
we can see that it's it's empirically
 

5327
01:30:40,960 --> 01:30:42,390
we can see that it's it's empirically
possible to show that the world is not a

5328
01:30:42,390 --> 01:30:42,400
possible to show that the world is not a
 

5329
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:44,310
possible to show that the world is not a
zero-sum game my fl human flourishing

5330
01:30:44,310 --> 01:30:44,320
zero-sum game my fl human flourishing
 

5331
01:30:44,320 --> 01:30:47,110
zero-sum game my fl human flourishing
doesn't come at your expense so i i you

5332
01:30:47,110 --> 01:30:47,120
doesn't come at your expense so i i you
 

5333
01:30:47,120 --> 01:30:48,470
doesn't come at your expense so i i you
know i can show that a system that

5334
01:30:48,470 --> 01:30:48,480
know i can show that a system that
 

5335
01:30:48,480 --> 01:30:49,669
know i can show that a system that
promotes my flourishing will probably

5336
01:30:49,669 --> 01:30:49,679
promotes my flourishing will probably
 

5337
01:30:49,679 --> 01:30:50,950
promotes my flourishing will probably
promote your flourishing as well and

5338
01:30:50,950 --> 01:30:50,960
promote your flourishing as well and
 

5339
01:30:50,960 --> 01:30:52,950
promote your flourishing as well and
promotes the general welfare in that

5340
01:30:52,950 --> 01:30:52,960
promotes the general welfare in that
 

5341
01:30:52,960 --> 01:30:55,189
promotes the general welfare in that
sense because it promotes

5342
01:30:55,189 --> 01:30:55,199
sense because it promotes
 

5343
01:30:55,199 --> 01:30:56,550
sense because it promotes
individuals

5344
01:30:56,550 --> 01:30:56,560
individuals
 

5345
01:30:56,560 --> 01:30:58,390
individuals
flourishing and we can we can look at

5346
01:30:58,390 --> 01:30:58,400
flourishing and we can we can look at
 

5347
01:30:58,400 --> 01:31:00,310
flourishing and we can we can look at
all these

5348
01:31:00,310 --> 01:31:00,320
all these
 

5349
01:31:00,320 --> 01:31:02,310
all these
examples of how we evolved and what

5350
01:31:02,310 --> 01:31:02,320
examples of how we evolved and what
 

5351
01:31:02,320 --> 01:31:04,229
examples of how we evolved and what
leads to bloodshed and what doesn't and

5352
01:31:04,229 --> 01:31:04,239
leads to bloodshed and what doesn't and
 

5353
01:31:04,239 --> 01:31:06,550
leads to bloodshed and what doesn't and
and and what promotes this ability to

5354
01:31:06,550 --> 01:31:06,560
and and what promotes this ability to
 

5355
01:31:06,560 --> 01:31:08,229
and and what promotes this ability to
flourish as an individual again an

5356
01:31:08,229 --> 01:31:08,239
flourish as an individual again an
 

5357
01:31:08,239 --> 01:31:09,750
flourish as an individual again an
achievement the idea of individual

5358
01:31:09,750 --> 01:31:09,760
achievement the idea of individual
 

5359
01:31:09,760 --> 01:31:10,950
achievement the idea of individual
flourishing

5360
01:31:10,950 --> 01:31:10,960
flourishing
 

5361
01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:12,950
flourishing
and then we can think about how to

5362
01:31:12,950 --> 01:31:12,960
and then we can think about how to
 

5363
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:15,270
and then we can think about how to
create a political system around that a

5364
01:31:15,270 --> 01:31:15,280
create a political system around that a
 

5365
01:31:15,280 --> 01:31:16,790
create a political system around that a
political system

5366
01:31:16,790 --> 01:31:16,800
political system
 

5367
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:19,750
political system
that recognizes and allows for the

5368
01:31:19,750 --> 01:31:19,760
that recognizes and allows for the
 

5369
01:31:19,760 --> 01:31:21,990
that recognizes and allows for the
formation of groups but just under the

5370
01:31:21,990 --> 01:31:22,000
formation of groups but just under the
 

5371
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,470
formation of groups but just under the
principle of voluntary so you can't be

5372
01:31:24,470 --> 01:31:24,480
principle of voluntary so you can't be
 

5373
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:26,229
principle of voluntary so you can't be
forced to join a group you you can't be

5374
01:31:26,229 --> 01:31:26,239
forced to join a group you you can't be
 

5375
01:31:26,239 --> 01:31:28,390
forced to join a group you you can't be
cursed into forming a group

5376
01:31:28,390 --> 01:31:28,400
cursed into forming a group
 

5377
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:30,390
cursed into forming a group
um other than the fact that you're born

5378
01:31:30,390 --> 01:31:30,400
um other than the fact that you're born
 

5379
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:32,310
um other than the fact that you're born
in a particular place in a particular

5380
01:31:32,310 --> 01:31:32,320
in a particular place in a particular
 

5381
01:31:32,320 --> 01:31:33,990
in a particular place in a particular
you know that in a sense but that's not

5382
01:31:33,990 --> 01:31:34,000
you know that in a sense but that's not
 

5383
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:35,510
you know that in a sense but that's not
force that's there's a difference

5384
01:31:35,510 --> 01:31:35,520
force that's there's a difference
 

5385
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:37,910
force that's there's a difference
between metaphysics and between choices

5386
01:31:37,910 --> 01:31:37,920
between metaphysics and between choices
 

5387
01:31:37,920 --> 01:31:39,270
between metaphysics and between choices
so this is something that came up in the

5388
01:31:39,270 --> 01:31:39,280
so this is something that came up in the
 

5389
01:31:39,280 --> 01:31:41,669
so this is something that came up in the
debate that yoram said that not all

5390
01:31:41,669 --> 01:31:41,679
debate that yoram said that not all
 

5391
01:31:41,679 --> 01:31:43,430
debate that yoram said that not all
human relations are voluntary and you

5392

human relations are voluntary and you
kind of emphasize that a lot of

5394
01:31:45,830 --> 01:31:45,840
kind of emphasize that a lot of
 

5395
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:48,470
kind of emphasize that a lot of
where we are is not voluntary we're

5396
01:31:48,470 --> 01:31:48,480
where we are is not voluntary we're
 

5397
01:31:48,480 --> 01:31:51,830
where we are is not voluntary we're
grounded we're connected in so much so

5398
01:31:51,830 --> 01:31:51,840
grounded we're connected in so much so
 

5399
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:54,950
grounded we're connected in so much so
how how can a human be free

5615
01:35:42,159 --> 01:35:44,950
you're getting to the standard too fast
first i want to know factually is it

5616
01:35:44,950 --> 01:35:44,960
first i want to know factually is it
 

5617
01:35:44,960 --> 01:35:46,790
first i want to know factually is it
true that all societies work like this

5618
01:35:46,790 --> 01:35:46,800
true that all societies work like this
 

5619
01:35:46,800 --> 01:35:48,229
true that all societies work like this
because if it's true that all societies

5620

because if it's true that all societies
 

5621
01:35:48,239 --> 01:35:49,750
because if it's true that all societies
work like this then saying saying we

01:35:49,750 --> 01:35:49,760
work like this then saying saying we
 

5623
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:51,430
work like this then saying saying we
should be free from it is is just a

5624
01:35:51,430 --> 01:35:51,440
should be free from it is is just a
 

5625
01:35:51,440 --> 01:35:52,470
should be free from it is is just a
fantasy

5626
01:35:52,470 --> 01:35:52,480
fantasy
 

5627
01:35:52,480 --> 01:35:53,990
fantasy
so a i don't think all societies work

5628
01:35:53,990 --> 01:35:54,000
so a i don't think all societies work
 

5629
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:55,910
so a i don't think all societies work

like this i think much of what happened
in america post-founding in the 19th

5632
01:35:58,149 --> 01:35:58,159
in america post-founding in the 19th
 

5633
01:35:58,159 --> 01:35:59,430
in america post-founding in the 19th
century didn't work like that i think

5634
01:35:59,430 --> 01:35:59,440
century didn't work like that i think
 

5635
01:35:59,440 --> 01:36:01,669
century didn't work like that i think
that's the genius of america and i think

5636
01:36:01,669 --> 01:36:01,679
that's the genius of america and i think
 

5637
01:36:01,679 --> 01:36:03,270
that's the genius of america and i think
what happened during the 19th century in

5638
01:36:03,270 --> 01:36:03,280
what happened during the 19th century in
 

5639
01:36:03,280 --> 01:36:05,030
what happened during the 19th century in
the industrial revolution what happened

5640
01:36:05,030 --> 01:36:05,040
the industrial revolution what happened
 

5641
01:36:05,040 --> 01:36:07,830
the industrial revolution what happened
in in in the 19th century to some extent

5642
01:36:07,830 --> 01:36:07,840
in in in the 19th century to some extent
 

5643
01:36:07,840 --> 01:36:09,270
in in in the 19th century to some extent
globally but certainly in the united

5644
01:36:09,270 --> 01:36:09,280
globally but certainly in the united
 

5645
01:36:09,280 --> 01:36:11,350
globally but certainly in the united
states didn't work that way it broke

5646
01:36:11,350 --> 01:36:11,360
states didn't work that way it broke
 

5647
01:36:11,360 --> 01:36:13,430
states didn't work that way it broke
tradition i think i think all innovation

5648
01:36:13,430 --> 01:36:13,440
tradition i think i think all innovation
 

5649
01:36:13,440 --> 01:36:15,109
tradition i think i think all innovation
breaks tradition and i think that's what

5650
01:36:15,109 --> 01:36:15,119
breaks tradition and i think that's what
 

5651
01:36:15,119 --> 01:36:17,669
breaks tradition and i think that's what
the genius of of this country is and and

5652
01:36:17,669 --> 01:36:17,679
the genius of of this country is and and
 

5653
01:36:17,679 --> 01:36:19,270
the genius of of this country is and and
the post-enlightenment

5654
01:36:19,270 --> 01:36:19,280
the post-enlightenment
 

5655
01:36:19,280 --> 01:36:20,870
the post-enlightenment
uh world is

5656
01:36:20,870 --> 01:36:20,880
uh world is
 

5657
01:36:20,880 --> 01:36:23,510
uh world is
uh i think pre that tradition they work

5658
01:36:23,510 --> 01:36:23,520
uh i think pre that tradition they work
 

5659
01:36:23,520 --> 01:36:25,750
uh i think pre that tradition they work
that way and then the question is that

5660
01:36:25,750 --> 01:36:25,760
that way and then the question is that
 

5661
01:36:25,760 --> 01:36:27,270
that way and then the question is that
people understand why they do what they

5662
01:36:27,270 --> 01:36:27,280
people understand why they do what they
 

5663
01:36:27,280 --> 01:36:27,990
people understand why they do what they
do

live in that's and i think that's what
we achieve through enlightenment through

5706
01:37:10,390 --> 01:37:10,400
we achieve through enlightenment through
 

5707
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:12,870
we achieve through enlightenment through
education through through in and where

5708
01:37:12,870 --> 01:37:12,880
education through through in and where
 

5709
01:37:12,880 --> 01:37:16,790
education through through in and where
we don't treat people just as a a blob

5710
01:37:16,790 --> 01:37:16,800
we don't treat people just as a a blob
 

5711
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:18,950
we don't treat people just as a a blob
tribe that just follows orders but we

5712
01:37:18,950 --> 01:37:18,960
tribe that just follows orders but we
 

5713
01:37:18,960 --> 01:37:20,950
tribe that just follows orders but we
now treat individuals as capable of

5714
01:37:20,950 --> 01:37:20,960
now treat individuals as capable of
 

5715
01:37:20,960 --> 01:37:22,790
now treat individuals as capable of
thinking for themselves capable for

5716
01:37:22,790 --> 01:37:22,800
thinking for themselves capable for
 

5717
01:37:22,800 --> 01:37:25,669
thinking for themselves capable for
discovering truth capable of of of

5718
01:37:25,669 --> 01:37:25,679
discovering truth capable of of of
 

5719
01:37:25,679 --> 01:37:28,870
discovering truth capable of of of
figuring out their own values and and

5720
01:37:28,870 --> 01:37:28,880
figuring out their own values and and
 

5721
01:37:28,880 --> 01:37:31,109
figuring out their own values and and
that's the big break between and this is

5722
01:37:31,109 --> 01:37:31,119
that's the big break between and this is
 

5723
01:37:31,119 --> 01:37:32,870
that's the big break between and this is
why you know this is the break i think

5724
01:37:32,870 --> 01:37:32,880
why you know this is the break i think
 

5725
01:37:32,880 --> 01:37:34,790
why you know this is the break i think
that the declaration represents

5726
01:37:34,790 --> 01:37:34,800
that the declaration represents
 

5727
01:37:34,800 --> 01:37:36,950
that the declaration represents
the break between society that is based

5728
01:37:36,950 --> 01:37:36,960
the break between society that is based
 

5729
01:37:36,960 --> 01:37:38,629
the break between society that is based
on tradition following commandments

5730
01:37:38,629 --> 01:37:38,639
on tradition following commandments
 

5731
01:37:38,639 --> 01:37:40,149
on tradition following commandments
following rules

5732
01:37:40,149 --> 01:37:40,159
following rules
 

5733
01:37:40,159 --> 01:37:41,669
following rules
because they are the rules because they

5734
01:37:41,669 --> 01:37:41,679
because they are the rules because they
 

5735
01:37:41,679 --> 01:37:43,830
because they are the rules because they
are the commandments and a society where

5736
01:37:43,830 --> 01:37:43,840
are the commandments and a society where
 

5737
01:37:43,840 --> 01:37:46,149
are the commandments and a society where
individuals understand those rules

5738
01:37:46,149 --> 01:37:46,159
individuals understand those rules
 

5739
01:37:46,159 --> 01:37:48,229
individuals understand those rules
understand yes it's now become a

5740
01:37:48,229 --> 01:37:48,239
understand yes it's now become a
 

5741
01:37:48,239 --> 01:37:50,149
understand yes it's now become a
tradition let's say to respect

5742
01:37:50,149 --> 01:37:50,159
tradition let's say to respect
 

5743
01:37:50,159 --> 01:37:51,590
tradition let's say to respect
individual right to respect property

5744
01:37:51,590 --> 01:37:51,600
individual right to respect property
 

5745
01:37:51,600 --> 01:37:53,350
individual right to respect property
rights but it's they're not following it

5746
01:37:53,350 --> 01:37:53,360
rights but it's they're not following it
 

5747
01:37:53,360 --> 01:37:54,950
rights but it's they're not following it
because it's a tradition they're

5748
01:37:54,950 --> 01:37:54,960
because it's a tradition they're
 

5749
01:37:54,960 --> 01:37:56,550
because it's a tradition they're
following it because they understand

5750
01:37:56,550 --> 01:37:56,560
following it because they understand
 

5751
01:37:56,560 --> 01:37:59,030
following it because they understand
what it is about it that that that makes

5752
01:37:59,030 --> 01:37:59,040
what it is about it that that that makes
 

5753
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:01,990
what it is about it that that that makes
it good so that's the world i think that

5754
01:38:01,990 --> 01:38:02,000
it good so that's the world i think that
 

5755
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,229
it good so that's the world i think that
that we were on the process of evolving

5756
01:38:04,229 --> 01:38:04,239
that we were on the process of evolving
 

5757
01:38:04,239 --> 01:38:05,510
that we were on the process of evolving
towards

5758
01:38:05,510 --> 01:38:05,520
towards
 

5759
01:38:05,520 --> 01:38:07,270
towards
and that is what got destroyed in the

5760
01:38:07,270 --> 01:38:07,280
and that is what got destroyed in the
 

5761
01:38:07,280 --> 01:38:09,109
and that is what got destroyed in the
20th century and and

5762
01:38:09,109 --> 01:38:09,119
20th century and and
 

5763
01:38:09,119 --> 01:38:11,109
20th century and and
certainly disappeared today and i think

5764
01:38:11,109 --> 01:38:11,119
certainly disappeared today and i think
 

5765
01:38:11,119 --> 01:38:12,709
certainly disappeared today and i think
that's the great tragedy is that we're

5766
01:38:12,709 --> 01:38:12,719
that's the great tragedy is that we're
 

5767
01:38:12,719 --> 01:38:14,229
that's the great tragedy is that we're
evolving to a place where people

5768
01:38:14,229 --> 01:38:14,239
evolving to a place where people
 

5769
01:38:14,239 --> 01:38:15,430

if you give people freedom

6002
01:42:17,990 --> 01:42:18,000
if you give people freedom

01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,310
if you give people freedom
if you give people politics yeah well

not politics relations relations uh
 

6007
01:42:23,679 --> 01:42:25,590
not politics relations relations uh
relationships so

6008

relationships so
 

6009
01:42:25,600 --> 01:42:27,030
relationships so
this is interesting because we have an

6010
01:42:27,030 --> 01:42:27,040
this is interesting because we have an
 

6011
01:42:27,040 --> 01:42:28,629
this is interesting because we have an
interesting dynamic going on here in

6012
01:42:28,629 --> 01:42:28,639
interesting dynamic going on here in
 

6013
01:42:28,639 --> 01:42:30,709
interesting dynamic going on here in
terms of beliefs they're differing and

6014
01:42:30,709 --> 01:42:30,719
terms of beliefs they're differing and
 

6015
01:42:30,719 --> 01:42:34,390
terms of beliefs they're differing and
so there's interesting overlaps but

6016
01:42:34,390 --> 01:42:34,400
so there's interesting overlaps but
 

6017
01:42:34,400 --> 01:42:36,870
so there's interesting overlaps but
there's a worry if you look at human

6018
01:42:36,870 --> 01:42:36,880
there's a worry if you look at human
 

6019
01:42:36,880 --> 01:42:38,470
there's a worry if you look at human
history and you study the lessons of

6020
01:42:38,470 --> 01:42:38,480
history and you study the lessons of
 

6021
01:42:38,480 --> 01:42:41,189
history and you study the lessons of
history and you look at modern society

6022
01:42:41,189 --> 01:42:41,199
history and you look at modern society
 

6023
01:42:41,199 --> 01:42:43,510
history and you look at modern society
if you give people freedom in terms of

full
like if you not give people freedom

6030
01:42:48,709 --> 01:42:48,719
like if you not give people freedom
 

6031
01:42:48,719 --> 01:42:50,310
like if you not give people freedom
emphasize

dating the stickiness dissolves just
 

6039
01:42:58,719 --> 01:43:01,109
dating the stickiness dissolves just
like in chemistry you start to have a

6040
01:43:01,109 --> 01:43:01,119
like in chemistry you start to have a
 

6041
01:43:01,119 --> 01:43:03,990
like in chemistry you start to have a
gas versus a liquid right that that's

6042
01:43:03,990 --> 01:43:04,000
gas versus a liquid right that that's
 

6043
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:05,910
gas versus a liquid right that that's
the way so you have to what you have to

6044
01:43:05,910 --> 01:43:05,920
the way so you have to what you have to
 

6045
01:43:05,920 --> 01:43:06,950
the way so you have to what you have to
study

6046
01:43:06,950 --> 01:43:06,960
study
 

6047
01:43:06,960 --> 01:43:10,550
study
what actually happens if you emphasize

what actually happens if you emphasize
 

6049
01:43:10,560 --> 01:43:12,149
what actually happens if you emphasize
that

01:43:15,199 --> 01:43:17,830
the stickiness the bonds of humans
is holding you back the exercise of

voluntary choice
 

6057
01:43:19,760 --> 01:43:21,669
voluntary choice
is the highest ideal

6058
01:43:21,669 --> 01:43:21,679
is the highest ideal
 

6059
01:43:21,679 --> 01:43:24,790
is the highest ideal
the danger of that is for that to be

6060
01:43:24,790 --> 01:43:24,800
the danger of that is for that to be
 

6061
01:43:24,800 --> 01:43:27,510
the danger of that is for that to be
implemented or interpreted in certain

kinds of ways by us flawed humans that

kinds of ways by us flawed humans that
 

6065
01:43:30,560 --> 01:43:32,550
kinds of ways by us flawed humans that
are not i mean you could say we're

6066
01:43:32,550 --> 01:43:32,560
are not i mean you could say we're
 

6067
01:43:32,560 --> 01:43:34,149
are not i mean you could say we're
perfectly reasonable and rational we can

6068
01:43:34,149 --> 01:43:34,159
perfectly reasonable and rational we can
 

6069
01:43:34,159 --> 01:43:35,590
perfectly reasonable and rational we can
think through all of our decisions but

6070
01:43:35,590 --> 01:43:35,600
think through all of our decisions but
 

6071
01:43:35,600 --> 01:43:38,470
think through all of our decisions but
really i mean especially you're young

6072
01:43:38,470 --> 01:43:38,480
really i mean especially you're young
 

6073
01:43:38,480 --> 01:43:40,390
really i mean especially you're young
you get horny you make decisions that

6074
01:43:40,390 --> 01:43:40,400
you get horny you make decisions that
 

6075
01:43:40,400 --> 01:43:41,030
you get horny you make decisions that
are

6076
01:43:41,030 --> 01:43:41,040
are
 

6077
01:43:41,040 --> 01:43:44,070
are
suboptimal perhaps so the the point is

6078
01:43:44,070 --> 01:43:44,080
suboptimal perhaps so the the point is
 

6079
01:43:44,080 --> 01:43:46,310
suboptimal perhaps so the the point is
you have to look at reality

6080
01:43:46,310 --> 01:43:46,320
you have to look at reality
 

6081
01:43:46,320 --> 01:43:49,109
you have to look at reality
of when you emphasize different things

6082
01:43:49,109 --> 01:43:49,119
of when you emphasize different things
 

6083
01:43:49,119 --> 01:43:51,910
of when you emphasize different things
so when you when you talk about what is

6084
01:43:51,910 --> 01:43:51,920
so when you when you talk about what is
 

6085
01:43:51,920 --> 01:43:54,390
so when you when you talk about what is
the ideal life what is the ideal

6086
01:43:54,390 --> 01:43:54,400
the ideal life what is the ideal
 

6087
01:43:54,400 --> 01:43:55,910
the ideal life what is the ideal
relations you have to also think like

6088

so that that's the way i think about it

6318
01:47:57,510 --> 01:47:57,520
so that that's the way i think about it
 

6319
01:47:57,520 --> 01:47:59,270
so that that's the way i think about it
it's like the energy you put on to the

01:48:05,199 --> 01:48:07,030
the fire gracefully
in some sense i mean perhaps you would

6328
01:48:07,030 --> 01:48:07,040
in some sense i mean perhaps you would
 

6329
01:48:07,040 --> 01:48:09,990
in some sense i mean perhaps you would
reframe that as not a

6330
01:48:09,990 --> 01:48:10,000
reframe that as not a
 

6331
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,149
reframe that as not a
uh then that that's not being altruistic

6332
01:48:12,149 --> 01:48:12,159
uh then that that's not being altruistic
 

6333
01:48:12,159 --> 01:48:13,510
uh then that that's not being altruistic
or whatever but

6334
01:48:13,510 --> 01:48:13,520
or whatever but
 

6335
01:48:13,520 --> 01:48:15,830
or whatever but
there there is something pragmatic about

01:48:15,830 --> 01:48:15,840
there there is something pragmatic about
 

6337
01:48:15,840 --> 01:48:18,390
there there is something pragmatic about
that kind of approach to life uh

6338
01:48:18,390 --> 01:48:18,400
that kind of approach to life uh
 

6339
01:48:18,400 --> 01:48:20,470
that kind of approach to life uh

version of that even even kant who we
 

6351
01:48:32,560 --> 01:48:34,950
version of that even even kant who we
join together in finding to be terrible

before we got onto this tangent is the
 

6369
01:48:49,600 --> 01:48:52,070
before we got onto this tangent is the

i'm not sure that those are exactly the
 

6389
01:49:09,760 --> 01:49:11,350
i'm not sure that those are exactly the
same things but they're they're they're

01:49:11,350 --> 01:49:11,360
same things but they're they're they're
 

6391
01:49:11,360 --> 01:49:13,830
same things but they're they're they're
both certainly uh relevant and

both certainly uh relevant and
 

6393
01:49:13,840 --> 01:49:15,189
both certainly uh relevant and
important

there's this middle ground where
 

6951
01:58:43,520 --> 01:58:45,910
there's this middle ground where
uh we both think that they're

6952
01:58:45,910 --> 01:58:45,920
uh we both think that they're
 

6953
01:58:45,920 --> 01:58:47,109
uh we both think that they're
not particularly bad but not

6954
01:58:47,109 --> 01:58:47,119
not particularly bad but not
 

6955
01:58:47,119 --> 01:58:48,390
not particularly bad but not
particularly good and you all might

6956
01:58:48,390 --> 01:58:48,400
particularly good and you all might
 

6957
01:58:48,400 --> 01:58:50,229
particularly good and you all might
think that better than i think they are

6958

think that better than i think they are
 

6959
01:58:50,239 --> 01:58:52,950

but if we can agree and this is good and
 

6961
01:58:52,960 --> 01:58:55,430
but if we can agree and this is good and
this is evil right then the systems that

6962
01:58:55,430 --> 01:58:55,440
this is evil right then the systems that

basically saying reason will arrive a

02:15:31,440 --> 02:15:33,910
basically saying reason will arrive a
lot of things why are you so sure that

so first of all humans have limited

7919
02:15:51,199 --> 02:15:53,109
researcher perspective
uh it seems there's a whole discussion

7920
02:15:53,109 --> 02:15:53,119
uh it seems there's a whole discussion
 

7921
02:15:53,119 --> 02:15:54,629
uh it seems there's a whole discussion
about whether there is such a thing as

7922
02:15:54,629 --> 02:15:54,639
about whether there is such a thing as
 

7923
02:15:54,639 --> 02:15:56,709
about whether there is such a thing as
artificial intelligence whether whether

artificial intelligence whether whether
 

7925
02:15:56,719 --> 02:15:59,270
artificial intelligence whether whether
that is what it is but um but see here's

7926
02:15:59,270 --> 02:15:59,280
that is what it is but um but see here's
 

7927
02:15:59,280 --> 02:16:00,950
that is what it is but um but see here's
the thing i mean you're very confident

7928
02:16:00,950 --> 02:16:00,960
the thing i mean you're very confident
 

7929
02:16:00,960 --> 02:16:02,390
the thing i mean you're very confident
about this particular thing but not

7930
02:16:02,390 --> 02:16:02,400
about this particular thing but not
 

7931
02:16:02,400 --> 02:16:04,390
about this particular thing but not
about other aspects of human nature that

7932
02:16:04,390 --> 02:16:04,400
about other aspects of human nature that
 

7933
02:16:04,400 --> 02:16:07,910
about other aspects of human nature that
seems to be obviously present so yes uh

7934
02:16:07,910 --> 02:16:07,920
seems to be obviously present so yes uh
 

7935
02:16:07,920 --> 02:16:08,790
seems to be obviously present so yes uh
almost

7936
02:16:08,790 --> 02:16:08,800
almost
 

7937
02:16:08,800 --> 02:16:11,910
almost
uh human relations love connection

7938
02:16:11,910 --> 02:16:11,920
uh human relations love connection
 

7939
02:16:11,920 --> 02:16:14,550
uh human relations love connection
between us so i it's very possible to

7940
02:16:14,550 --> 02:16:14,560
between us so i it's very possible to
 

7941
02:16:14,560 --> 02:16:16,390
between us so i it's very possible to
argue that all of the accomplishments of

7942
02:16:16,390 --> 02:16:16,400
argue that all of the accomplishments of

02:16:16,400 --> 02:16:18,069
argue that all of the accomplishments of
reason would not exist without the

reason would not exist without the
 

7945
02:16:18,079 --> 02:16:20,229
reason would not exist without the
connection of other humans there is of

7946
02:16:20,229 --> 02:16:20,239
connection of other humans there is of
 

7947
02:16:20,239 --> 02:16:21,669
connection of other humans there is of
course that's true it's not obvious

7948
02:16:21,669 --> 02:16:21,679
course that's true it's not obvious
 

7949
02:16:21,679 --> 02:16:24,229
course that's true it's not obvious
though it's possible that reason is a

02:16:24,229 --> 02:16:24,239
though it's possible that reason is a
 

7951
02:16:24,239 --> 02:16:27,270
though it's possible that reason is a

02:16:29,040 --> 02:16:30,550
people interacting with each other when
you look at the greatest inventions of

02:16:30,550 --> 02:16:30,560
you look at the greatest inventions of
 

7957
02:16:30,560 --> 02:16:32,469
you look at the greatest inventions of
human history some people tell that

human history some people tell that
 

7959

story by individual inventors
 

7961
02:16:34,800 --> 02:16:37,190
story by individual inventors
you could argue that's true some people

7962
02:16:37,190 --> 02:16:37,200
you could argue that's true some people
 

7963
02:16:37,200 --> 02:16:38,870
you could argue that's true some people
say that it's

02:16:38,870 --> 02:16:38,880
say that it's
 

7965
02:16:38,880 --> 02:16:40,309
say that it's
it's a bunch of people in the room

it's a bunch of people in the room
 

7967
02:16:40,319 --> 02:16:42,629
it's a bunch of people in the room
together the idea is bubbling and if

7968
02:16:42,629 --> 02:16:42,639
together the idea is bubbling and if
 

7969
02:16:42,639 --> 02:16:43,669
together the idea is bubbling and if
you're saying

7970
02:16:43,669 --> 02:16:43,679
you're saying
 

7971
02:16:43,679 --> 02:16:47,110
you're saying
individual is primary and they have the

7972
02:16:47,110 --> 02:16:47,120
individual is primary and they have the
 

7973
02:16:47,120 --> 02:16:49,030
individual is primary and they have the
full power and the capacity to make

7974
02:16:49,030 --> 02:16:49,040
full power and the capacity to make
 

7975
02:16:49,040 --> 02:16:50,230
full power and the capacity to make
choices

7976
02:16:50,230 --> 02:16:50,240
choices
 

7977
02:16:50,240 --> 02:16:51,910
choices
i don't know if that's necessarily

7978
02:16:51,910 --> 02:16:51,920
i don't know if that's necessarily
 

7979
02:16:51,920 --> 02:16:53,830
i don't know if that's necessarily
obviously so there's a straw manning

7980
02:16:53,830 --> 02:16:53,840
obviously so there's a straw manning
 

7981
02:16:53,840 --> 02:16:56,709
obviously so there's a straw manning
going on here yeah my position right yep

you're going to challenge me and i have
to come back and i have to think deeply

8054
02:18:12,549 --> 02:18:12,559
to come back and i have to think deeply
 

8055
02:18:12,559 --> 02:18:14,469
to come back and i have to think deeply
about what it is you said and why i'm

about what it is you said and why i'm

8062
02:18:20,389 --> 02:18:20,399
of course now you're causing me to think
 

8063
02:18:20,399 --> 02:18:22,389
of course now you're causing me to think
much more deeply and to challenge me but

8064
02:18:22,389 --> 02:18:22,399
much more deeply and to challenge me but
 

8065
02:18:22,399 --> 02:18:24,469
much more deeply and to challenge me but
it's still true that i have to think i

8066
02:18:24,469 --> 02:18:24,479
it's still true that i have to think i
 

8067
02:18:24,479 --> 02:18:26,230
it's still true that i have to think i
if i don't think for myself who's going

8068
02:18:26,230 --> 02:18:26,240
if i don't think for myself who's going

one of the benefits of federalism
 

9583
02:45:11,680 --> 02:45:12,870
one of the benefits of federalism
is that while you have a national

02:45:12,870 --> 02:45:12,880
is that while you have a national
 

9585
02:45:12,880 --> 02:45:14,790
is that while you have a national
government there are certain issues that

government there are certain issues that
 

9587
02:45:14,800 --> 02:45:16,710
government there are certain issues that
you relegate to states and they can try

you relegate to states and they can try
 

9589
02:45:16,720 --> 02:45:19,510
you relegate to states and they can try
different things and learn because there

9590
02:45:19,510 --> 02:45:19,520
different things and learn because there
 

9591
02:45:19,520 --> 02:45:22,150
different things and learn because there
is a huge value in the empirical

knowledge comes the you can't just
 

9595
02:45:23,920 --> 02:45:26,070
knowledge comes the you can't just
deduce it all and figure it all out you

9596
02:45:26,070 --> 02:45:26,080
deduce it all and figure it all out you
 

9597
02:45:26,080 --> 02:45:28,790
deduce it all and figure it all out you
have to experiment so i do

experimentation is gone and if you make

9604
02:45:34,790 --> 02:45:34,800
experimentation is gone and if you make
 

9605
02:45:34,800 --> 02:45:37,190
experimentation is gone and if you make
a mistake everybody suffers

experimentation i think is crucial but
 

9615
02:45:47,120 --> 02:45:48,630
experimentation i think is crucial but
you need a principle

9616
02:45:48,630 --> 02:45:48,640
you need a principle
 

9617

and then we try to figure out okay what
 

9635
02:46:05,520 --> 02:46:07,590
and then we try to figure out okay what
works better than other things and and

what gives you hope about the future
 

9653
02:46:25,200 --> 02:46:27,990
what gives you hope about the future
so we've been describing um

9654
02:46:27,990 --> 02:46:28,000
so we've been describing um
 

9655
02:46:28,000 --> 02:46:31,349
so we've been describing um
reasons to maybe not have hope

9656
02:46:31,349 --> 02:46:31,359
reasons to maybe not have hope
 

9657
02:46:31,359 --> 02:46:33,670
reasons to maybe not have hope
what gives you hope when you look at the

9658
02:46:33,670 --> 02:46:33,680
what gives you hope when you look at the
 

9659
02:46:33,680 --> 02:46:35,110
what gives you hope when you look at the
world

9660
02:46:35,110 --> 02:46:35,120
world
 

9661

and 300 years and 500 years like the the

9664
02:46:39,750 --> 02:46:39,760
and 300 years and 500 years like the the
 

9665
02:46:39,760 --> 02:46:41,670
and 300 years and 500 years like the the
founders look into the future

9666
02:46:41,670 --> 02:46:41,680
founders look into the future
 

9667
02:46:41,680 --> 02:46:42,950
founders look into the future
that

9668
02:46:42,950 --> 02:46:42,960
that
 

9669
02:46:42,960 --> 02:46:45,590
that
human civilization will be all right and

9670
02:46:45,590 --> 02:46:45,600
human civilization will be all right and
 

9671
02:46:45,600 --> 02:46:47,910
human civilization will be all right and
and more than that it would flourish two

9672
02:46:47,910 --> 02:46:47,920
and more than that it would flourish two
 

9673
02:46:47,920 --> 02:46:49,349
and more than that it would flourish two
things for me

9674
02:46:49,349 --> 02:46:49,359
things for me
 

9675
02:46:49,359 --> 02:46:52,550
things for me
one is history so in the very long run

9676
02:46:52,550 --> 02:46:52,560
one is history so in the very long run
 

9677
02:46:52,560 --> 02:46:54,550
one is history so in the very long run
good ideas went out

9678
02:46:54,550 --> 02:46:54,560
good ideas went out
 

9679
02:46:54,560 --> 02:46:57,030
good ideas went out
i think in the very long run you can go

9680
02:46:57,030 --> 02:46:57,040
i think in the very long run you can go
 

9681
02:46:57,040 --> 02:46:58,550
i think in the very long run you can go
through dark ages but you come out of

9682
02:46:58,550 --> 02:46:58,560
through dark ages but you come out of
 

9683
02:46:58,560 --> 02:46:59,910
through dark ages but you come out of
the dark ages

9684
02:46:59,910 --> 02:46:59,920
the dark ages
 

9685
02:46:59,920 --> 02:47:01,190
the dark ages
um

9686
02:47:01,190 --> 02:47:01,200
um
 

9687
02:47:01,200 --> 02:47:03,429
um
you know the the the the the good and

9688
02:47:03,429 --> 02:47:03,439
you know the the the the the good and
 

9689
02:47:03,439 --> 02:47:06,550
you know the the the the the good and
the just does win in the end even if it

9690
02:47:06,550 --> 02:47:06,560
the just does win in the end even if it
 

9691
02:47:06,560 --> 02:47:08,950
the just does win in the end even if it
is bloody and difficult and and hard to

9692
02:47:08,950 --> 02:47:08,960
is bloody and difficult and and hard to
 

9693
02:47:08,960 --> 02:47:10,710
is bloody and difficult and and hard to
get there so while i am quite

9694
02:47:10,710 --> 02:47:10,720
get there so while i am quite
 

9695
02:47:10,720 --> 02:47:12,469
get there so while i am quite
pessimistic unfortunately about the

9696
02:47:12,469 --> 02:47:12,479
pessimistic unfortunately about the
 

9697
02:47:12,479 --> 02:47:15,110
pessimistic unfortunately about the
short run i'm ultimately optimistic that

9698
02:47:15,110 --> 02:47:15,120
short run i'm ultimately optimistic that
 

9699
02:47:15,120 --> 02:47:17,830
short run i'm ultimately optimistic that
that in the long run good ideas win and

9700
02:47:17,830 --> 02:47:17,840
that in the long run good ideas win and
 

9701
02:47:17,840 --> 02:47:19,510
that in the long run good ideas win and
and they're justified and and and i

9702
02:47:19,510 --> 02:47:19,520
and they're justified and and and i
 

9703
02:47:19,520 --> 02:47:21,269
and they're justified and and and i
think the fundamental

9704
02:47:21,269 --> 02:47:21,279
think the fundamental
 

9705
02:47:21,279 --> 02:47:23,030
think the fundamental
behind that is

9706
02:47:23,030 --> 02:47:23,040
behind that is
 

9707
02:47:23,040 --> 02:47:26,230
behind that is
i i think is is that i'm fundamentally

9708
02:47:26,230 --> 02:47:26,240
i i think is is that i'm fundamentally
 

9709
02:47:26,240 --> 02:47:28,389
i i think is is that i'm fundamentally
positive about human nature i i think

9710
02:47:28,389 --> 02:47:28,399
positive about human nature i i think

human beings
 

9713
02:47:29,840 --> 02:47:32,630
human beings
um can think uh they're capable of

9714
02:47:32,630 --> 02:47:32,640
um can think uh they're capable of
 

9715
02:47:32,640 --> 02:47:33,750
um can think uh they're capable of
reasoning

9716
02:47:33,750 --> 02:47:33,760
reasoning
 

9717
02:47:33,760 --> 02:47:35,910
reasoning
they're capable of figuring out the

9718
02:47:35,910 --> 02:47:35,920
they're capable of figuring out the
 

9719
02:47:35,920 --> 02:47:37,830
they're capable of figuring out the
truth they're capable of learning from

9720
02:47:37,830 --> 02:47:37,840
truth they're capable of learning from
 

9721
02:47:37,840 --> 02:47:40,070
truth they're capable of learning from
experience they don't always do it it's

9722
02:47:40,070 --> 02:47:40,080
experience they don't always do it it's
 

9723
02:47:40,080 --> 02:47:42,070
experience they don't always do it it's
an achievement to do it

9724
02:47:42,070 --> 02:47:42,080
an achievement to do it
 

9725
02:47:42,080 --> 02:47:44,710
an achievement to do it
but over time they do

9726
02:47:44,710 --> 02:47:44,720
but over time they do
 

9727
02:47:44,720 --> 02:47:46,309
but over time they do
and and if you create the right

9728
02:47:46,309 --> 02:47:46,319
and and if you create the right
 

9729
02:47:46,319 --> 02:47:48,630
and and if you create the right
circumstances they will and when things

9730
02:47:48,630 --> 02:47:48,640
circumstances they will and when things
 

9731
02:47:48,640 --> 02:47:51,110
circumstances they will and when things
