00:03:28,099 --> 00:03:28,109
of course Drake so in your view let's
 

163
00:03:28,109 --> 00:03:30,110
of course Drake so in your view let's
start like high level philosophical what

164
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:30,120
start like high level philosophical what
 

165
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:34,250
start like high level philosophical what
is the purpose of music on this planet

166
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:34,260
is the purpose of music on this planet
 

167
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:37,670
is the purpose of music on this planet
of ours I think music has many different

168
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:37,680
of ours I think music has many different
 

169
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,089
of ours I think music has many different
purposes I think there's there's

170
00:03:41,089 --> 00:03:41,099
purposes I think there's there's
 

171
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:43,550
purposes I think there's there's
certainly a big purpose which is the

172
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:43,560
certainly a big purpose which is the
 

173
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,619
certainly a big purpose which is the
same as multiple attainment which is

174
00:03:45,619 --> 00:03:45,629
same as multiple attainment which is
 

175
00:03:45,629 --> 00:03:50,149
same as multiple attainment which is
ESCA pisum and to be able to live in

176
00:03:50,149 --> 00:03:50,159
ESCA pisum and to be able to live in
 

177
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,009
ESCA pisum and to be able to live in
some sort of other mental state for a

178
00:03:52,009 --> 00:03:52,019
some sort of other mental state for a
 

179
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:52,309
some sort of other mental state for a
while

180
00:03:52,309 --> 00:03:52,319
while
 

181
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,020
while
but I also think you have the the

182
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:54,030
but I also think you have the the
 

183
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,429
but I also think you have the the
opposite of escaping which is to help

184
00:03:55,429 --> 00:03:55,439
opposite of escaping which is to help
 

185
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:56,750
opposite of escaping which is to help
you focus on something you are actually

186
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:56,760
you focus on something you are actually
 

187
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,629
you focus on something you are actually
doing and so I think people use music as

188
00:03:59,629 --> 00:03:59,639
doing and so I think people use music as
 

189
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:03,589
doing and so I think people use music as
a tool to to tune the brain to the

190
00:04:03,589 --> 00:04:03,599
a tool to to tune the brain to the
 

191
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,629
a tool to to tune the brain to the
activities that they are actually doing

192
00:04:05,629 --> 00:04:05,639
activities that they are actually doing
 

193
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:10,969
activities that they are actually doing
and it's kind of like in one sense maybe

194
00:04:10,969 --> 00:04:10,979
and it's kind of like in one sense maybe
 

195
00:04:10,979 --> 00:04:12,800
and it's kind of like in one sense maybe
it's the rawest signal if you if you

196
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:12,810
it's the rawest signal if you if you
 

197
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:14,509
it's the rawest signal if you if you
think about the brain that's known that

198
00:04:14,509 --> 00:04:14,519
think about the brain that's known that
 

199
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:16,279
think about the brain that's known that
works it's maybe the most efficient hack

200
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:16,289
works it's maybe the most efficient hack
 

201
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:18,259
works it's maybe the most efficient hack
we can do to actually actively tune it

202
00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:18,269
we can do to actually actively tune it
 

203
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:20,750
we can do to actually actively tune it
into some state that you want to be you

204
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:20,760
into some state that you want to be you
 

205
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,830
into some state that you want to be you
can do it in other ways you can tell

206
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:21,840
can do it in other ways you can tell
 

207
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,480
can do it in other ways you can tell
stories to put people in a certain mood

208
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:23,490
stories to put people in a certain mood
 

209
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:25,670
stories to put people in a certain mood
but music is probably very F

210
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:25,680
but music is probably very F
 

211
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,850
but music is probably very F
to get to a certain mood very fast and

212
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:27,860
to get to a certain mood very fast and
 

213
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:30,620
to get to a certain mood very fast and
you know there's uh there's a social

214
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:30,630
you know there's uh there's a social
 

215
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:32,780
you know there's uh there's a social
component historically to music where

216
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:32,790
component historically to music where
 

217
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:35,240
component historically to music where
people listen to music together I was

218
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:35,250
people listen to music together I was
 

219
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:38,360
people listen to music together I was
just thinking about this that to me you

220
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:38,370
just thinking about this that to me you
 

221
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:40,040
just thinking about this that to me you
mentioned machine learning but to me

222
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:40,050
mentioned machine learning but to me
 

223
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:44,090
mentioned machine learning but to me
personally music is a really private

224
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:44,100
personally music is a really private
 

225
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:47,870
personally music is a really private
thing I'm speaking for myself I listen

226
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:47,880
thing I'm speaking for myself I listen
 

227
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,330
thing I'm speaking for myself I listen
to music like almost nobody knows the

228
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:50,340
to music like almost nobody knows the
 

229
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:52,180
to music like almost nobody knows the
kind of things I have in my library

230
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:52,190
kind of things I have in my library
 

231
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:54,560
kind of things I have in my library
except people who are really close to me

232
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:54,570
except people who are really close to me
 

233
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:56,390
except people who are really close to me
and they really only know a certain

234
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:56,400
and they really only know a certain
 

235
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,040
and they really only know a certain
percentage there's like some weird stuff

236
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:58,050
percentage there's like some weird stuff
 

237
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:00,320
percentage there's like some weird stuff
that I'm almost probably embarrassed but

238
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:00,330
that I'm almost probably embarrassed but
 

239
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:01,850
that I'm almost probably embarrassed but
by right it's called to give the

240
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:01,860
by right it's called to give the
 

241
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:03,620
by right it's called to give the
pleasure everyone I said the guilty

242
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:03,630
pleasure everyone I said the guilty
 

243
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:05,420
pleasure everyone I said the guilty
pleasures yet hopefully they're not too

244
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:05,430
pleasures yet hopefully they're not too
 

245
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:08,360
pleasures yet hopefully they're not too
bad but it's just the ice for me it's

246
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:08,370
bad but it's just the ice for me it's
 

247
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:09,860
bad but it's just the ice for me it's
personal do you think of music is

248
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:09,870
personal do you think of music is
 

249
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:13,790
personal do you think of music is
something that's social or as something

250
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:13,800
something that's social or as something
 

251
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:17,379
something that's social or as something
that's personal this is a very so I

252
00:05:17,379 --> 00:05:17,389
that's personal this is a very so I
 

253
00:05:17,389 --> 00:05:21,110
that's personal this is a very so I
think it's the same it's the same answer

254
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:21,120
think it's the same it's the same answer
 

255
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,300
think it's the same it's the same answer
that you use it for for both we we've

256
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:23,310
that you use it for for both we we've
 

257
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:25,879
that you use it for for both we we've
thought a lot about this during these 10

258
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:25,889
thought a lot about this during these 10
 

259
00:05:25,889 --> 00:05:28,370
thought a lot about this during these 10
years at Spotify obviously in one sense

260
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:28,380
years at Spotify obviously in one sense
 

261
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:30,950
years at Spotify obviously in one sense
as you said music is incredibly social

262
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:30,960
as you said music is incredibly social
 

263
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,800
as you said music is incredibly social
you go to concerts and so forth on the

264
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:33,810
you go to concerts and so forth on the
 

265
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:37,520
you go to concerts and so forth on the
other hand it is your your escape and

266
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:37,530
other hand it is your your escape and
 

267
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:40,129
other hand it is your your escape and
everyone has these things are very

268
00:05:40,129 --> 00:05:40,139
everyone has these things are very
 

269
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:44,450
everyone has these things are very
personal to them so what we've found is

270
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:44,460
personal to them so what we've found is
 

271
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:48,980
personal to them so what we've found is
that when it comes to to most people

272
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:48,990
that when it comes to to most people
 

273
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:50,629
that when it comes to to most people
claim that they have a friend or two

274
00:05:50,629 --> 00:05:50,639
claim that they have a friend or two
 

275
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,490
claim that they have a friend or two
that they are heavily inspired by and

276
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:52,500
that they are heavily inspired by and
 

277
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,589
that they are heavily inspired by and
that they listen to so I actually think

278
00:05:54,589 --> 00:05:54,599
that they listen to so I actually think
 

279
00:05:54,599 --> 00:05:56,930
that they listen to so I actually think
music is very social but in a smaller

280
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:56,940
music is very social but in a smaller
 

281
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,330
music is very social but in a smaller
group setting it's in it's an intimate

282
00:05:59,330 --> 00:05:59,340
group setting it's in it's an intimate
 

283
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:03,290
group setting it's in it's an intimate
form of of it's an intimate relationship

284
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:03,300
form of of it's an intimate relationship
 

285
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,750
form of of it's an intimate relationship
it's not something that you necessarily

286
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:04,760
it's not something that you necessarily
 

287
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,550
it's not something that you necessarily
share broadly now at concerts you can

288
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:07,560
share broadly now at concerts you can
 

289
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,080
share broadly now at concerts you can
argue you do but then you've gathered a

290
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:09,090
argue you do but then you've gathered a
 

291
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:11,300
argue you do but then you've gathered a
lot of people that you have something in

292
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:11,310
lot of people that you have something in
 

293
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:13,420
lot of people that you have something in

sharing on music it's something we tried

296
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:17,720
sharing on music it's something we tried
 

297
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:21,110
sharing on music it's something we tried
on social networks and so forth but it

298
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:21,120
on social networks and so forth but it
 

299
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,689
on social networks and so forth but it
turns out that people aren't super

300
00:06:23,689 --> 00:06:23,699
turns out that people aren't super
 

301
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:26,210
turns out that people aren't super

years now and they've grown with me
together there's there's an intimate

00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:55,160
together there's there's an intimate
 

327
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,590
together there's there's an intimate
relationship you have with a library of

328
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:57,600
relationship you have with a library of
 

329
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,140
relationship you have with a library of
music you've developed and we'll talk

330
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:00,150
music you've developed and we'll talk
 

331
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:01,910
music you've developed and we'll talk
about different ways to play with that

332
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:01,920
about different ways to play with that
 

333
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:05,150
about different ways to play with that
can you do the impossible task and try

334
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:05,160
can you do the impossible task and try
 

335
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,560
can you do the impossible task and try
to give a history of music listening

336
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:08,570
to give a history of music listening
 

337
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:12,440
to give a history of music listening
from your perspective from before the

338
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:12,450
from your perspective from before the
 

339
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:14,600
from your perspective from before the
Internet and after the Internet and just

340
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:14,610
Internet and after the Internet and just
 

341
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:16,520
Internet and after the Internet and just
kind of everything leading up to

342
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:16,530
kind of everything leading up to
 

343
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:19,700
kind of everything leading up to
streaming Spotify I'll try it it could

344
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:19,710
streaming Spotify I'll try it it could
 

345
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:22,880
streaming Spotify I'll try it it could
be a 100 year podcast yeah I'll try to

346
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:22,890
be a 100 year podcast yeah I'll try to
 

347
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:25,220
be a 100 year podcast yeah I'll try to
do a brief version there are some things

348
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:25,230
do a brief version there are some things
 

349
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:26,810
do a brief version there are some things
that that I think are very interesting

350
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:26,820
that that I think are very interesting
 

351
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,520
that that I think are very interesting
during the history of music which is

352
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:28,530
during the history of music which is
 

353
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:32,270
during the history of music which is
that before recorded music you to be

354
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:32,280
that before recorded music you to be
 

355
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,100
that before recorded music you to be
able to enjoy music you actually had to

356
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:34,110
able to enjoy music you actually had to
 

357
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:35,660
able to enjoy music you actually had to
be where the music was produced because

358
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:35,670
be where the music was produced because
 

359
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:37,460
be where the music was produced because
he couldn't he couldn't record it and

360
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:37,470
he couldn't he couldn't record it and
 

361
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:39,200
he couldn't he couldn't record it and
time-shifted write creation and

362
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:39,210
time-shifted write creation and
 

363
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:40,310
time-shifted write creation and
consumption had to happen at the same

364
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:40,320
consumption had to happen at the same
 

365
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,950
consumption had to happen at the same
time basically concerts and so you

366
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:42,960
time basically concerts and so you
 

367
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,400
time basically concerts and so you
either had to get to the nearest village

368
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:45,410
either had to get to the nearest village
 

369
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:48,470
either had to get to the nearest village
to listen to music and while that was

370
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:48,480
to listen to music and while that was
 

371
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,840
to listen to music and while that was
cumbersome and it severely limited the

372
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:50,850
cumbersome and it severely limited the
 

373
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:52,970
cumbersome and it severely limited the
distribution of music it also had some

374
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:52,980
distribution of music it also had some
 

375
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:55,550
distribution of music it also had some
different qualities which was that the

376
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:55,560
different qualities which was that the
 

377
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,200
different qualities which was that the
Creator could always interact with the

378
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:57,210
Creator could always interact with the
 

379
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:57,560
Creator could always interact with the
audience

380
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:57,570
audience
 

381
00:07:57,570 --> 00:08:00,320
audience
it was always live and also there was no

382
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:00,330
it was always live and also there was no
 

383
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:02,330
it was always live and also there was no
time cap on the music so I think it's

384
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:02,340
time cap on the music so I think it's
 

385
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:04,090
time cap on the music so I think it's
not a coincident that these early

386
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:04,100
not a coincident that these early
 

387
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:06,890
not a coincident that these early
classical works they're much longer than

388
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:06,900
classical works they're much longer than
 

389
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:10,070
classical works they're much longer than
the three minutes the three minutes came

390
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:10,080
the three minutes the three minutes came
 

391
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,870
the three minutes the three minutes came
in as a restriction of the first wax

392
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:11,880
in as a restriction of the first wax
 

393
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,910
in as a restriction of the first wax
disc that could only contain a three

394
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:13,920
disc that could only contain a three
 

395
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,330
disc that could only contain a three
minute singsong on one side right so

396
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:16,340
minute singsong on one side right so
 

397
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:19,540
minute singsong on one side right so
actually the recorded music severely

398
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:19,550
actually the recorded music severely
 

399
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:22,460
actually the recorded music severely
limited there or could constraint I

400
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:22,470
limited there or could constraint I
 

401
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:23,930
limited there or could constraint I
won't say limit I mean constraints often

402
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:23,940
won't say limit I mean constraints often
 

403
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:25,850
won't say limit I mean constraints often
good but it put very hard constraints on

404
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:25,860
good but it put very hard constraints on
 

405
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,710
good but it put very hard constraints on
the music format so you kind of said

406
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:27,720
the music format so you kind of said
 

407
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,420
the music format so you kind of said
like instead of doing these this opus

408
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:29,430
like instead of doing these this opus
 

409
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:32,380
like instead of doing these this opus
like many tens of minutes or something

410
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:32,390
like many tens of minutes or something
 

411
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:34,370
like many tens of minutes or something
now you get three and a half minutes

412
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:34,380
now you get three and a half minutes
 

413
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,050
now you get three and a half minutes
because then you're out of wax on this

414
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:36,060
because then you're out of wax on this
 

415
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:39,530
because then you're out of wax on this
disc but in return you get in amazing

416
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:39,540
disc but in return you get in amazing
 

417
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:41,720
disc but in return you get in amazing
distribution you reach will widen right

418
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:41,730
distribution you reach will widen right
 

419
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:45,410
distribution you reach will widen right
just on that point real quick without

420
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:45,420
just on that point real quick without
 

421
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:48,290
just on that point real quick without
the mass scale distribution there's a

422
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:48,300
the mass scale distribution there's a
 

423
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:51,770
the mass scale distribution there's a
scarcity component where you kind of

424
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:51,780
scarcity component where you kind of
 

425
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:52,790
scarcity component where you kind of
look forward

426
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:52,800
look forward
 

427
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,269
look forward
what we had that it's like the Netflix

428
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:56,279
what we had that it's like the Netflix
 

429
00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:59,569
what we had that it's like the Netflix
versus HBO Game of Thrones you like wait

430
00:08:59,569 --> 00:08:59,579
versus HBO Game of Thrones you like wait
 

431
00:08:59,579 --> 00:09:01,489
versus HBO Game of Thrones you like wait
for the event because you can't really

432
00:09:01,489 --> 00:09:01,499
for the event because you can't really
 

433
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:03,530
for the event because you can't really
listen to it see you're like look

434
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:03,540
listen to it see you're like look
 

435
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:06,199
listen to it see you're like look
forward to it and then it's you derive

436
00:09:06,199 --> 00:09:06,209
forward to it and then it's you derive
 

437
00:09:06,209 --> 00:09:08,660
forward to it and then it's you derive
perhaps more pleasure because it's more

438
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:08,670
perhaps more pleasure because it's more
 

439
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:10,160
perhaps more pleasure because it's more
rare for you to listen to particular

440
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:10,170
rare for you to listen to particular
 

441
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:11,809
rare for you to listen to particular
piece you think there's value to that

442
00:09:11,809 --> 00:09:11,819
piece you think there's value to that
 

443
00:09:11,819 --> 00:09:14,780
piece you think there's value to that
scarcity yeah I think that that is

444
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:14,790
scarcity yeah I think that that is
 

445
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:15,829
scarcity yeah I think that that is
definitely a thing and there's always

446
00:09:15,829 --> 00:09:15,839
definitely a thing and there's always
 

447
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,530
definitely a thing and there's always
this component of if you have something

448
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:18,540
this component of if you have something
 

449
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,749
this component of if you have something
in infinite amount so will you value it

450
00:09:20,749 --> 00:09:20,759
in infinite amount so will you value it
 

451
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:24,859
in infinite amount so will you value it
as much probably not humanity is always

452
00:09:24,859 --> 00:09:24,869
as much probably not humanity is always
 

453
00:09:24,869 --> 00:09:27,410
as much probably not humanity is always
seeking some is relative so you're

454
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:27,420
seeking some is relative so you're
 

455
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:28,579
seeking some is relative so you're
always seeking something you didn't have

456
00:09:28,579 --> 00:09:28,589
always seeking something you didn't have
 

457
00:09:28,589 --> 00:09:29,509
always seeking something you didn't have
and when you have it you don't

458
00:09:29,509 --> 00:09:29,519
and when you have it you don't
 

459
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,220
and when you have it you don't
appreciate as much I think that's

460
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:31,230
appreciate as much I think that's
 

461
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:32,960
appreciate as much I think that's
probably true but I think that's why

462
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:32,970
probably true but I think that's why
 

463
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:35,179
probably true but I think that's why
concerts exist so you can actually have

464
00:09:35,179 --> 00:09:35,189
concerts exist so you can actually have
 

465
00:09:35,189 --> 00:09:38,479
concerts exist so you can actually have
both but I think net if you couldn't

466
00:09:38,479 --> 00:09:38,489
both but I think net if you couldn't
 

467
00:09:38,489 --> 00:09:41,900
both but I think net if you couldn't
listen to music in your car driving that

468
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:41,910
listen to music in your car driving that
 

469
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:44,030
listen to music in your car driving that
that'd be worse that cost will be bigger

470
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:44,040
that'd be worse that cost will be bigger
 

471
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,189
that'd be worse that cost will be bigger
than the benefit of of the anticipation

472
00:09:46,189 --> 00:09:46,199
than the benefit of of the anticipation
 

473
00:09:46,199 --> 00:09:49,789
than the benefit of of the anticipation
I think that you would have so yep it

474
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:49,799
I think that you would have so yep it
 

475
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:53,960
I think that you would have so yep it
started with live concerts then it's

476
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:53,970
started with live concerts then it's
 

477
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:56,059
started with live concerts then it's
being able to you know the the

478
00:09:56,059 --> 00:09:56,069
being able to you know the the
 

479
00:09:56,069 --> 00:09:58,549
being able to you know the the
phonograph invented right you start to

480
00:09:58,549 --> 00:09:58,559
phonograph invented right you start to
 

481
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:01,249
phonograph invented right you start to
be able to record music exactly so then

482
00:10:01,249 --> 00:10:01,259
be able to record music exactly so then
 

483
00:10:01,259 --> 00:10:02,929
be able to record music exactly so then
then you got this massive distribution

484
00:10:02,929 --> 00:10:02,939
then you got this massive distribution
 

485
00:10:02,939 --> 00:10:05,329
then you got this massive distribution
that that made it possible to create two

486
00:10:05,329 --> 00:10:05,339
that that made it possible to create two
 

487
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:06,949
that that made it possible to create two
things I think first of all cultural

488
00:10:06,949 --> 00:10:06,959
things I think first of all cultural
 

489
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,119
things I think first of all cultural
phenomenons they probably need

490
00:10:08,119 --> 00:10:08,129
phenomenons they probably need
 

491
00:10:08,129 --> 00:10:11,960
phenomenons they probably need
distribution to be able to happen but it

492
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:11,970
distribution to be able to happen but it
 

493
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:15,619
distribution to be able to happen but it
also opened access to you know for a new

494
00:10:15,619 --> 00:10:15,629
also opened access to you know for a new
 

495
00:10:15,629 --> 00:10:17,389
also opened access to you know for a new
kind of artists so you started to have

496
00:10:17,389 --> 00:10:17,399
kind of artists so you started to have
 

497
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:19,100
kind of artists so you started to have
these phenomenons like Beatles inhale

498
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:19,110
these phenomenons like Beatles inhale
 

499
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:20,679
these phenomenons like Beatles inhale
this and so forth that would really a

500
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:20,689
this and so forth that would really a
 

501
00:10:20,689 --> 00:10:22,639
this and so forth that would really a
function of distribution I think

502
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:22,649
function of distribution I think
 

503
00:10:22,649 --> 00:10:24,889
function of distribution I think
obviously of talent and innovation but

504
00:10:24,889 --> 00:10:24,899
obviously of talent and innovation but
 

505
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:27,109
obviously of talent and innovation but
there was also taking a component and of

506
00:10:27,109 --> 00:10:27,119
there was also taking a component and of
 

507
00:10:27,119 --> 00:10:28,579
there was also taking a component and of
course the next big innovation that come

508
00:10:28,579 --> 00:10:28,589
course the next big innovation that come
 

509
00:10:28,589 --> 00:10:31,699
course the next big innovation that come
along was was radio broadcast radio and

510
00:10:31,699 --> 00:10:31,709
along was was radio broadcast radio and
 

511
00:10:31,709 --> 00:10:35,210
along was was radio broadcast radio and
I think radio is interesting because it

512
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:35,220
I think radio is interesting because it
 

513
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:37,189
I think radio is interesting because it
started not as a music medium and

514
00:10:37,189 --> 00:10:37,199
started not as a music medium and
 

515
00:10:37,199 --> 00:10:39,889
started not as a music medium and
started us as an information medium for

516
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:39,899
started us as an information medium for
 

517
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:43,009
started us as an information medium for
for news and then radio need to define

518
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:43,019
for news and then radio need to define
 

519
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:44,960
for news and then radio need to define
something to fill the time wid so that

520
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:44,970
something to fill the time wid so that
 

521
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:46,939
something to fill the time wid so that
they could honestly play more ads and

522
00:10:46,939 --> 00:10:46,949
they could honestly play more ads and
 

523
00:10:46,949 --> 00:10:50,030
they could honestly play more ads and
make more money and music was free so so

524
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:50,040
make more money and music was free so so
 

525
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,859
make more money and music was free so so
then you had this massive distribution

526
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:51,869
then you had this massive distribution
 

527
00:10:51,869 --> 00:10:53,840
then you had this massive distribution
we could program to people I think those

528
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:53,850
we could program to people I think those
 

529
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:57,039
we could program to people I think those
things that ecosystem is what created

530
00:10:57,039 --> 00:10:57,049
things that ecosystem is what created
 

531
00:10:57,049 --> 00:11:00,619
things that ecosystem is what created
the ability for for for hits but it was

532
00:11:00,619 --> 00:11:00,629
the ability for for for hits but it was
 

533
00:11:00,629 --> 00:11:03,230
the ability for for for hits but it was
also very broadcast medium so you would

534
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:03,240
also very broadcast medium so you would
 

535
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,030
also very broadcast medium so you would
tend to get these massive massive hits

536
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:05,040
tend to get these massive massive hits
 

537
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,519
tend to get these massive massive hits
but maybe not such a lot

538
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:06,529
but maybe not such a lot
 

539
00:11:06,529 --> 00:11:10,389
but maybe not such a lot
tail in terms of choice of everybody

540
00:11:10,389 --> 00:11:10,399
tail in terms of choice of everybody
 

541
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,280
tail in terms of choice of everybody
listening to the same stuff yeah and as

542
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:12,290
listening to the same stuff yeah and as
 

543
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:14,019
listening to the same stuff yeah and as
you said I think there are some social

544
00:11:14,019 --> 00:11:14,029
you said I think there are some social
 

545
00:11:14,029 --> 00:11:16,300
you said I think there are some social
benefits to that yeah I think for

546
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:16,310
benefits to that yeah I think for
 

547
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:18,249
benefits to that yeah I think for
example there is there's a high

548
00:11:18,249 --> 00:11:18,259
example there is there's a high
 

549
00:11:18,259 --> 00:11:19,780
example there is there's a high
statistical chance that if I talk about

550
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:19,790
statistical chance that if I talk about
 

551
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:21,670
statistical chance that if I talk about
the latest episode of Game of Thrones we

552
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:21,680
the latest episode of Game of Thrones we
 

553
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,049
the latest episode of Game of Thrones we
have something to talk about yeah just

554
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:23,059
have something to talk about yeah just
 

555
00:11:23,059 --> 00:11:25,360
have something to talk about yeah just
statistically in the age of individual

556
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:25,370
statistically in the age of individual
 

557
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:27,670
statistically in the age of individual
choice maybe some of that goes away so I

558
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:27,680
choice maybe some of that goes away so I
 

559
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:32,290
choice maybe some of that goes away so I
I do see the value of like you know

560
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:32,300
I do see the value of like you know
 

561
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:34,869
I do see the value of like you know
shared cultural components but I also

562
00:11:34,869 --> 00:11:34,879
shared cultural components but I also
 

563
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:38,559
shared cultural components but I also
obviously love personalization and so

564
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:38,569
obviously love personalization and so
 

565
00:11:38,569 --> 00:11:40,150
obviously love personalization and so
let's catch us up to the Internet

566
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:40,160
let's catch us up to the Internet
 

567
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,790
let's catch us up to the Internet
so maybe Napster well first of all

568
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:42,800
so maybe Napster well first of all
 

569
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,910
so maybe Napster well first of all
there's like mp3's exact tape CDs there

570
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:45,920
there's like mp3's exact tape CDs there
 

571
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,129
there's like mp3's exact tape CDs there
was a digitalization of music with a CD

572
00:11:48,129 --> 00:11:48,139
was a digitalization of music with a CD
 

573
00:11:48,139 --> 00:11:49,629
was a digitalization of music with a CD
really it was physical distribution but

574
00:11:49,629 --> 00:11:49,639
really it was physical distribution but
 

575
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:51,999
really it was physical distribution but
the music became did you don't yeah and

576
00:11:51,999 --> 00:11:52,009
the music became did you don't yeah and
 

577
00:11:52,009 --> 00:11:54,790
the music became did you don't yeah and
so they were files but basically boxed

578
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:54,800
so they were files but basically boxed
 

579
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,889
so they were files but basically boxed
software and use the software analogy

580
00:11:56,889 --> 00:11:56,899
software and use the software analogy
 

581
00:11:56,899 --> 00:11:59,110
software and use the software analogy
and then you could start downloading

582
00:11:59,110 --> 00:11:59,120
and then you could start downloading
 

583
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,319
and then you could start downloading
these files and I think there are two

584
00:12:02,319 --> 00:12:02,329
these files and I think there are two
 

585
00:12:02,329 --> 00:12:03,910
these files and I think there are two
interesting things that happen back to

586
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:03,920
interesting things that happen back to
 

587
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,220
interesting things that happen back to
music used to be longer before it was

588
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:06,230
music used to be longer before it was
 

589
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:08,369
music used to be longer before it was
constrained by the distribution medium I

590
00:12:08,369 --> 00:12:08,379
constrained by the distribution medium I
 

591
00:12:08,379 --> 00:12:10,960
constrained by the distribution medium I
don't think that was a coincidence and

592
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:10,970
don't think that was a coincidence and
 

593
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:13,210
don't think that was a coincidence and
then really the only music genre to have

594
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:13,220
then really the only music genre to have
 

595
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:16,299
then really the only music genre to have
developed mostly after music was a file

596
00:12:16,299 --> 00:12:16,309
developed mostly after music was a file
 

597
00:12:16,309 --> 00:12:18,970
developed mostly after music was a file
again on the Internet is EDM and EDM is

598
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:18,980
again on the Internet is EDM and EDM is
 

599
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,549
again on the Internet is EDM and EDM is
often much longer than the traditional

600
00:12:20,549 --> 00:12:20,559
often much longer than the traditional
 

601
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:23,199
often much longer than the traditional
music I think I think it's interesting

602
00:12:23,199 --> 00:12:23,209
music I think I think it's interesting
 

603
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:25,150
music I think I think it's interesting
to think about the fact that music is no

604
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:25,160
to think about the fact that music is no
 

605
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,730
to think about the fact that music is no
longer constrained in minutes per song

606
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:27,740
longer constrained in minutes per song
 

607
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:30,100
longer constrained in minutes per song
or something it's it's a it's a legacy

608
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:30,110
or something it's it's a it's a legacy
 

609
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:32,319
or something it's it's a it's a legacy
of our own distribution technology and

610
00:12:32,319 --> 00:12:32,329
of our own distribution technology and
 

611
00:12:32,329 --> 00:12:33,910
of our own distribution technology and
you see some of this new music that that

612
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:33,920
you see some of this new music that that
 

613
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,679
you see some of this new music that that
breaks the format not so much as I would

614
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:35,689
breaks the format not so much as I would
 

615
00:12:35,689 --> 00:12:38,290
breaks the format not so much as I would
have expected actually by now but but it

616
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:38,300
have expected actually by now but but it
 

617
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,269
have expected actually by now but but it
still happens so first of all I don't

618
00:12:40,269 --> 00:12:40,279
still happens so first of all I don't
 

619
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:42,879
still happens so first of all I don't
really know what EDM is electronic dance

620
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:42,889
really know what EDM is electronic dance
 

621
00:12:42,889 --> 00:12:45,220
really know what EDM is electronic dance
music yeah right you could say Avicii

622
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:45,230
music yeah right you could say Avicii
 

623
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:48,059
music yeah right you could say Avicii
was one of the biggest in this genre so

624
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:48,069
was one of the biggest in this genre so
 

625
00:12:48,069 --> 00:12:51,100
was one of the biggest in this genre so
the main constraint is of time something

626
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:51,110
the main constraint is of time something
 

627
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:53,340
the main constraint is of time something
like three four or five minute songs

628
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:53,350
like three four or five minute songs
 

629
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:55,720
like three four or five minute songs
songs there were eight minutes ten

630
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:55,730
songs there were eight minutes ten
 

631
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:58,030
songs there were eight minutes ten
minutes and so forth because the you

632
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:58,040
minutes and so forth because the you
 

633
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:00,269
minutes and so forth because the you
know it started as a digital product

634
00:13:00,269 --> 00:13:00,279
know it started as a digital product
 

635
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:02,710
know it started as a digital product
that you downloaded so you didn't have

636
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:02,720
that you downloaded so you didn't have
 

637
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,619
that you downloaded so you didn't have
this this constraint anymore so I think

638
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:05,629
this this constraint anymore so I think
 

639
00:13:05,629 --> 00:13:07,030
this this constraint anymore so I think
it's something really interesting that I

640
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:07,040
it's something really interesting that I
 

641
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,519
it's something really interesting that I
don't think has fully happened yet we're

642
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:09,529
don't think has fully happened yet we're
 

643
00:13:09,529 --> 00:13:10,989
don't think has fully happened yet we're
kind of jumping ahead a little bit to

644
00:13:10,989 --> 00:13:10,999
kind of jumping ahead a little bit to
 

645
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:13,299
kind of jumping ahead a little bit to
where we are but I think there's there's

646
00:13:13,299 --> 00:13:13,309
where we are but I think there's there's
 

647
00:13:13,309 --> 00:13:15,939
where we are but I think there's there's
tons of formal innovation in music that

648
00:13:15,939 --> 00:13:15,949
tons of formal innovation in music that
 

649
00:13:15,949 --> 00:13:17,750
tons of formal innovation in music that
should happen now

650
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:17,760
should happen now
 

651
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,910
should happen now
that couldn't happen when you needed to

652
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:19,920
that couldn't happen when you needed to
 

653
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,110
that couldn't happen when you needed to
really adhere to the distribution

654
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:21,120
really adhere to the distribution
 

655
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,200
really adhere to the distribution
constraints if you didn't adhere to that

656
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:23,210
constraints if you didn't adhere to that
 

657
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:26,390
constraints if you didn't adhere to that
you will get no distribution so so jerk

658
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:26,400
you will get no distribution so so jerk
 

659
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,340
you will get no distribution so so jerk
for example

660
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:27,350
for example
 

661
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:30,410
for example
Icelandic artist she made a full I pad

662
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:30,420
Icelandic artist she made a full I pad
 

663
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:33,230
Icelandic artist she made a full I pad
app as an album that's very expensive

664
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:33,240
app as an album that's very expensive
 

665
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,840
app as an album that's very expensive
you know even though the App Store has

666
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:35,850
you know even though the App Store has
 

667
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:37,940
you know even though the App Store has
great distribution she gets nowhere near

668
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:37,950
great distribution she gets nowhere near
 

669
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:39,680
great distribution she gets nowhere near
the distribution versus staying within

670
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:39,690
the distribution versus staying within
 

671
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:43,430
the distribution versus staying within
the 3-minute format so I think now that

672
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:43,440
the 3-minute format so I think now that
 

673
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,650
the 3-minute format so I think now that
music is fully digital inside these

674
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:45,660
music is fully digital inside these
 

675
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,330
music is fully digital inside these
streaming services there is there is the

676
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:47,340
streaming services there is there is the
 

677
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:48,830
streaming services there is there is the
opportunity to change the format again

678
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:48,840
opportunity to change the format again
 

679
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,780
opportunity to change the format again
and allow creators to be much more

680
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:50,790
and allow creators to be much more
 

681
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:54,140
and allow creators to be much more
creative without limiting their their

682
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:54,150
creative without limiting their their
 

683
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:55,910
creative without limiting their their
distribution ability that's interesting

684
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:55,920
distribution ability that's interesting
 

685
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,240
distribution ability that's interesting
that you're right it's surprising we

686
00:13:59,240 --> 00:13:59,250
that you're right it's surprising we
 

687
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,010
that you're right it's surprising we
don't see that taking advantage more

688
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:01,020
don't see that taking advantage more
 

689
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:03,890
don't see that taking advantage more
often it's almost like the constraints

690
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:03,900
often it's almost like the constraints
 

691
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:06,460
often it's almost like the constraints
of the distribution from the 50s and 60s

692
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:06,470
of the distribution from the 50s and 60s
 

693
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:09,800
of the distribution from the 50s and 60s
have molded the culture to where we want

694
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:09,810
have molded the culture to where we want
 

695
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:13,130
have molded the culture to where we want
the five three to five minutes on that

696
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:13,140
the five three to five minutes on that
 

697
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:15,740
the five three to five minutes on that
anything else not just so we want the

698
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:15,750
anything else not just so we want the
 

699
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:19,070
anything else not just so we want the
song as consumers and as artists like I

700
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:19,080
song as consumers and as artists like I
 

701
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,290
song as consumers and as artists like I
cuz I write a lot of music and I never

702
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:21,300
cuz I write a lot of music and I never
 

703
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,960
cuz I write a lot of music and I never
even thought about writing something

704
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:22,970
even thought about writing something
 

705
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:27,440
even thought about writing something
longer than 10 minutes that's it's

706
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:27,450
longer than 10 minutes that's it's
 

707
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:28,340
longer than 10 minutes that's it's
really interesting that those

708
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:28,350
really interesting that those
 

709
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:29,870
really interesting that those
constraints because all your training

710
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:29,880
constraints because all your training
 

711
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:32,090
constraints because all your training
data has been three minutes right it's

712
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:32,100
data has been three minutes right it's
 

713
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:35,560
data has been three minutes right it's
right okay so yes digitization of data

714
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:35,570
right okay so yes digitization of data
 

715
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:38,480
right okay so yes digitization of data
later than mp3s

716
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:38,490
later than mp3s
 

717
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:40,690

yeah so I think you had this file then

718
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:40,700
yeah so I think you had this file then
 

719
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:44,090
yeah so I think you had this file then
that was distributed physically but then

720
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:44,100
that was distributed physically but then
 

721
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,860
that was distributed physically but then
you had the components of digital

722
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:45,870
you had the components of digital
 

723
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:47,180
you had the components of digital
distribution and then the internet

724
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:47,190
distribution and then the internet
 

725
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:49,970
distribution and then the internet
happened and there was this vacuum where

726
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:49,980
happened and there was this vacuum where
 

727
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:52,340
happened and there was this vacuum where
you had a format that could be digitally

728
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:52,350
you had a format that could be digitally
 

729
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:53,690
you had a format that could be digitally
shipped but there was no business model

730
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:53,700
shipped but there was no business model
 

731
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:57,800
shipped but there was no business model
and then all these pirate networks

732
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:57,810
and then all these pirate networks
 

733
00:14:57,810 --> 00:15:01,100
and then all these pirate networks
happen Napster and in pirate in Sweden

734
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:01,110
happen Napster and in pirate in Sweden
 

735
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:02,750
happen Napster and in pirate in Sweden
Pirate Bay which was one of the biggest

736
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:02,760
Pirate Bay which was one of the biggest
 

737
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:06,770
Pirate Bay which was one of the biggest
and it you know I think from a consumer

738
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:06,780
and it you know I think from a consumer
 

739
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,960
and it you know I think from a consumer
point of view which which kind of leads

740
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:08,970
point of view which which kind of leads
 

741
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:10,910
point of view which which kind of leads
up to the inception of of Spotify from a

742
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:10,920
up to the inception of of Spotify from a
 

743
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:14,210
up to the inception of of Spotify from a
consumer point of view consumers for the

744
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:14,220
consumer point of view consumers for the
 

745
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:15,920
consumer point of view consumers for the
first time had this access model to

746
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:15,930
first time had this access model to
 

747
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:19,130
first time had this access model to
music where they could without kind of

748
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:19,140
music where they could without kind of
 

749
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:23,510
music where they could without kind of
any marginal costs they could they could

750
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:23,520
any marginal costs they could they could
 

751
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:26,660
any marginal costs they could they could
try different tracks you could use music

752
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:26,670
try different tracks you could use music
 

753
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:28,250
try different tracks you could use music
in in new ways there was no marginal

754
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:28,260
in in new ways there was no marginal
 

755
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,470
in in new ways there was no marginal
cost and that was a fantastic consumer

756
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:30,480
cost and that was a fantastic consumer
 

757
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,310
cost and that was a fantastic consumer
experience that

758
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:31,320
experience that
 

759
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,070
experience that
just all the music ever made I think was

760
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:33,080
just all the music ever made I think was
 

761
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,690
just all the music ever made I think was
fantastic but it was all so horrible for

762
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:35,700
fantastic but it was all so horrible for
 

763
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,250
fantastic but it was all so horrible for
artists because there was no business

764
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:37,260
artists because there was no business
 

765
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,900
artists because there was no business
model around it so they didn't make any

766
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:38,910
model around it so they didn't make any
 

767
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:43,940
model around it so they didn't make any
money so the user need almost drove the

768
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:43,950
money so the user need almost drove the
 

769
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:45,320
money so the user need almost drove the
user interface before there was a

00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:45,330
user interface before there was a
 

771
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:47,330
user interface before there was a
business model and then there were these

772
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:47,340
business model and then there were these
 

773
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:50,090
business model and then there were these
download stores that allowed you to

774
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:50,100
download stores that allowed you to
 

775
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:53,330
download stores that allowed you to
download files which was a solution but

776
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:53,340
download files which was a solution but
 

777
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:55,400
download files which was a solution but
it didn't solve the access problem there

778
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:55,410
it didn't solve the access problem there
 

779
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:57,290
it didn't solve the access problem there
was still a marginal cost of 99 cents to

780
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:57,300
was still a marginal cost of 99 cents to
 

781
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,600
was still a marginal cost of 99 cents to
try one more track and I think that that

782
00:15:59,600 --> 00:15:59,610
try one more track and I think that that
 

783
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:01,460
try one more track and I think that that
heavily limits how you listen to music

00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,070
costed you $0.99 per three minutes you
probably wouldn't do that and you would

796
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:16,080
probably wouldn't do that and you would
 

797
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,540
probably wouldn't do that and you would
be much less adventurous if there was a

798
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:17,550
be much less adventurous if there was a
 

799
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:19,520
be much less adventurous if there was a
real dollar cost to exploring music so

800
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:19,530
real dollar cost to exploring music so
 

801
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:20,840
real dollar cost to exploring music so
the access model is interesting in that

802
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:20,850
the access model is interesting in that
 

803
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:23,240
the access model is interesting in that
it changes your music behavior you can

804
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:23,250
it changes your music behavior you can
 

805
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:25,940
it changes your music behavior you can
be you can take much more risk because

806
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:25,950
be you can take much more risk because
 

807
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:28,910
be you can take much more risk because
there's no marginal cost to it maybe let

808
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:28,920
there's no marginal cost to it maybe let
 

809
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,680
there's no marginal cost to it maybe let
me linger on piracy for a second because

810
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:30,690
me linger on piracy for a second because
 

811
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:33,490
me linger on piracy for a second because
I I find especially coming from Russia

812
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:33,500
I I find especially coming from Russia
 

813
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,300
I I find especially coming from Russia
piracy is something that's very

814
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:35,310
piracy is something that's very
 

815
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:41,270
piracy is something that's very
interesting to me not me of course ever

816
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:41,280
interesting to me not me of course ever
 

817
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:47,440
interesting to me not me of course ever
but my friends who partook in piracy of

818
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:47,450
but my friends who partook in piracy of
 

819
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:53,060
but my friends who partook in piracy of
music software TV shows sporting events

820
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:53,070
music software TV shows sporting events
 

821
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:55,940
music software TV shows sporting events
and usually to me what that shows is not

822
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:55,950
and usually to me what that shows is not
 

823
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:58,790
and usually to me what that shows is not
that they're they can actually pay the

824
00:16:58,790 --> 00:16:58,800
that they're they can actually pay the
 

825
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,710
that they're they can actually pay the
money and they're not trying to save

826
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:00,720
money and they're not trying to save
 

827
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,260
money and they're not trying to save
money they're choosing the best

828
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:03,270
money they're choosing the best
 

829
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:07,610
money they're choosing the best
experience so what to me piracy shows is

830
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:07,620
experience so what to me piracy shows is
 

831
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:09,199
experience so what to me piracy shows is
a business opportunity in all these

832
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:09,209
a business opportunity in all these
 

833
00:17:09,209 --> 00:17:11,960
a business opportunity in all these
domains and that's where I think you're

834
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:11,970
domains and that's where I think you're
 

835
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:14,470
domains and that's where I think you're
right spot if I stepped in is basically

836
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:14,480
right spot if I stepped in is basically
 

837
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,540
right spot if I stepped in is basically
piracy was is an experience you can

838
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:17,550
piracy was is an experience you can
 

839
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:20,050
piracy was is an experience you can
explore was fine music you like and

840
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:20,060
explore was fine music you like and
 

841
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:23,120
explore was fine music you like and
actually the interface of piracy isn't

842
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:23,130
actually the interface of piracy isn't
 

843
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:27,079
actually the interface of piracy isn't
as horrible because it's I mean it's not

844
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:27,089
as horrible because it's I mean it's not
 

845
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:29,390
as horrible because it's I mean it's not

846
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:29,400
metadata yeah that metadata is long
 

847
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,040

download times all kinds of stuff and

848
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:31,050
download times all kinds of stuff and
 

849
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:34,210

what Spotify does is basically

850
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:34,220
what Spotify does is basically
 

851
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:37,790
what Spotify does is basically
first rewards artists and second makes

00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:37,800
first rewards artists and second makes
 

853
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,710
first rewards artists and second makes
the experience of exploring music much

854
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:39,720
the experience of exploring music much
 

855
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,380
the experience of exploring music much
better I mean the same is true I think

856
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:42,390
better I mean the same is true I think
 

857
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:45,270
better I mean the same is true I think
for movies and so on this piracy reveals

858
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:45,280
for movies and so on this piracy reveals
 

859
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,310
for movies and so on this piracy reveals
in the software space for example I'm a

860
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:47,320
in the software space for example I'm a
 

861
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:51,410
in the software space for example I'm a
huge user and fan of Adobe products and

862
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:51,420
huge user and fan of Adobe products and
 

863
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:53,730
huge user and fan of Adobe products and
the there was much more incentive to

864
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:53,740
the there was much more incentive to
 

865
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:56,100
the there was much more incentive to
pirate Adobe products before they went

866
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:56,110
pirate Adobe products before they went
 

867
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:59,010
pirate Adobe products before they went
to a monthly subscription plan and now

868
00:17:59,010 --> 00:17:59,020
to a monthly subscription plan and now
 

869
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:01,140
to a monthly subscription plan and now
all of the sudden

870
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:01,150
all of the sudden
 

871
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:03,990
all of the sudden
that you used to pirate Adobe products

872
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:04,000
that you used to pirate Adobe products
 

873
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,170
that you used to pirate Adobe products
that I know now actually pay gladly for

874
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:07,180
that I know now actually pay gladly for
 

875
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:09,240
that I know now actually pay gladly for
the monthly subscription I think you're

876
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:09,250
the monthly subscription I think you're
 

877
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:11,160
the monthly subscription I think you're
right I think it's in it's a sign of an

878
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:11,170
right I think it's in it's a sign of an
 

879
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:12,720
right I think it's in it's a sign of an
opportunity for product development and

880
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:12,730
opportunity for product development and
 

881
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:17,010
opportunity for product development and
that sometimes the there's a product

882
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:17,020
that sometimes the there's a product
 

883
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:18,900
that sometimes the there's a product
market fit before there's a business

884
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:18,910
market fit before there's a business
 

885
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:21,600
market fit before there's a business
model fit in product development I think

886
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:21,610
model fit in product development I think
 

887
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:23,610
model fit in product development I think
that that is that's a sign of it in in

888
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:23,620
that that is that's a sign of it in in
 

889
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:26,070
that that is that's a sign of it in in
Sweden I think was a bit of both there

890
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:26,080
Sweden I think was a bit of both there
 

891
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,790
Sweden I think was a bit of both there
was there was a culture where even had a

892
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:29,800
was there was a culture where even had a
 

893
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,530
was there was a culture where even had a
political party called the pirate party

894
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:31,540
political party called the pirate party
 

895
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:33,810
political party called the pirate party
and this was during the time when when

896
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:33,820
and this was during the time when when
 

897
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,460
and this was during the time when when
people said that you know information

898
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:35,470
people said that you know information
 

899
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:37,320
people said that you know information
should be free it's not was somehow

900
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:37,330
should be free it's not was somehow
 

901
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:40,230
should be free it's not was somehow
wrong to charge for ones and zeros so I

902
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:40,240
wrong to charge for ones and zeros so I
 

903
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,320
wrong to charge for ones and zeros so I
think people felt that artists should

904
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:43,330
think people felt that artists should
 

905
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:45,030
think people felt that artists should
probably make some money somehow else

906
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:45,040
probably make some money somehow else
 

907
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,460
probably make some money somehow else
and you know concerts or something so at

908
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:47,470
and you know concerts or something so at
 

909
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:49,020
and you know concerts or something so at
least in Sweden it was part really

910
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:49,030
least in Sweden it was part really
 

911
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:51,120
least in Sweden it was part really
social acceptance even at the political

912
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:51,130
social acceptance even at the political
 

913
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,160
social acceptance even at the political
level and that but that also forced

914
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:53,170
level and that but that also forced
 

915
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:56,930
level and that but that also forced
Spotify to compete with with free which

916
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:56,940
Spotify to compete with with free which
 

917
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:59,010
Spotify to compete with with free which
which I don't think would actually could

918
00:18:59,010 --> 00:18:59,020
which I don't think would actually could
 

919
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:00,450
which I don't think would actually could
have happen anywhere else in the world

920
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:00,460
have happen anywhere else in the world
 

921
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:02,790
have happen anywhere else in the world
the music industry needed to be doing

922
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:02,800
the music industry needed to be doing
 

923
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,800
the music industry needed to be doing
bad enough to take that risk

924
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:04,810
bad enough to take that risk
 

925
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,630
bad enough to take that risk
and Sweden was like a perfect testing

926
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:06,640
and Sweden was like a perfect testing
 

927
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,810
and Sweden was like a perfect testing
ground it had government-funded

928
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:08,820
ground it had government-funded
 

929
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,920
ground it had government-funded
high-bandwidth low-latency broadband

930
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:10,930
high-bandwidth low-latency broadband
 

931
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:12,840
high-bandwidth low-latency broadband
which meant that the product would work

932
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:12,850
which meant that the product would work
 

933
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:14,790
which meant that the product would work
and it was also there was no music

934
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:14,800
and it was also there was no music
 

935
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,070
and it was also there was no music
revenue anyway so they were kind of like

936
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:17,080
revenue anyway so they were kind of like
 

937
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,570
revenue anyway so they were kind of like
I don't think this is going to work but

938
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:18,580
I don't think this is going to work but
 

939
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:20,610
I don't think this is going to work but
why not

940
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:20,620
why not
 

941
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:22,470
why not
so this product is one that I don't

942
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:22,480
so this product is one that I don't
 

943
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,670
so this product is one that I don't
think could have happened in America

944
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:23,680
think could have happened in America
 

945
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,140
think could have happened in America
there was large music market for example

946
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:25,150
there was large music market for example
 

947
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:27,870
there was large music market for example
so how do you compete with free because

948
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:27,880
so how do you compete with free because
 

949
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,910
so how do you compete with free because
that's an interesting world of the

950
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:29,920
that's an interesting world of the
 

951
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,610
that's an interesting world of the
Internet where most people don't like to

952
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:32,620
Internet where most people don't like to
 

953
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:36,210
Internet where most people don't like to
pay for things so Spotify steps in and

954
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:36,220
pay for things so Spotify steps in and
 

955
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:39,360
pay for things so Spotify steps in and
tries to yes compete with free how do

956
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:39,370
tries to yes compete with free how do
 

957
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:41,790
tries to yes compete with free how do
you do it so I think two things one is

958
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:41,800
you do it so I think two things one is
 

959
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,430
you do it so I think two things one is
people are starting to pay for things on

960
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:44,440
people are starting to pay for things on
 

961
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:44,970
people are starting to pay for things on
the Internet

962
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:44,980
the Internet
 

963
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:47,190
the Internet
I think one way to think about it was

964
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:47,200
I think one way to think about it was
 

965
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,100
I think one way to think about it was
that advertising was the first business

966
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:50,110
that advertising was the first business
 

967
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:51,540
that advertising was the first business
model because no one would put a credit

968
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:51,550
model because no one would put a credit
 

969
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:53,190
model because no one would put a credit
card on internet transactional with

970
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:53,200
card on internet transactional with
 

971
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,020
card on internet transactional with
Amazon was the second and maybe

972
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:55,030
Amazon was the second and maybe
 

973
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:56,520
Amazon was the second and maybe
subscription is their third and if you

974
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:56,530
subscription is their third and if you
 

975
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:58,530
subscription is their third and if you
look offline subscription is the biggest

976
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:58,540
look offline subscription is the biggest
 

977
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:01,110
look offline subscription is the biggest
those so that may still happen I think

978
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:01,120
those so that may still happen I think
 

979
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:01,920
those so that may still happen I think
people are starting to pay but

980
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:01,930
people are starting to pay but
 

981
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:03,570
people are starting to pay but
definitely back then we needed to

982
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:03,580
definitely back then we needed to
 

983
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:05,910
definitely back then we needed to
compete with free and the first thing

984
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:05,920
compete with free and the first thing
 

985
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,500
compete with free and the first thing
you need to do is obviously to lower the

986
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:07,510
you need to do is obviously to lower the
 

987
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:10,620
you need to do is obviously to lower the
price to free and then you need to be

988
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:10,630
price to free and then you need to be
 

989
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:13,410
price to free and then you need to be
better somehow and the way that Spotify

990
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:13,420
better somehow and the way that Spotify
 

991
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,780
better somehow and the way that Spotify
was better was on the user experience on

992
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:15,790
was better was on the user experience on
 

993
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:17,970
was better was on the user experience on
the on the actual performance the

994
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:17,980
the on the actual performance the
 

995
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:22,530
the on the actual performance the
latency of you know even if even if you

996
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:22,540
latency of you know even if even if you
 

997
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:26,970
latency of you know even if even if you
had high bandwidth broadband it would

998
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:26,980
had high bandwidth broadband it would
 

999
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:28,860
had high bandwidth broadband it would
still take you thirty Seconds to a

1000
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:28,870
still take you thirty Seconds to a
 

1001
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:30,210
still take you thirty Seconds to a
minute to download one of these tracks

1002
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:30,220
minute to download one of these tracks
 

1003
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:32,280
minute to download one of these tracks
so the Spotify experience of starting

1004
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:32,290
so the Spotify experience of starting
 

1005
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:34,620
so the Spotify experience of starting
within the perceptual limit of immediacy

1006
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:34,630
within the perceptual limit of immediacy
 

1007
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:38,010
within the perceptual limit of immediacy
about 250 milliseconds meant that the

1008
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:38,020
about 250 milliseconds meant that the
 

1009
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:40,260
about 250 milliseconds meant that the
the whole trick was that felt as if you

1010
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:40,270
the whole trick was that felt as if you
 

1011
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:41,970
the whole trick was that felt as if you
had downloaded all the part that it was

1012
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:41,980
had downloaded all the part that it was
 

1013
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:43,860
had downloaded all the part that it was
on your harddrive it was that fast even

1014
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:43,870
on your harddrive it was that fast even
 

1015
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:46,440
on your harddrive it was that fast even
though it wasn't and it was still free

1016
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:46,450
though it wasn't and it was still free
 

1017
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:48,990
though it wasn't and it was still free
but somehow you were actually still

1018
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:49,000
but somehow you were actually still
 

1019
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,660
but somehow you were actually still
being a legal citizen now that was the

1020
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:51,670
being a legal citizen now that was the
 

1021
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:53,820
being a legal citizen now that was the
trick that's what if I managed to to

1022
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:53,830
trick that's what if I managed to to
 

1023
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:56,250
trick that's what if I managed to to
pull off so yeah I've actually heard you

1024
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:56,260
pull off so yeah I've actually heard you
 

1025
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:58,860
pull off so yeah I've actually heard you
say this to write this and that was

1026
00:20:58,860 --> 00:20:58,870
say this to write this and that was
 

1027
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:00,510
say this to write this and that was
surprised that wasn't aware of it

1028
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:00,520
surprised that wasn't aware of it
 

1029
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,610
surprised that wasn't aware of it
because I just took it for granted you

1030
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:02,620
because I just took it for granted you
 

1031
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:04,080
because I just took it for granted you
know whenever an awesome thing comes

1032
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:04,090
know whenever an awesome thing comes
 

1033
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:06,090
know whenever an awesome thing comes
along you just like of course it has to

1034
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:06,100
along you just like of course it has to
 

1035
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,250
along you just like of course it has to
be this way that that's exactly right

1036
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:08,260
be this way that that's exactly right
 

1037
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:10,500
be this way that that's exactly right
that it felt like the entire world's

1038
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:10,510
that it felt like the entire world's
 

1039

that it felt like the entire world's
libraries at my fingertips because of

1040
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:12,820
libraries at my fingertips because of
 

1041
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:15,990
libraries at my fingertips because of
that of that latency being reduced what

1042
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:16,000
that of that latency being reduced what
 

1043
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,270
that of that latency being reduced what
was the technical challenge in reducing

1044
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:18,280
was the technical challenge in reducing

of an interesting backstory to Spotify

1056
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:34,060
of an interesting backstory to Spotify
 

1057
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:37,020
of an interesting backstory to Spotify
you know that we have one of the top

1058
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:37,030
you know that we have one of the top
 

1059
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:39,300
you know that we have one of the top
developers from from BitTorrent clients

1060
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:39,310
developers from from BitTorrent clients
 

1061
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:41,280
developers from from BitTorrent clients
as well so he wrote utorrent the world's

1062
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:41,290
as well so he wrote utorrent the world's
 

1063
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:45,600
as well so he wrote utorrent the world's
smallest BitTorrent clients and then he

1064
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:45,610
smallest BitTorrent clients and then he
 

1065
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:48,120
smallest BitTorrent clients and then he
he was acquired very early by daniel and

1066
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:48,130
he was acquired very early by daniel and
 

1067
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:50,760
he was acquired very early by daniel and
martin who found it spotify and they

1068
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:50,770
martin who found it spotify and they
 

1069
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:52,500
martin who found it spotify and they
actually sold the u torrent client to

1070
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:52,510
actually sold the u torrent client to
 

1071
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:54,930
actually sold the u torrent client to
BitTorrent but kept living so Spotify

1072
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:54,940
BitTorrent but kept living so Spotify
 

1073
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:57,680
BitTorrent but kept living so Spotify
had a lot of experience within

1074
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:57,690
had a lot of experience within
 

1075
00:21:57,690 --> 00:22:01,440
had a lot of experience within
peer-to-peer networking so the original

1076
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:01,450
peer-to-peer networking so the original
 

1077
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:03,150
peer-to-peer networking so the original
innovation wasn't was a distribution

1078
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:03,160
innovation wasn't was a distribution
 

1079
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,460
innovation wasn't was a distribution
innovation where Spotify built an

1080
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:05,470
innovation where Spotify built an
 

1081
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:07,410
innovation where Spotify built an
end-to-end media distribution system up

1082
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:07,420
end-to-end media distribution system up
 

1083
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:08,760
end-to-end media distribution system up
until only a few years ago we actually

1084
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:08,770
until only a few years ago we actually
 

1085
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:10,980
until only a few years ago we actually
hosted all the music ourselves so we had

1086
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:10,990
hosted all the music ourselves so we had
 

1087
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:12,300
hosted all the music ourselves so we had
both the server side in the cloud

1088
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:12,310
both the server side in the cloud
 

1089
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:14,190
both the server side in the cloud
and that meant that we could do things

1090
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:14,200
and that meant that we could do things
 

1091
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,440
and that meant that we could do things
such as having a peer-to-peer solution

1092
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:16,450
such as having a peer-to-peer solution
 

1093
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:19,320
such as having a peer-to-peer solution
to use local caching on the client-side

1094
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:19,330
to use local caching on the client-side
 

1095
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:20,970
to use local caching on the client-side
because back then the world was mostly

1096
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:20,980
because back then the world was mostly
 

1097
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:23,280
because back then the world was mostly
desktop but we could also do things like

1098
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:23,290
desktop but we could also do things like
 

1099
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:25,740
desktop but we could also do things like
hack the TCP protocols

1100
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:25,750
hack the TCP protocols
 

1101
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:27,780
hack the TCP protocols
things like niggles algorithm for kind

1102
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:27,790
things like niggles algorithm for kind
 

1103
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:30,390
things like niggles algorithm for kind
of exponential back-off or ramp up and

video content as far as I know Spotify

1158
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:38,890
video content as far as I know Spotify
 

1159
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:41,220
video content as far as I know Spotify
doesn't have video content well we do

1160
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:41,230
doesn't have video content well we do

have music videos and we do have videos
 

1163
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:45,780
have music videos and we do have videos
on the on the service but the way we

1164
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:45,790
on the on the service but the way we
 

1165
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:48,090
on the on the service but the way we
think about ourselves is that we're an

1166
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:48,100
think about ourselves is that we're an
 

1167
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:51,750
think about ourselves is that we're an
audio service and we think that if you

1168
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:51,760
audio service and we think that if you
 

1169
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,070
audio service and we think that if you
look at the amount of time that people

1170
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:53,080
look at the amount of time that people
 

1171
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:55,230
look at the amount of time that people
spend on audio it's actually very

1172
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:55,240
spend on audio it's actually very
 

1173
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,760
spend on audio it's actually very
similar to the amount of time that's

1174
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:56,770
similar to the amount of time that's
 

1175
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:59,550
similar to the amount of time that's
people spend on video so the opportunity

1176
00:23:59,550 --> 00:23:59,560
people spend on video so the opportunity
 

1177
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:02,220
people spend on video so the opportunity
should be equally big but today is not

1178
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:02,230
should be equally big but today is not
 

1179
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:04,200
should be equally big but today is not
at all valued videos value much higher

1180
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:04,210
at all valued videos value much higher
 

1181
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:07,470
at all valued videos value much higher
so we think it's basically completely

1182
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:07,480
so we think it's basically completely
 

1183
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,120
so we think it's basically completely
undervalues we think of ourselves as an

00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:09,130
undervalues we think of ourselves as an
 

1185
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:11,430
undervalues we think of ourselves as an
audio service but within that audio

1186
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:11,440
audio service but within that audio
 

1187
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,350
audio service but within that audio
service I think video can make a lot of

1188
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:13,360
service I think video can make a lot of
 

1189
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,660
service I think video can make a lot of
sense I think for when you're when

1190
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:15,670
sense I think for when you're when
 

1191
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:17,160

you're discovering an artist you

00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:17,170
you're discovering an artist you
 

1193
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:18,510
you're discovering an artist you
probably do want to see them and

1194
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:18,520
probably do want to see them and
 

1195
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:20,010
probably do want to see them and
understand who they are to understand

1196
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:20,020
understand who they are to understand
 

1197
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:21,690
understand who they are to understand
their identity you won't see the video

1198
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:21,700
their identity you won't see the video
 

1199
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:23,610
their identity you won't see the video
every time now 90% of the time the phone

1200
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:23,620
every time now 90% of the time the phone
 

1201
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:25,120

for podcasters you use video I think

1204
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:27,620
for podcasters you use video I think
 

1205
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:29,020
for podcasters you use video I think
that can make a ton of sense so we do

1206
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:29,030
that can make a ton of sense so we do
 

1207
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:30,640
that can make a ton of sense so we do
have video but we're an audio service

1208
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:30,650
have video but we're an audio service
 

1209
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:32,830
have video but we're an audio service
where think of it as we call it

1210
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:32,840
where think of it as we call it
 

1211
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:35,500
where think of it as we call it
internally background able video video

that is helpful but isn't isn't the

1214
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:37,820
that is helpful but isn't isn't the
 

1215
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:40,659
that is helpful but isn't isn't the
driver of the narrative I think also if

1216
00:24:40,659 --> 00:24:40,669
driver of the narrative I think also if
 

1217
00:24:40,669 --> 00:24:44,049
driver of the narrative I think also if
we look at YouTube the way people

1218
00:24:44,049 --> 00:24:44,059
we look at YouTube the way people
 

1219
00:24:44,059 --> 00:24:47,560
we look at YouTube the way people
there's quite a few folks who listen to

1220
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:47,570
there's quite a few folks who listen to
 

1221
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:48,669
there's quite a few folks who listen to
music on YouTube

1222
00:24:48,669 --> 00:24:48,679
music on YouTube
 

1223
00:24:48,679 --> 00:24:50,230
music on YouTube
so in some sense YouTube was a bit of a

1224
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:50,240
so in some sense YouTube was a bit of a
 

1225
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:54,190
so in some sense YouTube was a bit of a
competitor to to Spotify which is very

1226
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:54,200
competitor to to Spotify which is very
 

1227
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,500
competitor to to Spotify which is very
strange to me that people use YouTube to

1228
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:56,510
strange to me that people use YouTube to
 

1229
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:58,810
strange to me that people use YouTube to
listen to music they play essentially

1230
00:24:58,810 --> 00:24:58,820
listen to music they play essentially
 

1231
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:01,360
listen to music they play essentially
the music videos right but don't watch

1232
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:01,370
the music videos right but don't watch
 

1233
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:03,010
the music videos right but don't watch
the videos and put it in their pocket

1234
00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:03,020
the videos and put it in their pocket
 

1235
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:06,810
the videos and put it in their pocket
well I think I think it's similar to to

1236
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:06,820
well I think I think it's similar to to
 

1237
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:10,840
well I think I think it's similar to to
what strange I mean it's similar to what

1238
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:10,850
what strange I mean it's similar to what
 

1239
00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:13,600
what strange I mean it's similar to what
we were for the piracy networks know

00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:13,610
we were for the piracy networks know
 

1241
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:17,220
we were for the piracy networks know
where YouTube for historical reasons

people use YouTube for a lot of the
 

1247
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:24,520
people use YouTube for a lot of the
discovery part of the process I think

1248
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:24,530
discovery part of the process I think
 

1249
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:27,310
discovery part of the process I think
but then it's not a really good sort of

1250
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:27,320
but then it's not a really good sort of
 

1251

1253
00:25:29,299 --> 00:25:30,520

1255
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:32,919
doesn't even background then you have to
keep the app in the foreground so so the

00:25:32,919 --> 00:25:32,929
keep the app in the foreground so so the

1259
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:36,340
consumption on a good consumption tool
but it's a decently good discoveries I

1260
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:36,350
but it's a decently good discoveries I
 

1261
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:37,539
but it's a decently good discoveries I
mean I think YouTube is fantastic

time through piracy so one way to think
 

1325
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,610
time through piracy so one way to think
about Spotify it was just legal and fast

1326
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:53,620
about Spotify it was just legal and fast
 

1327
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:55,440
about Spotify it was just legal and fast
piracy yeah and so people have been

1328
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:55,450
piracy yeah and so people have been
 

1329
00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:57,840
piracy yeah and so people have been
using it for a long time so they weren't

1330
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:57,850
using it for a long time so they weren't
 

1331
00:26:57,850 --> 00:26:59,640
using it for a long time so they weren't
alien to it they didn't really

1332
00:26:59,640 --> 00:26:59,650
alien to it they didn't really
 

1333
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:01,500
alien to it they didn't really
understand how it could be legal because

1334
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:01,510
understand how it could be legal because
 

1335
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:03,210
understand how it could be legal because
it was seemed too fast and too good to

1336
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:03,220
it was seemed too fast and too good to
 

1337
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:04,650
it was seemed too fast and too good to
be true yeah which i think is a great

1338
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:04,660
be true yeah which i think is a great
 

1339
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:06,360
be true yeah which i think is a great
product proposition if you can be too

1340
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:06,370
product proposition if you can be too
 

1341
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:09,450
product proposition if you can be too
good to be true but what I saw again and

1342
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:09,460
good to be true but what I saw again and
 

1343
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:11,070
good to be true but what I saw again and
again was people showing each other

1344
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:11,080
again was people showing each other
 

1345
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,570
again was people showing each other
clicking the song showing how fast it

1346
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:12,580
clicking the song showing how fast it
 

1347
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:14,130
clicking the song showing how fast it
started and saying I can't believe this

1348
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:14,140
started and saying I can't believe this
 

1349
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:16,220
started and saying I can't believe this
yeah so I really think it was about

1350
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:16,230
yeah so I really think it was about
 

1351
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:20,280
yeah so I really think it was about
speed then we also had an invite product

1352
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:20,290
speed then we also had an invite product
 

1353
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:22,680
speed then we also had an invite product
program that was there was really meant

1354
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:22,690
program that was there was really meant
 

1355
00:27:22,690 --> 00:27:24,270
program that was there was really meant
for scaling because we hosted our own

1356
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:24,280
for scaling because we hosted our own
 

1357
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,920
for scaling because we hosted our own
service we needed as a control scaling

1358
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:25,930
service we needed as a control scaling
 

1359
00:27:25,930 --> 00:27:28,920
service we needed as a control scaling
but that built a lot of expectation and

1360
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:28,930
but that built a lot of expectation and
 

1361
00:27:28,930 --> 00:27:32,160
but that built a lot of expectation and
I don't want to say hype because I hype

1362
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:32,170
I don't want to say hype because I hype
 

1363
00:27:32,170 --> 00:27:35,570
I don't want to say hype because I hype
implies that it was that it wasn't true

1364
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:35,580
implies that it was that it wasn't true
 

1365
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:38,340
implies that it was that it wasn't true
excitement around the product and we've

1366
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:38,350
excitement around the product and we've
 

1367
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:39,750
excitement around the product and we've
replicated that when we launched in the

1368
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:39,760
replicated that when we launched in the
 

1369
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,630
replicated that when we launched in the
in the US we also built up and it might

1370
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:42,640
in the US we also built up and it might
 

1371
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,890
in the US we also built up and it might
only program first there are lots of

1372
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:43,900
only program first there are lots of
 

1373
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:46,800
only program first there are lots of
tactics but I think you need a you need

1374
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:46,810
tactics but I think you need a you need
 

1375
00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:48,480
tactics but I think you need a you need
a great product that solves some problem

1376
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:48,490
a great product that solves some problem
 

1377
00:27:48,490 --> 00:27:52,890
a great product that solves some problem
and B basically the key innovation there

1378
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:52,900
and B basically the key innovation there
 

1379
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,840
and B basically the key innovation there
was technology but on a method level the

1380
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:54,850
was technology but on a method level the
 

1381
00:27:54,850 --> 00:27:56,460
was technology but on a method level the
innovation was really the access model

1382
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:56,470
innovation was really the access model
 

1383
00:27:56,470 --> 00:27:58,590
innovation was really the access model
versus the ownership model and that was

1384
00:27:58,590 --> 00:27:58,600
versus the ownership model and that was
 

1385
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:01,530
versus the ownership model and that was
tricky a lot of people said that they I

1386
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:01,540
tricky a lot of people said that they I
 

1387
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:04,770
tricky a lot of people said that they I
mean they wanted to own their music they

1388
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:04,780
mean they wanted to own their music they
 

1389
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:07,110
mean they wanted to own their music they
would never kind of rent it or borrow it

1390
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:07,120
would never kind of rent it or borrow it
 

1391
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,940
would never kind of rent it or borrow it
but I think the fact that we had a free

1392
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:08,950
but I think the fact that we had a free
 

1393
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:11,070
but I think the fact that we had a free
tier which meant that you get to keep

1394
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:11,080
tier which meant that you get to keep
 

1395
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,600
tier which meant that you get to keep
this music for life as well

1396
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:12,610
this music for life as well
 

1397
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:15,330
this music for life as well
helped quite a lot so this is an

1398
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:15,340
helped quite a lot so this is an
 

1399
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:17,550
helped quite a lot so this is an
interesting psychological point maybe

1400
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:17,560
interesting psychological point maybe
 

1401
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:20,010
interesting psychological point maybe
you can speak to it was a big shift for

1402
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:20,020
you can speak to it was a big shift for
 

1403
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:23,880
you can speak to it was a big shift for
me like I get to it's almost like a I go

1407
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,860
to therapy for this is uh I think I
would describe my early listening

1408
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:28,870
would describe my early listening
 

1409
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:30,240
would describe my early listening
experience and I think a lot of my

1410

1498
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:11,529
the problem is I think because you paid
 

1499
00:30:11,529 --> 00:30:14,129
the problem is I think because you paid
us a subscription if we hadn't had the

us a subscription if we hadn't had the

us a subscription if we hadn't had the

forever they don't disappear even though
 

1509
00:30:21,009 --> 00:30:22,409
forever they don't disappear even though
you stopped paying I think that was

1510
00:30:22,409 --> 00:30:22,419
you stopped paying I think that was
 

1511
00:30:22,419 --> 00:30:23,820
you stopped paying I think that was
really important if we would have

1512
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:23,830
really important if we would have
 

1513
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:26,609
really important if we would have
started us you know you can put in all

1514
00:30:26,609 --> 00:30:26,619
started us you know you can put in all
 

1515
00:30:26,619 --> 00:30:28,109
started us you know you can put in all
this time but if you stopped paying you

1516
00:30:28,109 --> 00:30:28,119
this time but if you stopped paying you
 

1517
00:30:28,119 --> 00:30:30,119
this time but if you stopped paying you
lose all your work I think that would

1518
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:30,129
lose all your work I think that would
 

1519
00:30:30,129 --> 00:30:31,859
lose all your work I think that would
have been a big challenge and what's the

1520
00:30:31,859 --> 00:30:31,869
have been a big challenge and what's the
 

1521
00:30:31,869 --> 00:30:32,999
have been a big challenge and what's the
big challenge for a lot of our

1522
00:30:32,999 --> 00:30:33,009
big challenge for a lot of our
 

1523
00:30:33,009 --> 00:30:34,379
big challenge for a lot of our
competitors that's another reason why I

1524
00:30:34,379 --> 00:30:34,389
competitors that's another reason why I
 

1525
00:30:34,389 --> 00:30:36,239
competitors that's another reason why I
think the free tier is really important

1526
00:30:36,239 --> 00:30:36,249
think the free tier is really important
 

1527
00:30:36,249 --> 00:30:38,190
think the free tier is really important
that people need to feel the security

1528
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:38,200
that people need to feel the security
 

1529
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,869
that people need to feel the security
that the work they put in it will never

1530
00:30:39,869 --> 00:30:39,879
that the work they put in it will never
 

1531
00:30:39,879 --> 00:30:41,700
that the work they put in it will never
disappear even if they decide not to pay

1532
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:41,710
disappear even if they decide not to pay

doing that I was listening to a small
 

1549
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:05,730
doing that I was listening to a small
selection of songs way too much to our

I listened to stairway to heaven over

1558
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:13,630
I listened to stairway to heaven over
 

1559
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:15,480
I listened to stairway to heaven over
and over but because of the extra

00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:21,990
there is an interesting statistic I saw
that so

1566
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:22,000
that so

00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:28,090
over 50 million songs tracks and over
 

1571
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:33,270
over 50 million songs tracks and over
three billion playlists so yes a million

1572
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:33,280
three billion playlists so yes a million
 

1573
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:35,940
three billion playlists so yes a million
songs and three billion playlists 60

1574
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:35,950
songs and three billion playlists 60
 

1575
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:39,090
songs and three billion playlists 60
times more playlists what do you make of

1576
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:39,100
times more playlists what do you make of
 

1577
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:42,000
times more playlists what do you make of
that yeah so the way I think about it is

1578
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:42,010
that yeah so the way I think about it is
 

1579
00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:46,110
that yeah so the way I think about it is
that from a from is that the station or

00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:46,120
that from a from is that the station or
 

1581
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:48,750
that from a from is that the station or
machine learning point of view you have

1582
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:48,760
machine learning point of view you have
 

1583
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:51,000
machine learning point of view you have
all these if you only thing about

1584
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:51,010
all these if you only thing about
 

1585
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:52,290
all these if you only thing about
reinforcement learning where you have

1586
00:31:52,290 --> 00:31:52,300
reinforcement learning where you have
 

1587
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:54,360
reinforcement learning where you have
this state space of all the tracks and

1588
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:54,370
this state space of all the tracks and
 

1589
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:55,770
this state space of all the tracks and
you can take different journeys through

1590
00:31:55,770 --> 00:31:55,780
you can take different journeys through
 

1591
00:31:55,780 --> 00:32:00,299
you can take different journeys through
this through this world and these I

1592
00:32:00,299 --> 00:32:00,309
this through this world and these I
 

1593
00:32:00,309 --> 00:32:03,240
this through this world and these I
think of these is like people helping

1594
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:03,250
think of these is like people helping
 

1595
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:05,640
think of these is like people helping
themselves and each other creating

1596
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:05,650
themselves and each other creating
 

1597
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:07,860
themselves and each other creating
interesting vectors through this space

1598
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:07,870
interesting vectors through this space
 

1599
00:32:07,870 --> 00:32:09,540
interesting vectors through this space
of tracks and then it's not so

1600
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:09,550
of tracks and then it's not so
 

1601
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:11,610
of tracks and then it's not so
surprising that across you know many

1602
00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:11,620
surprising that across you know many
 

1603
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:14,070
surprising that across you know many
tens of millions of kind of atomic units

1604
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:14,080
tens of millions of kind of atomic units
 

1605
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,410
tens of millions of kind of atomic units
there will be billions of paths that

1606
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:16,420
there will be billions of paths that
 

1607
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:18,060
there will be billions of paths that
make sense and we're probably pretty

1608
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:18,070
make sense and we're probably pretty
 

1609
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:21,330
make sense and we're probably pretty
quite far away from having found all of

search box that was for that time pretty
 

1617
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:31,799
search box that was for that time pretty
powerful and then I'd like to refer to

powerful and then I'd like to refer to
 

1619
00:32:31,809 --> 00:32:33,330
powerful and then I'd like to refer to
that this programming language called

actually enough if you had the catalog
in a good search tool and you can create

up so what we did to try to scale this

1664
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:14,470
up so what we did to try to scale this
 

1665
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:17,970
up so what we did to try to scale this
was to essentially try to build you can

00:33:24,730 --> 00:33:28,700
this music catalog that's what we're
trying to do for you but also there is

trying to do for you but also there is
 

1677
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:33,570
trying to do for you but also there is
something like 200 million active users

something like 200 million active users
 

1679
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:37,500
something like 200 million active users
on Spotify so there it's okay so from

00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:37,510
on Spotify so there it's okay so from
 

1681
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:39,990
on Spotify so there it's okay so from
the machine learning perspective you

1682

the machine learning perspective you
have these 200 million people plus

1684

have these 200 million people plus
 

1685
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,950
have these 200 million people plus
they're creating it's really interesting

00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:46,960
they're creating it's really interesting

know if you meant it that way but it's

00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:53,590
know if you meant it that way but it's
 

1691
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:55,110
know if you meant it that way but it's
almost like a programming language it's

how can playlist be used as data in
 

1707
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:22,740
how can playlist be used as data in
terms of machine learning and just to

00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:22,750
terms of machine learning and just to
 

1709
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:26,460
terms of machine learning and just to
help Spotify organize the music so we

1710
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:26,470
help Spotify organize the music so we
 

1711
00:34:26,470 --> 00:34:29,250
help Spotify organize the music so we
found in our data not surprising that

1712
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:29,260
found in our data not surprising that
 

1713
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:31,860
found in our data not surprising that
people who play listed lots they retain

people who play listed lots they retain
 

1715
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:32,940
people who play listed lots they retain
much better they had a great experience

1716
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:32,950
much better they had a great experience
 

1717
00:34:32,950 --> 00:34:36,180
much better they had a great experience
and so our first attempt was to playlist

1718
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:36,190
and so our first attempt was to playlist
 

1719
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:38,490
and so our first attempt was to playlist
for users and so we acquired this

as dumb luck we looked at these
 

1773
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:43,230
as dumb luck we looked at these
playlists and we had some people in the

1774
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:43,240

2007-2008 back then it was mostly
 

1783
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,530
2007-2008 back then it was mostly
collaborative filtering you so forth but

1784
00:35:54,530 --> 00:35:54,540
collaborative filtering you so forth but
 

1785
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:58,350
collaborative filtering you so forth but
we realized that what what this is is

1786
00:35:58,350 --> 00:35:58,360
we realized that what what this is is
 

1787
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,970
we realized that what what this is is
people are grouping tracks for

1788
00:35:59,970 --> 00:35:59,980
people are grouping tracks for
 

1789
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:01,440
people are grouping tracks for
themselves that have some semantic

1790
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:01,450
themselves that have some semantic
 

1791
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:03,720
themselves that have some semantic
meaning to them and then they actually

1792
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:03,730
meaning to them and then they actually
 

1793
00:36:03,730 --> 00:36:06,810
meaning to them and then they actually
label it with a playlist name as well so

1794
00:36:06,810 --> 00:36:06,820
label it with a playlist name as well so
 

1795
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:09,150
label it with a playlist name as well so
in a sense people were grouping tracks

1796
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:09,160
in a sense people were grouping tracks
 

1797
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:11,250
in a sense people were grouping tracks
along semantic dimensions and labeling

1798
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:11,260
along semantic dimensions and labeling
 

1799
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:14,520
along semantic dimensions and labeling
them and so could you could you use that

1800
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:14,530
them and so could you could you use that
 

1801
00:36:14,530 --> 00:36:17,340
them and so could you could you use that
information to find that that latent

1802
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:17,350
information to find that that latent
 

1803
00:36:17,350 --> 00:36:21,300
information to find that that latent
embedding and so we started playing

1804
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:21,310
embedding and so we started playing
 

1805
00:36:21,310 --> 00:36:24,170
embedding and so we started playing
around with collaborative filtering and

1806
00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:24,180
around with collaborative filtering and
 

1807
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:26,850
around with collaborative filtering and
we saw tremendous success with it

1808
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:26,860
we saw tremendous success with it
 

1809
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:29,700
we saw tremendous success with it
basically trying to extract some of

1810
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:29,710
basically trying to extract some of
 

1811
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:31,560
basically trying to extract some of
these some of these dimensions and and

1812
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:31,570
these some of these dimensions and and
 

1813
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:32,880
these some of these dimensions and and
if you think about it's not surprising

1814
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:32,890
if you think about it's not surprising
 

1815
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:35,900
if you think about it's not surprising
at all it'd be quite surprising if

1816
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:35,910
at all it'd be quite surprising if
 

1817
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:38,040
at all it'd be quite surprising if
playlists were actually random if they

1818
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:38,050
playlists were actually random if they
 

1819
00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:40,650
playlists were actually random if they
had no semantic meaning for most people

1820
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:40,660
had no semantic meaning for most people
 

1821
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:42,210
had no semantic meaning for most people
they group these tracks for some reason

1822
00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:42,220
they group these tracks for some reason
 

1823
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:44,580
they group these tracks for some reason
so we just happen to cross this

1824
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:44,590
so we just happen to cross this
 

1825
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:46,500
so we just happen to cross this
incredible data set where people are

1826
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:46,510
incredible data set where people are
 

1827
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:48,450
incredible data set where people are
taking taken these tens of millions of

1828
00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:48,460
taking taken these tens of millions of
 

1829
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:50,520
taking taken these tens of millions of
tracks and group them along different

1830
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:50,530
tracks and group them along different
 

1831
00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:54,180
tracks and group them along different
semantic vectors and the semantics being

1832
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:54,190
semantic vectors and the semantics being
 

1833
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:56,010
semantic vectors and the semantics being
outside the individual users it's some

1834
00:36:56,010 --> 00:36:56,020
outside the individual users it's some
 

1835
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:58,940
outside the individual users it's some
kind of universal there's a universal

1836
00:36:58,940 --> 00:36:58,950
kind of universal there's a universal
 

1837
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:01,830
kind of universal there's a universal
embedding that holds across people on

1839
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:05,370

this earth yes I do think that the

1840
00:37:05,370 --> 00:37:05,380
this earth yes I do think that the
 

1841
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:06,450
this earth yes I do think that the
embeddings you finally gonna be

1842
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:06,460

1843
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:08,130

so if if you have a lot of indie lovers

1846
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:11,020
so if if you have a lot of indie lovers
 

1847
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,780
so if if you have a lot of indie lovers
who playlist your embed is going to

1848
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:12,790
who playlist your embed is going to
 

1849
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:15,630
who playlist your embed is going to
perform better there but what we found

1850
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:15,640
perform better there but what we found
 

1851
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:18,560
perform better there but what we found
was that yes there were these these

1852
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:18,570
was that yes there were these these
 

1853
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:21,180
was that yes there were these these
latent similarities they were very

1854
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:21,190
latent similarities they were very
 

1855
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:23,700
latent similarities they were very
powerful and we we had them it was

1856
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:23,710
powerful and we we had them it was
 

1857
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:26,760
powerful and we we had them it was
interesting because I think that the

1858
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:26,770
interesting because I think that the
 

1859
00:37:26,770 --> 00:37:27,780
interesting because I think that the
people who play listed the most

1860
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:27,790
people who play listed the most
 

1861
00:37:27,790 --> 00:37:30,120
people who play listed the most
initially were this so-called music

1862
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:30,130
initially were this so-called music
 

1863
00:37:30,130 --> 00:37:32,370
initially were this so-called music
aficionados who who really into music

1864
00:37:32,370 --> 00:37:32,380
aficionados who who really into music
 

1865
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:35,610
aficionados who who really into music
and they often had a certain they're

1866
00:37:35,610 --> 00:37:35,620
and they often had a certain they're
 

1867
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:37,830
and they often had a certain they're
tasteful stuff is often certain geared

1868
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:37,840
tasteful stuff is often certain geared
 

1869
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:40,170
tasteful stuff is often certain geared
towards a certain type of music and so

1870
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:40,180
towards a certain type of music and so
 

1871
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:41,970
towards a certain type of music and so
what surprised us if you look at the

1872
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:41,980
what surprised us if you look at the
 

1873
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:43,650
what surprised us if you look at the
problem from the outside you might

1874
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:43,660
problem from the outside you might
 

1875
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:45,190
problem from the outside you might
expect that

1876
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:45,200
expect that

best with mainstreamers first because it

1880
00:37:49,299 --> 00:37:49,309
best with mainstreamers first because it
 

1881
00:37:49,309 --> 00:37:51,009
best with mainstreamers first because it
somehow feels like an easier problem to

00:37:51,009 --> 00:37:51,019
somehow feels like an easier problem to
 

1883
00:37:51,019 --> 00:37:52,960
somehow feels like an easier problem to
solve mainstream tastes than really

1884
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:52,970
solve mainstream tastes than really
 

1885
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:55,000
solve mainstream tastes than really
particular tastes it was the complete

1886
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:55,010
particular tastes it was the complete
 

1887
00:37:55,010 --> 00:37:57,220
particular tastes it was the complete
opposite for us the recommendations

1888
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:57,230
opposite for us the recommendations
 

1889
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:58,809
opposite for us the recommendations
performed fantastically for people who

1890
00:37:58,809 --> 00:37:58,819
performed fantastically for people who
 

1891
00:37:58,819 --> 00:38:01,269
performed fantastically for people who
saw themselves as having very unique

1892
00:38:01,269 --> 00:38:01,279
saw themselves as having very unique
 

1893
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:03,309
saw themselves as having very unique
taste that's probably because all of

1894
00:38:03,309 --> 00:38:03,319
taste that's probably because all of
 

1895
00:38:03,319 --> 00:38:05,470
taste that's probably because all of
them playlist ed and they didn't perform

1896
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:05,480
them playlist ed and they didn't perform
 

1897
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,759
them playlist ed and they didn't perform
so well for mainstream is they actually

1898
00:38:06,759 --> 00:38:06,769
so well for mainstream is they actually
 

1899
00:38:06,769 --> 00:38:09,039
so well for mainstream is they actually
thought they were a bit too particular

1900
00:38:09,039 --> 00:38:09,049
thought they were a bit too particular
 

1901
00:38:09,049 --> 00:38:11,829
thought they were a bit too particular
and unorthodox so we had the complete

1902
00:38:11,829 --> 00:38:11,839
and unorthodox so we had the complete
 

1903
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:13,660
and unorthodox so we had the complete
opposite of what we expected success

1904
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:13,670
opposite of what we expected success
 

1905
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:15,490
opposite of what we expected success
within the hardest problem first and

1906
00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:15,500
within the hardest problem first and
 

1907
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,109
within the hardest problem first and
then had to try to scale to more

1908
00:38:17,109 --> 00:38:17,119
then had to try to scale to more
 

1909
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:20,079
then had to try to scale to more
mainstream recommendations so you've

1910
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:20,089
mainstream recommendations so you've
 

1911
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:24,400
mainstream recommendations so you've
also acquired echo nests that analyze a

1912
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:24,410
also acquired echo nests that analyze a
 

1913
00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:29,289
also acquired echo nests that analyze a
song data so in your view maybe you can

1914
00:38:29,289 --> 00:38:29,299
song data so in your view maybe you can
 

1915
00:38:29,299 --> 00:38:31,480
song data so in your view maybe you can
talk about so what kind of data is there

1916
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:31,490
talk about so what kind of data is there
 

1917
00:38:31,490 --> 00:38:32,500
talk about so what kind of data is there
from a machine learning perspective

1918
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:32,510
from a machine learning perspective
 

1919
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:35,950
from a machine learning perspective
there's a like a huge amount what we're

1920
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:35,960
there's a like a huge amount what we're
 

1921
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,720
there's a like a huge amount what we're
talking about playlists thing and just

1922
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:37,730
talking about playlists thing and just
 

1923
00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:40,240
talking about playlists thing and just
user data of what people are listening

1924
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:40,250
user data of what people are listening
 

1925
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:43,720
user data of what people are listening
to the playlists are constructing and so

1926
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:43,730
to the playlists are constructing and so
 

1927
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:46,539
to the playlists are constructing and so
on and then there's the the actual data

1928
00:38:46,539 --> 00:38:46,549
on and then there's the the actual data
 

1929
00:38:46,549 --> 00:38:49,809
on and then there's the the actual data
within a song what makes a song I don't

1930
00:38:49,809 --> 00:38:49,819
within a song what makes a song I don't
 

1931
00:38:49,819 --> 00:38:53,230
within a song what makes a song I don't
know the actual waveforms right is there

1932
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:53,240
know the actual waveforms right is there
 

1933
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:56,079
know the actual waveforms right is there
any how do you mix the two how much

1934
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:56,089
any how do you mix the two how much
 

1935
00:38:56,089 --> 00:38:58,180
any how do you mix the two how much
values are in each to me it seems like

1936
00:38:58,180 --> 00:38:58,190
values are in each to me it seems like
 

1937
00:38:58,190 --> 00:39:02,829
values are in each to me it seems like
user data is well it's a romantic notion

1938
00:39:02,829 --> 00:39:02,839
user data is well it's a romantic notion
 

1939
00:39:02,839 --> 00:39:04,900
user data is well it's a romantic notion
that the song itself would contain

1940
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:04,910
that the song itself would contain
 

1941
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:07,329
that the song itself would contain
useful information but if I were to

1942
00:39:07,329 --> 00:39:07,339
useful information but if I were to
 

1943
00:39:07,339 --> 00:39:09,069
useful information but if I were to
guess user data would be much more

1944
00:39:09,069 --> 00:39:09,079
guess user data would be much more
 

1945
00:39:09,079 --> 00:39:10,960
guess user data would be much more
powerful like playlists would be much

1946
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:10,970
powerful like playlists would be much
 

1947
00:39:10,970 --> 00:39:14,279
powerful like playlists would be much
more powerful yeah so we use both our

1948
00:39:14,279 --> 00:39:14,289
more powerful yeah so we use both our
 

1949
00:39:14,289 --> 00:39:17,519
more powerful yeah so we use both our
biggest success initially what was with

1950
00:39:17,519 --> 00:39:17,529
biggest success initially what was with
 

1951
00:39:17,529 --> 00:39:19,829
biggest success initially what was with
playlist data without understanding

1952
00:39:19,829 --> 00:39:19,839
playlist data without understanding
 

1953
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:21,759
playlist data without understanding
anything about the structure of this

1954
00:39:21,759 --> 00:39:21,769
anything about the structure of this
 

1955
00:39:21,769 --> 00:39:24,069
anything about the structure of this
song but when we acquire the echo nest

1956
00:39:24,069 --> 00:39:24,079
song but when we acquire the echo nest
 

1957
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:26,559
song but when we acquire the echo nest
they had the inverse problem they

1958
00:39:26,559 --> 00:39:26,569
they had the inverse problem they
 

1959
00:39:26,569 --> 00:39:28,269
they had the inverse problem they
actually didn't have any play data they

1960
00:39:28,269 --> 00:39:28,279
actually didn't have any play data they
 

1961
00:39:28,279 --> 00:39:29,799
actually didn't have any play data they
were just they were a provider of

1962
00:39:29,799 --> 00:39:29,809
were just they were a provider of
 

1963
00:39:29,809 --> 00:39:31,029
were just they were a provider of
recommendations but they didn't actually

1964
00:39:31,029 --> 00:39:31,039
recommendations but they didn't actually
 

1965
00:39:31,039 --> 00:39:33,519
recommendations but they didn't actually
have any play data so they they looked

1966
00:39:33,519 --> 00:39:33,529
have any play data so they they looked
 

1967
00:39:33,529 --> 00:39:36,809
have any play data so they they looked
at the structure of songs sonically and

1968
00:39:36,809 --> 00:39:36,819
at the structure of songs sonically and
 

1969
00:39:36,819 --> 00:39:39,339
at the structure of songs sonically and
they looked at Wikipedia for cultural

1970
00:39:39,339 --> 00:39:39,349
they looked at Wikipedia for cultural
 

1971
00:39:39,349 --> 00:39:41,170
they looked at Wikipedia for cultural
references and so forth right cool and

1972
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:41,180
references and so forth right cool and
 

1973
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:43,240
references and so forth right cool and
did a lot of NLU and so forth so we got

1974
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:43,250
did a lot of NLU and so forth so we got
 

1975
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:45,970
did a lot of NLU and so forth so we got
that skill into the company and combine

1976
00:39:45,970 --> 00:39:45,980
that skill into the company and combine
 

1977
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:49,120
that skill into the company and combine
kind of our user data with their with

1978
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:49,130
kind of our user data with their with
 

1979
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:52,839
kind of our user data with their with
their kind of content-based so you can

1980
00:39:52,839 --> 00:39:52,849
their kind of content-based so you can
 

1981
00:39:52,849 --> 00:39:54,009
their kind of content-based so you can
think of as we were used to based and

1982
00:39:54,009 --> 00:39:54,019
think of as we were used to based and
 

1983
00:39:54,019 --> 00:39:54,880
think of as we were used to based and
they were content based in their

1984
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:54,890
they were content based in their
 

1985
00:39:54,890 --> 00:39:56,890
they were content based in their
recommendations and we combine those two

1986
00:39:56,890 --> 00:39:56,900
recommendations and we combine those two
 

1987
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:58,900
recommendations and we combine those two
and for some cases where you have a new

1988
00:39:58,900 --> 00:39:58,910
and for some cases where you have a new
 

1989
00:39:58,910 --> 00:40:01,359
and for some cases where you have a new
there's no no play date obviously you

1990
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:01,369
there's no no play date obviously you
 

1991
00:40:01,369 --> 00:40:04,210
there's no no play date obviously you
have to try to go by either you know who

1992
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:04,220
have to try to go by either you know who
 

1993
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:07,450
have to try to go by either you know who
the artist is or or the sonic

1994
00:40:07,450 --> 00:40:07,460
the artist is or or the sonic
 

1995
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:08,980
the artist is or or the sonic
information in the song or what it's

1996
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:08,990
information in the song or what it's
 

1997
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:10,779
information in the song or what it's
similar to so there's definitely value

1998
00:40:10,779 --> 00:40:10,789
similar to so there's definitely value
 

1999
00:40:10,789 --> 00:40:13,000
similar to so there's definitely value
in in both and we do a lot in both but I

2000
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:13,010
in in both and we do a lot in both but I
 

2001
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:15,609
in in both and we do a lot in both but I
would say yes the user data captures

2002
00:40:15,609 --> 00:40:15,619
would say yes the user data captures
 

2003
00:40:15,619 --> 00:40:18,430
would say yes the user data captures
things that that have to do with culture

2004
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:18,440
things that that have to do with culture
 

2005
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,200
things that that have to do with culture
in the greater society that you would

2006
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:20,210
in the greater society that you would
 

2007
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:23,020
in the greater society that you would
never see in the in the content itself

2008
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:23,030
never see in the in the content itself
 

2009
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:26,289
never see in the in the content itself
but that said we have seen we have a

2010
00:40:26,289 --> 00:40:26,299
but that said we have seen we have a
 

2011
00:40:26,299 --> 00:40:29,589
but that said we have seen we have a
research lab in Paris when you know we

2012
00:40:29,589 --> 00:40:29,599
research lab in Paris when you know we
 

2013
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:31,660
research lab in Paris when you know we
can talk about more about that on kind

2014
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:31,670
can talk about more about that on kind
 

2015
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:32,920
can talk about more about that on kind
of machine layer on the creator side

2016
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:32,930
of machine layer on the creator side
 

2017
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:34,420
of machine layer on the creator side
what it can do for creators not just for

2018
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:34,430
what it can do for creators not just for
 

2019
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:37,630
what it can do for creators not just for
the consumers but where we looked at how

2020
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:37,640
the consumers but where we looked at how
 

2021
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:38,890
the consumers but where we looked at how
does the structure of a song actually

2022
00:40:38,890 --> 00:40:38,900
does the structure of a song actually
 

2023
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:41,170
does the structure of a song actually
affect the listening behavior and it

2024
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:41,180
affect the listening behavior and it
 

2025
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:43,539
affect the listening behavior and it
turns out that there is a lot of we can

2026
00:40:43,539 --> 00:40:43,549
turns out that there is a lot of we can
 

2027
00:40:43,549 --> 00:40:46,299
turns out that there is a lot of we can
we can predict things like skips based

2028
00:40:46,299 --> 00:40:46,309
we can predict things like skips based
 

2029
00:40:46,309 --> 00:40:48,160
we can predict things like skips based
on we you know based on on the song

2030
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:48,170
on we you know based on on the song
 

2031
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:50,140
on we you know based on on the song
itself we could say that maybe you

2032
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:50,150
itself we could say that maybe you
 

2033
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:51,130
itself we could say that maybe you
should move that chorus a bit because

2034
00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:51,140
should move that chorus a bit because
 

2035
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:52,779
should move that chorus a bit because
you're skippers gonna go up here there

2036
00:40:52,779 --> 00:40:52,789
you're skippers gonna go up here there
 

2037
00:40:52,789 --> 00:40:54,250
you're skippers gonna go up here there
is a lot of latent structure in the

2038
00:40:54,250 --> 00:40:54,260
is a lot of latent structure in the
 

2039
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:56,500
is a lot of latent structure in the
music which is not surprising because it

2040
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:56,510
music which is not surprising because it
 

2041
00:40:56,510 --> 00:40:59,140
music which is not surprising because it
is some sort of mind hack so there

2042
00:40:59,140 --> 00:40:59,150
is some sort of mind hack so there
 

2043
00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:00,250
is some sort of mind hack so there
should be structured that's probably

2044
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:00,260
should be structured that's probably
 

2045
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:01,930
should be structured that's probably
what we respond to you just blew my mind

2046
00:41:01,930 --> 00:41:01,940
what we respond to you just blew my mind
 

2047
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:03,970
what we respond to you just blew my mind
actually for from the creator

2048
00:41:03,970 --> 00:41:03,980
actually for from the creator
 

2049
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:06,940
actually for from the creator
perspective so that's really interesting

2050
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:06,950
perspective so that's really interesting
 

2051
00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:10,029
perspective so that's really interesting
topic that probably most creators aren't

2052
00:41:10,029 --> 00:41:10,039
topic that probably most creators aren't
 

2053
00:41:10,039 --> 00:41:12,970
topic that probably most creators aren't
taking advantage of right so there's

2054
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:12,980
taking advantage of right so there's
 

2055
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:15,430
taking advantage of right so there's
I've recently got to interact with a few

2056
00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:15,440
I've recently got to interact with a few
 

2057
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:20,289
I've recently got to interact with a few
folks youtubers who are like obsessed

2058
00:41:20,289 --> 00:41:20,299
folks youtubers who are like obsessed
 

2059
00:41:20,299 --> 00:41:24,970
folks youtubers who are like obsessed
with this idea of what do I do to make

2060
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:24,980
with this idea of what do I do to make
 

2061
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:27,670
with this idea of what do I do to make
sure people keep watching the video and

2062
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:27,680
sure people keep watching the video and
 

2063
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:30,130
sure people keep watching the video and
then like look at the analytics of which

2064
00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:30,140
then like look at the analytics of which
 

2065
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:33,069
then like look at the analytics of which
point if people turn off and so on first

2066
00:41:33,069 --> 00:41:33,079
point if people turn off and so on first
 

2067
00:41:33,079 --> 00:41:35,289
point if people turn off and so on first
of all don't think that's healthy but

2068
00:41:35,289 --> 00:41:35,299
of all don't think that's healthy but
 

2069
00:41:35,299 --> 00:41:37,210
of all don't think that's healthy but
it's it's because you can do it a little

2070
00:41:37,210 --> 00:41:37,220
it's it's because you can do it a little
 

2071
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:39,789
it's it's because you can do it a little
too much but it is a really powerful

2072
00:41:39,789 --> 00:41:39,799
too much but it is a really powerful
 

2073
00:41:39,799 --> 00:41:42,250
too much but it is a really powerful
tool for helping the creative process

2074
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:42,260
tool for helping the creative process
 

2075
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:44,380
tool for helping the creative process
you just made me realize you could do

2076
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:44,390
you just made me realize you could do
 

2077
00:41:44,390 --> 00:41:48,220
you just made me realize you could do
the same thing for creation of music and

2078
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:48,230
the same thing for creation of music and
 

2079
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:50,079
the same thing for creation of music and
so is that something you've looked into

2080
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:50,089
so is that something you've looked into
 

2081
00:41:50,089 --> 00:41:54,069
so is that something you've looked into
oh is it can you speak to how much

2082
00:41:54,069 --> 00:41:54,079
oh is it can you speak to how much
 

2083
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:55,450
oh is it can you speak to how much
opportunity there is for that yeah I

2084
00:41:55,450 --> 00:41:55,460
opportunity there is for that yeah I
 

2085
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:57,789
opportunity there is for that yeah I
think I listen to to the podcast with

2086
00:41:57,789 --> 00:41:57,799
think I listen to to the podcast with
 

2087
00:41:57,799 --> 00:41:59,349
think I listen to to the podcast with
Suraj yeah and I thought it was

2088
00:41:59,349 --> 00:41:59,359
Suraj yeah and I thought it was
 

2089
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:01,269
Suraj yeah and I thought it was
fantastic and directed to do the same

2090
00:42:01,269 --> 00:42:01,279
fantastic and directed to do the same
 

2091
00:42:01,279 --> 00:42:03,069
fantastic and directed to do the same
thing where he said and he said he

2092
00:42:03,069 --> 00:42:03,079
thing where he said and he said he
 

2093
00:42:03,079 --> 00:42:04,390
thing where he said and he said he
posted something in the morning

2094
00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:04,400
posted something in the morning
 

2095
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,339
posted something in the morning
yeah immediately watch the feedback

2096
00:42:06,339 --> 00:42:06,349
yeah immediately watch the feedback
 

2097
00:42:06,349 --> 00:42:07,599
yeah immediately watch the feedback
where the drop off was and then

2098
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:07,609
where the drop off was and then
 

2099
00:42:07,609 --> 00:42:09,230
where the drop off was and then
responded to that in the afternoon

2100
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:09,240
responded to that in the afternoon
 

2101
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:11,540
responded to that in the afternoon
yeah which which is quite different from

2102
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:11,550
yeah which which is quite different from
 

2103
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:13,820
yeah which which is quite different from
how people make podcasts for example yes

2104
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:13,830
how people make podcasts for example yes
 

2105
00:42:13,830 --> 00:42:15,290
how people make podcasts for example yes
exactly I mean the feedback loop is

2106
00:42:15,290 --> 00:42:15,300
exactly I mean the feedback loop is
 

2107
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:17,480
exactly I mean the feedback loop is
almost non-existent it's very so if we

2108
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:17,490
almost non-existent it's very so if we
 

2109
00:42:17,490 --> 00:42:21,050
almost non-existent it's very so if we
back out a one-level I think actually

2110
00:42:21,050 --> 00:42:21,060
back out a one-level I think actually
 

2111
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:22,970
back out a one-level I think actually
both for music and podcasts which we

2112
00:42:22,970 --> 00:42:22,980
both for music and podcasts which we
 

2113
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:25,580
both for music and podcasts which we
also do is let Spotify I think there's a

2114
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:25,590
also do is let Spotify I think there's a
 

2115
00:42:25,590 --> 00:42:27,800
also do is let Spotify I think there's a
tremendous opportunity just for the

2116
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:27,810
tremendous opportunity just for the
 

2117
00:42:27,810 --> 00:42:30,800
tremendous opportunity just for the
creation workflow and I think it's

2118
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:30,810
creation workflow and I think it's
 

2119
00:42:30,810 --> 00:42:32,330
creation workflow and I think it's
really interesting speaking to you who

2120
00:42:32,330 --> 00:42:32,340
really interesting speaking to you who
 

2121
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:34,730
really interesting speaking to you who
because you're a musician a developer

2122
00:42:34,730 --> 00:42:34,740
because you're a musician a developer
 

2123
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:36,860
because you're a musician a developer
and a podcaster if you think about those

2124
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:36,870
and a podcaster if you think about those
 

2125
00:42:36,870 --> 00:42:40,130
and a podcaster if you think about those
three different roles if you if you make

2126
00:42:40,130 --> 00:42:40,140
three different roles if you if you make
 

2127
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:42,500
three different roles if you if you make
the leap as a musician if you if you

2128
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:42,510
the leap as a musician if you if you
 

2129
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:44,540
the leap as a musician if you if you
think about it as a software tool chain

2130
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:44,550
think about it as a software tool chain
 

2131
00:42:44,550 --> 00:42:47,570
think about it as a software tool chain
really your door with the stems

2132
00:42:47,570 --> 00:42:47,580
really your door with the stems
 

2133
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:49,700
really your door with the stems
that's the IDE right that's what you

2134
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:49,710
that's the IDE right that's what you
 

2135
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:52,010
that's the IDE right that's what you
work in source code formant with your

2136
00:42:52,010 --> 00:42:52,020
work in source code formant with your
 

2137
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:54,380
work in source code formant with your
with with what you're creating then you

2138
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:54,390
with with what you're creating then you
 

2139
00:42:54,390 --> 00:42:55,550
with with what you're creating then you
sit around and you play with that and

2140
00:42:55,550 --> 00:42:55,560
sit around and you play with that and
 

2141
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:56,990
sit around and you play with that and
when you're happy you compile that thing

2142
00:42:56,990 --> 00:42:57,000
when you're happy you compile that thing
 

2143
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,600
when you're happy you compile that thing
into some sort of you know AAC or mp3 or

2144
00:42:59,600 --> 00:42:59,610
into some sort of you know AAC or mp3 or
 

2145
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:01,460
into some sort of you know AAC or mp3 or
something you do that because you get

2146
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:01,470
something you do that because you get
 

2147
00:43:01,470 --> 00:43:03,020
something you do that because you get
distribution there's so many runtimes

2148
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:03,030
distribution there's so many runtimes
 

2149
00:43:03,030 --> 00:43:04,430
distribution there's so many runtimes
for that mp3 across the world and

2150
00:43:04,430 --> 00:43:04,440
for that mp3 across the world and
 

2151
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:05,870
for that mp3 across the world and
Carstairs and stuff so you kind of

2152
00:43:05,870 --> 00:43:05,880
Carstairs and stuff so you kind of
 

2153
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:07,550
Carstairs and stuff so you kind of
compile this executable you ship it out

2154
00:43:07,550 --> 00:43:07,560
compile this executable you ship it out
 

2155
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:09,470
compile this executable you ship it out
and kind of an old fashioned box

2156
00:43:09,470 --> 00:43:09,480
and kind of an old fashioned box
 

2157
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:12,890
and kind of an old fashioned box
software analogy and then you hope for

2158
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:12,900
software analogy and then you hope for
 

2159
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:16,100
software analogy and then you hope for
the best right right but as a as a as a

2160
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:16,110
the best right right but as a as a as a
 

2161
00:43:16,110 --> 00:43:19,010
the best right right but as a as a as a
software developer you'd never do that

2162
00:43:19,010 --> 00:43:19,020
software developer you'd never do that
 

2163
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:20,300
software developer you'd never do that
first you go and get helping you

2164
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:20,310
first you go and get helping you
 

2165
00:43:20,310 --> 00:43:22,220
first you go and get helping you
collaborate with other Creators yeah and

2166
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:22,230
collaborate with other Creators yeah and
 

2167
00:43:22,230 --> 00:43:24,410
collaborate with other Creators yeah and
then you know you think it'd be crazy to

2168
00:43:24,410 --> 00:43:24,420
then you know you think it'd be crazy to
 

2169
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:25,760
then you know you think it'd be crazy to
just ship one version of your software

2170
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:25,770
just ship one version of your software
 

2171
00:43:25,770 --> 00:43:28,790
just ship one version of your software
without doing an a/b test without any

2172
00:43:28,790 --> 00:43:28,800
without doing an a/b test without any
 

2173
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:31,010
without doing an a/b test without any
feedback loop and then HD tracking

2174
00:43:31,010 --> 00:43:31,020
feedback loop and then HD tracking
 

2175
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:32,990
feedback loop and then HD tracking
exactly and then you would you would

2176
00:43:32,990 --> 00:43:33,000
exactly and then you would you would
 

2177
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,520
exactly and then you would you would
look at the feedback loops and try to

2178
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:34,530
look at the feedback loops and try to
 

2179
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:37,220
look at the feedback loops and try to
optimize that thing right so I think if

2180
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:37,230
optimize that thing right so I think if
 

2181
00:43:37,230 --> 00:43:38,750
optimize that thing right so I think if
you think of it as a as a very specific

2182
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:38,760
you think of it as a as a very specific
 

2183
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:41,720
you think of it as a as a very specific
software tool chain it looks quite

2184
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:41,730
software tool chain it looks quite
 

2185
00:43:41,730 --> 00:43:44,450
software tool chain it looks quite
arcane you know the tools that a music

2186
00:43:44,450 --> 00:43:44,460
arcane you know the tools that a music
 

2187
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:45,830
arcane you know the tools that a music
creator has versus what a software

2188
00:43:45,830 --> 00:43:45,840
creator has versus what a software
 

2189
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:48,500
creator has versus what a software
developer has so that's kind of how we

2190
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:48,510
developer has so that's kind of how we
 

2191
00:43:48,510 --> 00:43:52,310
developer has so that's kind of how we
think about it and why wouldn't a why

2192
00:43:52,310 --> 00:43:52,320
think about it and why wouldn't a why

billion people inspired by it and what I
 

2463
00:49:36,210 --> 00:49:37,400
billion people inspired by it and what I
think it is interesting about that

2464
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:37,410
think it is interesting about that
 

2465

to live off of their art not just make
some money or further art as well so

2474
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:48,120
some money or further art as well so
 

2475
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:52,250
some money or further art as well so
it's quite an ambitious project and so

2476
00:49:52,250 --> 00:49:52,260
it's quite an ambitious project and so
 

2477
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:54,790

we think about creators of all kinds and
we kind of expanded our mission from

00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:57,510
we kind of expanded our mission from
 

2481
00:49:57,510 --> 00:50:00,170
we kind of expanded our mission from
being music - being audio a while back

2483
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:06,410
being music - being audio a while back
and that's not so much because we think

2484
00:50:06,410 --> 00:50:06,420
and that's not so much because we think
 

2485
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:09,230
and that's not so much because we think
we made that decision we think that my

2486
00:50:09,230 --> 00:50:09,240
we made that decision we think that my
 

2487

we made that decision we think that my
decision was was made for us

2488
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:10,890
decision was was made for us
 

2489
00:50:10,890 --> 00:50:12,560
decision was was made for us
we need the world made that decision

2490
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:12,570
we need the world made that decision
 

2491
00:50:12,570 --> 00:50:15,560

2505
00:50:28,470 --> 00:50:31,670
and that you know that's how radio work
so we decided that we think it's about

2506
00:50:31,670 --> 00:50:31,680
so we decided that we think it's about
 

2507
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:34,010
so we decided that we think it's about
audio you can see the rise of audiobooks

2508
00:50:34,010 --> 00:50:34,020
audio you can see the rise of audiobooks
 

2509
00:50:34,020 --> 00:50:35,360
audio you can see the rise of audiobooks
and so forth we think audio is this

2510
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:35,370
and so forth we think audio is this
 

2511
00:50:35,370 --> 00:50:37,460
and so forth we think audio is this
great opportunity so we decided to enter

2512
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:37,470
great opportunity so we decided to enter
 

2513
00:50:37,470 --> 00:50:41,570
great opportunity so we decided to enter
it and and obviously Apple and Apple

2514
00:50:41,570 --> 00:50:41,580

podcast is absolutely dominating in

podcast is absolutely dominating in
 

2517
00:50:44,210 --> 00:50:47,210
podcast is absolutely dominating in
podcasting and we didn't have a single

2518
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:47,220
podcasting and we didn't have a single
 

2519
00:50:47,220 --> 00:50:49,300
podcasting and we didn't have a single
podcast only like two years ago

2520
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:49,310
podcast only like two years ago
 

2521
00:50:49,310 --> 00:50:54,530
podcast only like two years ago
what we did though was we we we looked

00:50:54,530 --> 00:50:54,540
what we did though was we we we looked
 

2523
00:50:54,540 --> 00:50:55,700
what we did though was we we we looked
at this and said no can we bring

2524
00:50:55,700 --> 00:50:55,710
at this and said no can we bring
 

2525
00:50:55,710 --> 00:50:58,070
at this and said no can we bring
something to this you know we want to do

2526
00:50:58,070 --> 00:50:58,080
something to this you know we want to do
 

2527
00:50:58,080 --> 00:50:59,470
something to this you know we want to do
this but the back to the

Josefa we have to do something that

2530
00:51:00,670 --> 00:51:00,680
Josefa we have to do something that
 

2531
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:04,210
Josefa we have to do something that
consumers actually value to be able to

2532
00:51:04,210 --> 00:51:04,220
consumers actually value to be able to
 

2533
00:51:04,220 --> 00:51:06,310
consumers actually value to be able to
do this and the reason we've gone from

2534
00:51:06,310 --> 00:51:06,320
do this and the reason we've gone from
 

2535
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:08,380
do this and the reason we've gone from
not existing at all to being the the

00:51:13,270 --> 00:51:13,280
second-largest podcast consumption still
 

2541
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:15,490
second-largest podcast consumption still
still wide gap to iTunes but we're

2542
00:51:15,490 --> 00:51:15,500
still wide gap to iTunes but we're
 

2543
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:17,920
still wide gap to iTunes but we're
growing quite fast I think it's because

2544
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:17,930
growing quite fast I think it's because
 

2545
00:51:17,930 --> 00:51:19,720
growing quite fast I think it's because
when we when we looked at the consumer

2546
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:19,730
when we when we looked at the consumer
 

2547
00:51:19,730 --> 00:51:20,440
when we when we looked at the consumer
problem

2548
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:20,450
problem
 

2549
00:51:20,450 --> 00:51:22,780
problem
people said surprisingly that they

2550
00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:22,790
people said surprisingly that they
 

2551
00:51:22,790 --> 00:51:25,300
people said surprisingly that they
wanted their podcasts and music in the

2552
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:25,310
wanted their podcasts and music in the
 

2553
00:51:25,310 --> 00:51:28,210
wanted their podcasts and music in the
same in the same application so what we

2554
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:28,220
same in the same application so what we
 

2555
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:29,410
same in the same application so what we
did was we took a little bit of a

2556
00:51:29,410 --> 00:51:29,420
did was we took a little bit of a
 

2557
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:30,670
did was we took a little bit of a
different approach what we said instead

2558
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:30,680
different approach what we said instead
 

2559
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:33,220
different approach what we said instead
of building a separate podcast app we

2560
00:51:33,220 --> 00:51:33,230
of building a separate podcast app we
 

2561
00:51:33,230 --> 00:51:34,750
of building a separate podcast app we
thought it's their consumer problem to

2562
00:51:34,750 --> 00:51:34,760
thought it's their consumer problem to
 

2563
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:35,980
thought it's their consumer problem to
solve here because the others are very

2564
00:51:35,980 --> 00:51:35,990
solve here because the others are very
 

2565
00:51:35,990 --> 00:51:38,020
solve here because the others are very
successful already and we thought there

2566
00:51:38,020 --> 00:51:38,030
successful already and we thought there
 

2567
00:51:38,030 --> 00:51:40,330
successful already and we thought there
was in making a more seamless experience

2568
00:51:40,330 --> 00:51:40,340
was in making a more seamless experience
 

2569
00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:41,890
was in making a more seamless experience
where you can have your podcast in your

2570
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:41,900
where you can have your podcast in your
 

2571
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:45,670
where you can have your podcast in your
music in the same application because we

2572
00:51:45,670 --> 00:51:45,680
music in the same application because we
 

2573
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:47,710
music in the same application because we
think it's audio to you and that that

2574
00:51:47,710 --> 00:51:47,720
think it's audio to you and that that
 

2575
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:49,270
think it's audio to you and that that
has been successful and that meant that

2576
00:51:49,270 --> 00:51:49,280
has been successful and that meant that
 

2577
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:51,580
has been successful and that meant that
we actually had 200 million people to

2578
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:51,590
we actually had 200 million people to
 

2579
00:51:51,590 --> 00:51:53,380
we actually had 200 million people to
offer this to instead of starting from 0

2580
00:51:53,380 --> 00:51:53,390
offer this to instead of starting from 0
 

2581
00:51:53,390 --> 00:51:56,290
offer this to instead of starting from 0
so I think we have a good chance because

2582
00:51:56,290 --> 00:51:56,300
so I think we have a good chance because
 

2583
00:51:56,300 --> 00:51:57,340
so I think we have a good chance because
we're taking a different approach than

2584
00:51:57,340 --> 00:51:57,350
we're taking a different approach than
 

2585
00:51:57,350 --> 00:51:59,560
we're taking a different approach than
the competition and back to the other

2586
00:51:59,560 --> 00:51:59,570
the competition and back to the other
 

2587
00:51:59,570 --> 00:52:03,340
the competition and back to the other
thing I mentioned about creators because

2588
00:52:03,340 --> 00:52:03,350
thing I mentioned about creators because
 

2589
00:52:03,350 --> 00:52:05,260
thing I mentioned about creators because
we're looking at the end-to-end flow I

2590
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:05,270
we're looking at the end-to-end flow I
 

2591
00:52:05,270 --> 00:52:07,000
we're looking at the end-to-end flow I
think there's a tremendous amount of

2592
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:07,010
think there's a tremendous amount of
 

2593
00:52:07,010 --> 00:52:08,740
think there's a tremendous amount of
innovation to do around podcast as a

2594
00:52:08,740 --> 00:52:08,750
innovation to do around podcast as a
 

2595
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:11,230
innovation to do around podcast as a
format when we have creation tools and

2596
00:52:11,230 --> 00:52:11,240
format when we have creation tools and
 

2597
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:14,140
format when we have creation tools and
consumption I think we could start

2598
00:52:14,140 --> 00:52:14,150
consumption I think we could start
 

2599
00:52:14,150 --> 00:52:15,849
consumption I think we could start
improving what podcasting is I mean

2600
00:52:15,849 --> 00:52:15,859
improving what podcasting is I mean
 

2601
00:52:15,859 --> 00:52:19,300
improving what podcasting is I mean
podcast is this this opaque big like 1/2

2602
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:19,310
podcast is this this opaque big like 1/2
 

2603
00:52:19,310 --> 00:52:23,080
podcast is this this opaque big like 1/2
hour file that you're streaming which it

2604
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:23,090
hour file that you're streaming which it
 

2605
00:52:23,090 --> 00:52:24,400
hour file that you're streaming which it
really doesn't make that much sense in

2606
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:24,410
really doesn't make that much sense in
 

2607
00:52:24,410 --> 00:52:27,370
really doesn't make that much sense in
2019 that it's not interactive there's

2608
00:52:27,370 --> 00:52:27,380
2019 that it's not interactive there's
 

2609
00:52:27,380 --> 00:52:29,230
2019 that it's not interactive there's
no feedback loops nothing like that so I

2610
00:52:29,230 --> 00:52:29,240
no feedback loops nothing like that so I
 

2611
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:31,120
no feedback loops nothing like that so I
think if we're gonna win it's gonna have

2612
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:31,130
think if we're gonna win it's gonna have
 

2613
00:52:31,130 --> 00:52:32,410
think if we're gonna win it's gonna have
to be because we build a better product

2614
00:52:32,410 --> 00:52:32,420
to be because we build a better product
 

2615
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:35,650
to be because we build a better product
for creators and for for consumers so

2616
00:52:35,650 --> 00:52:35,660
for creators and for for consumers so
 

2617
00:52:35,660 --> 00:52:37,930
for creators and for for consumers so
we'll see but it's certainly our goal we

2618
00:52:37,930 --> 00:52:37,940
we'll see but it's certainly our goal we
 

2619
00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:38,800
we'll see but it's certainly our goal we
have a long way to go

2620
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:38,810
have a long way to go
 

2621
00:52:38,810 --> 00:52:40,510
have a long way to go
well the creators part is really

2622
00:52:40,510 --> 00:52:40,520
well the creators part is really
 

2623
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:42,550
well the creators part is really
exciting you ready you got me hooked

2624

blueberry just recently added the stats

2628
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:46,910
blueberry just recently added the stats
 

2629
00:52:46,910 --> 00:52:49,870
blueberry just recently added the stats
of whether it's listened to the end or

2630
00:52:49,870 --> 00:52:49,880
of whether it's listened to the end or
 

2631
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:53,340
of whether it's listened to the end or
not and that's like a huge improvement

2632
00:52:53,340 --> 00:52:53,350
not and that's like a huge improvement
 

2633
00:52:53,350 --> 00:52:57,010
not and that's like a huge improvement
but that's still nowhere to where you

2634
00:52:57,010 --> 00:52:57,020
but that's still nowhere to where you
 

2635
00:52:57,020 --> 00:52:58,690
but that's still nowhere to where you
could possibly go into her statistics

album so it was like you bought a small
catalog of like 10 tracks right it was

00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:46,650
catalog of like 10 tracks right it was
it was again it was actually a lot of a

2718
00:54:46,650 --> 00:54:46,660
it was again it was actually a lot of a
 

2719
00:54:46,660 --> 00:54:49,140
it was again it was actually a lot of a
lot of consumption you think it's about

2720
00:54:49,140 --> 00:54:49,150
lot of consumption you think it's about
 

2721
00:54:49,150 --> 00:54:50,430
lot of consumption you think it's about
what you like but it's based on the

2722
00:54:50,430 --> 00:54:50,440
what you like but it's based on the
 

2723
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:52,110
what you like but it's based on the
business model right so you paid for

2724
00:54:52,110 --> 00:54:52,120
business model right so you paid for
 

2725
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:54,630
business model right so you paid for
this 10 track yeah service and then you

2726
00:54:54,630 --> 00:54:54,640
this 10 track yeah service and then you
 

2727
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:55,650
this 10 track yeah service and then you
listened to that for a while

2728
00:54:55,650 --> 00:54:55,660
listened to that for a while
 

2729
00:54:55,660 --> 00:54:57,870
listened to that for a while
and then when everything was flat priced

2730
00:54:57,870 --> 00:54:57,880
and then when everything was flat priced
 

2731
00:54:57,880 --> 00:55:00,780
and then when everything was flat priced
you tended to listen differently now so

2732
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:00,790
you tended to listen differently now so
 

2733
00:55:00,790 --> 00:55:02,220
you tended to listen differently now so
so I think the I think the album is

2734
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:02,230
so I think the I think the album is
 

2735
00:55:02,230 --> 00:55:03,330
so I think the I think the album is
still tremendously important that's why

2736
00:55:03,330 --> 00:55:03,340
still tremendously important that's why
 

2737
00:55:03,340 --> 00:55:04,830
still tremendously important that's why
we have it and you can save albums and

2738
00:55:04,830 --> 00:55:04,840
we have it and you can save albums and
 

2739
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:06,300
we have it and you can save albums and
so forth and you have a huge amount of

2740
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:06,310
so forth and you have a huge amount of
 

2741
00:55:06,310 --> 00:55:07,740
so forth and you have a huge amount of
people who really listen according to

2742
00:55:07,740 --> 00:55:07,750
people who really listen according to
 

2743
00:55:07,750 --> 00:55:09,690
people who really listen according to
albums and I like that because it is a

2744
00:55:09,690 --> 00:55:09,700
albums and I like that because it is a
 

2745
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:11,430
albums and I like that because it is a
creator format you can tell a longer

2746
00:55:11,430 --> 00:55:11,440
creator format you can tell a longer
 

2747
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:14,790
creator format you can tell a longer
story over several tracks and so some

2748
00:55:14,790 --> 00:55:14,800
story over several tracks and so some
 

2749
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:16,110
story over several tracks and so some
people listen to just one track some

2750
00:55:16,110 --> 00:55:16,120
people listen to just one track some
 

2751
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:17,430
people listen to just one track some
people actually want to hear that whole

2752
00:55:17,430 --> 00:55:17,440
people actually want to hear that whole
 

2753
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:21,950
people actually want to hear that whole
story now in podcast I think

2754
00:55:21,950 --> 00:55:21,960
story now in podcast I think
 

2755
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:24,200
story now in podcast I think
I think it's different you can argue

2756
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:24,210
I think it's different you can argue
 

2757
00:55:24,210 --> 00:55:26,300
I think it's different you can argue
that podcasts might be more like shows

2758
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:26,310
that podcasts might be more like shows
 

2759
00:55:26,310 --> 00:55:28,640
that podcasts might be more like shows
on Netflix you have like a full season

2760
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:28,650
on Netflix you have like a full season
 

2761
00:55:28,650 --> 00:55:30,740
on Netflix you have like a full season
of of narcos and you're probably not

2762
00:55:30,740 --> 00:55:30,750
of of narcos and you're probably not
 

2763
00:55:30,750 --> 00:55:32,390
of of narcos and you're probably not
going to do like one episode of Marcos

2764
00:55:32,390 --> 00:55:32,400
going to do like one episode of Marcos
 

2765
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:34,730
going to do like one episode of Marcos
and then one of house of cards like you

2766
00:55:34,730 --> 00:55:34,740
and then one of house of cards like you
 

2767
00:55:34,740 --> 00:55:36,829
and then one of house of cards like you
know that there's a narrative there and

2768
00:55:36,829 --> 00:55:36,839
know that there's a narrative there and
 

2769
00:55:36,839 --> 00:55:39,500
know that there's a narrative there and
you you you love the cast and you love

2770
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:39,510
you you you love the cast and you love
 

2771
00:55:39,510 --> 00:55:41,150
you you you love the cast and you love
these chairs so I think people will

2772
00:55:41,150 --> 00:55:41,160
these chairs so I think people will
 

2773
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:44,990
these chairs so I think people will
people love shows and I think they will

2774
00:55:44,990 --> 00:55:45,000
people love shows and I think they will
 

2775
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,359
people love shows and I think they will
they will listen to those shows I do

2776
00:55:47,359 --> 00:55:47,369
they will listen to those shows I do
 

2777
00:55:47,369 --> 00:55:48,680
they will listen to those shows I do
think you follow a bunch of shows at the

2778
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:48,690
think you follow a bunch of shows at the
 

2779
00:55:48,690 --> 00:55:50,000
think you follow a bunch of shows at the
same time so there's certainly an

2780
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:50,010
same time so there's certainly an
 

2781
00:55:50,010 --> 00:55:51,170
same time so there's certainly an
opportunity to bring you the latest

2782
00:55:51,170 --> 00:55:51,180
opportunity to bring you the latest
 

2783
00:55:51,180 --> 00:55:54,140
opportunity to bring you the latest
episode of you know whatever that 5 6 10

2784
00:55:54,140 --> 00:55:54,150
episode of you know whatever that 5 6 10
 

2785
00:55:54,150 --> 00:55:57,320
episode of you know whatever that 5 6 10
things that that you're into but but I

2786
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:57,330
things that that you're into but but I
 

2787
00:55:57,330 --> 00:55:59,890
things that that you're into but but I
think I think people are gonna listen to

2788
00:55:59,890 --> 00:55:59,900
think I think people are gonna listen to
 

2789
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:03,560
think I think people are gonna listen to
specific hosts and love those hosts for

2790
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:03,570
specific hosts and love those hosts for
 

2791
00:56:03,570 --> 00:56:04,640
specific hosts and love those hosts for
a long time because I think there's

2792
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:04,650
a long time because I think there's
 

2793
00:56:04,650 --> 00:56:08,020
a long time because I think there's
something different with podcast where

2794
00:56:08,020 --> 00:56:08,030
something different with podcast where
 

2795
00:56:08,030 --> 00:56:12,500
something different with podcast where
this format of the the experience of the

2796
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:12,510
this format of the the experience of the
 

2797
00:56:12,510 --> 00:56:14,180
this format of the the experience of the
of the audience is actually sitting here

2798
00:56:14,180 --> 00:56:14,190
of the audience is actually sitting here
 

2799
00:56:14,190 --> 00:56:16,220
of the audience is actually sitting here
right between us whereas if you look at

2800
00:56:16,220 --> 00:56:16,230
right between us whereas if you look at
 

2801
00:56:16,230 --> 00:56:18,140
right between us whereas if you look at
something on TV the audio actually would

2802
00:56:18,140 --> 00:56:18,150
something on TV the audio actually would
 

2803
00:56:18,150 --> 00:56:18,859
something on TV the audio actually would
come from

2804
00:56:18,859 --> 00:56:18,869
come from
 

2805
00:56:18,869 --> 00:56:20,540
come from
you would sit over there the order would

2806
00:56:20,540 --> 00:56:20,550
you would sit over there the order would
 

2807
00:56:20,550 --> 00:56:22,370
you would sit over there the order would
come to you from both of us as if you

2808
00:56:22,370 --> 00:56:22,380
come to you from both of us as if you
 

2809
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:23,839
come to you from both of us as if you
were watching notice you were part of

2810
00:56:23,839 --> 00:56:23,849
were watching notice you were part of
 

2811
00:56:23,849 --> 00:56:25,670
were watching notice you were part of
the conversation so my experience is I

2812
00:56:25,670 --> 00:56:25,680
the conversation so my experience is I
 

2813
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:28,160
the conversation so my experience is I
mean listen to podcasts like yours and

2814
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:28,170
mean listen to podcasts like yours and
 

2815
00:56:28,170 --> 00:56:30,589
mean listen to podcasts like yours and
Joe Rogan is I feel like I know all of

2816
00:56:30,589 --> 00:56:30,599
Joe Rogan is I feel like I know all of
 

2817
00:56:30,599 --> 00:56:32,270
Joe Rogan is I feel like I know all of
these people they they have no idea who

2818
00:56:32,270 --> 00:56:32,280
these people they they have no idea who
 

2819
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:34,250
these people they they have no idea who
I am but I feel like you know so many

2820
00:56:34,250 --> 00:56:34,260
I am but I feel like you know so many
 

2821
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:35,810
I am but I feel like you know so many
artists and that it's very different

2822
00:56:35,810 --> 00:56:35,820
artists and that it's very different
 

2823
00:56:35,820 --> 00:56:38,120
artists and that it's very different
from me watching a watching like a TV

2824
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:38,130
from me watching a watching like a TV
 

2825
00:56:38,130 --> 00:56:40,490
from me watching a watching like a TV
show or an interview so I think you you

2826
00:56:40,490 --> 00:56:40,500
show or an interview so I think you you
 

2827
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:43,720
show or an interview so I think you you
kind of fall in love with people and

2828
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:43,730
kind of fall in love with people and
 

2829
00:56:43,730 --> 00:56:46,280
kind of fall in love with people and
experience in a different way so I think

2830
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:46,290
experience in a different way so I think
 

2831
00:56:46,290 --> 00:56:47,960
experience in a different way so I think
I think shows and hosts are gonna be

2832
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:47,970
I think shows and hosts are gonna be
 

2833
00:56:47,970 --> 00:56:50,060
I think shows and hosts are gonna be
very very important I don't think that's

2834
00:56:50,060 --> 00:56:50,070
very very important I don't think that's
 

2835
00:56:50,070 --> 00:56:51,500
very very important I don't think that's
gonna go away in just some sort of thing

2836
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:51,510
gonna go away in just some sort of thing
 

2837
00:56:51,510 --> 00:56:52,880
gonna go away in just some sort of thing
where well you don't even know who

2838
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:52,890
where well you don't even know who
 

2839
00:56:52,890 --> 00:56:53,990
where well you don't even know who
you're listening to I don't think that's

2840
00:56:53,990 --> 00:56:54,000
you're listening to I don't think that's
 

2841
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,180
you're listening to I don't think that's
gonna happen what I do think is I think

2842
00:56:56,180 --> 00:56:56,190
gonna happen what I do think is I think
 

2843
00:56:56,190 --> 00:56:58,329
gonna happen what I do think is I think
there's a tremendous discovery

2844
00:56:58,329 --> 00:56:58,339
there's a tremendous discovery
 

2845
00:56:58,339 --> 00:57:01,280
there's a tremendous discovery
opportunity in podcast because the

2846
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:01,290
opportunity in podcast because the
 

2847
00:57:01,290 --> 00:57:04,520
opportunity in podcast because the
catalog is growing quite quickly and I

2848
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:04,530
catalog is growing quite quickly and I
 

2849
00:57:04,530 --> 00:57:08,329
catalog is growing quite quickly and I
think podcast is only a few like five

2850
00:57:08,329 --> 00:57:08,339
think podcast is only a few like five
 

2851
00:57:08,339 --> 00:57:11,570
think podcast is only a few like five
six hundred thousand shows right now if

2852
00:57:11,570 --> 00:57:11,580
six hundred thousand shows right now if
 

2853
00:57:11,580 --> 00:57:13,250
six hundred thousand shows right now if
you look back to YouTube as another in

2854
00:57:13,250 --> 00:57:13,260
you look back to YouTube as another in
 

2855
00:57:13,260 --> 00:57:15,440
you look back to YouTube as another in
knowledge of creators no one really

2856
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:15,450
knowledge of creators no one really
 

2857
00:57:15,450 --> 00:57:17,180
knowledge of creators no one really
knows if you would lift the lid on

2858
00:57:17,180 --> 00:57:17,190
knows if you would lift the lid on
 

2859
00:57:17,190 --> 00:57:19,450
knows if you would lift the lid on
YouTube but it's probably billions of

2860
00:57:19,450 --> 00:57:19,460
YouTube but it's probably billions of
 

2861
00:57:19,460 --> 00:57:22,550
YouTube but it's probably billions of
episodes and so I think the podcast

2862
00:57:22,550 --> 00:57:22,560
episodes and so I think the podcast
 

2863
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:23,740
episodes and so I think the podcast
catalog would probably grow tremendously

2864
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:23,750
catalog would probably grow tremendously
 

2865
00:57:23,750 --> 00:57:26,300
catalog would probably grow tremendously
because the creation tools are getting

2866
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:26,310
because the creation tools are getting
 

2867
00:57:26,310 --> 00:57:28,660
because the creation tools are getting
easier and then you're gonna have this

2868
00:57:28,660 --> 00:57:28,670
easier and then you're gonna have this
 

2869
00:57:28,670 --> 00:57:30,859
easier and then you're gonna have this
discovery opportunity that I think is

2870
00:57:30,859 --> 00:57:30,869
discovery opportunity that I think is
 

2871
00:57:30,869 --> 00:57:32,510
discovery opportunity that I think is
really big so so a lot of people tell me

2872
00:57:32,510 --> 00:57:32,520
really big so so a lot of people tell me
 

2873
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:34,650
really big so so a lot of people tell me
that they love their shows

2874
00:57:34,650 --> 00:57:34,660
that they love their shows
 

2875
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:36,750
that they love their shows
but discovering podcasts kind of suck

2876
00:57:36,750 --> 00:57:36,760
but discovering podcasts kind of suck
 

2877
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:38,340
but discovering podcasts kind of suck
it's really hard to get into new show

2878
00:57:38,340 --> 00:57:38,350
it's really hard to get into new show
 

2879
00:57:38,350 --> 00:57:40,350
it's really hard to get into new show
they're usually quite long it's a big

2880
00:57:40,350 --> 00:57:40,360
they're usually quite long it's a big
 

2881
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:41,700
they're usually quite long it's a big
time investments I think there's plenty

2882
00:57:41,700 --> 00:57:41,710
time investments I think there's plenty
 

2883
00:57:41,710 --> 00:57:44,810
time investments I think there's plenty
of opportunity in the discovery part

2884
00:57:44,810 --> 00:57:44,820
of opportunity in the discovery part
 

2885
00:57:44,820 --> 00:57:48,180
of opportunity in the discovery part
yeah for sure a hundred percent in in

2886
00:57:48,180 --> 00:57:48,190
yeah for sure a hundred percent in in
 

2887
00:57:48,190 --> 00:57:50,100
yeah for sure a hundred percent in in
even the dumbest there's so many

2888
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:50,110
even the dumbest there's so many
 

2889
00:57:50,110 --> 00:57:55,080
even the dumbest there's so many
low-hanging fruit too for example just

2890
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:55,090
low-hanging fruit too for example just
 

2891
00:57:55,090 --> 00:57:57,960
low-hanging fruit too for example just
knowing what episode to listen to first

2892
00:57:57,960 --> 00:57:57,970
knowing what episode to listen to first
 

2893
00:57:57,970 --> 00:58:00,900
knowing what episode to listen to first
to try out a podcast exactly because

2894
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:00,910
to try out a podcast exactly because
 

2895
00:58:00,910 --> 00:58:03,060
to try out a podcast exactly because
most podcasts don't have an order to

2896
00:58:03,060 --> 00:58:03,070
most podcasts don't have an order to
 

2897
00:58:03,070 --> 00:58:05,550
most podcasts don't have an order to
them they they can be listening to out

2898
00:58:05,550 --> 00:58:05,560
them they they can be listening to out
 

2899
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:10,050
them they they can be listening to out
of order and sorry to say some are

2900
00:58:10,050 --> 00:58:10,060
of order and sorry to say some are
 

2901
00:58:10,060 --> 00:58:13,110
of order and sorry to say some are
better than others episodes so some

2902
00:58:13,110 --> 00:58:13,120
better than others episodes so some
 

2903
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:14,610
better than others episodes so some
episodes of Joe Rogan are better than

2904
00:58:14,610 --> 00:58:14,620
episodes of Joe Rogan are better than
 

2905
00:58:14,620 --> 00:58:18,930
episodes of Joe Rogan are better than
others and it's nice to know which you

2906
00:58:18,930 --> 00:58:18,940
others and it's nice to know which you
 

2907
00:58:18,940 --> 00:58:20,460
others and it's nice to know which you
should listen to to try it out and

2908
00:58:20,460 --> 00:58:20,470
should listen to to try it out and
 

2909
00:58:20,470 --> 00:58:22,380
should listen to to try it out and
there's as far as I know almost no

2910
00:58:22,380 --> 00:58:22,390
there's as far as I know almost no
 

2911
00:58:22,390 --> 00:58:27,270
there's as far as I know almost no
information in terms of like up votes on

2912
00:58:27,270 --> 00:58:27,280
information in terms of like up votes on
 

2913
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:29,580
information in terms of like up votes on
how good an episode is exactly so I

2914
00:58:29,580 --> 00:58:29,590
how good an episode is exactly so I
 

2915
00:58:29,590 --> 00:58:32,340
how good an episode is exactly so I
think part of the problem is you it's

2916
00:58:32,340 --> 00:58:32,350
think part of the problem is you it's
 

2917
00:58:32,350 --> 00:58:34,080
think part of the problem is you it's
kind of like music there isn't one

2918
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:34,090
kind of like music there isn't one
 

2919
00:58:34,090 --> 00:58:35,760
kind of like music there isn't one
answer people use music for different

2920
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:35,770
answer people use music for different
 

2921
00:58:35,770 --> 00:58:36,660
answer people use music for different
things and there's actually many

2922
00:58:36,660 --> 00:58:36,670
things and there's actually many
 

2923
00:58:36,670 --> 00:58:38,130
things and there's actually many
different types of music there's workout

2924
00:58:38,130 --> 00:58:38,140
different types of music there's workout
 

2925
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:39,420
different types of music there's workout
music and there's classical piano music

2926
00:58:39,420 --> 00:58:39,430
music and there's classical piano music
 

2927
00:58:39,430 --> 00:58:42,750
music and there's classical piano music
and focus music and and and so forth I

2928
00:58:42,750 --> 00:58:42,760
and focus music and and and so forth I
 

2929
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:44,400
and focus music and and and so forth I
think the same with podcasts some

2930
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:44,410
think the same with podcasts some
 

2931
00:58:44,410 --> 00:58:45,990
think the same with podcasts some
podcasts are sequential they're supposed

2932
00:58:45,990 --> 00:58:46,000
podcasts are sequential they're supposed
 

2933
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,630
podcasts are sequential they're supposed
to be listened to in in order it's

2934
00:58:48,630 --> 00:58:48,640
to be listened to in in order it's
 

2935
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:50,220
to be listened to in in order it's
actually it's actually telling a

2936
00:58:50,220 --> 00:58:50,230
actually it's actually telling a
 

2937
00:58:50,230 --> 00:58:53,720
actually it's actually telling a
narrative some podcasts are one topic

2938
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:53,730
narrative some podcasts are one topic
 

2939
00:58:53,730 --> 00:58:55,860
narrative some podcasts are one topic
kind of like yours but different guests

2940
00:58:55,860 --> 00:58:55,870
kind of like yours but different guests
 

2941
00:58:55,870 --> 00:58:57,990
kind of like yours but different guests
so you could jump in anywhere some potes

2942
00:58:57,990 --> 00:58:58,000
so you could jump in anywhere some potes
 

2943
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,670
so you could jump in anywhere some potes
I have completely different topics and

2944
00:58:59,670 --> 00:58:59,680
I have completely different topics and
 

2945
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:01,560
I have completely different topics and
for those podcasts it might be that I

2946
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:01,570
for those podcasts it might be that I
 

2947
00:59:01,570 --> 00:59:04,080
for those podcasts it might be that I
want you know we should recommend one

2948
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:04,090
want you know we should recommend one
 

2949
00:59:04,090 --> 00:59:06,840
want you know we should recommend one
episode because it's about AI yeah from

2950
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:06,850
episode because it's about AI yeah from
 

2951
00:59:06,850 --> 00:59:08,070
episode because it's about AI yeah from
someone but then they talk about

2952
00:59:08,070 --> 00:59:08,080
someone but then they talk about
 

2953
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:09,930
someone but then they talk about
something that you're not interested in

2954
00:59:09,930 --> 00:59:09,940
something that you're not interested in
 

2955
00:59:09,940 --> 00:59:11,700
something that you're not interested in
the rest of the episodes so I think or

2956
00:59:11,700 --> 00:59:11,710
the rest of the episodes so I think or
 

2957
00:59:11,710 --> 00:59:13,800
the rest of the episodes so I think or
well we're spending a lot of time on now

2958
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:13,810
well we're spending a lot of time on now
 

2959
00:59:13,810 --> 00:59:15,630
well we're spending a lot of time on now
it's just first understanding the domain

2960
00:59:15,630 --> 00:59:15,640
it's just first understanding the domain
 

2961
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:17,520
it's just first understanding the domain
and creating kind of the knowledge graph

2962
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:17,530
and creating kind of the knowledge graph
 

2963
00:59:17,530 --> 00:59:21,600
and creating kind of the knowledge graph
of how do these objects relate and how

2964
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:21,610
of how do these objects relate and how
 

2965
00:59:21,610 --> 00:59:23,040
of how do these objects relate and how

out of what that means then you can work

3174
01:03:16,030 --> 01:03:16,040
out of what that means then you can work
 

3175
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:17,470
out of what that means then you can work

learning age and and what we discovered

3184
01:03:27,610 --> 01:03:27,620
learning age and and what we discovered
 

3185
01:03:27,620 --> 01:03:29,350
learning age and and what we discovered
was that a lot of it is actually in the

3186
01:03:29,350 --> 01:03:29,360
was that a lot of it is actually in the
 

3187
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:32,290
was that a lot of it is actually in the
expectation and you can go you can go

3188
01:03:32,290 --> 01:03:32,300
expectation and you can go you can go
 

3189
01:03:32,300 --> 01:03:35,740
expectation and you can go you can go
two ways so

3190
01:03:35,740 --> 01:03:35,750

 

3191
01:03:35,750 --> 01:03:38,559

let's say that if you if you set the

3192
01:03:38,559 --> 01:03:38,569
let's say that if you if you set the
 

3193
01:03:38,569 --> 01:03:40,120
let's say that if you if you set the
expectation with the user that this is a

3194
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:40,130
expectation with the user that this is a
 

3195
01:03:40,130 --> 01:03:41,890

discovery product like discover weekly
 

3197
01:03:41,900 --> 01:03:44,380
discovery product like discover weekly
you're actually setting the expectation

3198
01:03:44,380 --> 01:03:44,390
you're actually setting the expectation
 

3199
01:03:44,390 --> 01:03:45,970
you're actually setting the expectation
that most of all we show you will not be

3200
01:03:45,970 --> 01:03:45,980
that most of all we show you will not be
 

3201
01:03:45,980 --> 01:03:47,829
that most of all we show you will not be
relevant when you're in the discovery

3202
01:03:47,829 --> 01:03:47,839
relevant when you're in the discovery
 

3203
01:03:47,839 --> 01:03:48,930
relevant when you're in the discovery
process you're gonna accept that

3204
01:03:48,930 --> 01:03:48,940
process you're gonna accept that
 

3205
01:03:48,940 --> 01:03:51,700
process you're gonna accept that
actually if you find one gem every

3206
01:03:51,700 --> 01:03:51,710
actually if you find one gem every
 

3207
01:03:51,710 --> 01:03:54,010
actually if you find one gem every
Monday that you totally love you're

3208
01:03:54,010 --> 01:03:54,020
Monday that you totally love you're
 

3209
01:03:54,020 --> 01:03:56,500
Monday that you totally love you're
probably gonna be happy even though the

3210
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:56,510
probably gonna be happy even though the
 

3211
01:03:56,510 --> 01:03:58,390
probably gonna be happy even though the
statistical meaning one out of ten is

terrible or one out of twenty is
 

3215
01:03:59,780 --> 01:04:01,120
terrible or one out of twenty is
terrible from a user point of view

3216
01:04:01,120 --> 01:04:01,130
terrible from a user point of view
 

3217
01:04:01,130 --> 01:04:02,349
terrible from a user point of view
because the studying was discoveries

3218
01:04:02,349 --> 01:04:02,359
because the studying was discoveries
 

3219
01:04:02,359 --> 01:04:04,390

maybe I can do issue tracking I couldn't

3230
01:04:18,550 --> 01:04:18,560
maybe I can do issue tracking I couldn't
 

3231
01:04:18,560 --> 01:04:21,160
maybe I can do issue tracking I couldn't
find them my Spotify app it's in your

3232
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:21,170
find them my Spotify app it's in your
 

3233
01:04:21,170 --> 01:04:23,079
find them my Spotify app it's in your
library it's in the library it's in the

3234
01:04:23,079 --> 01:04:23,089
library it's in the library it's in the
 

3235
01:04:23,089 --> 01:04:24,910

list of life cuz I was like whoa is just

3236
01:04:24,910 --> 01:04:24,920
list of life cuz I was like whoa is just
 

3237
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:26,620

cool I didn't know this existed and I

3238
01:04:26,620 --> 01:04:26,630
cool I didn't know this existed and I
 

3239
01:04:26,630 --> 01:04:29,559
cool I didn't know this existed and I
try to find it but I'll show it to you

3240

I just uh just to mention the
 

3245
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:40,270
I just uh just to mention the
expectation there is basically they

3246
01:04:40,270 --> 01:04:40,280
expectation there is basically they
 

3247
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:42,130

you're going to discover in your song

3248
01:04:42,130 --> 01:04:42,140
you're going to discover in your song
 

3249
01:04:42,140 --> 01:04:44,020

yes so then you can be quite adventurous
 

3251
01:04:44,030 --> 01:04:48,460
yes so then you can be quite adventurous
in in the recommendations you do but but

3252
01:04:48,460 --> 01:04:48,470
in in the recommendations you do but but
 

3253
01:04:48,470 --> 01:04:49,960
in in the recommendations you do but but
if you're but we have another product

3254
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:49,970
if you're but we have another product
 

3255
01:04:49,970 --> 01:04:52,420
if you're but we have another product
called daily mix which kind of implies

3256
01:04:52,420 --> 01:04:52,430
called daily mix which kind of implies
 

3257
01:04:52,430 --> 01:04:53,620
called daily mix which kind of implies
that these are only going to be your

3258
01:04:53,620 --> 01:04:53,630
that these are only going to be your
 

3259
01:04:53,630 --> 01:04:55,960
that these are only going to be your
favorites so if you have one out of ten

3260
01:04:55,960 --> 01:04:55,970
favorites so if you have one out of ten
 

3261
01:04:55,970 --> 01:04:57,430
favorites so if you have one out of ten
that is good and nine out of ten that

3262
01:04:57,430 --> 01:04:57,440
that is good and nine out of ten that
 

3263
01:04:57,440 --> 01:04:58,839
that is good and nine out of ten that
doesn't work for you you're gonna think

3264
01:04:58,839 --> 01:04:58,849
doesn't work for you you're gonna think
 

3265
01:04:58,849 --> 01:05:00,190
doesn't work for you you're gonna think
it's a horrible product so actually a

3266
01:05:00,190 --> 01:05:00,200
it's a horrible product so actually a
 

3267
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:01,359
it's a horrible product so actually a
lot of the product development we

3268
01:05:01,359 --> 01:05:01,369
lot of the product development we
 

3269
01:05:01,369 --> 01:05:02,800
lot of the product development we
learned over the years it's about

3270
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:02,810
learned over the years it's about
 

3271
01:05:02,810 --> 01:05:04,809
learned over the years it's about
setting the right expectation so for

3272
01:05:04,809 --> 01:05:04,819
setting the right expectation so for
 

3273
01:05:04,819 --> 01:05:07,630
setting the right expectation so for
daily mix you know algorithmically we

3274
01:05:07,630 --> 01:05:07,640

would have because they honest they're
 

3353
01:06:33,650 --> 01:06:35,410
would have because they honest they're
much smarter than these algorithms the

01:07:00,470 --> 01:07:02,829
human-in-the-loop thinking around
machine learning and we actually coined

machine learning and we actually coined
 

3379
01:07:02,839 --> 01:07:04,690
machine learning and we actually coined
an internal term for it called algo

to create that product and you have this
 

3417
01:07:45,140 --> 01:07:46,810
to create that product and you have this
product manager if it's a musical expert

create a test set or they create a group

3430
01:08:01,030 --> 01:08:01,040
create a test set or they create a group
 

3431
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:03,099
create a test set or they create a group
of songs like a few thousand songs

3432
01:08:03,099 --> 01:08:03,109
of songs like a few thousand songs
 

3433
01:08:03,109 --> 01:08:04,269
of songs like a few thousand songs
out of the catalogue that they manually

3434
01:08:04,269 --> 01:08:04,279
out of the catalogue that they manually
 

3435
01:08:04,279 --> 01:08:06,640
out of the catalogue that they manually
curate that our known songs that are

3436
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:06,650
curate that our known songs that are
 

3437
01:08:06,650 --> 01:08:08,680
curate that our known songs that are
great to sing in the car and they can

3438
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:08,690
great to sing in the car and they can
 

3439
01:08:08,690 --> 01:08:10,630
great to sing in the car and they can
take like to romance into account they

3440
01:08:10,630 --> 01:08:10,640
take like to romance into account they
 

3441
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:12,069
take like to romance into account they
understand things that our algorithms do

3442
01:08:12,069 --> 01:08:12,079
understand things that our algorithms do
 

3443
01:08:12,079 --> 01:08:14,410
understand things that our algorithms do
not at all so they have this huge set of

3444
01:08:14,410 --> 01:08:14,420
not at all so they have this huge set of
 

3445
01:08:14,420 --> 01:08:16,859
not at all so they have this huge set of
tracks then when we deliver that to you

3446
01:08:16,859 --> 01:08:16,869
tracks then when we deliver that to you
 

3447
01:08:16,869 --> 01:08:19,149
tracks then when we deliver that to you
we look at your taste vectors and you

3448
01:08:19,149 --> 01:08:19,159
we look at your taste vectors and you
 

3449
01:08:19,159 --> 01:08:21,220
we look at your taste vectors and you
get the 20 tracks that are songs to sing

3450
01:08:21,220 --> 01:08:21,230
get the 20 tracks that are songs to sing
 

3451
01:08:21,230 --> 01:08:23,979
get the 20 tracks that are songs to sing
in the car in your taste so you have you

3452
01:08:23,979 --> 01:08:23,989
in the car in your taste so you have you
 

3453
01:08:23,989 --> 01:08:27,280
in the car in your taste so you have you
have personalization and editorial input

3454
01:08:27,280 --> 01:08:27,290
have personalization and editorial input
 

3455
01:08:27,290 --> 01:08:30,189
have personalization and editorial input
in the same process if that makes sense

3456
01:08:30,189 --> 01:08:30,199
in the same process if that makes sense
 

3457
01:08:30,199 --> 01:08:31,959
in the same process if that makes sense
yeah it makes total sense and I have

3458
01:08:31,959 --> 01:08:31,969
yeah it makes total sense and I have
 

3459
01:08:31,969 --> 01:08:33,609
yeah it makes total sense and I have
several questions around that this is a

3460
01:08:33,609 --> 01:08:33,619
several questions around that this is a
 

3461
01:08:33,619 --> 01:08:38,229
several questions around that this is a
this is like fascinating okay so first

3462
01:08:38,229 --> 01:08:38,239
this is like fascinating okay so first
 

3463
01:08:38,239 --> 01:08:41,160
this is like fascinating okay so first
it is a little bit surprising to me that

3464
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:41,170
it is a little bit surprising to me that
 

3465
01:08:41,170 --> 01:08:44,129
it is a little bit surprising to me that
the world expert humans are

3466
01:08:44,129 --> 01:08:44,139
the world expert humans are
 

3467
01:08:44,139 --> 01:08:49,269
the world expert humans are
outperforming machines at specifying

3468
01:08:49,269 --> 01:08:49,279
outperforming machines at specifying
 

3469
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:53,620
outperforming machines at specifying
songs to sing in the car so maybe you

3470
01:08:53,620 --> 01:08:53,630
songs to sing in the car so maybe you
 

3471
01:08:53,630 --> 01:08:54,700
songs to sing in the car so maybe you
could talk to that a little bit I don't

3472
01:08:54,700 --> 01:08:54,710
could talk to that a little bit I don't
 

3473
01:08:54,710 --> 01:08:56,579
could talk to that a little bit I don't
know if you can put it into words but

3474
01:08:56,579 --> 01:08:56,589
know if you can put it into words but
 

3475
01:08:56,589 --> 01:09:00,359
know if you can put it into words but
what is it how difficult is this problem

3476
01:09:00,359 --> 01:09:00,369
what is it how difficult is this problem
 

3477
01:09:00,369 --> 01:09:04,599
what is it how difficult is this problem
of tea do you really I guess what I'm

3478
01:09:04,599 --> 01:09:04,609
of tea do you really I guess what I'm
 

3479
01:09:04,609 --> 01:09:06,910
of tea do you really I guess what I'm
trying to ask is there how difficult is

3480
01:09:06,910 --> 01:09:06,920
trying to ask is there how difficult is
 

3481
01:09:06,920 --> 01:09:10,019
trying to ask is there how difficult is
it to encode the cultural references the

3482
01:09:10,019 --> 01:09:10,029
it to encode the cultural references the
 

3483
01:09:10,029 --> 01:09:14,019
it to encode the cultural references the
the context of the song the artists all

3484
01:09:14,019 --> 01:09:14,029
the context of the song the artists all
 

3485
01:09:14,029 --> 01:09:15,820
the context of the song the artists all
those things together can machine

3486
01:09:15,820 --> 01:09:15,830
those things together can machine
 

3487
01:09:15,830 --> 01:09:18,309
those things together can machine
learning really not do that I mean I

3488
01:09:18,309 --> 01:09:18,319
learning really not do that I mean I
 

3489
01:09:18,319 --> 01:09:19,839
learning really not do that I mean I
think machine learning is great at

3490
01:09:19,839 --> 01:09:19,849
think machine learning is great at
 

3491
01:09:19,849 --> 01:09:23,229
think machine learning is great at
replicating patterns if you have the

3492
01:09:23,229 --> 01:09:23,239
replicating patterns if you have the
 

3493
01:09:23,239 --> 01:09:25,570
replicating patterns if you have the
patterns but if you try to write with me

3494
01:09:25,570 --> 01:09:25,580
patterns but if you try to write with me
 

3495
01:09:25,580 --> 01:09:27,700
patterns but if you try to write with me
a spec of what songs greatest song

3496
01:09:27,700 --> 01:09:27,710
a spec of what songs greatest song
 

3497
01:09:27,710 --> 01:09:30,280
a spec of what songs greatest song
testing in the card definition is is it

3498
01:09:30,280 --> 01:09:30,290
testing in the card definition is is it
 

3499
01:09:30,290 --> 01:09:32,229
testing in the card definition is is it
is it loud there's many choruses

3500
01:09:32,229 --> 01:09:32,239
is it loud there's many choruses
 

3501
01:09:32,239 --> 01:09:34,390
is it loud there's many choruses
should've been in movies it's it quickly

3502
01:09:34,390 --> 01:09:34,400
should've been in movies it's it quickly
 

3503
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:36,609
should've been in movies it's it quickly
gets incredibly complicated right yeah

3504
01:09:36,609 --> 01:09:36,619
gets incredibly complicated right yeah
 

3505
01:09:36,619 --> 01:09:39,519
gets incredibly complicated right yeah
and and a lot of it may not be in the

3506
01:09:39,519 --> 01:09:39,529
and and a lot of it may not be in the
 

3507
01:09:39,529 --> 01:09:41,169
and and a lot of it may not be in the
structure of the song or the title it

3508
01:09:41,169 --> 01:09:41,179
structure of the song or the title it
 

3509
01:09:41,179 --> 01:09:43,780
structure of the song or the title it
could be cultural references because you

3510
01:09:43,780 --> 01:09:43,790
could be cultural references because you
 

3511
01:09:43,790 --> 01:09:45,970
could be cultural references because you
know it was a history once so so the

3512
01:09:45,970 --> 01:09:45,980
know it was a history once so so the
 

3513
01:09:45,980 --> 01:09:48,550
know it was a history once so so the
definition problems quickly get and I

3514
01:09:48,550 --> 01:09:48,560
definition problems quickly get and I
 

3515
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:50,169
definition problems quickly get and I
think that was the that was the insight

3516
01:09:50,169 --> 01:09:50,179
think that was the that was the insight
 

3517
01:09:50,179 --> 01:09:52,479
think that was the that was the insight
of Andrew Aang when he said the job of

3518
01:09:52,479 --> 01:09:52,489
of Andrew Aang when he said the job of
 

3519
01:09:52,489 --> 01:09:53,709
of Andrew Aang when he said the job of
the product manager is to understand

3520
01:09:53,709 --> 01:09:53,719
the product manager is to understand
 

3521
01:09:53,719 --> 01:09:55,780
the product manager is to understand
these things that that algorithms don't

3522
01:09:55,780 --> 01:09:55,790
these things that that algorithms don't
 

3523
01:09:55,790 --> 01:09:58,839
these things that that algorithms don't
and then define what that looks like and

3524
01:09:58,839 --> 01:09:58,849
and then define what that looks like and
 

3525
01:09:58,849 --> 01:10:00,370
and then define what that looks like and
then you have something to train towards

3526
01:10:00,370 --> 01:10:00,380
then you have something to train towards
 

3527
01:10:00,380 --> 01:10:02,290
then you have something to train towards
right then you have kind of the test set

3528
01:10:02,290 --> 01:10:02,300
right then you have kind of the test set
 

3529
01:10:02,300 --> 01:10:05,080
right then you have kind of the test set
and then so so today the editors create

3530
01:10:05,080 --> 01:10:05,090
and then so so today the editors create
 

3531
01:10:05,090 --> 01:10:06,490
and then so so today the editors create
this pool of tracks and then we

3532
01:10:06,490 --> 01:10:06,500
this pool of tracks and then we
 

3533
01:10:06,500 --> 01:10:07,930
this pool of tracks and then we
personalize you could easily imagine

3534
01:10:07,930 --> 01:10:07,940
personalize you could easily imagine
 

3535
01:10:07,940 --> 01:10:10,000
personalize you could easily imagine
that once you have this set you could

3536
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:10,010
that once you have this set you could
 

3537
01:10:10,010 --> 01:10:11,439
that once you have this set you could
have some automatic exploration on the

3538
01:10:11,439 --> 01:10:11,449
have some automatic exploration on the
 

3539
01:10:11,449 --> 01:10:13,000
have some automatic exploration on the
rest of the catalogue because then you

3540
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:13,010
rest of the catalogue because then you
 

3541
01:10:13,010 --> 01:10:15,160
rest of the catalogue because then you
understand what it is and then the other

3542
01:10:15,160 --> 01:10:15,170
understand what it is and then the other
 

3543
01:10:15,170 --> 01:10:16,750
understand what it is and then the other
side of it what machine learning

3544
01:10:16,750 --> 01:10:16,760
side of it what machine learning
 

3545
01:10:16,760 --> 01:10:21,040
side of it what machine learning
does help is this taste vector how hard

3546
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:21,050
does help is this taste vector how hard
 

3547
01:10:21,050 --> 01:10:23,770
does help is this taste vector how hard
is it to construct a vector that

3548
01:10:23,770 --> 01:10:23,780
is it to construct a vector that
 

3549
01:10:23,780 --> 01:10:26,680
is it to construct a vector that
represents the things an individual

3550
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:26,690
represents the things an individual
 

3551
01:10:26,690 --> 01:10:30,310
represents the things an individual
human likes it this human preference so

3552
01:10:30,310 --> 01:10:30,320
human likes it this human preference so
 

3553
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:34,450
human likes it this human preference so
you can you know music isn't like it's

3554
01:10:34,450 --> 01:10:34,460
you can you know music isn't like it's
 

3555
01:10:34,460 --> 01:10:36,670
you can you know music isn't like it's
not like Amazon like things you usually

3556
01:10:36,670 --> 01:10:36,680
not like Amazon like things you usually
 

3557
01:10:36,680 --> 01:10:40,420
not like Amazon like things you usually
buy music seems more amorphous like it's

3558
01:10:40,420 --> 01:10:40,430
buy music seems more amorphous like it's
 

3559
01:10:40,430 --> 01:10:43,320
buy music seems more amorphous like it's
this thing that's hard to specify like

3560
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:43,330
this thing that's hard to specify like
 

3561
01:10:43,330 --> 01:10:46,060
this thing that's hard to specify like
what what is what you know if you look

3562
01:10:46,060 --> 01:10:46,070
what what is what you know if you look
 

3563
01:10:46,070 --> 01:10:47,920
what what is what you know if you look
at my playlist what is the music that I

3564
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:47,930
at my playlist what is the music that I
 

3565
01:10:47,930 --> 01:10:51,790
at my playlist what is the music that I
love it's harder it seems to be much

3566
01:10:51,790 --> 01:10:51,800
love it's harder it seems to be much
 

3567
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:54,280
love it's harder it seems to be much
more difficult to specify concretely so

3568
01:10:54,280 --> 01:10:54,290
more difficult to specify concretely so
 

3569
01:10:54,290 --> 01:10:56,350
more difficult to specify concretely so
how hard is it to a build the taste

3570
01:10:56,350 --> 01:10:56,360
how hard is it to a build the taste
 

3571
01:10:56,360 --> 01:10:58,690
how hard is it to a build the taste
vector it is very hard in the sense that

3572
01:10:58,690 --> 01:10:58,700
vector it is very hard in the sense that
 

3573
01:10:58,700 --> 01:11:01,690
vector it is very hard in the sense that
you need a lot of data and I think what

3574
01:11:01,690 --> 01:11:01,700
you need a lot of data and I think what
 

3575
01:11:01,700 --> 01:11:04,810
you need a lot of data and I think what
we found was that so it's not so it's

3576
01:11:04,810 --> 01:11:04,820
we found was that so it's not so it's
 

3577
01:11:04,820 --> 01:11:06,790
we found was that so it's not so it's
not a stationery problem most it changes

3578
01:11:06,790 --> 01:11:06,800
not a stationery problem most it changes
 

3579
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:11,830
not a stationery problem most it changes
over time and so we've gone through the

3580
01:11:11,830 --> 01:11:11,840
over time and so we've gone through the
 

3581
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:14,890
over time and so we've gone through the
journey of if you've done a lot of

3582
01:11:14,890 --> 01:11:14,900
journey of if you've done a lot of
 

3583
01:11:14,900 --> 01:11:16,450
journey of if you've done a lot of
computer vision obviously I've done a

3584
01:11:16,450 --> 01:11:16,460
computer vision obviously I've done a
 

3585
01:11:16,460 --> 01:11:18,460
computer vision obviously I've done a
bunch of computer vision in my past and

3586
01:11:18,460 --> 01:11:18,470
bunch of computer vision in my past and
 

3587
01:11:18,470 --> 01:11:19,900
bunch of computer vision in my past and
and we started kind of with the

3588
01:11:19,900 --> 01:11:19,910
and we started kind of with the
 

3589
01:11:19,910 --> 01:11:23,590
and we started kind of with the
handcrafted heuristics for you know this

3590
01:11:23,590 --> 01:11:23,600
handcrafted heuristics for you know this
 

3591
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:25,600
handcrafted heuristics for you know this
is kind of in the music this is this and

3592
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:25,610
is kind of in the music this is this and
 

3593
01:11:25,610 --> 01:11:27,070
is kind of in the music this is this and
if you consume this you probably like

3594
01:11:27,070 --> 01:11:27,080
if you consume this you probably like
 

3595
01:11:27,080 --> 01:11:29,979
if you consume this you probably like
this so we have we started there and we

3596
01:11:29,979 --> 01:11:29,989
this so we have we started there and we
 

3597
01:11:29,989 --> 01:11:31,870
this so we have we started there and we
have some of that still then what was

3598
01:11:31,870 --> 01:11:31,880
have some of that still then what was
 

3599
01:11:31,880 --> 01:11:33,729
have some of that still then what was
interesting about the playlist data was

3600
01:11:33,729 --> 01:11:33,739
interesting about the playlist data was
 

3601
01:11:33,739 --> 01:11:35,020
interesting about the playlist data was
that you could find these latent things

3602
01:11:35,020 --> 01:11:35,030
that you could find these latent things
 

3603
01:11:35,030 --> 01:11:36,910
that you could find these latent things
that wouldn't necessarily even make

3604
01:11:36,910 --> 01:11:36,920
that wouldn't necessarily even make
 

3605
01:11:36,920 --> 01:11:39,820
that wouldn't necessarily even make
sense to you that could could even

3606
01:11:39,820 --> 01:11:39,830
sense to you that could could even
 

3607
01:11:39,830 --> 01:11:41,500
sense to you that could could even
capture maybe cultural references

3608
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:41,510
capture maybe cultural references
 

3609
01:11:41,510 --> 01:11:43,390
capture maybe cultural references
because they Co occurred things that

3610
01:11:43,390 --> 01:11:43,400
because they Co occurred things that
 

3611
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:45,930
because they Co occurred things that
they wouldn't have appeared

3612
01:11:45,930 --> 01:11:45,940
they wouldn't have appeared
 

3613
01:11:45,940 --> 01:11:48,040
they wouldn't have appeared
mechanistically either in the content or

3614
01:11:48,040 --> 01:11:48,050
mechanistically either in the content or
 

3615
01:11:48,050 --> 01:11:57,670
mechanistically either in the content or
so forth so I think that I think the

3616
01:11:57,670 --> 01:11:57,680
so forth so I think that I think the
 

3617
01:11:57,680 --> 01:12:00,040
so forth so I think that I think the
core assumption is that there are

3618
01:12:00,040 --> 01:12:00,050
core assumption is that there are
 

3619
01:12:00,050 --> 01:12:03,729
core assumption is that there are
patterns in in almost everything and if

3620
01:12:03,729 --> 01:12:03,739
patterns in in almost everything and if
 

3621
01:12:03,739 --> 01:12:06,070
patterns in in almost everything and if
there are patterns these these embedding

3622
01:12:06,070 --> 01:12:06,080
there are patterns these these embedding
 

3623
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:07,240
there are patterns these these embedding
techniques are getting better and better

3624
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:07,250
techniques are getting better and better
 

3625
01:12:07,250 --> 01:12:10,600
techniques are getting better and better
now if now as everyone else we're also

3626
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:10,610
now if now as everyone else we're also
 

3627
01:12:10,610 --> 01:12:12,940
now if now as everyone else we're also
using kind of deep embedding so you can

3628
01:12:12,940 --> 01:12:12,950
using kind of deep embedding so you can
 

3629
01:12:12,950 --> 01:12:16,420
using kind of deep embedding so you can
encode binary values and so forth and

3630
01:12:16,420 --> 01:12:16,430
encode binary values and so forth and
 

3631
01:12:16,430 --> 01:12:18,880
encode binary values and so forth and
what I think is interesting is is this

3632
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:18,890
what I think is interesting is is this
 

3633
01:12:18,890 --> 01:12:23,050
what I think is interesting is is this
process to try to find things that they

3634
01:12:23,050 --> 01:12:23,060
process to try to find things that they
 

3635
01:12:23,060 --> 01:12:24,640
process to try to find things that they
do not necessarily you wouldn't actually

3636
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:24,650
do not necessarily you wouldn't actually
 

3637
01:12:24,650 --> 01:12:27,910
do not necessarily you wouldn't actually
have have guessed so it is very hard in

3638
01:12:27,910 --> 01:12:27,920
have have guessed so it is very hard in
 

3639
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:30,310
have have guessed so it is very hard in
a in an engineering sense to find the

3640
01:12:30,310 --> 01:12:30,320
a in an engineering sense to find the
 

3641
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:32,520
a in an engineering sense to find the
dimensions it's an incredible

3642
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:32,530
dimensions it's an incredible
 

3643
01:12:32,530 --> 01:12:35,290
dimensions it's an incredible
scalability problem to do for hundreds

3644
01:12:35,290 --> 01:12:35,300
scalability problem to do for hundreds
 

3645
01:12:35,300 --> 01:12:36,610

embeddings isn't that complicated the

3650
01:12:44,440 --> 01:12:44,450
embeddings isn't that complicated the
 

3651
01:12:44,450 --> 01:12:46,690
embeddings isn't that complicated the
fact that you try to find some principal

3652
01:12:46,690 --> 01:12:46,700
fact that you try to find some principal
 

3653
01:12:46,700 --> 01:12:48,210
fact that you try to find some principal
components or some like that

3654
01:12:48,210 --> 01:12:48,220
components or some like that
 

3655
01:12:48,220 --> 01:12:50,200

dimensionality reduction is also the

3656
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:50,210
dimensionality reduction is also the
 

3657
01:12:50,210 --> 01:12:51,310
dimensionality reduction is also the
theory I guess is easy that the

3658
01:12:51,310 --> 01:12:51,320
theory I guess is easy that the
 

3659
01:12:51,320 --> 01:12:53,860
theory I guess is easy that the
practices is very very hard and it's a

3660
01:12:53,860 --> 01:12:53,870
practices is very very hard and it's a
 

3661
01:12:53,870 --> 01:12:56,290
practices is very very hard and it's a
it's a huge engineering challenge but

3662
01:12:56,290 --> 01:12:56,300
it's a huge engineering challenge but
 

3663
01:12:56,300 --> 01:12:57,970
it's a huge engineering challenge but
fortunately we have some amazing

3664
01:12:57,970 --> 01:12:57,980
fortunately we have some amazing
 

3665
01:12:57,980 --> 01:13:00,700
fortunately we have some amazing
research and engineering teams in this

3666
01:13:00,700 --> 01:13:00,710
research and engineering teams in this
 

3667
01:13:00,710 --> 01:13:04,150
research and engineering teams in this
space yeah I guess the the question is

3668
01:13:04,150 --> 01:13:04,160
space yeah I guess the the question is
 

3669
01:13:04,160 --> 01:13:06,700
space yeah I guess the the question is
all I mean it's similar I deal with it

3670
01:13:06,700 --> 01:13:06,710
all I mean it's similar I deal with it
 

3671
01:13:06,710 --> 01:13:08,470
all I mean it's similar I deal with it
with an autonomous vehicle spaces the

3672
01:13:08,470 --> 01:13:08,480
with an autonomous vehicle spaces the
 

3673
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:12,490
with an autonomous vehicle spaces the
question is how hard is driving and here

3674
01:13:12,490 --> 01:13:12,500
question is how hard is driving and here
 

3675
01:13:12,500 --> 01:13:15,610
question is how hard is driving and here
is basically the question is of edge

3676
01:13:15,610 --> 01:13:15,620
is basically the question is of edge
 

3677
01:13:15,620 --> 01:13:22,960
is basically the question is of edge
cases so embedding probably works not

3678
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:22,970
cases so embedding probably works not
 

3679
01:13:22,970 --> 01:13:25,390
cases so embedding probably works not
probably but I would imagine works well

3680
01:13:25,390 --> 01:13:25,400
probably but I would imagine works well
 

3681
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:28,540
probably but I would imagine works well
in a lot of cases so there's a bunch of

3682
01:13:28,540 --> 01:13:28,550
in a lot of cases so there's a bunch of
 

3683
01:13:28,550 --> 01:13:31,570
in a lot of cases so there's a bunch of
questions that arise then so do song

3684
01:13:31,570 --> 01:13:31,580
questions that arise then so do song
 

3685
01:13:31,580 --> 01:13:33,370
questions that arise then so do song
preferences does your taste vector

3686
01:13:33,370 --> 01:13:33,380
preferences does your taste vector
 

3687
01:13:33,380 --> 01:13:38,680
preferences does your taste vector
depend on context like mood right so

3688
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:38,690
depend on context like mood right so
 

3689
01:13:38,690 --> 01:13:41,710
depend on context like mood right so
there's different moods and absolutely

3690
01:13:41,710 --> 01:13:41,720
there's different moods and absolutely
 

3691
01:13:41,720 --> 01:13:46,600
there's different moods and absolutely
so how does that take in is it is it

3692
01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:46,610
so how does that take in is it is it
 

3693
01:13:46,610 --> 01:13:48,250
so how does that take in is it is it
possible to take that at consideration

3694
01:13:48,250 --> 01:13:48,260
possible to take that at consideration
 

3695
01:13:48,260 --> 01:13:51,490
possible to take that at consideration
or do you just leave that as a interface

3696
01:13:51,490 --> 01:13:51,500
or do you just leave that as a interface
 

3697
01:13:51,500 --> 01:13:53,080
or do you just leave that as a interface
problem that allows the user to just

3700
01:13:55,030 --> 01:13:55,040
control it so when I'm looking for
 

3701
01:13:55,040 --> 01:13:58,180
control it so when I'm looking for
workout music I kind of specify it by

01:13:58,180 --> 01:13:58,190
workout music I kind of specify it by
 

3703
01:13:58,190 --> 01:13:59,980
workout music I kind of specify it by
choosing certain players doing certain

3704
01:13:59,980 --> 01:13:59,990
choosing certain players doing certain
 

3705
01:13:59,990 --> 01:14:03,040
choosing certain players doing certain
search yeah so that's a great point it's

3706
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:03,050
search yeah so that's a great point it's
 

3707
01:14:03,050 --> 01:14:04,960
search yeah so that's a great point it's

back to the product development you
 

3709
01:14:04,970 --> 01:14:06,730
back to the product development you
could try to spend a few years trying to

automatically open Spotify or you create

3714
01:14:11,260 --> 01:14:11,270
automatically open Spotify or you create
 

3715
01:14:11,270 --> 01:14:13,180
automatically open Spotify or you create
a tab which is happy and sad right and

3716
01:14:13,180 --> 01:14:13,190
a tab which is happy and sad right and
 

3717
01:14:13,190 --> 01:14:14,470
a tab which is happy and sad right and
you're gonna be right 100% of the time

01:14:14,470 --> 01:14:14,480
you're gonna be right 100% of the time

you're gonna be right 100% of the time
with one click now it's probably much

01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:16,970
with one click now it's probably much
 

3721
01:14:16,970 --> 01:14:18,670
with one click now it's probably much
better to let the user tell you if

3722
01:14:18,670 --> 01:14:18,680
better to let the user tell you if
 

3723
01:14:18,680 --> 01:14:19,990
better to let the user tell you if
they're happy or sad or if they want to

01:14:24,580 --> 01:14:24,590
the interface become 2,000 tabs you're
 

3729
01:14:24,590 --> 01:14:26,080
the interface become 2,000 tabs you're
introducing so much friction so no one

3730
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:26,090
introducing so much friction so no one
 

3731
01:14:26,090 --> 01:14:27,550
introducing so much friction so no one
will use the product so then you have to

3732
01:14:27,550 --> 01:14:27,560
will use the product so then you have to
 

3733
01:14:27,560 --> 01:14:30,160
will use the product so then you have to
get better so it's this thing where I

3734
01:14:30,160 --> 01:14:30,170
get better so it's this thing where I
 

3735
01:14:30,170 --> 01:14:33,220
get better so it's this thing where I
think it maybe was I remember who coined

01:14:33,220 --> 01:14:33,230
think it maybe was I remember who coined
 

3737
01:14:33,230 --> 01:14:34,810
think it maybe was I remember who coined
it but it's called fault tolerant you is

01:14:34,820 --> 01:14:36,520
it but it's called fault tolerant you is
right you build the UI that is tolerant

3740
01:14:36,520 --> 01:14:36,530
right you build the UI that is tolerant
 

3741
01:14:36,530 --> 01:14:39,490
right you build the UI that is tolerant
of being wrong and then you can be much

3742
01:14:39,490 --> 01:14:39,500
of being wrong and then you can be much
 

3743
01:14:39,500 --> 01:14:41,950
of being wrong and then you can be much
less right in your you know in your

3744
01:14:41,950 --> 01:14:41,960
less right in your you know in your
 

3745
01:14:41,960 --> 01:14:42,840
less right in your you know in your
algorithms

3746
01:14:42,840 --> 01:14:42,850
algorithms
 

3747
01:14:42,850 --> 01:14:45,150
algorithms
so we you know we've had to learn a lot

3748
01:14:45,150 --> 01:14:45,160
so we you know we've had to learn a lot
 

3749
01:14:45,160 --> 01:14:47,070
so we you know we've had to learn a lot
of that building the right UI that fits

3750
01:14:47,070 --> 01:14:47,080
of that building the right UI that fits
 

3751
01:14:47,080 --> 01:14:49,470
of that building the right UI that fits
where the where the machine learning is

3752
01:14:49,470 --> 01:14:49,480
where the where the machine learning is
 

3753
01:14:49,480 --> 01:14:53,010
where the where the machine learning is
and and a great discovery there which is

3754
01:14:53,010 --> 01:14:53,020
and and a great discovery there which is
 

3755
01:14:53,020 --> 01:14:55,920
and and a great discovery there which is
which was by the teams during one of our

3756
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:55,930
which was by the teams during one of our
 

3757
01:14:55,930 --> 01:14:58,230
which was by the teams during one of our
hack days was this thing of taking

3758
01:14:58,230 --> 01:14:58,240
hack days was this thing of taking
 

3759
01:14:58,240 --> 01:15:00,210
hack days was this thing of taking
discovery packaging it into a playlist

3760
01:15:00,210 --> 01:15:00,220
discovery packaging it into a playlist
 

3761
01:15:00,220 --> 01:15:03,080
discovery packaging it into a playlist
and saying that these are new tracks

3762
01:15:03,080 --> 01:15:03,090
and saying that these are new tracks
 

3763
01:15:03,090 --> 01:15:05,790
and saying that these are new tracks
that we think you might like based on

3764
01:15:05,790 --> 01:15:05,800
that we think you might like based on
 

3765
01:15:05,800 --> 01:15:07,320
that we think you might like based on
this and studying the right expectation

3766
01:15:07,320 --> 01:15:07,330
this and studying the right expectation
 

3767
01:15:07,330 --> 01:15:09,720
this and studying the right expectation
made it made it a great product so I

3768
01:15:09,720 --> 01:15:09,730
made it made it a great product so I
 

3769
01:15:09,730 --> 01:15:11,370
made it made it a great product so I
think we have this benefit that for

3770
01:15:11,370 --> 01:15:11,380
think we have this benefit that for
 

3771
01:15:11,380 --> 01:15:15,120
think we have this benefit that for
example Tesla doesn't have that we can

3772
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:15,130
example Tesla doesn't have that we can
 

3773
01:15:15,130 --> 01:15:17,100
example Tesla doesn't have that we can
we can we can change the expectation we

3774
01:15:17,100 --> 01:15:17,110
we can we can change the expectation we
 

3775
01:15:17,110 --> 01:15:18,090
we can we can change the expectation we
can we can build a fault-tolerant

3776
01:15:18,090 --> 01:15:18,100
can we can build a fault-tolerant
 

3777
01:15:18,100 --> 01:15:19,740
can we can build a fault-tolerant
setting it's very hard to be fault

3778
01:15:19,740 --> 01:15:19,750
setting it's very hard to be fault
 

3779
01:15:19,750 --> 01:15:21,570
setting it's very hard to be fault
tolerant when you're driving at you know

3780
01:15:21,570 --> 01:15:21,580
tolerant when you're driving at you know
 

3781
01:15:21,580 --> 01:15:24,210
tolerant when you're driving at you know
100 miles per hour or something and and

3782
01:15:24,210 --> 01:15:24,220
100 miles per hour or something and and
 

3783
01:15:24,220 --> 01:15:26,670
100 miles per hour or something and and
we we have the luxury of being able to

3784
01:15:26,670 --> 01:15:26,680
we we have the luxury of being able to
 

3785
01:15:26,680 --> 01:15:28,860
we we have the luxury of being able to
say that of being wrong if we have the

3786
01:15:28,860 --> 01:15:28,870
say that of being wrong if we have the
 

3787
01:15:28,870 --> 01:15:32,130
say that of being wrong if we have the
right UI which gives us different

3788
01:15:32,130 --> 01:15:32,140
right UI which gives us different
 

3789
01:15:32,140 --> 01:15:33,780
right UI which gives us different
abilities to take more risk so I

3790
01:15:33,780 --> 01:15:33,790
abilities to take more risk so I
 

3791
01:15:33,790 --> 01:15:35,910
abilities to take more risk so I
actually think the self-driving problem

3792
01:15:35,910 --> 01:15:35,920
actually think the self-driving problem
 

3793
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:39,120
actually think the self-driving problem
is is much harder oh yeah for sure

3794
01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:39,130
is is much harder oh yeah for sure
 

3795
01:15:39,130 --> 01:15:43,890
is is much harder oh yeah for sure
it's much less fun because people die

3796
01:15:43,890 --> 01:15:43,900
it's much less fun because people die
 

3797
01:15:43,900 --> 01:15:49,440
it's much less fun because people die
exactly and in Spotify it's just such a

3798
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:49,450
exactly and in Spotify it's just such a
 

3799
01:15:49,450 --> 01:15:52,760
exactly and in Spotify it's just such a
more fun problem because failure will

3800
01:15:52,760 --> 01:15:52,770
more fun problem because failure will
 

3801
01:15:52,770 --> 01:15:55,590
more fun problem because failure will
mean failures beautiful away at least

3802
01:15:55,590 --> 01:15:55,600
mean failures beautiful away at least
 

3803
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:57,240
mean failures beautiful away at least
exploration so it's a really fun

3804
01:15:57,240 --> 01:15:57,250
exploration so it's a really fun
 

3805
01:15:57,250 --> 01:15:59,040
exploration so it's a really fun
reinforcement learning project the worst

3806
01:15:59,040 --> 01:15:59,050
reinforcement learning project the worst
 

3807
01:15:59,050 --> 01:16:01,110
reinforcement learning project the worst
case scenario is to get these WTF tweets

3808
01:16:01,110 --> 01:16:01,120
case scenario is to get these WTF tweets
 

3809
01:16:01,120 --> 01:16:03,930
case scenario is to get these WTF tweets
like how did I get this this song which

3810
01:16:03,930 --> 01:16:03,940
like how did I get this this song which
 

3811
01:16:03,940 --> 01:16:05,430
like how did I get this this song which
is a lot better than the self-driving

3812
01:16:05,430 --> 01:16:05,440
is a lot better than the self-driving
 

3813
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:09,900
is a lot better than the self-driving
favor so what's the feedback that a user

3814
01:16:09,900 --> 01:16:09,910
favor so what's the feedback that a user
 

3815
01:16:09,910 --> 01:16:13,560
favor so what's the feedback that a user
puts the signal that a user provides

3816
01:16:13,560 --> 01:16:13,570
puts the signal that a user provides
 

3817
01:16:13,570 --> 01:16:17,100
puts the signal that a user provides
into the system so the the you mentioned

3818
01:16:17,100 --> 01:16:17,110
into the system so the the you mentioned
 

3819
01:16:17,110 --> 01:16:20,400
into the system so the the you mentioned
skipping what is like the strongest

3820
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:20,410
skipping what is like the strongest
 

3821
01:16:20,410 --> 01:16:23,280
skipping what is like the strongest
signal is uh you didn't mention clicking

3822
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:23,290
signal is uh you didn't mention clicking
 

3823
01:16:23,290 --> 01:16:26,880
signal is uh you didn't mention clicking
like so so we have a few signals that

3824
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:26,890
like so so we have a few signals that
 

3825
01:16:26,890 --> 01:16:29,550
like so so we have a few signals that
are important obviously playing playing

3826
01:16:29,550 --> 01:16:29,560
are important obviously playing playing
 

3827
01:16:29,560 --> 01:16:31,740
are important obviously playing playing
through so so one of the benefits of

3828
01:16:31,740 --> 01:16:31,750
through so so one of the benefits of
 

3829
01:16:31,750 --> 01:16:33,540
through so so one of the benefits of
music actually even compared to podcast

3830
01:16:33,540 --> 01:16:33,550
music actually even compared to podcast
 

3831
01:16:33,550 --> 01:16:37,500
music actually even compared to podcast
or or movies is the object itself is

3832
01:16:37,500 --> 01:16:37,510
or or movies is the object itself is
 

3833
01:16:37,510 --> 01:16:39,660
or or movies is the object itself is
really only about three minutes so you

3834
01:16:39,660 --> 01:16:39,670
really only about three minutes so you
 

3835
01:16:39,670 --> 01:16:41,640
really only about three minutes so you
get a lot of chances to recommend and

3836
01:16:41,640 --> 01:16:41,650
get a lot of chances to recommend and
 

3837
01:16:41,650 --> 01:16:43,770
get a lot of chances to recommend and
the feedback loop is is every three

3838
01:16:43,770 --> 01:16:43,780
the feedback loop is is every three
 

3839
01:16:43,780 --> 01:16:45,540
the feedback loop is is every three
minutes instead of every two hours or

3840
01:16:45,540 --> 01:16:45,550
minutes instead of every two hours or
 

3841
01:16:45,550 --> 01:16:47,940
minutes instead of every two hours or
some things you actually get kind of

3842
01:16:47,940 --> 01:16:47,950
some things you actually get kind of
 

3843
01:16:47,950 --> 01:16:51,360
some things you actually get kind of
noisy but but quite fast feedback and so

3844
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:51,370
noisy but but quite fast feedback and so
 

3845
01:16:51,370 --> 01:16:52,770
noisy but but quite fast feedback and so
you can see if people played through or

3846
01:16:52,770 --> 01:16:52,780
you can see if people played through or
 

3847
01:16:52,780 --> 01:16:54,360
you can see if people played through or
if they which is you know the inverse of

3848
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:54,370
if they which is you know the inverse of
 

3849
01:16:54,370 --> 01:16:55,630
if they which is you know the inverse of
skip really that

3850
01:16:55,630 --> 01:16:55,640
skip really that
 

3851
01:16:55,640 --> 01:16:57,340
skip really that
an important signal on the other hand

3852
01:16:57,340 --> 01:16:57,350
an important signal on the other hand
 

3853
01:16:57,350 --> 01:16:59,440
an important signal on the other hand
much of the consumption happens when

3854
01:16:59,440 --> 01:16:59,450
much of the consumption happens when
 

3855
01:16:59,450 --> 01:17:00,580
much of the consumption happens when
your phone is in your pocket maybe

3856
01:17:00,580 --> 01:17:00,590
your phone is in your pocket maybe
 

3857
01:17:00,590 --> 01:17:01,900
your phone is in your pocket maybe
you're running or driving or you're

3858
01:17:01,900 --> 01:17:01,910
you're running or driving or you're
 

3859
01:17:01,910 --> 01:17:03,880
you're running or driving or you're
playing on a speaker and so you not

3860
01:17:03,880 --> 01:17:03,890
playing on a speaker and so you not
 

3861
01:17:03,890 --> 01:17:05,350
playing on a speaker and so you not
skipping doesn't mean that you love that

3862
01:17:05,350 --> 01:17:05,360
skipping doesn't mean that you love that
 

3863
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:06,850
skipping doesn't mean that you love that
song it might be that it wasn't bad

3864
01:17:06,850 --> 01:17:06,860
song it might be that it wasn't bad
 

3865
01:17:06,860 --> 01:17:08,590
song it might be that it wasn't bad
enough that you would walk up and skip

3866
01:17:08,590 --> 01:17:08,600
enough that you would walk up and skip
 

3867
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:11,350
enough that you would walk up and skip
so it's a noisy signal then then we have

3868
01:17:11,350 --> 01:17:11,360
so it's a noisy signal then then we have
 

3869
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:12,670
so it's a noisy signal then then we have
the equivalent of the like which is you

3870
01:17:12,670 --> 01:17:12,680
the equivalent of the like which is you
 

3871
01:17:12,680 --> 01:17:14,650
the equivalent of the like which is you
saved it to your library that's a pretty

3872
01:17:14,650 --> 01:17:14,660
saved it to your library that's a pretty
 

3873
01:17:14,660 --> 01:17:18,370
saved it to your library that's a pretty
strong signal of affection and then we

3874
01:17:18,370 --> 01:17:18,380
strong signal of affection and then we
 

3875
01:17:18,380 --> 01:17:20,920
strong signal of affection and then we
have the more explicit signal of play

3876
01:17:20,920 --> 01:17:20,930
have the more explicit signal of play
 

3877
01:17:20,930 --> 01:17:22,540
have the more explicit signal of play
listing like you took the time to create

3878
01:17:22,540 --> 01:17:22,550
listing like you took the time to create
 

3879
01:17:22,550 --> 01:17:24,340
listing like you took the time to create
a playlist you put it in there there's a

3880
01:17:24,340 --> 01:17:24,350
a playlist you put it in there there's a
 

3881
01:17:24,350 --> 01:17:27,370
a playlist you put it in there there's a
very little small chance that if you

3882
01:17:27,370 --> 01:17:27,380
very little small chance that if you
 

3883
01:17:27,380 --> 01:17:28,690
very little small chance that if you
took all that trouble this is not a

3884
01:17:28,690 --> 01:17:28,700
took all that trouble this is not a
 

3885
01:17:28,700 --> 01:17:30,880
took all that trouble this is not a
really important track to you and then

3886
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:30,890
really important track to you and then
 

3887
01:17:30,890 --> 01:17:33,460
really important track to you and then
we understand also what are the tracks

3888
01:17:33,460 --> 01:17:33,470
we understand also what are the tracks
 

3889
01:17:33,470 --> 01:17:35,290
we understand also what are the tracks
it relates to so we have we have the

3890
01:17:35,290 --> 01:17:35,300
it relates to so we have we have the
 

3891
01:17:35,300 --> 01:17:36,520
it relates to so we have we have the
playlist thing we have the like and then

3892
01:17:36,520 --> 01:17:36,530
playlist thing we have the like and then
 

3893
01:17:36,530 --> 01:17:39,670
playlist thing we have the like and then
we have the listening or skipped and you

3894
01:17:39,670 --> 01:17:39,680
we have the listening or skipped and you
 

3895
01:17:39,680 --> 01:17:42,040
we have the listening or skipped and you
have two very different approaches to

3896
01:17:42,040 --> 01:17:42,050
have two very different approaches to
 

3897
01:17:42,050 --> 01:17:43,360
have two very different approaches to
all of them because at different levels

3898
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:43,370
all of them because at different levels
 

3899
01:17:43,370 --> 01:17:46,060
all of them because at different levels
of noise one one is very voluminous but

3900
01:17:46,060 --> 01:17:46,070
of noise one one is very voluminous but
 

3901
01:17:46,070 --> 01:17:48,700
of noise one one is very voluminous but
noisy and the others rare but you can

3902
01:17:48,700 --> 01:17:48,710
noisy and the others rare but you can
 

3903
01:17:48,710 --> 01:17:50,950
noisy and the others rare but you can
you can probably trust it yeah it's

3904
01:17:50,950 --> 01:17:50,960
you can probably trust it yeah it's
 

3905
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:53,470
you can probably trust it yeah it's
interesting I think between those

3906
01:17:53,470 --> 01:17:53,480
interesting I think between those
 

3907
01:17:53,480 --> 01:17:55,870
interesting I think between those
signals captures all the information

3908
01:17:55,870 --> 01:17:55,880
signals captures all the information
 

3909
01:17:55,880 --> 01:17:57,640
signals captures all the information
you'd want to capture I mean there's a

3910
01:17:57,640 --> 01:17:57,650
you'd want to capture I mean there's a
 

3911
01:17:57,650 --> 01:18:00,280
you'd want to capture I mean there's a
feeling a shallow feeling for me that

3912
01:18:00,280 --> 01:18:00,290
feeling a shallow feeling for me that
 

3913
01:18:00,290 --> 01:18:02,320
feeling a shallow feeling for me that
there's sometimes I'll hear songs like

3914
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:02,330
there's sometimes I'll hear songs like
 

3915
01:18:02,330 --> 01:18:04,660
there's sometimes I'll hear songs like
yes this is you know this was the right

3916
01:18:04,660 --> 01:18:04,670
yes this is you know this was the right
 

3917
01:18:04,670 --> 01:18:06,610
yes this is you know this was the right
song for the moment but there's really

3918
01:18:06,610 --> 01:18:06,620
song for the moment but there's really
 

3919
01:18:06,620 --> 01:18:09,520
song for the moment but there's really
no way to express that fact except by

3920
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:09,530
no way to express that fact except by
 

3921
01:18:09,530 --> 01:18:11,980
no way to express that fact except by
listening through it all the way yeah

3922
01:18:11,980 --> 01:18:11,990
listening through it all the way yeah
 

3923
01:18:11,990 --> 01:18:13,720
listening through it all the way yeah
and maybe playing it again at that time

3924
01:18:13,720 --> 01:18:13,730
and maybe playing it again at that time
 

3925
01:18:13,730 --> 01:18:14,920
and maybe playing it again at that time
or something yeah

3926
01:18:14,920 --> 01:18:14,930
or something yeah
 

3927
01:18:14,930 --> 01:18:17,160
or something yeah
there's no need for a button that says

3928
01:18:17,160 --> 01:18:17,170
there's no need for a button that says
 

3929
01:18:17,170 --> 01:18:19,510
there's no need for a button that says
this was the best song I could have

3930
01:18:19,510 --> 01:18:19,520
this was the best song I could have
 

3931
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:21,250
this was the best song I could have
heard at this moment well we're playing

3932
01:18:21,250 --> 01:18:21,260
heard at this moment well we're playing
 

3933
01:18:21,260 --> 01:18:23,170
heard at this moment well we're playing
around with that with kind of the thumbs

3934
01:18:23,170 --> 01:18:23,180
around with that with kind of the thumbs
 

3935
01:18:23,180 --> 01:18:24,700
around with that with kind of the thumbs
up concept saying like I really like

3936
01:18:24,700 --> 01:18:24,710
up concept saying like I really like
 

3937
01:18:24,710 --> 01:18:26,740
up concept saying like I really like
this just kind of talking to the

3938
01:18:26,740 --> 01:18:26,750
this just kind of talking to the
 

3939
01:18:26,750 --> 01:18:28,990
this just kind of talking to the
algorithm it's unclear if that's the

3940
01:18:28,990 --> 01:18:29,000
algorithm it's unclear if that's the
 

3941
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:30,970
algorithm it's unclear if that's the
best way for you miss to interact maybe

3942
01:18:30,970 --> 01:18:30,980
best way for you miss to interact maybe
 

3943
01:18:30,980 --> 01:18:32,620
best way for you miss to interact maybe
it is maybe they should think of Spotify

3944
01:18:32,620 --> 01:18:32,630
it is maybe they should think of Spotify
 

3945
01:18:32,630 --> 01:18:35,080
it is maybe they should think of Spotify

3946
01:18:35,080 --> 01:18:35,090
has a person an agent sitting there
 

3947
01:18:35,090 --> 01:18:36,400

trying to serve you and you can say like

3948
01:18:36,400 --> 01:18:36,410
trying to serve you and you can say like
 

3949
01:18:36,410 --> 01:18:39,190
trying to serve you and you can say like
that's modified good Spotify right now

3950
01:18:39,190 --> 01:18:39,200
that's modified good Spotify right now
 

3951
01:18:39,200 --> 01:18:41,620
that's modified good Spotify right now
the analogy we've had is more you

3952
01:18:41,620 --> 01:18:41,630
the analogy we've had is more you
 

3953
01:18:41,630 --> 01:18:43,480
the analogy we've had is more you
shouldn't think of us we should be

3954
01:18:43,480 --> 01:18:43,490
shouldn't think of us we should be
 

3955
01:18:43,490 --> 01:18:45,610
shouldn't think of us we should be
invested oh and the feedback is if you

3956
01:18:45,610 --> 01:18:45,620
invested oh and the feedback is if you
 

3957
01:18:45,620 --> 01:18:48,130
invested oh and the feedback is if you
save it it's kind of you work for

3958
01:18:48,130 --> 01:18:48,140
save it it's kind of you work for
 

3959
01:18:48,140 --> 01:18:49,480
save it it's kind of you work for
yourself you do a playlist because you

3960
01:18:49,480 --> 01:18:49,490
yourself you do a playlist because you
 

3961
01:18:49,490 --> 01:18:50,440
yourself you do a playlist because you
think is great and we can learn from

3962
01:18:50,440 --> 01:18:50,450
think is great and we can learn from
 

3963
01:18:50,450 --> 01:18:53,560
think is great and we can learn from
that it's kind of back to back to Tesla

3964
01:18:53,560 --> 01:18:53,570
that it's kind of back to back to Tesla
 

3965
01:18:53,570 --> 01:18:55,270
that it's kind of back to back to Tesla
how they kind of have that shadow mode

3966
01:18:55,270 --> 01:18:55,280
how they kind of have that shadow mode
 

3967
01:18:55,280 --> 01:18:57,280
how they kind of have that shadow mode
they sit in what you drive we kind of

3968
01:18:57,280 --> 01:18:57,290
they sit in what you drive we kind of
 

3969
01:18:57,290 --> 01:18:59,260
they sit in what you drive we kind of
took the same analogy we stayed in watch

3970
01:18:59,260 --> 01:18:59,270
took the same analogy we stayed in watch
 

3971
01:18:59,270 --> 01:19:01,690
took the same analogy we stayed in watch
your playlist and then maybe we can we

3972
01:19:01,690 --> 01:19:01,700
your playlist and then maybe we can we
 

3973
01:19:01,700 --> 01:19:02,920
your playlist and then maybe we can we
can offer you an autopilot where you can

3974
01:19:02,920 --> 01:19:02,930
can offer you an autopilot where you can
 

3975
01:19:02,930 --> 01:19:04,180
can offer you an autopilot where you can
take over for a while or something like

3976
01:19:04,180 --> 01:19:04,190
take over for a while or something like
 

3977
01:19:04,190 --> 01:19:06,040
take over for a while or something like
that and then back off if you say like

3978
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:06,050
that and then back off if you say like
 

3979
01:19:06,050 --> 01:19:08,400
that and then back off if you say like
that's not that's not good enough

3980
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:08,410
that's not that's not good enough
 

3981
01:19:08,410 --> 01:19:09,750
that's not that's not good enough
but but I think it's interesting to

3982
01:19:09,750 --> 01:19:09,760
but but I think it's interesting to
 

3983
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:11,700
but but I think it's interesting to
figure out what your mental model s if

3984
01:19:11,700 --> 01:19:11,710
figure out what your mental model s if
 

3985
01:19:11,710 --> 01:19:15,480
figure out what your mental model s if
Spotify is an AI that you talk to which

3986
01:19:15,480 --> 01:19:15,490
Spotify is an AI that you talk to which
 

3987
01:19:15,490 --> 01:19:17,580
Spotify is an AI that you talk to which
I think might be a bit too abstract for

3988
01:19:17,580 --> 01:19:17,590
I think might be a bit too abstract for
 

3989
01:19:17,590 --> 01:19:20,580
I think might be a bit too abstract for
for many consumers or if you still think

3990
01:19:20,580 --> 01:19:20,590
for many consumers or if you still think
 

3991
01:19:20,590 --> 01:19:23,340
for many consumers or if you still think
of it as it's my music app but it's just

3992
01:19:23,340 --> 01:19:23,350
of it as it's my music app but it's just
 

3993
01:19:23,350 --> 01:19:25,650
of it as it's my music app but it's just
more helpful and depends on the device

3994
01:19:25,650 --> 01:19:25,660
more helpful and depends on the device
 

3995
01:19:25,660 --> 01:19:29,610
more helpful and depends on the device
it's running on which brings us to smart

speakers so I have a lot of the Spotify

3998
01:19:32,520 --> 01:19:32,530
speakers so I have a lot of the Spotify
 

3999

01:19:41,370 --> 01:19:41,380
from Amazon Google or Apple what's the
 

4005
01:19:41,380 --> 01:19:43,230
from Amazon Google or Apple what's the
role Spotify on those devices how do you

4006
01:19:43,230 --> 01:19:43,240
role Spotify on those devices how do you
 

4007
01:19:43,240 --> 01:19:45,210
role Spotify on those devices how do you
think of it differently then on the

4008
01:19:45,210 --> 01:19:45,220
think of it differently then on the
 

4009
01:19:45,220 --> 01:19:48,840
think of it differently then on the
phone or on the desktop there are few

4010
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:48,850
phone or on the desktop there are few
 

4011
01:19:48,850 --> 01:19:51,480

01:19:51,480 --> 01:19:51,490
things to say about the first of all
 

4013

it's incredibly exciting they're growing

4014
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:53,050
it's incredibly exciting they're growing
 

4015
01:19:53,050 --> 01:19:55,680
it's incredibly exciting they're growing
like crazy especially here in the in the

4016
01:19:55,680 --> 01:19:55,690
like crazy especially here in the in the

need that I think is is you can think of

4020
01:20:06,240 --> 01:20:06,250
need that I think is is you can think of
 

4021
01:20:06,250 --> 01:20:10,170
need that I think is is you can think of
it as just remote interactivity you can

4022
01:20:10,170 --> 01:20:10,180
it as just remote interactivity you can
 

4023
01:20:10,180 --> 01:20:11,880
it as just remote interactivity you can
control this thing from from from across

4024
01:20:11,880 --> 01:20:11,890
control this thing from from from across
 

4025
01:20:11,890 --> 01:20:14,100
control this thing from from from across
the room and it might may feel like a

4026
01:20:14,100 --> 01:20:14,110
the room and it might may feel like a
 

4027
01:20:14,110 --> 01:20:16,260
the room and it might may feel like a
small thing but it turns out that

4028
01:20:16,260 --> 01:20:16,270
small thing but it turns out that
 

4029
01:20:16,270 --> 01:20:18,060
small thing but it turns out that
friction matters to consumers being able

4030
01:20:18,060 --> 01:20:18,070
friction matters to consumers being able
 

4031
01:20:18,070 --> 01:20:20,730
friction matters to consumers being able
to say play pause and so forth from

4032
01:20:20,730 --> 01:20:20,740
to say play pause and so forth from
 

4033
01:20:20,740 --> 01:20:22,980
to say play pause and so forth from
across the room is very powerful so

4034
01:20:22,980 --> 01:20:22,990
across the room is very powerful so
 

4035
01:20:22,990 --> 01:20:24,990
across the room is very powerful so
basically you made you made the living

4036
01:20:24,990 --> 01:20:25,000
basically you made you made the living
 

4037
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:29,970
basically you made you made the living

01:20:40,830 --> 01:20:40,840
been important to these companies to
 

4047
01:20:40,840 --> 01:20:42,780
been important to these companies to
have those use case covered so they

4048
01:20:42,780 --> 01:20:42,790
have those use case covered so they
 

4049
01:20:42,790 --> 01:20:44,220
have those use case covered so they
wanted Spotify on this we have very good

4050
01:20:44,220 --> 01:20:44,230
wanted Spotify on this we have very good
 

4051
01:20:44,230 --> 01:20:47,970
wanted Spotify on this we have very good
relationships with with them and we're

4052
01:20:47,970 --> 01:20:47,980
relationships with with them and we're
 

4053
01:20:47,980 --> 01:20:50,430
relationships with with them and we're
seeing we're seeing tremendous success

4054
01:20:50,430 --> 01:20:50,440
seeing we're seeing tremendous success
 

4055
01:20:50,440 --> 01:20:53,460
seeing we're seeing tremendous success
for them what what I think it's

4056
01:20:53,460 --> 01:20:53,470
for them what what I think it's
 

4057
01:20:53,470 --> 01:20:55,770
for them what what I think it's
interesting about them is it's already

4058
01:20:55,770 --> 01:20:55,780
interesting about them is it's already
 

4059
01:20:55,780 --> 01:20:59,490
interesting about them is it's already
working with we kind of had this

4060
01:20:59,490 --> 01:20:59,500
working with we kind of had this
 

4061
01:20:59,500 --> 01:21:03,150
working with we kind of had this
epiphany many years ago back when we

4062
01:21:03,150 --> 01:21:03,160
epiphany many years ago back when we
 

4063
01:21:03,160 --> 01:21:05,070
epiphany many years ago back when we
started using Sonos if you went through

4064
01:21:05,070 --> 01:21:05,080
started using Sonos if you went through
 

4065
01:21:05,080 --> 01:21:06,600
started using Sonos if you went through
all the trouble of setting up your sonar

4066
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:06,610
all the trouble of setting up your sonar
 

4067
01:21:06,610 --> 01:21:08,700
all the trouble of setting up your sonar
system you had this magical experience

4068
01:21:08,700 --> 01:21:08,710
system you had this magical experience
 

4069
01:21:08,710 --> 01:21:10,950
system you had this magical experience
where you had all the music ever made in

4070
01:21:10,950 --> 01:21:10,960
where you had all the music ever made in
 

4071
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:13,680
where you had all the music ever made in
your living room and and we we we made

4072
01:21:13,680 --> 01:21:13,690
your living room and and we we we made
 

4073
01:21:13,690 --> 01:21:16,140
your living room and and we we we made
this assumption that the home everyone

4074
01:21:16,140 --> 01:21:16,150
this assumption that the home everyone
 

4075
01:21:16,150 --> 01:21:18,180
this assumption that the home everyone
use that a CD player at home but they

4076
01:21:18,180 --> 01:21:18,190
use that a CD player at home but they
 

4077
01:21:18,190 --> 01:21:19,800
use that a CD player at home but they
never managed to get their files working

4078
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:19,810
never managed to get their files working
 

4079
01:21:19,810 --> 01:21:21,890
never managed to get their files working
in the home having this network attached

4080
01:21:21,890 --> 01:21:21,900
in the home having this network attached
 

4081
01:21:21,900 --> 01:21:23,149
in the home having this network attached
which was too cumbersome for most

4082
01:21:23,149 --> 01:21:23,159
which was too cumbersome for most
 

4083
01:21:23,159 --> 01:21:25,399
which was too cumbersome for most
consumers so we made the assumption that

4084
01:21:25,399 --> 01:21:25,409
consumers so we made the assumption that
 

4085
01:21:25,409 --> 01:21:27,169
consumers so we made the assumption that
the home would skip from the CD all the

4086
01:21:27,169 --> 01:21:27,179
the home would skip from the CD all the
 

4087
01:21:27,179 --> 01:21:29,660
the home would skip from the CD all the
way to streaming books where where you

4088
01:21:29,660 --> 01:21:29,670
way to streaming books where where you
 

4089
01:21:29,670 --> 01:21:31,250
way to streaming books where where you
will get would by the steering without

4090
01:21:31,250 --> 01:21:31,260
will get would by the steering without
 

4091
01:21:31,260 --> 01:21:33,140
will get would by the steering without
all the music built-in that took longer

4092
01:21:33,140 --> 01:21:33,150
all the music built-in that took longer
 

4093
01:21:33,150 --> 01:21:34,280
all the music built-in that took longer
than we thought but with the voice

4094
01:21:34,280 --> 01:21:34,290
than we thought but with the voice
 

4095
01:21:34,290 --> 01:21:36,320
than we thought but with the voice
speakers that was the unlocking that

4096
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:36,330
speakers that was the unlocking that
 

4097
01:21:36,330 --> 01:21:37,870
speakers that was the unlocking that
made kind of the connected speaker

4098
01:21:37,870 --> 01:21:37,880
made kind of the connected speaker
 

4099
01:21:37,880 --> 01:21:42,050
made kind of the connected speaker
happen in the home so so it really it

4100
01:21:42,050 --> 01:21:42,060
happen in the home so so it really it
 

4101
01:21:42,060 --> 01:21:44,300
happen in the home so so it really it
really exploded and we saw this

4102
01:21:44,300 --> 01:21:44,310
really exploded and we saw this
 

4103
01:21:44,310 --> 01:21:46,340
really exploded and we saw this
engagement that we predicted would

4104
01:21:46,340 --> 01:21:46,350
engagement that we predicted would
 

4105
01:21:46,350 --> 01:21:47,840
engagement that we predicted would
happen what I think is interesting

4106
01:21:47,840 --> 01:21:47,850
happen what I think is interesting
 

4107
01:21:47,850 --> 01:21:49,610
happen what I think is interesting
though is where it's going from now

4108
01:21:49,610 --> 01:21:49,620
though is where it's going from now
 

4109
01:21:49,620 --> 01:21:51,680
though is where it's going from now
right now you think of them as voice

4110
01:21:51,680 --> 01:21:51,690
right now you think of them as voice
 

4111
01:21:51,690 --> 01:21:54,380
right now you think of them as voice
speakers but I think if you look at

4112
01:21:54,380 --> 01:21:54,390
speakers but I think if you look at
 

4113
01:21:54,390 --> 01:21:57,320
speakers but I think if you look at
Google i/o for example they just added a

4114
01:21:57,320 --> 01:21:57,330
Google i/o for example they just added a
 

4115
01:21:57,330 --> 01:22:00,320
Google i/o for example they just added a
camera to it where you know when the

4116
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:00,330
camera to it where you know when the
 

4117
01:22:00,330 --> 01:22:02,959
camera to it where you know when the
alarm goes off instead of saying hey

4118
01:22:02,959 --> 01:22:02,969
alarm goes off instead of saying hey
 

4119
01:22:02,969 --> 01:22:05,870
alarm goes off instead of saying hey
Google stop you can just wave your hand

4120
01:22:05,870 --> 01:22:05,880
Google stop you can just wave your hand
 

4121
01:22:05,880 --> 01:22:08,120
Google stop you can just wave your hand
so I think they're gonna think more of

4122
01:22:08,120 --> 01:22:08,130
so I think they're gonna think more of
 

4123
01:22:08,130 --> 01:22:12,350
so I think they're gonna think more of
it as a as an agent or as an assistant

4124
01:22:12,350 --> 01:22:12,360
it as a as an agent or as an assistant
 

4125
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:14,360
it as a as an agent or as an assistant
truly an assistant and an assistant that

4126
01:22:14,360 --> 01:22:14,370
truly an assistant and an assistant that
 

4127
01:22:14,370 --> 01:22:16,100
truly an assistant and an assistant that
can see you it's gonna be much more

4128
01:22:16,100 --> 01:22:16,110
can see you it's gonna be much more
 

4129
01:22:16,110 --> 01:22:18,560
can see you it's gonna be much more
effective than then a blind assistant so

4130
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:18,570
effective than then a blind assistant so
 

4131
01:22:18,570 --> 01:22:20,149
effective than then a blind assistant so
I think these things will morph and we

4132
01:22:20,149 --> 01:22:20,159
I think these things will morph and we
 

4133
01:22:20,159 --> 01:22:21,229
I think these things will morph and we
won't necessarily think of them as

4134
01:22:21,229 --> 01:22:21,239
won't necessarily think of them as
 

4135
01:22:21,239 --> 01:22:23,479
won't necessarily think of them as
quote-unquote voice speakers anymore

4136
01:22:23,479 --> 01:22:23,489
quote-unquote voice speakers anymore
 

4137
01:22:23,489 --> 01:22:28,130
quote-unquote voice speakers anymore
just as interactive access to the

4138
01:22:28,130 --> 01:22:28,140
just as interactive access to the
 

4139
01:22:28,140 --> 01:22:30,890
just as interactive access to the
Internet in the home but I still think

4140
01:22:30,890 --> 01:22:30,900
Internet in the home but I still think
 

4141
01:22:30,900 --> 01:22:33,439
Internet in the home but I still think
that the biggest use case for those will

4142
01:22:33,439 --> 01:22:33,449
that the biggest use case for those will
 

4143
01:22:33,449 --> 01:22:36,140
that the biggest use case for those will
be will be audio so for that reason

4144
01:22:36,140 --> 01:22:36,150
be will be audio so for that reason
 

4145
01:22:36,150 --> 01:22:38,120
be will be audio so for that reason
we're investing heavily in it and we've

4146
01:22:38,120 --> 01:22:38,130
we're investing heavily in it and we've
 

4147
01:22:38,130 --> 01:22:41,450
we're investing heavily in it and we've
built our own NLU stack to be able to

4148
01:22:41,450 --> 01:22:41,460
built our own NLU stack to be able to
 

4149
01:22:41,460 --> 01:22:44,180
built our own NLU stack to be able to
the the challenge here is how do you

4150
01:22:44,180 --> 01:22:44,190
the the challenge here is how do you
 

4151
01:22:44,190 --> 01:22:46,250
the the challenge here is how do you
innovate in that well it's it's it

4152
01:22:46,250 --> 01:22:46,260
innovate in that well it's it's it
 

4153
01:22:46,260 --> 01:22:47,689
innovate in that well it's it's it
lowers friction for consumers but it's

4154
01:22:47,689 --> 01:22:47,699
lowers friction for consumers but it's
 

4155
01:22:47,699 --> 01:22:49,520
lowers friction for consumers but it's
also much more constrained there you

4156
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:49,530
also much more constrained there you
 

4157
01:22:49,530 --> 01:22:51,770
also much more constrained there you
have no pixels to play with in an in an

4158
01:22:51,770 --> 01:22:51,780
have no pixels to play with in an in an
 

4159
01:22:51,780 --> 01:22:53,390
have no pixels to play with in an in an
audio-only world it's really the

4160
01:22:53,390 --> 01:22:53,400
audio-only world it's really the
 

4161
01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:56,570
audio-only world it's really the
vocabulary that is the interface so we

4162
01:22:56,570 --> 01:22:56,580
vocabulary that is the interface so we
 

4163
01:22:56,580 --> 01:22:58,070
vocabulary that is the interface so we
started investing and playing around

4164
01:22:58,070 --> 01:22:58,080
started investing and playing around
 

4165
01:22:58,080 --> 01:22:59,360
started investing and playing around
quite a lot with that trying to

4166
01:22:59,360 --> 01:22:59,370
quite a lot with that trying to
 

4167
01:22:59,370 --> 01:23:01,070
quite a lot with that trying to
understand what the future will be of

4168
01:23:01,070 --> 01:23:01,080
understand what the future will be of
 

4169
01:23:01,080 --> 01:23:03,709
understand what the future will be of
you speaking and gesturing and waving at

4170
01:23:03,709 --> 01:23:03,719
you speaking and gesturing and waving at
 

4171
01:23:03,719 --> 01:23:06,350
you speaking and gesturing and waving at
your music and actually you're actually

4172
01:23:06,350 --> 01:23:06,360
your music and actually you're actually
 

4173
01:23:06,360 --> 01:23:08,330
your music and actually you're actually
nudging closer to the autonomous vehicle

4174
01:23:08,330 --> 01:23:08,340
nudging closer to the autonomous vehicle
 

4175
01:23:08,340 --> 01:23:10,270
nudging closer to the autonomous vehicle

4178
01:23:12,680 --> 01:23:12,690
the level of frustration people

4180
01:23:15,290 --> 01:23:15,300
experience upon failure of natural
 

4181
01:23:15,300 --> 01:23:17,090
experience upon failure of natural
language understanding is much higher

4182
01:23:17,090 --> 01:23:17,100
language understanding is much higher
 

4183
01:23:17,100 --> 01:23:20,000
language understanding is much higher
than failure in other content people get

4184
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:20,010
than failure in other content people get
 

4185
01:23:20,010 --> 01:23:22,520
than failure in other content people get
frustrated really fast so if you screw

4186
01:23:22,520 --> 01:23:22,530
frustrated really fast so if you screw
 

4187
01:23:22,530 --> 01:23:25,070
frustrated really fast so if you screw
screw that experience up even just a

4188
01:23:25,070 --> 01:23:25,080
screw that experience up even just a
 

4189
01:23:25,080 --> 01:23:26,479
screw that experience up even just a
little bit they give up really quickly

4190
01:23:26,479 --> 01:23:26,489
little bit they give up really quickly
 

4191
01:23:26,489 --> 01:23:29,000
little bit they give up really quickly
yeah and I think you see that in the

4192
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:29,010
yeah and I think you see that in the
 

4193
01:23:29,010 --> 01:23:31,129
yeah and I think you see that in the
data while well it's tremendously

01:23:31,129 --> 01:23:31,139
data while well it's tremendously
 

4195
01:23:31,139 --> 01:23:31,850

and you know next the things were if you
 

4203
01:23:38,489 --> 01:23:39,770
and you know next the things were if you
compare it to taking up your phone

4204
01:23:39,770 --> 01:23:39,780
compare it to taking up your phone
 

4205
01:23:39,780 --> 01:23:41,300
compare it to taking up your phone
unlocking you bringing up the app and

4206
01:23:41,300 --> 01:23:41,310
unlocking you bringing up the app and
 

4207
01:23:41,310 --> 01:23:43,850
unlocking you bringing up the app and
skipping clicking skip yeah it was it

4208
01:23:43,850 --> 01:23:43,860
skipping clicking skip yeah it was it
 

4209
01:23:43,860 --> 01:23:47,870
skipping clicking skip yeah it was it
was much lower friction but then for for

4210
01:23:47,870 --> 01:23:47,880
was much lower friction but then for for
 

4211
01:23:47,880 --> 01:23:49,490
was much lower friction but then for for
longer more complicated things like you

4212
01:23:49,490 --> 01:23:49,500
longer more complicated things like you
 

4213
01:23:49,500 --> 01:23:51,020
longer more complicated things like you
if I mean that song about people

4214
01:23:51,020 --> 01:23:51,030
if I mean that song about people
 

4215
01:23:51,030 --> 01:23:52,250
if I mean that song about people
stopping up the phone and search and

4216
01:23:52,250 --> 01:23:52,260
stopping up the phone and search and
 

4217
01:23:52,260 --> 01:23:53,810
stopping up the phone and search and
then play it on their speaker so we

4218
01:23:53,810 --> 01:23:53,820
then play it on their speaker so we
 

4219
01:23:53,820 --> 01:23:55,669
then play it on their speaker so we
tried again to build a fault-tolerant UI

4220
01:23:55,669 --> 01:23:55,679
tried again to build a fault-tolerant UI
 

4221
01:23:55,679 --> 01:23:57,530
tried again to build a fault-tolerant UI
where for the more for the more

4222
01:23:57,530 --> 01:23:57,540
where for the more for the more
 

4223
01:23:57,540 --> 01:23:59,300
where for the more for the more
complicated things you can still pick up

4224
01:23:59,300 --> 01:23:59,310
complicated things you can still pick up
 

4225
01:23:59,310 --> 01:24:01,550
complicated things you can still pick up
your phone have powerful full keyboard

4226
01:24:01,550 --> 01:24:01,560
your phone have powerful full keyboard
 

4227
01:24:01,560 --> 01:24:04,189
your phone have powerful full keyboard
search and then try to optimize for

4228
01:24:04,189 --> 01:24:04,199
search and then try to optimize for
 

4229
01:24:04,199 --> 01:24:06,200
search and then try to optimize for
whether it's actually lower friction and

4230
01:24:06,200 --> 01:24:06,210
whether it's actually lower friction and
 

4231
01:24:06,210 --> 01:24:08,479
whether it's actually lower friction and
try to it's it's kind of like the test

4232
01:24:08,479 --> 01:24:08,489
try to it's it's kind of like the test
 

4233
01:24:08,489 --> 01:24:10,490
try to it's it's kind of like the test
autopilot thing you have to be at the

4234
01:24:10,490 --> 01:24:10,500
autopilot thing you have to be at the
 

4235
01:24:10,500 --> 01:24:13,370
autopilot thing you have to be at the
level where you're helpful if you're too

4236
01:24:13,370 --> 01:24:13,380
level where you're helpful if you're too
 

4237
01:24:13,380 --> 01:24:14,990
level where you're helpful if you're too
smart and just in the way people are

4238
01:24:14,990 --> 01:24:15,000
smart and just in the way people are
 

4239
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,720
smart and just in the way people are
gonna get frustrated and first of all

4240
01:24:17,720 --> 01:24:17,730
gonna get frustrated and first of all
 

4241
01:24:17,730 --> 01:24:19,280
gonna get frustrated and first of all
I'm not obsessed with stairway to heaven

4242
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:19,290
I'm not obsessed with stairway to heaven
 

4243
01:24:19,290 --> 01:24:20,930
I'm not obsessed with stairway to heaven
it's just a good song but let me mention

4244
01:24:20,930 --> 01:24:20,940
it's just a good song but let me mention
 

4245
01:24:20,940 --> 01:24:23,330
it's just a good song but let me mention
that as a use case because it's an

4246
01:24:23,330 --> 01:24:23,340
that as a use case because it's an
 

4247
01:24:23,340 --> 01:24:26,240
that as a use case because it's an
interesting one I've literally told one

4248
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:26,250
interesting one I've literally told one
 

4249
01:24:26,250 --> 01:24:27,590
interesting one I've literally told one
of I don't want to say the name of the

4250
01:24:27,590 --> 01:24:27,600
of I don't want to say the name of the
 

4251
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:29,330
of I don't want to say the name of the
speaker cuz though when people are

4252
01:24:29,330 --> 01:24:29,340
speaker cuz though when people are
 

4253
01:24:29,340 --> 01:24:31,130
speaker cuz though when people are
listening to it'll make their speaker go

4254
01:24:31,130 --> 01:24:31,140
listening to it'll make their speaker go
 

4255
01:24:31,140 --> 01:24:33,439
listening to it'll make their speaker go
off but I talk to the speaker and I say

4256
01:24:33,439 --> 01:24:33,449
off but I talk to the speaker and I say
 

4257
01:24:33,449 --> 01:24:36,939
off but I talk to the speaker and I say
play stairway to heaven and every time

4258
01:24:36,939 --> 01:24:36,949
play stairway to heaven and every time
 

4259
01:24:36,949 --> 01:24:39,680
play stairway to heaven and every time
it like not every time but a large

4260
01:24:39,680 --> 01:24:39,690
it like not every time but a large
 

4261
01:24:39,690 --> 01:24:41,120
it like not every time but a large
percent of the time plays the wrong

4262
01:24:41,120 --> 01:24:41,130
percent of the time plays the wrong
 

4263
01:24:41,130 --> 01:24:43,280
percent of the time plays the wrong
stairway to heaven it plays like some

4264
01:24:43,280 --> 01:24:43,290
stairway to heaven it plays like some
 

4265
01:24:43,290 --> 01:24:47,870
stairway to heaven it plays like some
cover of the and that that part of the

4266
01:24:47,870 --> 01:24:47,880
cover of the and that that part of the
 

4267
01:24:47,880 --> 01:24:50,030
cover of the and that that part of the
experience I actually wonder from a

4268
01:24:50,030 --> 01:24:50,040
experience I actually wonder from a
 

4269
01:24:50,040 --> 01:24:52,479
experience I actually wonder from a
business perspective the Spotify control

4270
01:24:52,479 --> 01:24:52,489
business perspective the Spotify control
 

4271
01:24:52,489 --> 01:24:56,780
business perspective the Spotify control
that entire experience or no it seems

4272
01:24:56,780 --> 01:24:56,790
that entire experience or no it seems
 

4273
01:24:56,790 --> 01:24:59,419
that entire experience or no it seems
like the NLU the the natural language

4274
01:24:59,419 --> 01:24:59,429
like the NLU the the natural language
 

4275
01:24:59,429 --> 01:25:01,370
like the NLU the the natural language
stuff is controlled by the speaker and

4276
01:25:01,370 --> 01:25:01,380
stuff is controlled by the speaker and
 

4277
01:25:01,380 --> 01:25:04,400
stuff is controlled by the speaker and
then Spotify stays at a layer below that

4278
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:04,410
then Spotify stays at a layer below that
 

4279
01:25:04,410 --> 01:25:07,130
then Spotify stays at a layer below that
it is a good and complicated question

4280
01:25:07,130 --> 01:25:07,140
it is a good and complicated question
 

4281
01:25:07,140 --> 01:25:11,450
it is a good and complicated question
some of which is dependent on the on the

4282
01:25:11,450 --> 01:25:11,460
some of which is dependent on the on the
 

4283
01:25:11,460 --> 01:25:12,890
some of which is dependent on the on the
partner so it's hard to comment on the

4284
01:25:12,890 --> 01:25:12,900
partner so it's hard to comment on the
 

4285
01:25:12,900 --> 01:25:15,800
partner so it's hard to comment on the
own specifics but the question is the

4286
01:25:15,800 --> 01:25:15,810
own specifics but the question is the
 

4287
01:25:15,810 --> 01:25:19,010
own specifics but the question is the
right one the challenges if you can't

4288
01:25:19,010 --> 01:25:19,020
right one the challenges if you can't
 

4289
01:25:19,020 --> 01:25:20,959
right one the challenges if you can't
use any other personalization I mean we

4290
01:25:20,959 --> 01:25:20,969
use any other personalization I mean we
 

4291
01:25:20,969 --> 01:25:22,820
use any other personalization I mean we
know which stairway to heaven and and

4292
01:25:22,820 --> 01:25:22,830
know which stairway to heaven and and
 

4293
01:25:22,830 --> 01:25:25,310
know which stairway to heaven and and
the truth is maybe for for one person it

4294
01:25:25,310 --> 01:25:25,320
the truth is maybe for for one person it
 

4295
01:25:25,320 --> 01:25:27,260
the truth is maybe for for one person it
is exactly the cover that they want and

4296
01:25:27,260 --> 01:25:27,270
is exactly the cover that they want and
 

4297
01:25:27,270 --> 01:25:29,090
is exactly the cover that they want and
they will be very frustrated if a place

4298
01:25:29,090 --> 01:25:29,100
they will be very frustrated if a place
 

4299
01:25:29,100 --> 01:25:31,939
they will be very frustrated if a place
I I think we I think we default to the

4300
01:25:31,939 --> 01:25:31,949
I I think we I think we default to the
 

4301
01:25:31,949 --> 01:25:33,560
I I think we I think we default to the
right version but but you actually want

4302
01:25:33,560 --> 01:25:33,570
right version but but you actually want
 

4303
01:25:33,570 --> 01:25:34,880
right version but but you actually want
to be able to do the cover for the

4304
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:34,890
to be able to do the cover for the
 

4305
01:25:34,890 --> 01:25:36,620
to be able to do the cover for the
person that just played the cover 50

4306
01:25:36,620 --> 01:25:36,630
person that just played the cover 50
 

4307
01:25:36,630 --> 01:25:38,810
person that just played the cover 50
times or Spotify is just gonna seem

4308
01:25:38,810 --> 01:25:38,820
times or Spotify is just gonna seem
 

4309
01:25:38,820 --> 01:25:40,280
times or Spotify is just gonna seem
stupid so you want to be able to

4310
01:25:40,280 --> 01:25:40,290
stupid so you want to be able to
 

4311
01:25:40,290 --> 01:25:41,510
stupid so you want to be able to
leverage the personalization but you

4312
01:25:41,510 --> 01:25:41,520
leverage the personalization but you
 

4313
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:44,680
leverage the personalization but you
have this stack where where you have the

4314
01:25:44,680 --> 01:25:44,690
have this stack where where you have the
 

4315
01:25:44,690 --> 01:25:47,270
have this stack where where you have the
the ASR and this thing called the N best

4316
01:25:47,270 --> 01:25:47,280
the ASR and this thing called the N best
 

4317
01:25:47,280 --> 01:25:48,560
the ASR and this thing called the N best
list so then that guesses

4318
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:48,570
list so then that guesses
 

4319
01:25:48,570 --> 01:25:50,750
list so then that guesses
here and then the presentation comes in

4320
01:25:50,750 --> 01:25:50,760
here and then the presentation comes in
 

4321
01:25:50,760 --> 01:25:52,160
here and then the presentation comes in
at the end you actually want the

4322
01:25:52,160 --> 01:25:52,170
at the end you actually want the
 

4323
01:25:52,170 --> 01:25:53,390
at the end you actually want the
personalization to be here when you're

4324
01:25:53,390 --> 01:25:53,400
personalization to be here when you're
 

4325
01:25:53,400 --> 01:25:54,590
personalization to be here when you're
guessing about what they actually meant

4326
01:25:54,590 --> 01:25:54,600
guessing about what they actually meant
 

4327
01:25:54,600 --> 01:25:57,920
guessing about what they actually meant
so we're working with these partners and

4328
01:25:57,920 --> 01:25:57,930
so we're working with these partners and
 

4329
01:25:57,930 --> 01:26:00,950
so we're working with these partners and
it's a complicated it's a complicated

4330
01:26:00,950 --> 01:26:00,960
it's a complicated it's a complicated
 

4331
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:03,590
it's a complicated it's a complicated
thing where you want to you want to be

4332
01:26:03,590 --> 01:26:03,600
thing where you want to you want to be
 

4333
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:05,390
thing where you want to you want to be
able so first of all you want to be very

4334
01:26:05,390 --> 01:26:05,400
able so first of all you want to be very
 

4335
01:26:05,400 --> 01:26:06,920
able so first of all you want to be very
careful with you users data

4336
01:26:06,920 --> 01:26:06,930
careful with you users data
 

4337
01:26:06,930 --> 01:26:08,300
careful with you users data
you don't share your users data without

4338
01:26:08,300 --> 01:26:08,310
you don't share your users data without
 

4339
01:26:08,310 --> 01:26:10,040
you don't share your users data without
the permission but you want to share

4340
01:26:10,040 --> 01:26:10,050
the permission but you want to share
 

4341
01:26:10,050 --> 01:26:11,390
the permission but you want to share
some data so that their experience gets

4342
01:26:11,390 --> 01:26:11,400
some data so that their experience gets
 

4343
01:26:11,400 --> 01:26:12,260
some data so that their experience gets
better

4344
01:26:12,260 --> 01:26:12,270
better
 

4345
01:26:12,270 --> 01:26:14,060
better
so that these partners can understand

4346
01:26:14,060 --> 01:26:14,070
so that these partners can understand
 

4347
01:26:14,070 --> 01:26:16,900
so that these partners can understand
enough but not too much and so forth so

4348
01:26:16,900 --> 01:26:16,910
enough but not too much and so forth so
 

4349
01:26:16,910 --> 01:26:19,610
enough but not too much and so forth so
it's really the trick is that it's like

4350
01:26:19,610 --> 01:26:19,620
it's really the trick is that it's like
 

4351
01:26:19,620 --> 01:26:21,770
it's really the trick is that it's like
a business driven relationship where

4352
01:26:21,770 --> 01:26:21,780
a business driven relationship where
 

4353
01:26:21,780 --> 01:26:23,090
a business driven relationship where
you're doing product development across

4354
01:26:23,090 --> 01:26:23,100
you're doing product development across
 

4355
01:26:23,100 --> 01:26:25,580
you're doing product development across
companies together yeah which is which

4356
01:26:25,580 --> 01:26:25,590
companies together yeah which is which
 

4357

01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:27,930
is really complicated but this is
 

4359
01:26:27,930 --> 01:26:31,010
is really complicated but this is
exactly why we built our own NLU so that

4360
01:26:31,010 --> 01:26:31,020
exactly why we built our own NLU so that
 

4361
01:26:31,020 --> 01:26:32,990
exactly why we built our own NLU so that
we actually can make personalized

4362
01:26:32,990 --> 01:26:33,000
we actually can make personalized
 

4363
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:34,490
we actually can make personalized
guesses because this is the biggest

4364
01:26:34,490 --> 01:26:34,500
guesses because this is the biggest
 

4365
01:26:34,500 --> 01:26:36,380
guesses because this is the biggest
frustration from a user point of view

4366
01:26:36,380 --> 01:26:36,390
frustration from a user point of view
 

4367
01:26:36,390 --> 01:26:38,300
frustration from a user point of view
they don't understand about ASRs and n

4368
01:26:38,300 --> 01:26:38,310
they don't understand about ASRs and n

4372
01:26:41,450 --> 01:26:41,460
they're like how hard can it be
 

4373
01:26:41,460 --> 01:26:43,700
they're like how hard can it be
I've told this thing 50 times in this

4374
01:26:43,700 --> 01:26:43,710
I've told this thing 50 times in this
 

4375
01:26:43,710 --> 01:26:44,900
I've told this thing 50 times in this
version and still applies the wrong

4376
01:26:44,900 --> 01:26:44,910
version and still applies the wrong
 

4377
01:26:44,910 --> 01:26:47,570
version and still applies the wrong
thing it can't it can't be hard so we

4378
01:26:47,570 --> 01:26:47,580
thing it can't it can't be hard so we
 

4379
01:26:47,580 --> 01:26:48,950
thing it can't it can't be hard so we
try to take the user approach if the

4380
01:26:48,950 --> 01:26:48,960
try to take the user approach if the
 

4381
01:26:48,960 --> 01:26:51,200
try to take the user approach if the
user the users not going to understand

4382
01:26:51,200 --> 01:26:51,210
user the users not going to understand

the complications of business we have to
 

4385
01:26:53,430 --> 01:26:55,940

solve it let's talk about sort of a

4386
01:26:55,940 --> 01:26:55,950
solve it let's talk about sort of a
 

4387
01:26:55,950 --> 01:27:00,440
solve it let's talk about sort of a
complicated subject that I myself I'm

4388
01:27:00,440 --> 01:27:00,450
complicated subject that I myself I'm
 

4389
01:27:00,450 --> 01:27:06,070
complicated subject that I myself I'm
quite torn about the idea of sort of

4390
01:27:06,070 --> 01:27:06,080

 

4391
01:27:06,080 --> 01:27:11,090

paying artists right I saw as of August

4392
01:27:11,090 --> 01:27:11,100
paying artists right I saw as of August
 

4393
01:27:11,100 --> 01:27:15,650
paying artists right I saw as of August
31st 2018 over 11 billion dollars were

4394
01:27:15,650 --> 01:27:15,660
31st 2018 over 11 billion dollars were
 

4395
01:27:15,660 --> 01:27:19,070
31st 2018 over 11 billion dollars were
paid to rights holders so and further

4396
01:27:19,070 --> 01:27:19,080
paid to rights holders so and further
 

4397
01:27:19,080 --> 01:27:21,560
paid to rights holders so and further
distributed to artists from Spotify so a

4398
01:27:21,560 --> 01:27:21,570
distributed to artists from Spotify so a
 

4399
01:27:21,570 --> 01:27:23,960
distributed to artists from Spotify so a
lot of money is being paid to artists

4400
01:27:23,960 --> 01:27:23,970
lot of money is being paid to artists
 

4401

lot of money is being paid to artists
first of all the whole time is a

4402
01:27:26,420 --> 01:27:26,430
first of all the whole time is a
 

4403
01:27:26,430 --> 01:27:28,810
first of all the whole time is a
consumer for me when I look at Spotify

4404
01:27:28,810 --> 01:27:28,820
consumer for me when I look at Spotify
 

4405
01:27:28,820 --> 01:27:31,730
consumer for me when I look at Spotify
I'm not sure I'm remembering correctly

4406
01:27:31,730 --> 01:27:31,740
I'm not sure I'm remembering correctly
 

4407
01:27:31,740 --> 01:27:33,770
I'm not sure I'm remembering correctly
but I think you said exactly how I feel

4408
01:27:33,770 --> 01:27:33,780
but I think you said exactly how I feel
 

4409
01:27:33,780 --> 01:27:35,570
but I think you said exactly how I feel
which is this is too good to be true

4410
01:27:35,570 --> 01:27:35,580
which is this is too good to be true
 

4411
01:27:35,580 --> 01:27:39,770
which is this is too good to be true
like when I started using Spotify I

4412
01:27:39,770 --> 01:27:39,780
like when I started using Spotify I
 

4413
01:27:39,780 --> 01:27:42,080
like when I started using Spotify I
assume you guys will go bankrupt in like

4414
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:42,090
assume you guys will go bankrupt in like
 

4415
01:27:42,090 --> 01:27:44,720
assume you guys will go bankrupt in like
a month it's like this is too good a lot

4416
01:27:44,720 --> 01:27:44,730
a month it's like this is too good a lot
 

4417
01:27:44,730 --> 01:27:49,780
a month it's like this is too good a lot
of people did like this is amazing so

4418
01:27:49,780 --> 01:27:49,790
of people did like this is amazing so
 

4419
01:27:49,790 --> 01:27:53,000
of people did like this is amazing so
one question I have is sort of the

4420
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:53,010
one question I have is sort of the
 

4421
01:27:53,010 --> 01:27:54,620
one question I have is sort of the
bigger question how do you make money in

4422
01:27:54,620 --> 01:27:54,630
bigger question how do you make money in

01:27:57,110 --> 01:27:57,120
this complicated world how do you deal
 

4425
01:27:57,120 --> 01:27:59,900
this complicated world how do you deal
with a relationship with record labels

4426
01:27:59,900 --> 01:27:59,910
with a relationship with record labels
 

4427
01:27:59,910 --> 01:28:01,530
with a relationship with record labels
who

4428
01:28:01,530 --> 01:28:01,540
who
 

4429
01:28:01,540 --> 01:28:07,380
who
are complicated these big you're

4430
01:28:07,380 --> 01:28:07,390
are complicated these big you're
 

4431
01:28:07,390 --> 01:28:10,580

essentially and have the task of herding

4432
01:28:10,580 --> 01:28:10,590
essentially and have the task of herding
 

4433
01:28:10,590 --> 01:28:11,850
essentially and have the task of herding
cats

4434
01:28:11,850 --> 01:28:11,860
cats
 

4435
01:28:11,860 --> 01:28:17,010
cats
but like rich and powerful cats and also

4436
01:28:17,010 --> 01:28:17,020
but like rich and powerful cats and also
 

4437
01:28:17,020 --> 01:28:19,290
but like rich and powerful cats and also
have the task of paying artists enough

4438
01:28:19,290 --> 01:28:19,300
have the task of paying artists enough
 

4439
01:28:19,300 --> 01:28:22,170
have the task of paying artists enough
and paying those labels enough and still

4440
01:28:22,170 --> 01:28:22,180
and paying those labels enough and still

of dollars a month so how do you

4446
01:28:29,370 --> 01:28:29,380
of dollars a month so how do you
 

4447
01:28:29,380 --> 01:28:31,290
of dollars a month so how do you
navigate the space how do you know

4448
01:28:31,290 --> 01:28:31,300
navigate the space how do you know
 

4449

that's a beautiful description hurting

4450
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:33,010
that's a beautiful description hurting
 

4451
01:28:33,010 --> 01:28:37,800
that's a beautiful description hurting
rich cats yeah that's before it is very

4452
01:28:37,800 --> 01:28:37,810
rich cats yeah that's before it is very
 

4453
01:28:37,810 --> 01:28:40,610
rich cats yeah that's before it is very
complicated and I think certainly

4454
01:28:40,610 --> 01:28:40,620
complicated and I think certainly
 

4455
01:28:40,620 --> 01:28:42,780
complicated and I think certainly
actually betting against Porter fire has

4456
01:28:42,780 --> 01:28:42,790
actually betting against Porter fire has
 

4457
01:28:42,790 --> 01:28:44,700
actually betting against Porter fire has
been statistically a very smart thing to

4458
01:28:44,700 --> 01:28:44,710
been statistically a very smart thing to
 

4459
01:28:44,710 --> 01:28:47,490
been statistically a very smart thing to
do just looking at the at the line of

4460
01:28:47,490 --> 01:28:47,500
do just looking at the at the line of
 

4461
01:28:47,500 --> 01:28:50,720
do just looking at the at the line of
roadkill in music streaming services

4462
01:28:50,720 --> 01:28:50,730
roadkill in music streaming services
 

4463
01:28:50,730 --> 01:28:53,820
roadkill in music streaming services
it's it's kind of I think if I had

4464
01:28:53,820 --> 01:28:53,830
it's it's kind of I think if I had
 

4465
01:28:53,830 --> 01:28:56,490
it's it's kind of I think if I had
understood the complexity when I joined

4466
01:28:56,490 --> 01:28:56,500
understood the complexity when I joined
 

4467
01:28:56,500 --> 01:28:58,770
understood the complexity when I joined
Spotify unfortunately fortunately I

4468
01:28:58,770 --> 01:28:58,780
Spotify unfortunately fortunately I
 

4469
01:28:58,780 --> 01:29:01,770
Spotify unfortunately fortunately I
didn't know enough about the music

4470
01:29:01,770 --> 01:29:01,780
didn't know enough about the music
 

4471
01:29:01,780 --> 01:29:03,090
didn't know enough about the music
industry to understand the complexities

4472
01:29:03,090 --> 01:29:03,100
industry to understand the complexities
 

4473
01:29:03,100 --> 01:29:04,350
industry to understand the complexities
because then I would have made a more

4474
01:29:04,350 --> 01:29:04,360
because then I would have made a more
 

4475
01:29:04,360 --> 01:29:06,510
because then I would have made a more
rational guess that it wouldn't work so

4476
01:29:06,510 --> 01:29:06,520
rational guess that it wouldn't work so
 

4477
01:29:06,520 --> 01:29:10,460
rational guess that it wouldn't work so
you know ignorant is bliss but I think

4478
01:29:10,460 --> 01:29:10,470
you know ignorant is bliss but I think
 

4479
01:29:10,470 --> 01:29:13,110
you know ignorant is bliss but I think
there have been a few distinct

4480
01:29:13,110 --> 01:29:13,120
there have been a few distinct
 

4481
01:29:13,120 --> 01:29:15,570
there have been a few distinct
challenges I think as I said one of the

4482
01:29:15,570 --> 01:29:15,580
challenges I think as I said one of the
 

4483
01:29:15,580 --> 01:29:17,390
challenges I think as I said one of the
things that made it work at all was that

4484
01:29:17,390 --> 01:29:17,400
things that made it work at all was that
 

4485
01:29:17,400 --> 01:29:20,010
things that made it work at all was that
Sweden and the Nordic was a lost market

4486
01:29:20,010 --> 01:29:20,020
Sweden and the Nordic was a lost market
 

4487
01:29:20,020 --> 01:29:23,070
Sweden and the Nordic was a lost market
so there was you know there was there

4488
01:29:23,070 --> 01:29:23,080
so there was you know there was there
 

4489
01:29:23,080 --> 01:29:25,280
so there was you know there was there
was no risk for labels to try this I

4490
01:29:25,280 --> 01:29:25,290
was no risk for labels to try this I
 

4491
01:29:25,290 --> 01:29:27,600
was no risk for labels to try this I
don't think it would have worked if if

4492
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:27,610
don't think it would have worked if if
 

4493
01:29:27,610 --> 01:29:32,130
don't think it would have worked if if
the market was was healthy so so that

4494
01:29:32,130 --> 01:29:32,140
the market was was healthy so so that
 

4495
01:29:32,140 --> 01:29:34,860
the market was was healthy so so that
was the initial condition then then we

4496
01:29:34,860 --> 01:29:34,870
was the initial condition then then we
 

4497
01:29:34,870 --> 01:29:36,270
was the initial condition then then we
had this tremendous challenge with the

4498
01:29:36,270 --> 01:29:36,280
had this tremendous challenge with the
 

4499
01:29:36,280 --> 01:29:39,630
had this tremendous challenge with the
model itself so now most people were

4500
01:29:39,630 --> 01:29:39,640
model itself so now most people were
 

4501
01:29:39,640 --> 01:29:41,580
model itself so now most people were
pirating but for the people who bought a

4502
01:29:41,580 --> 01:29:41,590
pirating but for the people who bought a
 

4503
01:29:41,590 --> 01:29:45,060
pirating but for the people who bought a
download or CD the artists will get all

4504
01:29:45,060 --> 01:29:45,070
download or CD the artists will get all
 

4505
01:29:45,070 --> 01:29:46,860
download or CD the artists will get all
the revenue for all the future plays

4506
01:29:46,860 --> 01:29:46,870
the revenue for all the future plays
 

4507
01:29:46,870 --> 01:29:49,740
the revenue for all the future plays
then right so you got it all up front

4508
01:29:49,740 --> 01:29:49,750
then right so you got it all up front
 

4509
01:29:49,750 --> 01:29:51,360
then right so you got it all up front
whereas the streaming model was like

4510
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:51,370
whereas the streaming model was like
 

4511
01:29:51,370 --> 01:29:52,920
whereas the streaming model was like
almost nothing they want almost nothing

4512
01:29:52,920 --> 01:29:52,930
almost nothing they want almost nothing
 

4513
01:29:52,930 --> 01:29:55,530
almost nothing they want almost nothing
they - and then at some point this curve

4514
01:29:55,530 --> 01:29:55,540
they - and then at some point this curve
 

4515
01:29:55,540 --> 01:29:58,410
they - and then at some point this curve
of incremental revenue would intersect

4516
01:29:58,410 --> 01:29:58,420
of incremental revenue would intersect
 

4517
01:29:58,420 --> 01:30:00,900
of incremental revenue would intersect
with your day one payment and that took

4518
01:30:00,900 --> 01:30:00,910
with your day one payment and that took
 

4519
01:30:00,910 --> 01:30:03,800
with your day one payment and that took
a long time to play out before before

4520
01:30:03,800 --> 01:30:03,810
a long time to play out before before
 

4521
01:30:03,810 --> 01:30:06,120
a long time to play out before before
the music labels they understood that

4522
01:30:06,120 --> 01:30:06,130
the music labels they understood that
 

4523
01:30:06,130 --> 01:30:08,130
the music labels they understood that
but on the other side it took a lot of

4524
01:30:08,130 --> 01:30:08,140
but on the other side it took a lot of
 

4525
01:30:08,140 --> 01:30:10,290
but on the other side it took a lot of
time to understand that actually if I

4526
01:30:10,290 --> 01:30:10,300
time to understand that actually if I
 

4527
01:30:10,300 --> 01:30:11,550
time to understand that actually if I
have a big hit that is gonna be played

4528
01:30:11,550 --> 01:30:11,560
have a big hit that is gonna be played
 

4529
01:30:11,560 --> 01:30:13,410
have a big hit that is gonna be played
for for many years this is a much better

4530
01:30:13,410 --> 01:30:13,420
for for many years this is a much better
 

4531
01:30:13,420 --> 01:30:14,140
for for many years this is a much better
model

4532
01:30:14,140 --> 01:30:14,150
model
 

4533
01:30:14,150 --> 01:30:16,000
model
because I get paid based on how much

4534
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:16,010
because I get paid based on how much
 

4535
01:30:16,010 --> 01:30:18,160
because I get paid based on how much
people use the product not how much they

4536
01:30:18,160 --> 01:30:18,170
people use the product not how much they
 

4537
01:30:18,170 --> 01:30:19,690
people use the product not how much they
thought they would use it day one or so

4538
01:30:19,690 --> 01:30:19,700
thought they would use it day one or so
 

4539
01:30:19,700 --> 01:30:22,900
thought they would use it day one or so
forth so it was a complicated model to

4540
01:30:22,900 --> 01:30:22,910
forth so it was a complicated model to
 

4541
01:30:22,910 --> 01:30:24,940
forth so it was a complicated model to
get across and but time helped with that

4542
01:30:24,940 --> 01:30:24,950
get across and but time helped with that
 

4543
01:30:24,950 --> 01:30:28,120
get across and but time helped with that
right and now now the revenues to the

4544
01:30:28,120 --> 01:30:28,130
right and now now the revenues to the
 

4545
01:30:28,130 --> 01:30:29,830
right and now now the revenues to the
music industry actually are bigger again

4546
01:30:29,830 --> 01:30:29,840
music industry actually are bigger again
 

4547
01:30:29,840 --> 01:30:31,780
music industry actually are bigger again
then you know it's gone through this

4548
01:30:31,780 --> 01:30:31,790
then you know it's gone through this
 

4549
01:30:31,790 --> 01:30:33,100
then you know it's gone through this
incredible dip and now they're back up

4550
01:30:33,100 --> 01:30:33,110
incredible dip and now they're back up
 

4551
01:30:33,110 --> 01:30:35,350
incredible dip and now they're back up
and so we're we're very really proud of

4552
01:30:35,350 --> 01:30:35,360
and so we're we're very really proud of
 

4553
01:30:35,360 --> 01:30:39,310
and so we're we're very really proud of
having having been a part of that so

4554
01:30:39,310 --> 01:30:39,320
having having been a part of that so
 

4555
01:30:39,320 --> 01:30:40,660
having having been a part of that so
there have been distinct problems I

4556
01:30:40,660 --> 01:30:40,670
there have been distinct problems I
 

4557
01:30:40,670 --> 01:30:44,460
there have been distinct problems I
think when it comes to the to the labels

4558
01:30:44,460 --> 01:30:44,470
think when it comes to the to the labels
 

4559
01:30:44,470 --> 01:30:48,100
think when it comes to the to the labels
we have taken the painful approach some

4560
01:30:48,100 --> 01:30:48,110
we have taken the painful approach some
 

4561
01:30:48,110 --> 01:30:49,990
we have taken the painful approach some
of our competition at the time they kind

4562
01:30:49,990 --> 01:30:50,000
of our competition at the time they kind
 

4563
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,690
of our competition at the time they kind
of they kind of look that other

4564
01:30:52,690 --> 01:30:52,700
of they kind of look that other
 

4565
01:30:52,700 --> 01:30:54,490
of they kind of look that other
companies instead if we just if we just

4566
01:30:54,490 --> 01:30:54,500
companies instead if we just if we just
 

4567
01:30:54,500 --> 01:30:56,650
companies instead if we just if we just
ignore the rights and we get really big

4568
01:30:56,650 --> 01:30:56,660
ignore the rights and we get really big
 

4569
01:30:56,660 --> 01:30:58,570
ignore the rights and we get really big
really fast we're gonna be too big for

4570
01:30:58,570 --> 01:30:58,580
really fast we're gonna be too big for
 

4571
01:30:58,580 --> 01:31:01,240
really fast we're gonna be too big for
the the labels too kind of too big to

4572
01:31:01,240 --> 01:31:01,250
the the labels too kind of too big to
 

4573
01:31:01,250 --> 01:31:03,430
the the labels too kind of too big to
fail they're not gonna kill us we didn't

4574
01:31:03,430 --> 01:31:03,440
fail they're not gonna kill us we didn't
 

4575
01:31:03,440 --> 01:31:04,810
fail they're not gonna kill us we didn't
take that approach we went legal from

4576
01:31:04,810 --> 01:31:04,820
take that approach we went legal from
 

4577
01:31:04,820 --> 01:31:07,810
take that approach we went legal from
day one and we we negotiated and

4578
01:31:07,810 --> 01:31:07,820
day one and we we negotiated and
 

4579
01:31:07,820 --> 01:31:09,490
day one and we we negotiated and
negotiated and negotiated was very slow

4580
01:31:09,490 --> 01:31:09,500
negotiated and negotiated was very slow
 

4581
01:31:09,500 --> 01:31:11,560
negotiated and negotiated was very slow
is very frustrating we were angry at

4582
01:31:11,560 --> 01:31:11,570
is very frustrating we were angry at
 

4583
01:31:11,570 --> 01:31:12,910
is very frustrating we were angry at
seeing other companies taking shortcuts

4584
01:31:12,910 --> 01:31:12,920
seeing other companies taking shortcuts
 

4585
01:31:12,920 --> 01:31:15,040
seeing other companies taking shortcuts
and seeming to get away with it it was

4586
01:31:15,040 --> 01:31:15,050
and seeming to get away with it it was
 

4587
01:31:15,050 --> 01:31:16,930
and seeming to get away with it it was
this this this game theory thing where

4588
01:31:16,930 --> 01:31:16,940
this this this game theory thing where
 

4589
01:31:16,940 --> 01:31:19,060
this this this game theory thing where
over many rounds of playing the game

4590
01:31:19,060 --> 01:31:19,070
over many rounds of playing the game
 

4591
01:31:19,070 --> 01:31:21,220
over many rounds of playing the game
this would be the right strategy and

4592
01:31:21,220 --> 01:31:21,230
this would be the right strategy and
 

4593
01:31:21,230 --> 01:31:23,470
this would be the right strategy and
even though to clearly there's a lot of

4594
01:31:23,470 --> 01:31:23,480
even though to clearly there's a lot of
 

4595
01:31:23,480 --> 01:31:26,020
even though to clearly there's a lot of
frustrations at times during

4596
01:31:26,020 --> 01:31:26,030
frustrations at times during
 

4597
01:31:26,030 --> 01:31:27,910
frustrations at times during
negotiations there is this there is this

4598
01:31:27,910 --> 01:31:27,920
negotiations there is this there is this
 

4599
01:31:27,920 --> 01:31:32,260
negotiations there is this there is this
weird trust where we have been honest

4600
01:31:32,260 --> 01:31:32,270
weird trust where we have been honest
 

4601
01:31:32,270 --> 01:31:34,960
weird trust where we have been honest
and fair we never screw them the inner

4602
01:31:34,960 --> 01:31:34,970
and fair we never screw them the inner
 

4603
01:31:34,970 --> 01:31:37,420
and fair we never screw them the inner
screwed us it's ten years but there's

4604
01:31:37,420 --> 01:31:37,430
screwed us it's ten years but there's
 

4605
01:31:37,430 --> 01:31:40,390
screwed us it's ten years but there's
this trust in like they know that if

4606
01:31:40,390 --> 01:31:40,400
this trust in like they know that if
 

4607
01:31:40,400 --> 01:31:42,940
this trust in like they know that if
music doesn't get really big if lots of

4608
01:31:42,940 --> 01:31:42,950
music doesn't get really big if lots of
 

4609
01:31:42,950 --> 01:31:44,500
music doesn't get really big if lots of
people do not want to listen to music I

4610
01:31:44,500 --> 01:31:44,510
people do not want to listen to music I
 

4611
01:31:44,510 --> 01:31:45,250
people do not want to listen to music I
want to pay for it

4612
01:31:45,250 --> 01:31:45,260
want to pay for it
 

4613
01:31:45,260 --> 01:31:47,290
want to pay for it
Spotify has no business model so we

4614
01:31:47,290 --> 01:31:47,300
Spotify has no business model so we
 

4615
01:31:47,300 --> 01:31:50,190
Spotify has no business model so we
actually are incredibly aligned right

4616
01:31:50,190 --> 01:31:50,200
actually are incredibly aligned right
 

4617
01:31:50,200 --> 01:31:52,390
actually are incredibly aligned right
other companies not to be tense but

4618
01:31:52,390 --> 01:31:52,400
other companies not to be tense but
 

4619
01:31:52,400 --> 01:31:53,560
other companies not to be tense but
other companies have other business

4620
01:31:53,560 --> 01:31:53,570
other companies have other business
 

4621
01:31:53,570 --> 01:31:55,180
other companies have other business
models where even if they may know music

4622
01:31:55,180 --> 01:31:55,190
models where even if they may know music
 

4623
01:31:55,190 --> 01:31:57,370
models where even if they may know music
from no money from music they still be

4624
01:31:57,370 --> 01:31:57,380
from no money from music they still be
 

4625
01:31:57,380 --> 01:31:59,230
from no money from music they still be
profitable companies but fall if I want

4626
01:31:59,230 --> 01:31:59,240
profitable companies but fall if I want
 

4627
01:31:59,240 --> 01:32:02,650
profitable companies but fall if I want
so and I think the industry sees that we

4628
01:32:02,650 --> 01:32:02,660
so and I think the industry sees that we
 

4629
01:32:02,660 --> 01:32:05,410
so and I think the industry sees that we
are actually aligned business-wise so

4630
01:32:05,410 --> 01:32:05,420
are actually aligned business-wise so
 

4631
01:32:05,420 --> 01:32:08,010
are actually aligned business-wise so
there is this distrust that allows us to

4632
01:32:08,010 --> 01:32:08,020
there is this distrust that allows us to
 

4633
01:32:08,020 --> 01:32:10,480
there is this distrust that allows us to
to do product development even if it's

4634
01:32:10,480 --> 01:32:10,490
to do product development even if it's
 

4635
01:32:10,490 --> 01:32:15,010
to do product development even if it's
scary you know taking risks the free

4636
01:32:15,010 --> 01:32:15,020
scary you know taking risks the free
 

4637
01:32:15,020 --> 01:32:17,350
scary you know taking risks the free
model itself was an incredible risk for

4638
01:32:17,350 --> 01:32:17,360
model itself was an incredible risk for
 

4639
01:32:17,360 --> 01:32:19,360
model itself was an incredible risk for
the music industry to take that they

4640
01:32:19,360 --> 01:32:19,370
the music industry to take that they
 

4641
01:32:19,370 --> 01:32:20,920
the music industry to take that they
should get credit for now some of it was

4642
01:32:20,920 --> 01:32:20,930
should get credit for now some of it was
 

4643
01:32:20,930 --> 01:32:22,300
should get credit for now some of it was
that they had nothing to lose in Sweden

4644
01:32:22,300 --> 01:32:22,310
that they had nothing to lose in Sweden
 

4645
01:32:22,310 --> 01:32:24,010
that they had nothing to lose in Sweden
but frankly a lot of the labels also

4646
01:32:24,010 --> 01:32:24,020
but frankly a lot of the labels also
 

4647
01:32:24,020 --> 01:32:26,770
but frankly a lot of the labels also
took risk and so I think we built up

4648
01:32:26,770 --> 01:32:26,780
took risk and so I think we built up
 

4649
01:32:26,780 --> 01:32:27,920
took risk and so I think we built up
that trust

4650
01:32:27,920 --> 01:32:27,930
that trust
 

4651
01:32:27,930 --> 01:32:31,070
that trust
with a I think hurting what cats sounds

4652
01:32:31,070 --> 01:32:31,080
with a I think hurting what cats sounds
 

4653
01:32:31,080 --> 01:32:34,250
with a I think hurting what cats sounds
a bit what's the word it sounds like I'm

4654
01:32:34,250 --> 01:32:34,260
a bit what's the word it sounds like I'm
 

4655
01:32:34,260 --> 01:32:36,140
a bit what's the word it sounds like I'm
dismissive of the guests dismissive no

4656
01:32:36,140 --> 01:32:36,150
dismissive of the guests dismissive no
 

4657
01:32:36,150 --> 01:32:37,430
dismissive of the guests dismissive no
everyday yeah you matter they're all

4658
01:32:37,430 --> 01:32:37,440
everyday yeah you matter they're all
 

4659
01:32:37,440 --> 01:32:39,890
everyday yeah you matter they're all
beautiful and and very important exactly

4660
01:32:39,890 --> 01:32:39,900
beautiful and and very important exactly
 

4661
01:32:39,900 --> 01:32:41,780
beautiful and and very important exactly
they've taken a lot of risks and

4662
01:32:41,780 --> 01:32:41,790
they've taken a lot of risks and
 

4663
01:32:41,790 --> 01:32:43,760
they've taken a lot of risks and
certainly it's been frustrating about it

4664
01:32:43,760 --> 01:32:43,770
certainly it's been frustrating about it
 

4665
01:32:43,770 --> 01:32:46,580
certainly it's been frustrating about it
yeah it's it's it's really like playing

4666
01:32:46,580 --> 01:32:46,590
yeah it's it's it's really like playing

its its game theory if you play that if
you play the game many times and then

4670
01:32:51,710 --> 01:32:51,720
you play the game many times and then
 

4671
01:32:51,720 --> 01:32:53,600
you play the game many times and then
you can have this statistical outcome

4672
01:32:53,600 --> 01:32:53,610
you can have this statistical outcome
 

4673
01:32:53,610 --> 01:32:55,220
you can have this statistical outcome
that you bet on and it feels very

4674

do the actual the actual Spotify model
 

4757
01:34:43,950 --> 01:34:45,290
do the actual the actual Spotify model
is very complicated they've looked at

01:34:45,290 --> 01:34:45,300
is very complicated they've looked at
 

4759
01:34:45,300 --> 01:34:47,540
is very complicated they've looked at
the premium model and said it seems like

4760
01:34:47,540 --> 01:34:47,550
the premium model and said it seems like
 

4761
01:34:47,550 --> 01:34:50,240
the premium model and said it seems like
you can you can charge $9.99 for music

you can you can charge $9.99 for music
 

4763

you can you can charge $9.99 for music
and people are gonna pay but that's not

what happened actually when we launched

the original mobile product everyone

4768
01:34:55,910 --> 01:34:55,920
the original mobile product everyone
 

4769
01:34:55,920 --> 01:34:58,310
the original mobile product everyone
said they would never pay what happened

4770
01:34:58,310 --> 01:34:58,320
said they would never pay what happened
 

4771
01:34:58,320 --> 01:34:59,600
said they would never pay what happened
was they started on the on the free

4772
01:34:59,600 --> 01:34:59,610
was they started on the on the free
 

4773
01:34:59,610 --> 01:35:02,120
was they started on the on the free
product and then their engagement grew

4774
01:35:02,120 --> 01:35:02,130
product and then their engagement grew
 

4775
01:35:02,130 --> 01:35:04,820
product and then their engagement grew
so much that eventually they said maybe

4776
01:35:04,820 --> 01:35:04,830
so much that eventually they said maybe
 

4777
01:35:04,830 --> 01:35:07,550
so much that eventually they said maybe
it is worth $9.99 right it's it's your

4778
01:35:07,550 --> 01:35:07,560
it is worth $9.99 right it's it's your
 

4779
01:35:07,560 --> 01:35:09,200
it is worth $9.99 right it's it's your
propensity to pay grows with your

4780
01:35:09,200 --> 01:35:09,210
propensity to pay grows with your
 

4781
01:35:09,210 --> 01:35:10,820
propensity to pay grows with your
engagement so we had this super

4782
01:35:10,820 --> 01:35:10,830
engagement so we had this super
 

4783
01:35:10,830 --> 01:35:13,310
engagement so we had this super
complicated business model we operate

4784
01:35:13,310 --> 01:35:13,320
complicated business model we operate
 

4785
01:35:13,320 --> 01:35:15,170
complicated business model we operate
two different business model advertising

4786
01:35:15,170 --> 01:35:15,180
two different business model advertising
 

4787
01:35:15,180 --> 01:35:17,300
two different business model advertising
and premium at the same time and I think

4788
01:35:17,300 --> 01:35:17,310
and premium at the same time and I think
 

4789
01:35:17,310 --> 01:35:19,190
and premium at the same time and I think
that is hard to replicate however I

4790
01:35:19,190 --> 01:35:19,200
that is hard to replicate however I
 

4791
01:35:19,200 --> 01:35:20,570
that is hard to replicate however I
struggled to think of other companies

4792
01:35:20,570 --> 01:35:20,580
struggled to think of other companies
 

4793
01:35:20,580 --> 01:35:23,030
struggled to think of other companies
that run large-scale advertising and

4794
01:35:23,030 --> 01:35:23,040
that run large-scale advertising and
 

4795
01:35:23,040 --> 01:35:24,610
that run large-scale advertising and
subscription products at the same time

4796
01:35:24,610 --> 01:35:24,620
subscription products at the same time
 

4797
01:35:24,620 --> 01:35:26,960
subscription products at the same time
so I think the business model is

4798
01:35:26,960 --> 01:35:26,970
so I think the business model is
 

4799
01:35:26,970 --> 01:35:28,580
so I think the business model is
actually much more complicated than

4800
01:35:28,580 --> 01:35:28,590
actually much more complicated than
 

4801
01:35:28,590 --> 01:35:31,550
actually much more complicated than
people think it is and and so some

4802
01:35:31,550 --> 01:35:31,560
people think it is and and so some
 

4803
01:35:31,560 --> 01:35:32,990
people think it is and and so some
people went after just the premium part

4804
01:35:32,990 --> 01:35:33,000
people went after just the premium part
 

4805
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:34,910
people went after just the premium part
without the free part and ran into a

4806
01:35:34,910 --> 01:35:34,920
without the free part and ran into a
 

4807
01:35:34,920 --> 01:35:37,430
without the free part and ran into a
wall where no one wanted to pay some

4808
01:35:37,430 --> 01:35:37,440
wall where no one wanted to pay some
 

4809
01:35:37,440 --> 01:35:39,830
wall where no one wanted to pay some
people went after just music music

4810
01:35:39,830 --> 01:35:39,840
people went after just music music
 

4811
01:35:39,840 --> 01:35:42,080
people went after just music music
should be free just ads which doesn't

4812
01:35:42,080 --> 01:35:42,090
should be free just ads which doesn't
 

4813
01:35:42,090 --> 01:35:43,280
should be free just ads which doesn't
give you enough revenue and doesn't work

4814
01:35:43,280 --> 01:35:43,290
give you enough revenue and doesn't work
 

4815
01:35:43,290 --> 01:35:45,530
give you enough revenue and doesn't work
for the music industry so I think that

4816
01:35:45,530 --> 01:35:45,540
for the music industry so I think that
 

4817
01:35:45,540 --> 01:35:47,840
for the music industry so I think that
combination is kind of a pick from the

4818
01:35:47,840 --> 01:35:47,850
combination is kind of a pick from the
 

4819
01:35:47,850 --> 01:35:49,790
combination is kind of a pick from the
outside so maybe I shouldn't say it here

4820
01:35:49,790 --> 01:35:49,800
outside so maybe I shouldn't say it here
 

4821
01:35:49,800 --> 01:35:52,460
outside so maybe I shouldn't say it here
and reveal the secret but that that

4822
01:35:52,460 --> 01:35:52,470
and reveal the secret but that that
 

4823
01:35:52,470 --> 01:35:54,830

turns out to be hard to replicate then

4824
01:35:54,830 --> 01:35:54,840
turns out to be hard to replicate then
 

4825

here brilliance or luck
 

4831
01:36:01,350 --> 01:36:03,230
here brilliance or luck
probably more luck but it doesn't really

4832
01:36:03,230 --> 01:36:03,240
probably more luck but it doesn't really
 

4833
01:36:03,240 --> 01:36:04,400
probably more luck but it doesn't really

01:36:35,030 --> 01:36:35,040
audio podcasts audiobooks I think it's
 

4855
01:36:35,040 --> 01:36:37,580

one of the few core human needs I think
 

4857
01:36:37,590 --> 01:36:40,160
one of the few core human needs I think
it there is no good reason to me why it

4858
01:36:40,160 --> 01:36:40,170
it there is no good reason to me why it
 

4859
01:36:40,170 --> 01:36:41,780
it there is no good reason to me why it
shouldn't be at the scale of something

4860
01:36:41,780 --> 01:36:41,790
shouldn't be at the scale of something
 

4861
01:36:41,790 --> 01:36:43,940
shouldn't be at the scale of something
like messaging or social networking I

4862
01:36:43,940 --> 01:36:43,950
like messaging or social networking I
 

4863

4865
01:36:46,530 --> 01:36:48,620
don't think it's a nice thing to listen
to music or news or something so I think

4866
01:36:48,620 --> 01:36:48,630
to music or news or something so I think
 

4867
01:36:48,630 --> 01:36:49,940
to music or news or something so I think
scale is obviously one of the things

4868
01:36:49,940 --> 01:36:49,950
scale is obviously one of the things
 

4869
01:36:49,950 --> 01:36:51,770

that I really hope for I think I hope
 

4871
01:36:51,780 --> 01:36:54,470
that I really hope for I think I hope
that it's going to be billions of users

01:36:54,480 --> 01:36:56,330
that it's going to be billions of users
I hope eventually everyone in the world

4874
01:36:56,330 --> 01:36:56,340
I hope eventually everyone in the world

ever made so obviously I think it's

4878
01:37:00,140 --> 01:37:00,150
ever made so obviously I think it's
 

4879
01:37:00,150 --> 01:37:01,220
ever made so obviously I think it's
going to be a much bigger business

4880

going to be a much bigger business
 

4881

4899
01:37:32,130 --> 01:37:35,120
mobile carriers you had the SMS the 140
character 2020 carrot SMS and it was

01:37:35,120 --> 01:37:35,130
character 2020 carrot SMS and it was
 

4901
01:37:35,130 --> 01:37:36,650
character 2020 carrot SMS and it was
great because everyone agreed on the

great because everyone agreed on the
 

4903
01:37:36,660 --> 01:37:38,510

4904
01:37:38,510 --> 01:37:38,520
standard so as a consumer you got a lot
 

4905

of distributions and interoperability
 

4907
01:37:39,900 --> 01:37:42,140
of distributions and interoperability
but it was a very constrained format and

4908
01:37:42,140 --> 01:37:42,150
but it was a very constrained format and
 

4909
01:37:42,150 --> 01:37:44,150
but it was a very constrained format and

4913
01:37:46,230 --> 01:37:48,020
pictures to that format to do the MMS I
looked it up and I think it took from

4914
01:37:48,020 --> 01:37:48,030
looked it up and I think it took from
 

4915
01:37:48,030 --> 01:37:50,150
looked it up and I think it took from
the late 80s to early 2000 this is like

4916
01:37:50,150 --> 01:37:50,160
the late 80s to early 2000 this is like
 

4917
01:37:50,160 --> 01:37:52,310
the late 80s to early 2000 this is like
a 15 20 year product cycle to bring

4918
01:37:52,310 --> 01:37:52,320
a 15 20 year product cycle to bring
 

4919
01:37:52,320 --> 01:37:56,380
a 15 20 year product cycle to bring
pictures into that now once that entire

value chain of creation and consumption

4922
01:37:58,970 --> 01:37:58,980

4923
01:37:58,980 --> 01:38:01,490
value chain of creation and consumption
got wrapped in one software stack with

4924
01:38:01,490 --> 01:38:01,500
got wrapped in one software stack with
 

4925
01:38:01,500 --> 01:38:03,820
got wrapped in one software stack with
in something like snapchat or whatsapp

4926
01:38:03,820 --> 01:38:03,830
in something like snapchat or whatsapp
 

4927
01:38:03,830 --> 01:38:06,050
in something like snapchat or whatsapp
like the first week they had a

4928
01:38:06,050 --> 01:38:06,060
like the first week they had a
 

4929
01:38:06,060 --> 01:38:07,790
like the first week they had a
disappearing messages like then two

4930
01:38:07,790 --> 01:38:07,800
disappearing messages like then two
 

4931
01:38:07,800 --> 01:38:09,830
disappearing messages like then two
weeks later they added stories like the

4932
01:38:09,830 --> 01:38:09,840
weeks later they added stories like the
 

4933
01:38:09,840 --> 01:38:11,270
weeks later they added stories like the
pace of innovation when you're on one

4934

pace of innovation when you're on one
 

4935
01:38:11,280 --> 01:38:13,640
pace of innovation when you're on one
software stack and you can you can you

4936
01:38:13,640 --> 01:38:13,650
software stack and you can you can you
 

4937
01:38:13,650 --> 01:38:15,050
software stack and you can you can you
can affect both creation and consumption

4938
01:38:15,050 --> 01:38:15,060
can affect both creation and consumption
 

4939
01:38:15,060 --> 01:38:17,960
can affect both creation and consumption
I think is going to be rapid so with

4940
01:38:17,960 --> 01:38:17,970
I think is going to be rapid so with
 

4941
01:38:17,970 --> 01:38:19,460
I think is going to be rapid so with
these streaming services we now for the

4942
01:38:19,460 --> 01:38:19,470
these streaming services we now for the
 

4943
01:38:19,470 --> 01:38:22,970
these streaming services we now for the
first time in history have enough I hope

4944
01:38:22,970 --> 01:38:22,980
first time in history have enough I hope
 

4945
01:38:22,980 --> 01:38:25,220
first time in history have enough I hope
people on one of these services actually

4946
01:38:25,220 --> 01:38:25,230
people on one of these services actually
 

4947
01:38:25,230 --> 01:38:27,560
people on one of these services actually
whether it's Spotify or Amazon or Apple

4948
01:38:27,560 --> 01:38:27,570
whether it's Spotify or Amazon or Apple
 

4949
01:38:27,570 --> 01:38:29,630
whether it's Spotify or Amazon or Apple
or or YouTube and hopefully enough

4950
01:38:29,630 --> 01:38:29,640
or or YouTube and hopefully enough
 

4951
01:38:29,640 --> 01:38:31,190
or or YouTube and hopefully enough
creators that you can actually start

4952
01:38:31,190 --> 01:38:31,200
creators that you can actually start
 

4953
01:38:31,200 --> 01:38:32,900
creators that you can actually start
working with a format again and and that

4954
01:38:32,900 --> 01:38:32,910
working with a format again and and that
 

4955
01:38:32,910 --> 01:38:34,820
working with a format again and and that
excites me I think being able to change

4956
01:38:34,820 --> 01:38:34,830
excites me I think being able to change
 

4957
01:38:34,830 --> 01:38:36,290
excites me I think being able to change
these constraints from a hundred years

4958

that could really that could really do
 

4961
01:38:38,760 --> 01:38:40,700
that could really that could really do
something interesting I don't I really

4962
01:38:40,700 --> 01:38:40,710
something interesting I don't I really
 

4963
01:38:40,710 --> 01:38:42,430
something interesting I don't I really
hope it's not just going to be their

4964
01:38:42,430 --> 01:38:42,440
hope it's not just going to be their
 

4965

hope it's not just going to be their
iteration on on the same thing for the

01:42:00,500 --> 01:42:03,010
will be ambient that you know at least
in my home you just shout something at

5134
01:42:03,010 --> 01:42:03,020
in my home you just shout something at
 

5135
01:42:03,020 --> 01:42:04,360
in my home you just shout something at
someone and there's always like one of

5136
01:42:04,360 --> 01:42:04,370
someone and there's always like one of
 

5137
01:42:04,370 --> 01:42:07,930
someone and there's always like one of
these speakers close enough and so you

5138
01:42:07,930 --> 01:42:07,940
these speakers close enough and so you
 

5139
01:42:07,940 --> 01:42:09,640
these speakers close enough and so you
start behaving differently it's as if

5140
01:42:09,640 --> 01:42:09,650
start behaving differently it's as if
 

5141
01:42:09,650 --> 01:42:10,870
start behaving differently it's as if
you have the Internet

5142
01:42:10,870 --> 01:42:10,880
you have the Internet
 

5143
01:42:10,880 --> 01:42:12,940
you have the Internet
ambient ambiently around you and you can

5144
01:42:12,940 --> 01:42:12,950
ambient ambiently around you and you can
 

5145
01:42:12,950 --> 01:42:16,430
ambient ambiently around you and you can
ask it things

5146
01:42:16,430 --> 01:42:16,440

 

5147
01:42:16,440 --> 01:42:19,610

so I think computing or kind of get more

5148
01:42:19,610 --> 01:42:19,620
so I think computing or kind of get more
 

5149
01:42:19,620 --> 01:42:21,020
so I think computing or kind of get more
integrated and we won we won't

5150
01:42:21,020 --> 01:42:21,030
integrated and we won we won't
 

5151
01:42:21,030 --> 01:42:23,020
integrated and we won we won't
necessarily think of that as as

5152
01:42:23,020 --> 01:42:23,030
necessarily think of that as as
 

5153
01:42:23,030 --> 01:42:25,100
necessarily think of that as as
connected to a device and the same thing

5154
01:42:25,100 --> 01:42:25,110
connected to a device and the same thing
 

5155
01:42:25,110 --> 01:42:27,620
connected to a device and the same thing
in the same way that we do today I don't

5156
01:42:27,620 --> 01:42:27,630
in the same way that we do today I don't
 

5157
01:42:27,630 --> 01:42:30,890
in the same way that we do today I don't
know the path to that maybe we used to

5158
01:42:30,890 --> 01:42:30,900
know the path to that maybe we used to
 

5159
01:42:30,900 --> 01:42:33,770
know the path to that maybe we used to
have these desktop computers and then we

5160
01:42:33,770 --> 01:42:33,780
have these desktop computers and then we
 

5161
01:42:33,780 --> 01:42:36,260
have these desktop computers and then we
partially replace that with the with the

5162
01:42:36,260 --> 01:42:36,270
partially replace that with the with the
 

5163
01:42:36,270 --> 01:42:38,360
partially replace that with the with the
laptops and left you know at home and at

5164
01:42:38,360 --> 01:42:38,370
laptops and left you know at home and at
 

5165
01:42:38,370 --> 01:42:40,460
laptops and left you know at home and at
work and then we got these phones and we

5166
01:42:40,460 --> 01:42:40,470
work and then we got these phones and we
 

5167
01:42:40,470 --> 01:42:42,650
work and then we got these phones and we
started leaving the laptop at home for a

5168
01:42:42,650 --> 01:42:42,660
started leaving the laptop at home for a
 

5169
01:42:42,660 --> 01:42:45,560
started leaving the laptop at home for a
while and maybe the maybe for stretches

5170
01:42:45,560 --> 01:42:45,570
while and maybe the maybe for stretches
 

5171
01:42:45,570 --> 01:42:46,760
while and maybe the maybe for stretches
of time you're gonna start using the

5172
01:42:46,760 --> 01:42:46,770
of time you're gonna start using the
 

5173
01:42:46,770 --> 01:42:48,530
of time you're gonna start using the
watch and you can leave your your phone

5174
01:42:48,530 --> 01:42:48,540
watch and you can leave your your phone
 

5175
01:42:48,540 --> 01:42:50,270
watch and you can leave your your phone
at home like for a run or something and

5176
01:42:50,270 --> 01:42:50,280
at home like for a run or something and
 

5177
01:42:50,280 --> 01:42:52,460
at home like for a run or something and
you know we're on this progressive path

5178
01:42:52,460 --> 01:42:52,470
you know we're on this progressive path
 

5179
01:42:52,470 --> 01:42:56,690
you know we're on this progressive path
where you I think what what is happening

5180
01:42:56,690 --> 01:42:56,700
where you I think what what is happening
 

5181
01:42:56,700 --> 01:43:00,950
where you I think what what is happening
with the voice is that you haven't you

5182
01:43:00,950 --> 01:43:00,960
with the voice is that you haven't you
 

5183
01:43:00,960 --> 01:43:02,600
with the voice is that you haven't you
have an interactive interaction paradigm

5184
01:43:02,600 --> 01:43:02,610
have an interactive interaction paradigm
 

5185
01:43:02,610 --> 01:43:06,230
have an interactive interaction paradigm
that doesn't require as large physical

5186
01:43:06,230 --> 01:43:06,240
that doesn't require as large physical
 

5187
01:43:06,240 --> 01:43:08,060
that doesn't require as large physical
devices so I definitely think there's a

5188
01:43:08,060 --> 01:43:08,070
devices so I definitely think there's a
 

5189
01:43:08,070 --> 01:43:10,340
devices so I definitely think there's a
future where you can have your your

5190
01:43:10,340 --> 01:43:10,350
future where you can have your your
 

5191
01:43:10,350 --> 01:43:13,220
future where you can have your your
airports and and your watch and you can

5192
01:43:13,220 --> 01:43:13,230
airports and and your watch and you can
 

5193
01:43:13,230 --> 01:43:17,600
airports and and your watch and you can
do a lot of computing and I don't think

5194
01:43:17,600 --> 01:43:17,610
do a lot of computing and I don't think
 

5195
01:43:17,610 --> 01:43:20,450
do a lot of computing and I don't think
it's gonna be this binary thing I think

5196
01:43:20,450 --> 01:43:20,460
it's gonna be this binary thing I think
 

5197
01:43:20,460 --> 01:43:21,920
it's gonna be this binary thing I think
it's gonna be like many of us still have

5198
01:43:21,920 --> 01:43:21,930
it's gonna be like many of us still have
 

5199
01:43:21,930 --> 01:43:24,440
it's gonna be like many of us still have
a laptop we just use it less and so you

5200
01:43:24,440 --> 01:43:24,450
a laptop we just use it less and so you
 

5201
01:43:24,450 --> 01:43:27,760
a laptop we just use it less and so you
shift your your consumption over and I

5202
01:43:27,760 --> 01:43:27,770
shift your your consumption over and I
 

5203
01:43:27,770 --> 01:43:31,580
shift your your consumption over and I
don't know about a or glasses and so

5204
01:43:31,580 --> 01:43:31,590
don't know about a or glasses and so
 

5205
01:43:31,590 --> 01:43:33,170
don't know about a or glasses and so
forth um I'm excited about I spend a lot

5206
01:43:33,170 --> 01:43:33,180
forth um I'm excited about I spend a lot
 

5207
01:43:33,180 --> 01:43:34,520
forth um I'm excited about I spend a lot
of time in that area but I still think

5208
01:43:34,520 --> 01:43:34,530
of time in that area but I still think
 

5209
01:43:34,530 --> 01:43:37,700
of time in that area but I still think
it's quite far away they are VR oh yes

5210
01:43:37,700 --> 01:43:37,710
it's quite far away they are VR oh yes
 

5211
01:43:37,710 --> 01:43:40,010
it's quite far away they are VR oh yes
VR is is happening and working I think

5212
01:43:40,010 --> 01:43:40,020
VR is is happening and working I think
 

5213
01:43:40,020 --> 01:43:43,220
VR is is happening and working I think
the recent oculus quest is quite

5214
01:43:43,220 --> 01:43:43,230
the recent oculus quest is quite
 

5215
01:43:43,230 --> 01:43:45,500
the recent oculus quest is quite
impressive I think AR is further away at

5216
01:43:45,500 --> 01:43:45,510
impressive I think AR is further away at
 

5217
01:43:45,510 --> 01:43:48,500
impressive I think AR is further away at
least that type of AR I think but I do

5218
01:43:48,500 --> 01:43:48,510
least that type of AR I think but I do
 

5219
01:43:48,510 --> 01:43:52,970
least that type of AR I think but I do
think your phone or water glasses

5220
01:43:52,970 --> 01:43:52,980
think your phone or water glasses
 

5221
01:43:52,980 --> 01:43:54,590
think your phone or water glasses
understanding where you are and maybe

5222
01:43:54,590 --> 01:43:54,600
understanding where you are and maybe
 

5223
01:43:54,600 --> 01:43:55,910
understanding where you are and maybe
what you're looking at and being able to

5224
01:43:55,910 --> 01:43:55,920
what you're looking at and being able to
 

5225
01:43:55,920 --> 01:43:57,350
what you're looking at and being able to
give you all your cues about or you can

5226
01:43:57,350 --> 01:43:57,360
give you all your cues about or you can
 

5227
01:43:57,360 --> 01:43:59,300
give you all your cues about or you can
say like what is this and it tells you

5228
01:43:59,300 --> 01:43:59,310
say like what is this and it tells you
 

5229
01:43:59,310 --> 01:44:02,030
say like what is this and it tells you
what it is that I think might happen you

5230
01:44:02,030 --> 01:44:02,040
what it is that I think might happen you
 

5231
01:44:02,040 --> 01:44:04,400
what it is that I think might happen you
you know you use your your watch to your

5232
01:44:04,400 --> 01:44:04,410
you know you use your your watch to your
 

5233
01:44:04,410 --> 01:44:07,070
you know you use your your watch to your
glasses there's a as a mouse pointer on

5234
01:44:07,070 --> 01:44:07,080
glasses there's a as a mouse pointer on
 

5235
01:44:07,080 --> 01:44:09,080
glasses there's a as a mouse pointer on
reality I think it might be a while

5236
01:44:09,080 --> 01:44:09,090
reality I think it might be a while
 

5237
01:44:09,090 --> 01:44:10,910
reality I think it might be a while
before I might be wrong I hope I'm wrong

5238
01:44:10,910 --> 01:44:10,920
before I might be wrong I hope I'm wrong
 

5239
01:44:10,920 --> 01:44:12,050
before I might be wrong I hope I'm wrong
I think it might be a while before we

5240
01:44:12,050 --> 01:44:12,060
I think it might be a while before we
 

5241
01:44:12,060 --> 01:44:13,340
I think it might be a while before we
walk around with these big like lab

5242
01:44:13,340 --> 01:44:13,350
walk around with these big like lab
 

5243
01:44:13,350 --> 01:44:16,250
walk around with these big like lab
glasses then project things I agree with

5244
01:44:16,250 --> 01:44:16,260
glasses then project things I agree with
 

5245
01:44:16,260 --> 01:44:17,660
glasses then project things I agree with
you there's a it's actually really

5246
01:44:17,660 --> 01:44:17,670
you there's a it's actually really
 

5247
01:44:17,670 --> 01:44:20,990
you there's a it's actually really
difficult when you have to understand

5248
01:44:20,990 --> 01:44:21,000
difficult when you have to understand
 

5249
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:23,570
difficult when you have to understand
the physical world enough to project

5250
01:44:23,570 --> 01:44:23,580
the physical world enough to project
 

5251
01:44:23,580 --> 01:44:26,300
the physical world enough to project
onto it well I lied about the last

5252
01:44:26,300 --> 01:44:26,310
onto it well I lied about the last
 

5253
01:44:26,310 --> 01:44:28,030
onto it well I lied about the last
question

5254
01:44:28,030 --> 01:44:28,040
question
 

5255
01:44:28,040 --> 01:44:31,930
question
because I just thought of audio and my

5256
01:44:31,930 --> 01:44:31,940
because I just thought of audio and my
 

5257
01:44:31,940 --> 01:44:33,970
because I just thought of audio and my
favorite topic which is the movie her

5258
01:44:33,970 --> 01:44:33,980
favorite topic which is the movie her
 

5259
01:44:33,980 --> 01:44:38,560
favorite topic which is the movie her
mm-hmm do you think well there's part of

5260
01:44:38,560 --> 01:44:38,570
mm-hmm do you think well there's part of
 

5261
01:44:38,570 --> 01:44:42,250
mm-hmm do you think well there's part of
Spotify or not will have I don't know if

5262
01:44:42,250 --> 01:44:42,260
Spotify or not will have I don't know if
 

5263
01:44:42,260 --> 01:44:46,200
Spotify or not will have I don't know if
you've seen the movie her absolutely and

5264
01:44:46,200 --> 01:44:46,210
you've seen the movie her absolutely and
 

5265
01:44:46,210 --> 01:44:50,590
you've seen the movie her absolutely and
their audio is the primary form of

5266
01:44:50,590 --> 01:44:50,600
their audio is the primary form of
 

5267
01:44:50,600 --> 01:44:52,330
their audio is the primary form of
interaction and the connection with

5268
01:44:52,330 --> 01:44:52,340
interaction and the connection with
 

5269
01:44:52,340 --> 01:44:55,000
interaction and the connection with
another entity that you can actually

5270
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:55,010
another entity that you can actually
 

5271
01:44:55,010 --> 01:44:56,890
another entity that you can actually
have a relationship with actually fall

5272
01:44:56,890 --> 01:44:56,900
have a relationship with actually fall
 

5273
01:44:56,900 --> 01:45:00,070
have a relationship with actually fall
in love with based on voice alone audio

5274
01:45:00,070 --> 01:45:00,080
in love with based on voice alone audio
 

5275
01:45:00,080 --> 01:45:02,260
in love with based on voice alone audio
alone you how far do you think that's

5276
01:45:02,260 --> 01:45:02,270
alone you how far do you think that's
 

5277
01:45:02,270 --> 01:45:03,970
alone you how far do you think that's
possible first of all based on audio

5278
01:45:03,970 --> 01:45:03,980
possible first of all based on audio
 

5279
01:45:03,980 --> 01:45:05,260
possible first of all based on audio
alone to fall in love with somebody

5280
01:45:05,260 --> 01:45:05,270
alone to fall in love with somebody
 

5281
01:45:05,270 --> 01:45:07,600
alone to fall in love with somebody
somebody or well yeah let's go with

5282
01:45:07,600 --> 01:45:07,610
somebody or well yeah let's go with
 

5283
01:45:07,610 --> 01:45:09,940
somebody or well yeah let's go with
somebody just have a relationship based

5284
01:45:09,940 --> 01:45:09,950
somebody just have a relationship based
 

5285
01:45:09,950 --> 01:45:13,030
somebody just have a relationship based
on audio alone and second question to

that can we create an artificial
intelligence system that allows one to

intelligence system that allows one to
 

5291

both I think what we just said about

5300
01:45:33,940 --> 01:45:33,950
both I think what we just said about
 

5301
01:45:33,950 --> 01:45:36,310
both I think what we just said about
podcasts and the feeling of being in the

5302

middle of a conversation if you could
 

5305
01:45:38,840 --> 01:45:42,190
middle of a conversation if you could
have an assistant where and we just said

5306
01:45:42,190 --> 01:45:42,200
have an assistant where and we just said
 

5307
01:45:42,200 --> 01:45:44,080
have an assistant where and we just said
that feels like a very personal settings

5308
01:45:44,080 --> 01:45:44,090
that feels like a very personal settings
 

5309
01:45:44,090 --> 01:45:45,010
that feels like a very personal settings
so if you walk around with these

5310
01:45:45,010 --> 01:45:45,020
so if you walk around with these
 

5311
01:45:45,020 --> 01:45:46,960
so if you walk around with these
headphones and this thing you're

5312
01:45:46,960 --> 01:45:46,970
headphones and this thing you're
 

5313
01:45:46,970 --> 01:45:48,100
headphones and this thing you're
speaking with this thing all of the time

5314
01:45:48,100 --> 01:45:48,110
speaking with this thing all of the time
 

5315
01:45:48,110 --> 01:45:50,170
speaking with this thing all of the time
that feels like it's in your brain I

5316
01:45:50,170 --> 01:45:50,180
that feels like it's in your brain I
 

5317
01:45:50,180 --> 01:45:53,320
that feels like it's in your brain I
think it's it's gonna be much easier to

5318
01:45:53,320 --> 01:45:53,330
think it's it's gonna be much easier to
 

5319
01:45:53,330 --> 01:45:54,430
think it's it's gonna be much easier to
fall in love with than something that

5320
01:45:54,430 --> 01:45:54,440
fall in love with than something that
 

5321
01:45:54,440 --> 01:45:55,990
fall in love with than something that
would be on your screen I think that's

5322
01:45:55,990 --> 01:45:56,000
would be on your screen I think that's
 

5323
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,510
would be on your screen I think that's
entirely possible and then from that you

5324
01:45:58,510 --> 01:45:58,520
entirely possible and then from that you
 

5325
01:45:58,520 --> 01:46:00,760
entirely possible and then from that you
can programs is better than me but from

5326
01:46:00,760 --> 01:46:00,770
can programs is better than me but from
 

5327
01:46:00,770 --> 01:46:02,680
can programs is better than me but from
the concept of if it's going to be

5328
01:46:02,680 --> 01:46:02,690
the concept of if it's going to be
 

5329
01:46:02,690 --> 01:46:06,370
the concept of if it's going to be
possible to build a machine that they

5330
01:46:06,370 --> 01:46:06,380
possible to build a machine that they
 

5331
01:46:06,380 --> 01:46:07,780
possible to build a machine that they
can achieve that I think whether you

5332
01:46:07,780 --> 01:46:07,790
can achieve that I think whether you
 

5333
01:46:07,790 --> 01:46:10,570
can achieve that I think whether you
whether you think of it as if you can

5334
01:46:10,570 --> 01:46:10,580
whether you think of it as if you can
 

5335
01:46:10,580 --> 01:46:12,250
whether you think of it as if you can
fake it the philosophical zombie that it

5336
01:46:12,250 --> 01:46:12,260
fake it the philosophical zombie that it
 

5337
01:46:12,260 --> 01:46:14,560
fake it the philosophical zombie that it
simulates it enough or it it somehow

5338
01:46:14,560 --> 01:46:14,570
simulates it enough or it it somehow
 

5339
01:46:14,570 --> 01:46:18,130
simulates it enough or it it somehow
actually is I think there's it's only

5340
01:46:18,130 --> 01:46:18,140
actually is I think there's it's only
 

5341
01:46:18,140 --> 01:46:19,840
actually is I think there's it's only
question if you ask me about time I'd

5342
01:46:19,840 --> 01:46:19,850
question if you ask me about time I'd
 

5343
01:46:19,850 --> 01:46:21,130
question if you ask me about time I'd
had to be a financier but if you say a

5344
01:46:21,130 --> 01:46:21,140
had to be a financier but if you say a
 

5345
01:46:21,140 --> 01:46:23,920
had to be a financier but if you say a
given some half infinite time absolutely

5346
01:46:23,920 --> 01:46:23,930
given some half infinite time absolutely
 

5347
01:46:23,930 --> 01:46:27,700
given some half infinite time absolutely
I think it's just atoms and arrangement

5348
01:46:27,700 --> 01:46:27,710
I think it's just atoms and arrangement
 

5349
01:46:27,710 --> 01:46:31,120
I think it's just atoms and arrangement
of information well I personally think

5350
01:46:31,120 --> 01:46:31,130
of information well I personally think
 

5351
01:46:31,130 --> 01:46:32,980
of information well I personally think
that love is a lot simpler than people

5352
01:46:32,980 --> 01:46:32,990
that love is a lot simpler than people
 

5353
01:46:32,990 --> 01:46:35,980
that love is a lot simpler than people
