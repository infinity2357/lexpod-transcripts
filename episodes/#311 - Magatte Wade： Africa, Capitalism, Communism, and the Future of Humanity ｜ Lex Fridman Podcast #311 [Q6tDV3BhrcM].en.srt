increases the span of those laws and
we'll talk about that the fascinating

824

race so in from that standpoint at the
 

875
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,189
race so in from that standpoint at the
most basic level

876
00:14:47,189 --> 00:14:47,199
most basic level
 

877
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:48,870

uh we're all africans where this whole
 

879
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,910
uh we're all africans where this whole
thing started exactly exactly where this

880
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:51,920
thing started exactly exactly where this
 

881
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,910
thing started exactly exactly where this
whole thing started and how at some

882
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:53,920
whole thing started and how at some
 

883
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,870
whole thing started and how at some
point um humanity was hanging by its

884
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:56,880
point um humanity was hanging by its
 

885
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,550
point um humanity was hanging by its
fingernails only two thousands of us

886
00:14:58,550 --> 00:14:58,560
fingernails only two thousands of us
 

887
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,310
fingernails only two thousands of us
were left on this earth and eventually

888
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:00,320
were left on this earth and eventually
 

889
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,990
were left on this earth and eventually
we started you know we went for survival

890
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:02,000
we started you know we went for survival
 

891
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,750
we started you know we went for survival
and that's how we started to spread

892
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:03,760
and that's how we started to spread
 

893
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,670
and that's how we started to spread
around and some going up north some

894
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:05,680
around and some going up north some
 

895
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,069
around and some going up north some
going this way that way and as you're

896
00:15:08,069 --> 00:15:08,079
going this way that way and as you're
 

897
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:09,990
going this way that way and as you're
traveling to different places then

898
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:10,000
traveling to different places then
 

899
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,910
traveling to different places then
features start to change to adapt to

00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:22,160
natural habitat you know the genomics
 

909
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,629
natural habitat you know the genomics
program i think um at the

910
00:15:24,629 --> 00:15:24,639
program i think um at the
 

911
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:26,710
program i think um at the
via national geographic did that so well

912
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:26,720
via national geographic did that so well
 

913
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,829
via national geographic did that so well
for people who are interested in going

914

such but um yeah so at the very basic
 

919
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,030
such but um yeah so at the very basic
most basic level that's that's what

920

and it's not always the correct way to
describe them but i'm sure you get the

1300
00:22:13,029 --> 00:22:13,039
describe them but i'm sure you get the
 

1301
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:14,310
describe them but i'm sure you get the
sentiment

1302
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:14,320
sentiment
 

1303
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,630
sentiment
and from that place

1304
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:16,640
and from that place
 

1305
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,669
and from that place
there is tons of resentment

1306
00:22:19,669 --> 00:22:19,679
there is tons of resentment
 

1307
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:21,909
there is tons of resentment
because for the longest time

1308
00:22:21,909 --> 00:22:21,919

1309
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:24,549
because for the longest time

these groups organizations
and some that preceded them

1312
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:27,120
and some that preceded them
 

1313
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,590
and some that preceded them
have proceeded to actually

1314
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:29,600
have proceeded to actually
 

1315
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,070
have proceeded to actually
decide what even our new frontiers would

be

really forced everyone to think
 

1397
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:47,750
really forced everyone to think
about the identity of this nation

1398
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:47,760
about the identity of this nation

what does it take for a country to
 

1451
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,830
what does it take for a country to
prosper you see many countries in the

1457
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,430
and many that flourish
and it's not always obvious why because

1458
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:57,440
and it's not always obvious why because
 

1459
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,390
and it's not always obvious why because
some have natural resources some don't

about and i think then this is where it
 

1495
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,190
about and i think then this is where it
becomes very important

1496
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:33,200
becomes very important
 

1497
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,870
becomes very important
that we are very clear

1498
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:34,880
that we are very clear
 

1499
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,269
that we are very clear
about the question you asked me

1500
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:37,279
about the question you asked me

2272
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:05,280
moves from a a poorer nation to a nation
 

2273
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,950
moves from a a poorer nation to a nation
that supposedly is rich

2274
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:06,960
that supposedly is rich
 

2275
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:07,910
that supposedly is rich
all the

2276
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:07,920
all the
 

2277
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:08,870
all the
sudden

2278
00:39:08,870 --> 00:39:08,880
sudden
 

2279
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,870
sudden
they get to manifest their greatest

2280
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:10,880
they get to manifest their greatest
 

2281
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,470
they get to manifest their greatest
potential

2282
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:12,480
potential
 

2283
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,750
potential
so i'm starting to think this has

2284
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:13,760
so i'm starting to think this has
 

2285
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,910
so i'm starting to think this has
nothing to do with a person per say

2286
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:15,920
nothing to do with a person per say
 

2287
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,030
nothing to do with a person per say
because we're talking about the same

2288
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:17,040
because we're talking about the same
 

2289
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,870
because we're talking about the same
person same background so maybe the same

2290
00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:18,880
person same background so maybe the same
 

2291
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:21,190
person same background so maybe the same
name features everything yeah now i'm

2292
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:21,200
name features everything yeah now i'm
 

2293
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,030
name features everything yeah now i'm
starting to think maybe it doesn't have

2294
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:23,040
starting to think maybe it doesn't have
 

2295
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,109
starting to think maybe it doesn't have
to do with a person maybe we're talking

2296
00:39:25,109 --> 00:39:25,119
to do with a person maybe we're talking
 

2297
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:27,030
to do with a person maybe we're talking
about something that has to do with a

2298
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:27,040
about something that has to do with a
 

2299
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,790
about something that has to do with a
place that they came from or the place

2300
00:39:28,790 --> 00:39:28,800
place that they came from or the place
 

2301
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,109
place that they came from or the place
that they're going to

2302
00:39:31,109 --> 00:39:31,119
that they're going to
 

2303
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:33,270
that they're going to
so this this little thing is starting to

2304
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:33,280
so this this little thing is starting to
 

2305
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,349
so this this little thing is starting to
be in my mind again remember this is not

i had to to face off to have many

2314
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:43,680
i had to to face off to have many
 

2315
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,910
i had to to face off to have many
different ideologies face each other i

2316
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:45,920
different ideologies face each other i
 

2317
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,510
different ideologies face each other i
had to really have a reckoning literally

2318
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:47,520
had to really have a reckoning literally
 

2319
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:50,870
had to really have a reckoning literally
in my heart and in my mind

2320
00:39:50,870 --> 00:39:50,880
in my heart and in my mind
 

2321
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,310

and so
so then that's what i'm thinking it

2324
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:54,560
so then that's what i'm thinking it
 

2325
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:57,510
so then that's what i'm thinking it
cannot be it cannot no no no it's the

2326
00:39:57,510 --> 00:39:57,520
cannot be it cannot no no no it's the
 

2327
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,190
cannot be it cannot no no no it's the
same people it has to be about the place

2328
00:39:59,190 --> 00:39:59,200
same people it has to be about the place

different outcome
what is this

2342
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:11,920
what is this
 

2343
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,829
what is this
and then i go on

2344
00:40:13,829 --> 00:40:13,839
and then i go on
 

2345
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:17,430
and then i go on
i start a comp i i am in silicon valley

2346
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:17,440
i start a comp i i am in silicon valley
 

2347

and um i'm starting to discover this
 

2355
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,510
and um i'm starting to discover this
concept of this thing called

2379
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,870
stuff together and then they have uh the
big four cpa firms this whole ecosystem

2380
00:40:50,870 --> 00:40:50,880
big four cpa firms this whole ecosystem
 

2381

so in that way it seems like the lesson
 

5277
01:30:36,480 --> 01:30:37,910
so in that way it seems like the lesson
at least of this part of the human

5278
01:30:37,910 --> 01:30:37,920
at least of this part of the human
 

5279
01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:40,390
at least of this part of the human
history until the robots take over is

5280
01:30:40,390 --> 01:30:40,400
history until the robots take over is
 

5281
01:30:40,400 --> 01:30:43,189
history until the robots take over is
that the economic

5282
01:30:43,189 --> 01:30:43,199
that the economic
 

5283
01:30:43,199 --> 01:30:44,229
that the economic
freedom

5284
01:30:44,229 --> 01:30:44,239

allowing
the anyone from your country

5290

01:30:52,320 --> 01:30:54,709
the anyone from your country
to dream and to make that dream a

5292
01:30:54,709 --> 01:30:54,719
to dream and to make that dream a
 

5293
01:30:54,719 --> 01:30:58,310
to dream and to make that dream a
reality by creating it with as few

5294
01:30:58,310 --> 01:30:58,320
reality by creating it with as few
 

5295
01:30:58,320 --> 01:30:59,350
reality by creating it with as few
sort of

5296
01:30:59,350 --> 01:30:59,360
sort of
 

5297
01:30:59,360 --> 01:31:02,470
sort of
uh roadblocks as possible exactly

5298
01:31:02,470 --> 01:31:02,480
uh roadblocks as possible exactly
 

5299
01:31:02,480 --> 01:31:04,470
uh roadblocks as possible exactly
so so that's why for me

5300
01:31:04,470 --> 01:31:04,480
so so that's why for me
 

5301
01:31:04,480 --> 01:31:06,310
so so that's why for me
the message is very clear is what we

5302
01:31:06,310 --> 01:31:06,320

so this is a problem
 

5479
01:34:08,800 --> 01:34:10,470
so this is a problem
this is a problem nobody cares about the

this is a problem nobody cares about the
 

5481
01:34:10,480 --> 01:34:13,830
this is a problem nobody cares about the
economist anyway

5482

and in this case my intellectual journey
was very much complemented by my own

5530
01:35:07,109 --> 01:35:07,119
was very much complemented by my own
 

5531
01:35:07,119 --> 01:35:08,070
was very much complemented by my own

having to build these companies
on two separate continents

on two separate continents
 

5537
01:35:12,480 --> 01:35:15,189
on two separate continents
and having to obs i was i had front row

5538
01:35:15,189 --> 01:35:15,199
and having to obs i was i had front row
 

5539
01:35:15,199 --> 01:35:17,590
and having to obs i was i had front row
seat of the differences at first i

5540
01:35:17,590 --> 01:35:17,600
seat of the differences at first i
 

5541
01:35:17,600 --> 01:35:19,030
seat of the differences at first i
thought it was this way just because

5542
01:35:19,030 --> 01:35:19,040
thought it was this way just because
 

5543
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:21,189
thought it was this way just because
we're poor and therefore we messed up

5544
01:35:21,189 --> 01:35:21,199
we're poor and therefore we messed up
 

5545
01:35:21,199 --> 01:35:22,629
we're poor and therefore we messed up
and therefore it's like this but

5546
01:35:22,629 --> 01:35:22,639
and therefore it's like this but
 

5547
01:35:22,639 --> 01:35:24,870
and therefore it's like this but
eventually i learned that no we're poor

5548
01:35:24,870 --> 01:35:24,880
eventually i learned that no we're poor
 

5549
01:35:24,880 --> 01:35:26,390
eventually i learned that no we're poor
because we lack economic freedom and if

5550
01:35:26,390 --> 01:35:26,400
because we lack economic freedom and if
 

5551
01:35:26,400 --> 01:35:28,070
because we lack economic freedom and if
the country allows its citizens the

5552
01:35:28,070 --> 01:35:28,080
the country allows its citizens the
 

5553
01:35:28,080 --> 01:35:30,149
the country allows its citizens the
economic freedom to enterprise then they

5554
01:35:30,149 --> 01:35:30,159
economic freedom to enterprise then they
 

5555
01:35:30,159 --> 01:35:32,629
economic freedom to enterprise then they
become rich so yeah i had it upside down

5556
01:35:32,629 --> 01:35:32,639
become rich so yeah i had it upside down
 

5557
01:35:32,639 --> 01:35:34,709
become rich so yeah i had it upside down
you see and so it's important for people

5558
01:35:34,709 --> 01:35:34,719
you see and so it's important for people
 

5559
01:35:34,719 --> 01:35:37,030
you see and so it's important for people
to know that so number one know your

5560
01:35:37,030 --> 01:35:37,040
to know that so number one know your
 

5561
01:35:37,040 --> 01:35:38,149
to know that so number one know your
facts

5562
01:35:38,149 --> 01:35:38,159
facts
 

5563
01:35:38,159 --> 01:35:39,990
facts
because your facts will

5564
01:35:39,990 --> 01:35:40,000
because your facts will
 

5565
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:41,590
because your facts will
empower you

5566
01:35:41,590 --> 01:35:41,600
empower you
 

5567
01:35:41,600 --> 01:35:43,430
empower you
in this case i like to use that word

5568
01:35:43,430 --> 01:35:43,440
in this case i like to use that word
 

5569
01:35:43,440 --> 01:35:45,030
in this case i like to use that word
facts will empire and they will even

5570
01:35:45,030 --> 01:35:45,040
facts will empire and they will even
 

5571
01:35:45,040 --> 01:35:48,229
facts will empire and they will even
further more they will power you empower

5572

further more they will power you empower
 

5573
01:35:48,239 --> 01:35:49,910
further more they will power you empower
and power you because then power is like

5574
01:35:49,910 --> 01:35:49,920
and power you because then power is like
 

5575
01:35:49,920 --> 01:35:52,470
and power you because then power is like
inside and power is like i push you

5576

inside and power is like i push you
 

5577
01:35:52,480 --> 01:35:55,189
inside and power is like i push you
forward and up so that's what it does to

5578
01:35:55,189 --> 01:35:55,199
forward and up so that's what it does to
 

5579
01:35:55,199 --> 01:35:56,709
forward and up so that's what it does to
know the facts

5580
01:35:56,709 --> 01:35:56,719
know the facts
 

5581
01:35:56,719 --> 01:35:57,990
know the facts
and then

5582
01:35:57,990 --> 01:35:58,000
and then
 

5583
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,310
and then
go on and look around you

5584
01:36:00,310 --> 01:36:00,320
go on and look around you
 

5585
01:36:00,320 --> 01:36:02,870
go on and look around you
where are the best practices of this who

01:37:42,629 --> 01:37:42,639
and there's a chance to leapfrog too
 

5679
01:37:42,639 --> 01:37:44,870
and there's a chance to leapfrog too
exactly which is really really powerful

5680

exactly which is really really powerful
 

5681
01:37:44,880 --> 01:37:47,590
exactly which is really really powerful
exactly because here we will leapfrog

exactly because here we will leapfrog
 

5683
01:37:47,600 --> 01:37:50,070

have to find that thing and there's
 

5757
01:39:04,080 --> 01:39:06,390
have to find that thing and there's
something about when there's freedom to

5758
01:39:06,390 --> 01:39:06,400
something about when there's freedom to
 

5759
01:39:06,400 --> 01:39:08,390
something about when there's freedom to
find that thing and people interact they

find that thing and people interact they
 

5761
01:39:08,400 --> 01:39:10,470
find that thing and people interact they
get excited about [\h__\h] together and then

5762
01:39:10,470 --> 01:39:10,480
get excited about [\h__\h] together and then
 

5763
01:39:10,480 --> 01:39:12,870
get excited about [\h__\h] together and then
they they build it's

5764
01:39:12,870 --> 01:39:12,880
they they build it's
 

5765

if you look at authoritarian

5766
01:39:14,950 --> 01:39:14,960
if you look at authoritarian
 

5767
01:39:14,960 --> 01:39:18,390
if you look at authoritarian
at places that limit that freedom

5768
01:39:18,390 --> 01:39:18,400
at places that limit that freedom
 

5769
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:21,350
at places that limit that freedom
at the core i think is the idea that

5770
01:39:21,350 --> 01:39:21,360
at the core i think is the idea that
 

5771
01:39:21,360 --> 01:39:23,270
at the core i think is the idea that
people are dumb let us take care of

5772
01:39:23,270 --> 01:39:23,280
people are dumb let us take care of
 

5773
01:39:23,280 --> 01:39:25,109
people are dumb let us take care of
everything we'll come up with the rules

5774
01:39:25,109 --> 01:39:25,119
everything we'll come up with the rules
 

5775
01:39:25,119 --> 01:39:26,629
everything we'll come up with the rules
and the regulations because people are

5776
01:39:26,629 --> 01:39:26,639
and the regulations because people are
 

5777
01:39:26,639 --> 01:39:28,950
and the regulations because people are
too dumb to manage things themselves and

5778
01:39:28,950 --> 01:39:28,960
too dumb to manage things themselves and
 

5779
01:39:28,960 --> 01:39:32,070
too dumb to manage things themselves and

the humanity for some reason to me
because there's such a focus on the art

6104
01:45:38,390 --> 01:45:38,400
because there's such a focus on the art
 

6105
01:45:38,400 --> 01:45:39,830
because there's such a focus on the art
of it all

6106
01:45:39,830 --> 01:45:39,840
of it all
 

6107
01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:41,750
of it all
that you lose the basic connection to

6108
01:45:41,750 --> 01:45:41,760
that you lose the basic connection to
 

6109
01:45:41,760 --> 01:45:44,550
that you lose the basic connection to
humanity now that said depends what

6110
01:45:44,550 --> 01:45:44,560
humanity now that said depends what
 

6111
01:45:44,560 --> 01:45:46,950
humanity now that said depends what
you're talking about i think some of the

6112
01:45:46,950 --> 01:45:46,960
you're talking about i think some of the
 

6113
01:45:46,960 --> 01:45:48,950
you're talking about i think some of the
lack of connection over humanity was the

6114
01:45:48,950 --> 01:45:48,960
lack of connection over humanity was the
 

6115
01:45:48,960 --> 01:45:51,270
lack of connection over humanity was the
fact that while i did know how to speak

6116
01:45:51,270 --> 01:45:51,280
fact that while i did know how to speak
 

6117
01:45:51,280 --> 01:45:53,510
fact that while i did know how to speak
french for a long time i forgot most of

6118
01:45:53,510 --> 01:45:53,520
french for a long time i forgot most of
 

6119
01:45:53,520 --> 01:45:54,629
french for a long time i forgot most of
the language

6120
01:45:54,629 --> 01:45:54,639
the language
 

6121
01:45:54,639 --> 01:45:57,990
the language
um and so part of it there is a barrier

6122
01:45:57,990 --> 01:45:58,000
um and so part of it there is a barrier
 

6123
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,550
um and so part of it there is a barrier
you said hospitality

6139
01:46:16,719 --> 01:46:19,750
there there's a bit of a barrier i must
admit on that and that it is true um

is it true i i needed to know

8352
02:25:10,790 --> 02:25:10,800
is it true i i needed to know
 

8353
02:25:10,800 --> 02:25:13,670
is it true i i needed to know
because i was at a time of my life where

8354
02:25:13,670 --> 02:25:13,680
because i was at a time of my life where
 

8355
02:25:13,680 --> 02:25:15,590
because i was at a time of my life where
at some point you know when when those

8356
02:25:15,590 --> 02:25:15,600
at some point you know when when those
 

8357
02:25:15,600 --> 02:25:17,830
at some point you know when when those
killings were happening it was so hard

8358
02:25:17,830 --> 02:25:17,840
killings were happening it was so hard
 

8359
02:25:17,840 --> 02:25:19,990
killings were happening it was so hard
for me um being a black person in this

8360
02:25:19,990 --> 02:25:20,000
for me um being a black person in this
 

8361
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:21,030
for me um being a black person in this
country

8362
02:25:21,030 --> 02:25:21,040
country
 

8363
02:25:21,040 --> 02:25:27,750
country
and wondering

8364
02:25:27,750 --> 02:25:27,760

 

8365
02:25:27,760 --> 02:25:30,389

i mean what is this and

8366
02:25:30,389 --> 02:25:30,399
i mean what is this and
 

8367
02:25:30,399 --> 02:25:33,270
i mean what is this and
and what do we do with this

8368
02:25:33,270 --> 02:25:33,280
and what do we do with this
 

8369
02:25:33,280 --> 02:25:35,349
and what do we do with this
um yeah is it true how much

8370
02:25:35,349 --> 02:25:35,359
um yeah is it true how much
 

8371
02:25:35,359 --> 02:25:37,190
um yeah is it true how much
discrimination am i operating under in

8372
02:25:37,190 --> 02:25:37,200
discrimination am i operating under in
 

8373
02:25:37,200 --> 02:25:38,870
discrimination am i operating under in
the system

8374
02:25:38,870 --> 02:25:38,880
the system
 

8375
02:25:38,880 --> 02:25:39,990
the system
all of that

8376
02:25:39,990 --> 02:25:40,000
all of that
 

8377
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:41,270
all of that
you need to understand the full

8378
02:25:41,270 --> 02:25:41,280
you need to understand the full
 

8379
02:25:41,280 --> 02:25:43,510
you need to understand the full
characteristics of if you're if you're

8380
02:25:43,510 --> 02:25:43,520
characteristics of if you're if you're
 

8381
02:25:43,520 --> 02:25:45,510
characteristics of if you're if you're
dreaming of making a big change by

8382
02:25:45,510 --> 02:25:45,520
dreaming of making a big change by
 

8383
02:25:45,520 --> 02:25:46,870
dreaming of making a big change by
building companies

8384
02:25:46,870 --> 02:25:46,880
building companies
 

8385
02:25:46,880 --> 02:25:48,550
building companies
you have to kind of

8386
02:25:48,550 --> 02:25:48,560
you have to kind of
 

8387
02:25:48,560 --> 02:25:50,870
you have to kind of
intuit how much what am i up against

8388
02:25:50,870 --> 02:25:50,880
intuit how much what am i up against
 

8389
02:25:50,880 --> 02:25:52,790
intuit how much what am i up against
what am i up against right and so this

8390
02:25:52,790 --> 02:25:52,800
what am i up against right and so this
 

8391
02:25:52,800 --> 02:25:55,110
what am i up against right and so this
is why you know spend all of his time on

8392
02:25:55,110 --> 02:25:55,120
is why you know spend all of his time on
 

8393
02:25:55,120 --> 02:25:57,190
is why you know spend all of his time on
some of the work and then eventually i

8394
02:25:57,190 --> 02:25:57,200
some of the work and then eventually i
 

8395
02:25:57,200 --> 02:25:59,030
some of the work and then eventually i
understood that um discrimination if you

8396
02:25:59,030 --> 02:25:59,040
understood that um discrimination if you
 

8397
02:25:59,040 --> 02:26:00,870
understood that um discrimination if you
wanted to understand it beyond

8398
02:26:00,870 --> 02:26:00,880
wanted to understand it beyond
 

8399
02:26:00,880 --> 02:26:03,429
wanted to understand it beyond
um it's um you know beyond the the big

8400
02:26:03,429 --> 02:26:03,439
um it's um you know beyond the the big
 

8401
02:26:03,439 --> 02:26:06,150
um it's um you know beyond the the big
lines of uh especially the the clickbait

8402
02:26:06,150 --> 02:26:06,160
lines of uh especially the the clickbait
 

8403
02:26:06,160 --> 02:26:08,790
lines of uh especially the the clickbait
lines would make it very black and white

8404
02:26:08,790 --> 02:26:08,800
lines would make it very black and white
 

8405
02:26:08,800 --> 02:26:10,630
lines would make it very black and white
then i had to really take a moment and i

8406
02:26:10,630 --> 02:26:10,640
then i had to really take a moment and i
 

8407
02:26:10,640 --> 02:26:12,790
then i had to really take a moment and i
spent time you know with a world of

8408
02:26:12,790 --> 02:26:12,800
spent time you know with a world of
 

8409
02:26:12,800 --> 02:26:14,870

and especially

02:26:27,510 --> 02:26:27,520
and especially
 

8423
02:26:27,520 --> 02:26:29,670
and especially
i came across the work of this team of

8424
02:26:29,670 --> 02:26:29,680
i came across the work of this team of
 

8425
02:26:29,680 --> 02:26:31,910
i came across the work of this team of
scientists at the university of uh i

8426
02:26:31,910 --> 02:26:31,920
scientists at the university of uh i
 

8427
02:26:31,920 --> 02:26:34,630
scientists at the university of uh i
think it's wisconsin and there were only

think it's wisconsin and there were only
 

8429
02:26:34,640 --> 02:26:37,030

ones who made sense

8430
02:26:37,030 --> 02:26:37,040
ones who made sense
 

8431
02:26:37,040 --> 02:26:40,230
ones who made sense
in this sea of nonsense back then

8432
02:26:40,230 --> 02:26:40,240
in this sea of nonsense back then
 

8433

and this article wasn't political

8434
02:26:43,670 --> 02:26:43,680
and this article wasn't political
 

8435
02:26:43,680 --> 02:26:45,190
and this article wasn't political
and it was saying something that i could

8436
02:26:45,190 --> 02:26:45,200
and it was saying something that i could
 

8437
02:26:45,200 --> 02:26:47,030
and it was saying something that i could
relate with

02:26:48,560 --> 02:26:50,710
and eventually
what i learned was

what i learned was

can happen sooner or later because you
 

8453
02:26:59,760 --> 02:27:01,349
can happen sooner or later because you
know we're all different

know we're all different
 

8455
02:27:01,359 --> 02:27:03,830
know we're all different
but you go from this person who has to

but you go from this person who has to

you're going to have to develop this

you're going to have to develop this
 

8493
02:27:38,319 --> 02:27:40,870
you're going to have to develop this
ability to make sense of the world and

ability to make sense of the world and
 

8495

what's making sense of a world at its
most basic level means is

02:27:45,670 --> 02:27:45,680
most basic level means is
 

8499
02:27:45,680 --> 02:27:49,110
most basic level means is
can you determine if a situation or a

can you determine if a situation or a

02:28:02,800 --> 02:28:05,030
alive for next second
see it's so wired in

8514
02:28:05,030 --> 02:28:05,040
see it's so wired in
 

8515
02:28:05,040 --> 02:28:08,230
see it's so wired in
so this process starting to kick in

8516
02:28:08,230 --> 02:28:08,240
so this process starting to kick in
 

8517
02:28:08,240 --> 02:28:10,630
so this process starting to kick in
and at that point your brain is going to

8518
02:28:10,630 --> 02:28:10,640
and at that point your brain is going to
 

8519
02:28:10,640 --> 02:28:13,030
and at that point your brain is going to
be your best ally for that

8520
02:28:13,030 --> 02:28:13,040
be your best ally for that
 

8521
02:28:13,040 --> 02:28:14,790
be your best ally for that
and what the brain is going to do is

8522
02:28:14,790 --> 02:28:14,800
and what the brain is going to do is
 

8523
02:28:14,800 --> 02:28:16,550
and what the brain is going to do is
it's going to help you and the way the

8524
02:28:16,550 --> 02:28:16,560
it's going to help you and the way the
 

8525
02:28:16,560 --> 02:28:18,309
it's going to help you and the way the
brain works is through

8526
02:28:18,309 --> 02:28:18,319
brain works is through
 

8527
02:28:18,319 --> 02:28:20,950
brain works is through
it it works with um for if it's all

8528
02:28:20,950 --> 02:28:20,960
it it works with um for if it's all
 

8529
02:28:20,960 --> 02:28:24,630
it it works with um for if it's all
wired for efficiency and the way it um

8530
02:28:24,630 --> 02:28:24,640
wired for efficiency and the way it um
 

8531
02:28:24,640 --> 02:28:26,389
wired for efficiency and the way it um
it goes for efficiency is through

8532
02:28:26,389 --> 02:28:26,399
it goes for efficiency is through
 

8533
02:28:26,399 --> 02:28:28,550
it goes for efficiency is through
automation meaning that every time it

8534
02:28:28,550 --> 02:28:28,560
automation meaning that every time it
 

8535
02:28:28,560 --> 02:28:29,830
automation meaning that every time it
has computed and you probably know these

8536
02:28:29,830 --> 02:28:29,840
has computed and you probably know these
 

8537
02:28:29,840 --> 02:28:31,110
has computed and you probably know these
things way better than me every time it

8538
02:28:31,110 --> 02:28:31,120
things way better than me every time it
 

8539
02:28:31,120 --> 02:28:34,230
things way better than me every time it
has computed one algorithm

8540
02:28:34,230 --> 02:28:34,240
has computed one algorithm
 

8541
02:28:34,240 --> 02:28:36,070
has computed one algorithm
it doesn't quite it doesn't want to do

8542
02:28:36,070 --> 02:28:36,080
it doesn't quite it doesn't want to do
 

8543
02:28:36,080 --> 02:28:37,830
it doesn't quite it doesn't want to do
it again it's almost like this okay got

8544
02:28:37,830 --> 02:28:37,840
it again it's almost like this okay got
 

8545
02:28:37,840 --> 02:28:39,190
it again it's almost like this okay got
it stored

8546
02:28:39,190 --> 02:28:39,200
it stored
 

8547
02:28:39,200 --> 02:28:41,270
it stored
stored right and then it adds maybe some

8548
02:28:41,270 --> 02:28:41,280
stored right and then it adds maybe some
 

8549
02:28:41,280 --> 02:28:43,349
stored right and then it adds maybe some
little levels of complexity to it but it

8550
02:28:43,349 --> 02:28:43,359
little levels of complexity to it but it
 

8551
02:28:43,359 --> 02:28:45,270
little levels of complexity to it but it
has to be something new meaning the new

8552
02:28:45,270 --> 02:28:45,280
has to be something new meaning the new
 

8553
02:28:45,280 --> 02:28:47,190
has to be something new meaning the new
level of complexity for it to even be

8554
02:28:47,190 --> 02:28:47,200
level of complexity for it to even be
 

8555
02:28:47,200 --> 02:28:48,870
level of complexity for it to even be
willing to reconsider

8556
02:28:48,870 --> 02:28:48,880
willing to reconsider
 

8557
02:28:48,880 --> 02:28:50,150
willing to reconsider
otherwise you have so then all of a

8558
02:28:50,150 --> 02:28:50,160
otherwise you have so then all of a
 

8559
02:28:50,160 --> 02:28:51,750
otherwise you have so then all of a
sudden what you have is

8560
02:28:51,750 --> 02:28:51,760
sudden what you have is
 

8561
02:28:51,760 --> 02:28:53,990
sudden what you have is
these neurons in the back of your head

8562
02:28:53,990 --> 02:28:54,000
these neurons in the back of your head
 

8563
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:56,950
these neurons in the back of your head
and they have created pathways right so

8564
02:28:56,950 --> 02:28:56,960
and they have created pathways right so
 

8565
02:28:56,960 --> 02:28:59,349
and they have created pathways right so
and every time um neurons have created

8566
02:28:59,349 --> 02:28:59,359
and every time um neurons have created
 

8567
02:28:59,359 --> 02:29:01,510
and every time um neurons have created
pathway among themselves

because basically they attached and here
 

8571
02:29:03,760 --> 02:29:05,910
because basically they attached and here
is a pathway well this pathway in the

02:29:05,910 --> 02:29:05,920
is a pathway well this pathway in the
 

8573
02:29:05,920 --> 02:29:07,830

science of bias

8578
02:29:10,870 --> 02:29:10,880
science of bias
 

8579
02:29:10,880 --> 02:29:12,710
science of bias
it's a habit in general it's a habit

8580
02:29:12,710 --> 02:29:12,720
it's a habit in general it's a habit
 

8581
02:29:12,720 --> 02:29:14,070
it's a habit in general it's a habit
when they form two pathways when they

8582
02:29:14,070 --> 02:29:14,080
when they form two pathways when they
 

8583
02:29:14,080 --> 02:29:17,030
when they form two pathways when they
form a pathway it's a habit so

8584
02:29:17,030 --> 02:29:17,040
form a pathway it's a habit so
 

8585
02:29:17,040 --> 02:29:18,309
form a pathway it's a habit so
if we're willing to talk about

8586
02:29:18,309 --> 02:29:18,319
if we're willing to talk about
 

8587
02:29:18,319 --> 02:29:20,870
if we're willing to talk about
unconscious bias because of course

8588
02:29:20,870 --> 02:29:20,880
unconscious bias because of course
 

8589
02:29:20,880 --> 02:29:22,870
unconscious bias because of course
it's very different from somebody who

8590
02:29:22,870 --> 02:29:22,880
it's very different from somebody who

02:29:22,880 --> 02:29:25,030
it's very different from somebody who
tells me to my face

percent of psychopaths in our world
 

8605
02:29:38,720 --> 02:29:40,630
percent of psychopaths in our world
they're out there unfortunately by the

8606
02:29:40,630 --> 02:29:40,640
they're out there unfortunately by the
 

8607
02:29:40,640 --> 02:29:42,150
they're out there unfortunately by the
time they do nasty things it's pretty

8608
02:29:42,150 --> 02:29:42,160
time they do nasty things it's pretty
 

8609
02:29:42,160 --> 02:29:43,510
time they do nasty things it's pretty
horrible and that's what all we hear

8610
02:29:43,510 --> 02:29:43,520
horrible and that's what all we hear
 

8611
02:29:43,520 --> 02:29:45,590
horrible and that's what all we hear
about but i'm talking mostly about the

8612
02:29:45,590 --> 02:29:45,600
about but i'm talking mostly about the
 

8613
02:29:45,600 --> 02:29:47,110
about but i'm talking mostly about the
rest of us remember when i told you that

8614
02:29:47,110 --> 02:29:47,120
rest of us remember when i told you that
 

8615
02:29:47,120 --> 02:29:49,110
rest of us remember when i told you that
most of us are good people bumbling

8616
02:29:49,110 --> 02:29:49,120
most of us are good people bumbling
 

8617
02:29:49,120 --> 02:29:51,429
most of us are good people bumbling
along making it up as we're going that's

8618
02:29:51,429 --> 02:29:51,439
along making it up as we're going that's
 

8619
02:29:51,439 --> 02:29:54,070
along making it up as we're going that's
why i have compassion for human nature

8620
02:29:54,070 --> 02:29:54,080
why i have compassion for human nature
 

8621
02:29:54,080 --> 02:29:56,070
why i have compassion for human nature
so but really

8622
02:29:56,070 --> 02:29:56,080
so but really
 

8623
02:29:56,080 --> 02:29:57,270
so but really
in the morning when i wake up do you

8624
02:29:57,270 --> 02:29:57,280
in the morning when i wake up do you
 

8625
02:29:57,280 --> 02:29:58,469
in the morning when i wake up do you
really think that i'm waking up and

8626
02:29:58,469 --> 02:29:58,479
really think that i'm waking up and
 

8627
02:29:58,479 --> 02:30:00,389
really think that i'm waking up and
thinking how am i gonna go kill how am i

8628
02:30:00,389 --> 02:30:00,399
thinking how am i gonna go kill how am i
 

8629
02:30:00,399 --> 02:30:02,150
thinking how am i gonna go kill how am i
gonna go kill lex that next guy needs to

8630
02:30:02,150 --> 02:30:02,160
gonna go kill lex that next guy needs to
 

8631
02:30:02,160 --> 02:30:04,550
gonna go kill lex that next guy needs to
go down he's a man he's a don't take me

8632
02:30:04,550 --> 02:30:04,560
go down he's a man he's a don't take me
 

8633
02:30:04,560 --> 02:30:05,590
go down he's a man he's a don't take me
where i'm sure about some women who feel

8634
02:30:05,590 --> 02:30:05,600
where i'm sure about some women who feel
 

8635
02:30:05,600 --> 02:30:07,349
where i'm sure about some women who feel
like that but i'm not one of them and i

8636
02:30:07,349 --> 02:30:07,359
like that but i'm not one of them and i
 

8637
02:30:07,359 --> 02:30:08,950
like that but i'm not one of them and i
do think a majority of us are not

8638
02:30:08,950 --> 02:30:08,960
do think a majority of us are not
 

8639
02:30:08,960 --> 02:30:10,710
do think a majority of us are not
whatever but you know in the morning i'm

8640
02:30:10,710 --> 02:30:10,720
whatever but you know in the morning i'm
 

8641
02:30:10,720 --> 02:30:12,870
whatever but you know in the morning i'm
waking up i'm just like

8642
02:30:12,870 --> 02:30:12,880
waking up i'm just like
 

8643
02:30:12,880 --> 02:30:14,070
waking up i'm just like
gee

8644
02:30:14,070 --> 02:30:14,080
gee
 

8645
02:30:14,080 --> 02:30:16,150
gee
can i get my tea

8646
02:30:16,150 --> 02:30:16,160
can i get my tea
 

8647
02:30:16,160 --> 02:30:18,150
can i get my tea
oh my dog is not looking okay today you

8648
02:30:18,150 --> 02:30:18,160
oh my dog is not looking okay today you
 

8649
02:30:18,160 --> 02:30:21,270
oh my dog is not looking okay today you
know we've got

8650
02:30:21,270 --> 02:30:21,280

 

8651
02:30:21,280 --> 02:30:22,469

right

8652
02:30:22,469 --> 02:30:22,479
right
 

8653
02:30:22,479 --> 02:30:24,309
right
it's a lot going on and you're using

8654
02:30:24,309 --> 02:30:24,319
it's a lot going on and you're using
 

8655
02:30:24,319 --> 02:30:25,590
it's a lot going on and you're using
these kind of

8656
02:30:25,590 --> 02:30:25,600
these kind of
 

8657
02:30:25,600 --> 02:30:27,270
these kind of
just like you said brilliantly the brain

8658
02:30:27,270 --> 02:30:27,280
just like you said brilliantly the brain
 

8659
02:30:27,280 --> 02:30:29,110
just like you said brilliantly the brain
is has a bunch of simplifications it's

8660
02:30:29,110 --> 02:30:29,120
is has a bunch of simplifications it's
 

8661
02:30:29,120 --> 02:30:31,110
is has a bunch of simplifications it's
built up yeah and he uses those

8662
02:30:31,110 --> 02:30:31,120
built up yeah and he uses those
 

8663
02:30:31,120 --> 02:30:32,710
built up yeah and he uses those
simplifications to get through the day

8664
02:30:32,710 --> 02:30:32,720
simplifications to get through the day
 

8665
02:30:32,720 --> 02:30:35,830
simplifications to get through the day
for the day exactly so so then here you

8666
02:30:35,830 --> 02:30:35,840
for the day exactly so so then here you
 

8667
02:30:35,840 --> 02:30:37,910
for the day exactly so so then here you
are needing to make sense of a world and

8668
02:30:37,910 --> 02:30:37,920
are needing to make sense of a world and
 

8669
02:30:37,920 --> 02:30:39,750
are needing to make sense of a world and
then the brain is your best ally in that

8670
02:30:39,750 --> 02:30:39,760
then the brain is your best ally in that
 

8671
02:30:39,760 --> 02:30:40,710
then the brain is your best ally in that
the way it's going to do it is for

8672
02:30:40,710 --> 02:30:40,720
the way it's going to do it is for
 

8673
02:30:40,720 --> 02:30:42,230
the way it's going to do it is for
efficiency efficiency done through

8674
02:30:42,230 --> 02:30:42,240
efficiency efficiency done through
 

8675
02:30:42,240 --> 02:30:45,270
efficiency efficiency done through
automation so every time it thinks it's

8676
02:30:45,270 --> 02:30:45,280
automation so every time it thinks it's
 

8677
02:30:45,280 --> 02:30:46,790
automation so every time it thinks it's
figured something out it's never going

8678
02:30:46,790 --> 02:30:46,800
figured something out it's never going
 

8679
02:30:46,800 --> 02:30:48,150
figured something out it's never going
to think about it again so that's how

8680
02:30:48,150 --> 02:30:48,160
to think about it again so that's how
 

8681
02:30:48,160 --> 02:30:49,830
to think about it again so that's how
you build all of these habits of

8682
02:30:49,830 --> 02:30:49,840
you build all of these habits of
 

8683
02:30:49,840 --> 02:30:52,790
you build all of these habits of
unconscious bias because everything so

8684
02:30:52,790 --> 02:30:52,800
unconscious bias because everything so
 

8685
02:30:52,800 --> 02:30:55,110
unconscious bias because everything so
it's somewhere along the line you come

8686
02:30:55,110 --> 02:30:55,120
it's somewhere along the line you come
 

8687
02:30:55,120 --> 02:30:56,870
it's somewhere along the line you come
up with um the

8688
02:30:56,870 --> 02:30:56,880
up with um the
 

8689
02:30:56,880 --> 02:30:59,270
up with um the
with the information that black men

8690
02:30:59,270 --> 02:30:59,280
with the information that black men
 

8691
02:30:59,280 --> 02:31:00,630
with the information that black men
walking around with a hoodie equals

8692
02:31:00,630 --> 02:31:00,640
walking around with a hoodie equals
 

8693
02:31:00,640 --> 02:31:04,790
walking around with a hoodie equals
danger so later what do you see

8694
02:31:04,790 --> 02:31:04,800
danger so later what do you see
 

8695
02:31:04,800 --> 02:31:06,710
danger so later what do you see
whether it's lex oh my god i'm walking

8696
02:31:06,710 --> 02:31:06,720
whether it's lex oh my god i'm walking
 

8697

given that information so the best way
 

8705
02:31:13,680 --> 02:31:15,030
given that information so the best way
to think about it is the brain is a

02:31:15,030 --> 02:31:15,040
to think about it is the brain is a
 

8707
02:31:15,040 --> 02:31:16,469
to think about it is the brain is a

and we're all programmed along the same
 

8757
02:31:57,760 --> 02:31:59,670
and we're all programmed along the same
line see that's the beauty of it

all of us are because even some black

8760

all of us are because even some black
 

8761
02:32:02,000 --> 02:32:03,349
all of us are because even some black
people who are going to claim but they

8762
02:32:03,349 --> 02:32:03,359
people who are going to claim but they
 

8763
02:32:03,359 --> 02:32:05,429
people who are going to claim but they
didn't business when they registered

didn't business when they registered
 

8765
02:32:05,439 --> 02:32:06,469
didn't business when they registered
really

8766
02:32:06,469 --> 02:32:06,479
really
 

8767
02:32:06,479 --> 02:32:08,150
really
so the truth so then when i learned all

8768
02:32:08,150 --> 02:32:08,160
so the truth so then when i learned all
 

8769
02:32:08,160 --> 02:32:10,309
so the truth so then when i learned all
of this i'm like wow this concept of if

8770
02:32:10,309 --> 02:32:10,319
of this i'm like wow this concept of if
 

8771
02:32:10,319 --> 02:32:12,710
of this i'm like wow this concept of if
you've got a brain you've got biases

8772
02:32:12,710 --> 02:32:12,720
you've got a brain you've got biases
 

8773
02:32:12,720 --> 02:32:14,950
you've got a brain you've got biases
it comes with a territory that makes

8774
02:32:14,950 --> 02:32:14,960
it comes with a territory that makes
 

8775
02:32:14,960 --> 02:32:16,469
it comes with a territory that makes
sense

8776
02:32:16,469 --> 02:32:16,479
sense
 

8777
02:32:16,479 --> 02:32:17,510
sense
now

8778
02:32:17,510 --> 02:32:17,520
now
 

8779
02:32:17,520 --> 02:32:19,030
now
it doesn't mean we can't we can't

8780
02:32:19,030 --> 02:32:19,040
it doesn't mean we can't we can't
 

8781
02:32:19,040 --> 02:32:21,190
it doesn't mean we can't we can't
transcend that function of a brain and

8782
02:32:21,190 --> 02:32:21,200
transcend that function of a brain and
 

8783
02:32:21,200 --> 02:32:24,150
transcend that function of a brain and
that we should transcend it

8784
02:32:24,150 --> 02:32:24,160
that we should transcend it
 

8785
02:32:24,160 --> 02:32:25,670
that we should transcend it
right but i think it's very important

8786
02:32:25,670 --> 02:32:25,680
right but i think it's very important
 

8787
02:32:25,680 --> 02:32:27,510
right but i think it's very important
because once you understand that

8788
02:32:27,510 --> 02:32:27,520
because once you understand that
 

8789
02:32:27,520 --> 02:32:29,750
because once you understand that
a little bit more peace is created among

8790
02:32:29,750 --> 02:32:29,760
a little bit more peace is created among
 

8791
02:32:29,760 --> 02:32:31,590
a little bit more peace is created among
us because this is not about a black and

8792
02:32:31,590 --> 02:32:31,600
us because this is not about a black and
 

8793
02:32:31,600 --> 02:32:34,150
us because this is not about a black and
white or a yellow and green issue it's

8794
02:32:34,150 --> 02:32:34,160
white or a yellow and green issue it's
 

8795
02:32:34,160 --> 02:32:36,710
white or a yellow and green issue it's
about we are human issue

8796
02:32:36,710 --> 02:32:36,720
about we are human issue
 

8797
02:32:36,720 --> 02:32:37,990
about we are human issue
and these are part of the things we

8798
02:32:37,990 --> 02:32:38,000
and these are part of the things we
 

8799
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:40,710
and these are part of the things we
developed to you know to to to to keep

8800
02:32:40,710 --> 02:32:40,720
developed to you know to to to to keep
 

8801
02:32:40,720 --> 02:32:42,230
developed to you know to to to to keep
to to stay around

8802
02:32:42,230 --> 02:32:42,240
to to stay around
 

8803
02:32:42,240 --> 02:32:44,630
to to stay around
um just like we no longer have to rely

8804
02:32:44,630 --> 02:32:44,640
um just like we no longer have to rely
 

8805
02:32:44,640 --> 02:32:46,070
um just like we no longer have to rely
on um

8806
02:32:46,070 --> 02:32:46,080
on um

you know this fear of flight um you know
 

8809
02:32:48,399 --> 02:32:51,750
you know this fear of flight um you know
like um ability of a brain because bears

8810
02:32:51,750 --> 02:32:51,760
like um ability of a brain because bears
 

8811
02:32:51,760 --> 02:32:53,590
like um ability of a brain because bears
over there start running and running

8812
02:32:53,590 --> 02:32:53,600
over there start running and running
 

8813
02:32:53,600 --> 02:32:55,910
over there start running and running
fast right today wherever bears show me

8814
02:32:55,910 --> 02:32:55,920
fast right today wherever bears show me
 

8815
02:32:55,920 --> 02:32:58,309
fast right today wherever bears show me
where they are but we have kept this

8816
02:32:58,309 --> 02:32:58,319
where they are but we have kept this
 

8817
02:32:58,319 --> 02:32:59,510
where they are but we have kept this
tendency

8818
02:32:59,510 --> 02:32:59,520
tendency
 

8819
02:32:59,520 --> 02:33:02,469
tendency
to go for fear uh fear or flight i don't

know how they say it and so we have this
 

8823
02:33:04,960 --> 02:33:07,429
know how they say it and so we have this

yourself you know all that kind of stuff
that's the thing and so lex that's why

9044
02:36:57,270 --> 02:36:57,280
that's the thing and so lex that's why
 

9045
02:36:57,280 --> 02:36:59,590
that's the thing and so lex that's why
this first step is bias um bias

9046
02:36:59,590 --> 02:36:59,600
this first step is bias um bias
 

9047
02:36:59,600 --> 02:37:01,510
this first step is bias um bias
awareness so you get you train yourself

9048
02:37:01,510 --> 02:37:01,520
awareness so you get you train yourself
 

9049
02:37:01,520 --> 02:37:03,990
awareness so you get you train yourself
oh yeah okay that was one or it's where

9050
02:37:03,990 --> 02:37:04,000
oh yeah okay that was one or it's where

then from there you like um
 

9057
02:37:09,280 --> 02:37:11,910
then from there you like um
um replace the bias like bias

9058
02:37:11,910 --> 02:37:11,920
um replace the bias like bias
 

9059
02:37:11,920 --> 02:37:13,830
um replace the bias like bias
replacement

9060

replacement
then it is um

9062
02:37:15,830 --> 02:37:15,840

sudden something else starts to click
 

9081
02:37:31,120 --> 02:37:33,990
sudden something else starts to click

and then from there you go on to
 

9083
02:37:34,000 --> 02:37:36,150
and then from there you go on to
making connection

9084

when you're making a connection and then
 

9087
02:37:38,560 --> 02:37:41,190
when you're making a connection and then
things start to change because now you

um no you're making um then you make
 

9091
02:37:43,680 --> 02:37:45,670
um no you're making um then you make
cultural immersion so this is where we

9092
02:37:45,670 --> 02:37:45,680
cultural immersion so this is where we
 

9093
02:37:45,680 --> 02:37:47,190
cultural immersion so this is where we
had some people like this one woman she

9094
02:37:47,190 --> 02:37:47,200
had some people like this one woman she

02:38:07,429 --> 02:38:07,439
demeaning of yourself not understanding
 

9111
02:38:07,439 --> 02:38:09,510
demeaning of yourself not understanding
everything else that comes with it

9112

everything else that comes with it
 

9113
02:38:09,520 --> 02:38:11,670
everything else that comes with it
but through as she understood that she

9114
02:38:11,670 --> 02:38:11,680
but through as she understood that she
 

9115
02:38:11,680 --> 02:38:13,510
but through as she understood that she
even had that bias

9116
02:38:13,510 --> 02:38:13,520
even had that bias
 

9117
02:38:13,520 --> 02:38:14,950
even had that bias
then she went on through all the

9118
02:38:14,950 --> 02:38:14,960
then she went on through all the
 

9119
02:38:14,960 --> 02:38:16,790
then she went on through all the
different processes and then eventually

9120
02:38:16,790 --> 02:38:16,800
different processes and then eventually
 

9121
02:38:16,800 --> 02:38:18,469
different processes and then eventually
when comes the next step cultural

9122
02:38:18,469 --> 02:38:18,479
when comes the next step cultural
 

9123
02:38:18,479 --> 02:38:20,790
when comes the next step cultural
immersion she started going

9124
02:38:20,790 --> 02:38:20,800
immersion she started going
 

9125
02:38:20,800 --> 02:38:23,110
immersion she started going
uh to the mosque during ramadan when the

and then we break at night
 

9133
02:38:29,680 --> 02:38:31,349
and then we break at night
and she started understanding very

02:38:31,349 --> 02:38:31,359
and she started understanding very
 

9135
02:38:31,359 --> 02:38:33,349
and she started understanding very
different things and eventually happens

9136
02:38:33,349 --> 02:38:33,359
different things and eventually happens
 

9137
02:38:33,359 --> 02:38:35,750
different things and eventually happens
the last step that happens naturally

9138
02:38:35,750 --> 02:38:35,760
the last step that happens naturally
 

9139
02:38:35,760 --> 02:38:38,710
the last step that happens naturally

02:51:02,080 --> 02:51:04,150
to stand
on their own as well it's like you're

9858
02:51:04,150 --> 02:51:04,160
on their own as well it's like you're

but for me
it still is hard

9980
02:53:14,469 --> 02:53:14,479
it still is hard
 

9981
02:53:14,479 --> 02:53:16,550
it still is hard
because i watch everything that's going

okay if piecemeal legislation takes
forever at the same while we have this

10754
03:06:42,710 --> 03:06:42,720
forever at the same while we have this
 

10755
03:06:42,720 --> 03:06:44,790
forever at the same while we have this
demographic that's growing faster and

10756
03:06:44,790 --> 03:06:44,800
demographic that's growing faster and
 

10757

there is a discrepancy here between the

10760
03:06:48,790 --> 03:06:48,800
there is a discrepancy here between the
 

10761
03:06:48,800 --> 03:06:51,030
there is a discrepancy here between the
the process of the progress we're making

10762
03:06:51,030 --> 03:06:51,040
the process of the progress we're making
 

10763
03:06:51,040 --> 03:06:53,269
the process of the progress we're making
to set the right environment for

10764
03:06:53,269 --> 03:06:53,279
to set the right environment for

and how many more people are coming
 

10769
03:06:57,840 --> 03:06:59,990
and how many more people are coming
to life

10770
03:06:59,990 --> 03:07:00,000
to life

literally every day on the continent
 

10773
03:07:02,160 --> 03:07:05,110
literally every day on the continent
there's a discrepancy here and so

10774
03:07:05,110 --> 03:07:05,120
there's a discrepancy here and so
 

10775
03:07:05,120 --> 03:07:06,870
there's a discrepancy here and so
the ticking bomb is going faster than

10776
03:07:06,870 --> 03:07:06,880
the ticking bomb is going faster than
 

10777
03:07:06,880 --> 03:07:09,110
the ticking bomb is going faster than
the process we the progress we can make

10778

the process we the progress we can make
 

10779
03:07:09,120 --> 03:07:10,710
the process we the progress we can make
this is a problem

10780
03:07:10,710 --> 03:07:10,720
this is a problem
 

10781
03:07:10,720 --> 03:07:12,389
this is a problem
so what some of us are working on is

10782
03:07:12,389 --> 03:07:12,399
so what some of us are working on is
 

10783

so what some of us are working on is
this concept of a startup cities and to

how about we continue doing that work
which is essential and critical but at

only spread but maybe let's say senegal
 

10897
03:09:06,240 --> 03:09:07,910
only spread but maybe let's say senegal
if senegal was to go for this here you

10898
03:09:07,910 --> 03:09:07,920
if senegal was to go for this here you
 

10899
03:09:07,920 --> 03:09:10,150
if senegal was to go for this here you
have this one and then over there you

10900
03:09:10,150 --> 03:09:10,160
have this one and then over there you
 

10901
03:09:10,160 --> 03:09:11,590
have this one and then over there you
have another zone and then what they

10902
03:09:11,590 --> 03:09:11,600
have another zone and then what they
 

10903
03:09:11,600 --> 03:09:13,510
have another zone and then what they
start to do is they're not all modeled

10904
03:09:13,510 --> 03:09:13,520
start to do is they're not all modeled
 

10905
03:09:13,520 --> 03:09:15,510
start to do is they're not all modeled
the same way because maybe this one is

10906
03:09:15,510 --> 03:09:15,520
the same way because maybe this one is
 

10907
03:09:15,520 --> 03:09:17,750
the same way because maybe this one is

keep you around whatever it takes and
 

11391

keep you around whatever it takes and
that's what i would tell people who feel

11392
03:17:48,630 --> 03:17:48,640
that's what i would tell people who feel
 

11393
03:17:48,640 --> 03:17:51,670
that's what i would tell people who feel
like they can't just push one more push

11394
03:17:51,670 --> 03:17:51,680
like they can't just push one more push
 

11395
03:17:51,680 --> 03:17:54,150
like they can't just push one more push
and they think they need to end it at

11396
03:17:54,150 --> 03:17:54,160
and they think they need to end it at
 

11397
03:17:54,160 --> 03:17:56,550
and they think they need to end it at
that point whatever it takes just stick

11398
03:17:56,550 --> 03:17:56,560
that point whatever it takes just stick
 

11399
03:17:56,560 --> 03:17:58,469
that point whatever it takes just stick
around for one more second because the

11400
03:17:58,469 --> 03:17:58,479
around for one more second because the
 

11401
03:17:58,479 --> 03:18:00,469
around for one more second because the
next second you know

11402
03:18:00,469 --> 03:18:00,479
next second you know
 

11403
03:18:00,479 --> 03:18:01,590

03:20:10,239 --> 03:20:11,830
then
except for a moment

11528
03:20:11,830 --> 03:20:11,840
except for a moment
 

11529
03:20:11,840 --> 03:20:13,510
except for a moment
that maybe capitalism might be part of a

11530
03:20:13,510 --> 03:20:13,520
that maybe capitalism might be part of a
 

11531
03:20:13,520 --> 03:20:14,630
that maybe capitalism might be part of a
solution

11532
03:20:14,630 --> 03:20:14,640
solution
 

11533
03:20:14,640 --> 03:20:16,389
solution
when many of them were involved in

11534
03:20:16,389 --> 03:20:16,399
when many of them were involved in
 

11535
03:20:16,399 --> 03:20:18,150
when many of them were involved in
capitalism

11536
03:20:18,150 --> 03:20:18,160
capitalism
 

11537
03:20:18,160 --> 03:20:19,670
capitalism
so um

11538
03:20:19,670 --> 03:20:19,680
so um
 

11539
03:20:19,680 --> 03:20:22,309
so um
that was a hard time

11540
03:20:22,309 --> 03:20:22,319
that was a hard time
 

11541
03:20:22,319 --> 03:20:24,790
that was a hard time
at some point i was um

11542
03:20:24,790 --> 03:20:24,800
at some point i was um
 

11543
03:20:24,800 --> 03:20:26,389
at some point i was um
yeah so many things were happening

11544
03:20:26,389 --> 03:20:26,399
yeah so many things were happening
 

11545
03:20:26,399 --> 03:20:29,830
yeah so many things were happening
around that time that basically shook

11546
03:20:29,830 --> 03:20:29,840
around that time that basically shook
 

11547
03:20:29,840 --> 03:20:31,590
around that time that basically shook
up

11548
03:20:31,590 --> 03:20:31,600
up
 

11549
03:20:31,600 --> 03:20:33,429

everything for me

11550
03:20:33,429 --> 03:20:33,439
everything for me
 

11551
03:20:33,439 --> 03:20:34,870
everything for me
one it's hard to talk about because it's

11552
03:20:34,870 --> 03:20:34,880
one it's hard to talk about because it's
 

11553
03:20:34,880 --> 03:20:36,950
one it's hard to talk about because it's
very personal and the person that i that

11554
03:20:36,950 --> 03:20:36,960
very personal and the person that i that
 

11555
03:20:36,960 --> 03:20:39,030
very personal and the person that i that
was but i but i was having a problem

11556
03:20:39,030 --> 03:20:39,040
was but i but i was having a problem
 

11557
03:20:39,040 --> 03:20:41,590
was but i but i was having a problem
with passed away last year

11558
03:20:41,590 --> 03:20:41,600
with passed away last year
 

11559
03:20:41,600 --> 03:20:43,990
with passed away last year
and i'm one to always say

03:20:45,760 --> 03:20:46,550
leave the dead alone
so

11564
03:20:46,550 --> 03:20:46,560
so
 

11565
03:20:46,560 --> 03:20:48,550
so
because of that i won't speak about it

11566
03:20:48,550 --> 03:20:48,560
because of that i won't speak about it
 

11567
03:20:48,560 --> 03:20:50,870
because of that i won't speak about it
but there too having a major fallout

11568
03:20:50,870 --> 03:20:50,880
but there too having a major fallout
 

11569
03:20:50,880 --> 03:20:52,309
but there too having a major fallout
with somebody who was like a favorite

11570
03:20:52,309 --> 03:20:52,319
with somebody who was like a favorite
 

11571
03:20:52,319 --> 03:20:54,309

trusted
and so

11576
03:20:57,269 --> 03:20:57,279
and so
 

11577
03:20:57,279 --> 03:20:59,110

and then i started to
 

11893
03:26:17,200 --> 03:26:19,429
and then i started to
but had those ideas with the ideas that
