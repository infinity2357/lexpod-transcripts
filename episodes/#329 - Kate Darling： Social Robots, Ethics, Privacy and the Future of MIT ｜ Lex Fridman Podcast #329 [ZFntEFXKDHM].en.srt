thought experiment when we're thinking

4
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:05,460
thought experiment when we're thinking
 

5
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:08,150
thought experiment when we're thinking
about Ai and Robotics because again this

6
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:08,160
about Ai and Robotics because again this
 

7
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,950

comparing them to humans that leads us

8
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:09,960
comparing them to humans that leads us
 

9
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,870
comparing them to humans that leads us
down the wrong path both because it's

10
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:11,880
down the wrong path both because it's
 

11
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,669
down the wrong path both because it's
not accurate but also I think for the

12
00:00:13,669 --> 00:00:13,679
not accurate but also I think for the
 

13
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:15,950
not accurate but also I think for the
future we don't want that

14
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:15,960
future we don't want that
 

15
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,510
future we don't want that
we want something that's a supplement

16
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:17,520
we want something that's a supplement
 

17
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,090
we want something that's a supplement
but I think animals because we've used

18
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:20,100
but I think animals because we've used
 

19
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,590
but I think animals because we've used
them throughout history for so many

20
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:21,600
them throughout history for so many
 

21
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,750
them throughout history for so many
different things we we domesticated them

22
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:23,760
different things we we domesticated them
 

23
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,250
different things we we domesticated them
not because they do what we do but

24
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:25,260
not because they do what we do but
 

25
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,170
not because they do what we do but
because what they do is different and

26
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:27,180
because what they do is different and
 

27
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:30,410
because what they do is different and
that's useful and I it's just like

00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:30,420
that's useful and I it's just like
 

29

history with animals reveals about our
future with robots

168
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:10,980
future with robots
 

169
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:13,790
future with robots
you open the book with the surprisingly

170
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:13,800
you open the book with the surprisingly
 

171
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,610
you open the book with the surprisingly
tricky question what is a robot so let

172
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:16,620
tricky question what is a robot so let
 

173
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:18,229
tricky question what is a robot so let
me ask you let's try to sneak up to this

174
00:03:18,229 --> 00:03:18,239
me ask you let's try to sneak up to this
 

175
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,170
me ask you let's try to sneak up to this
question what's a robot that's not

176
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:21,180
question what's a robot that's not
 

177
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,610
question what's a robot that's not
really sneaking up

178
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:22,620
really sneaking up
 

179
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:26,949
really sneaking up
it's just asking it yeah all right well

180
00:03:26,949 --> 00:03:26,959
it's just asking it yeah all right well
 

181
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,050
it's just asking it yeah all right well
what do you think a robot is what I

182
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:30,060
what do you think a robot is what I
 

183
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:34,430
what do you think a robot is what I
think a robot is is something that has

184
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:34,440
think a robot is is something that has
 

185
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,509
think a robot is is something that has
some level of intelligence

186
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:37,519
some level of intelligence
 

187
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:41,570
some level of intelligence
and some level of magic

188
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:41,580
and some level of magic
 

189
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:43,670
and some level of magic
that little shine in the eye you know

190
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:43,680
that little shine in the eye you know
 

191
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,210
that little shine in the eye you know
that allows you to navigate the

192
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:47,220
that allows you to navigate the
 

193
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:50,930
that allows you to navigate the
uncertainty of uh of life so that means

194
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:50,940
uncertainty of uh of life so that means
 

195
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:53,030
uncertainty of uh of life so that means
like autonomous vehicles to me in that

196
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:53,040
like autonomous vehicles to me in that
 

197
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,490
like autonomous vehicles to me in that
sense uh are robots because they

198
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:55,500
sense uh are robots because they
 

199
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,170
sense uh are robots because they
navigate

200
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:57,180
navigate
 

201
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:59,390
navigate
uh the uncertainty the complexity of

202
00:03:59,390 --> 00:03:59,400
uh the uncertainty the complexity of
 

203
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,289
uh the uncertainty the complexity of
life

204
00:04:00,289 --> 00:04:00,299
life
 

205
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:03,050
life
obviously social robots are that I love

206
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:03,060
obviously social robots are that I love
 

207
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:03,890
obviously social robots are that I love
that

208
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:03,900
that
 

209
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,390
that
I like that you mentioned magic because

210
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:05,400
I like that you mentioned magic because
 

211
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,949
I like that you mentioned magic because
that also

212
00:04:06,949 --> 00:04:06,959
that also
 

213
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:08,930
that also
well so first of all I don't Define

214
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:08,940
well so first of all I don't Define
 

215
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:11,149
well so first of all I don't Define
robot definitively in the book because

216
00:04:11,149 --> 00:04:11,159
robot definitively in the book because
 

217
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:14,030
robot definitively in the book because
there is no definitely that everyone

218
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:14,040
there is no definitely that everyone
 

219
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,670
there is no definitely that everyone
agrees on and if you look back through

220
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:16,680
agrees on and if you look back through
 

221
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,229
agrees on and if you look back through
time

222
00:04:18,229 --> 00:04:18,239
time
 

223
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:20,870
time
people have called things robots until

224
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:20,880
people have called things robots until
 

225
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,730
people have called things robots until
they lose the magic because they're more

226
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:22,740
they lose the magic because they're more
 

227
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,530
they lose the magic because they're more
ubiquitous like a vending machine used

228
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:24,540
ubiquitous like a vending machine used
 

229
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,270
ubiquitous like a vending machine used
to be called a robot and now it's not

230
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:26,280
to be called a robot and now it's not
 

231
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,490
to be called a robot and now it's not
right so I do agree with you that

232
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:28,500
right so I do agree with you that
 

233
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,850
right so I do agree with you that
there's this magic aspect that

234
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:31,860
there's this magic aspect that
 

235
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:34,129
there's this magic aspect that
that which is how people understand

236
00:04:34,129 --> 00:04:34,139
that which is how people understand
 

237
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:35,629
that which is how people understand
robots

238
00:04:35,629 --> 00:04:35,639
robots
 

239
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:37,790
robots
if you ask a roboticist they have the

240
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:37,800
if you ask a roboticist they have the
 

241
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,010
if you ask a roboticist they have the
definition of something that is well it

242
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:40,020
definition of something that is well it
 

243
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,749
definition of something that is well it
has to be physical usually it's not an

244
00:04:41,749 --> 00:04:41,759
has to be physical usually it's not an
 

245
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,530
has to be physical usually it's not an
AI agent it has to be embodied

246
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:45,540
AI agent it has to be embodied
 

247
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:47,150
AI agent it has to be embodied
um they'll say it has to be able to

248
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:47,160
um they'll say it has to be able to
 

249
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,310
um they'll say it has to be able to
sense this environment in some way it

250
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:49,320
sense this environment in some way it
 

251
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,650
sense this environment in some way it
has to be able to make a decision

252
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:51,660
has to be able to make a decision
 

253
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,629
has to be able to make a decision
autonomously and then act on its

254
00:04:53,629 --> 00:04:53,639
autonomously and then act on its
 

255
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:55,010
autonomously and then act on its
environment again

256
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:55,020
environment again
 

257
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,710
environment again
I think that's a pretty good technical

258
00:04:57,710 --> 00:04:57,720
I think that's a pretty good technical
 

259
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,570
I think that's a pretty good technical
definition even though it really breaks

260
00:04:59,570 --> 00:04:59,580
definition even though it really breaks
 

261
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:01,430
definition even though it really breaks
down when you come to things like the

262
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:01,440
down when you come to things like the
 

263
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,170
down when you come to things like the
smartphone because the smartphone can do

264
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:03,180
smartphone because the smartphone can do
 

265
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:05,510
smartphone because the smartphone can do
all of those things and most robotics

266
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:05,520
all of those things and most robotics
 

267
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,610
all of those things and most robotics
would not call it a robot so there's

268
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:07,620
would not call it a robot so there's
 

269
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,890
would not call it a robot so there's
really no no one good definition but

270
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:09,900
really no no one good definition but
 

271
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:13,550
really no no one good definition but
part of why I wrote the book is because

272
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:13,560
part of why I wrote the book is because
 

273
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,610
part of why I wrote the book is because
people have a definition of robot in

274
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:16,620
people have a definition of robot in
 

275
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:19,189
people have a definition of robot in
their minds that is

276
00:05:19,189 --> 00:05:19,199
their minds that is
 

277
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,189
their minds that is
usually very focused on a comparison of

278
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:22,199
usually very focused on a comparison of
 

279
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:24,350
usually very focused on a comparison of
robots to humans so if you Google image

280
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:24,360
robots to humans so if you Google image
 

281
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,629
robots to humans so if you Google image
search robot you get a bunch of humanoid

282
00:05:26,629 --> 00:05:26,639
search robot you get a bunch of humanoid
 

283
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,430
search robot you get a bunch of humanoid
robots robots with that torso and head

284
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:28,440
robots robots with that torso and head
 

285
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,710
robots robots with that torso and head
and two arms and two legs

286
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:30,720
and two arms and two legs
 

287
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,270
and two arms and two legs
and that's

288
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:32,280
and that's
 

289
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,550
and that's
the definition of robot that I'm trying

290
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:34,560
the definition of robot that I'm trying
 

291
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,469
the definition of robot that I'm trying
to get us away from because I think that

292
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:36,479
to get us away from because I think that
 

293
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,629
to get us away from because I think that
it trips us up a lot why does the

294
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:38,639
it trips us up a lot why does the
 

295
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,969
it trips us up a lot why does the
humanoid form trip us up a lot well

296
00:05:40,969 --> 00:05:40,979
humanoid form trip us up a lot well
 

297
00:05:40,979 --> 00:05:43,189
humanoid form trip us up a lot well
because this constant comparison of

298
00:05:43,189 --> 00:05:43,199
because this constant comparison of
 

299
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,950
because this constant comparison of
robots to people artificial intelligence

300
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:45,960
robots to people artificial intelligence
 

301

to human intelligence
 

303
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,129
to human intelligence
first of all it doesn't make sense from

304
00:05:49,129 --> 00:05:49,139
first of all it doesn't make sense from
 

305
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:51,770
first of all it doesn't make sense from
a technical perspective because

306
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:51,780
a technical perspective because
 

307
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:54,350
a technical perspective because
you know the early AI researchers some

308
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:54,360
you know the early AI researchers some
 

309
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,270
you know the early AI researchers some
of them were trying to recreate human

310
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:56,280
of them were trying to recreate human
 

311
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,890
of them were trying to recreate human
intelligence some people still are and

intelligence some people still are and
 

313
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,510
intelligence some people still are and
there's a lot to be learned from that

there's a lot to be learned from that

00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,790
there's a lot to be learned from that
academically Etc but

academically Etc but
 

317
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,650
academically Etc but
um that's not where We've Ended up AI

318
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:03,660
um that's not where We've Ended up AI
 

319
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:06,230
um that's not where We've Ended up AI
doesn't think like people we wind up in

320
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:06,240
doesn't think like people we wind up in
 

321
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,510
doesn't think like people we wind up in
this fallacy where we're where we're

this fallacy where we're where we're
 

323
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,670
this fallacy where we're where we're
comparing these two

comparing these two
 

325
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,830
comparing these two
um and we're when we talk about what

326
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:12,840
um and we're when we talk about what
 

327
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,510
um and we're when we talk about what
intelligence even is we're often

328
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:14,520
intelligence even is we're often
 

329
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,249
intelligence even is we're often
comparing to our own intelligence and

330
00:06:16,249 --> 00:06:16,259
comparing to our own intelligence and
 

331
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:16,969
comparing to our own intelligence and
then

332
00:06:16,969 --> 00:06:16,979
then
 

333
00:06:16,979 --> 00:06:19,550
then
the second reason this bothers me is

334
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:19,560
the second reason this bothers me is
 

335
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,129
the second reason this bothers me is
because it doesn't make sense

336
00:06:22,129 --> 00:06:22,139
because it doesn't make sense
 

337
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:24,770
because it doesn't make sense
I I just think it's boring to recreate

338
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:24,780
I I just think it's boring to recreate
 

339
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:27,110
I I just think it's boring to recreate
intelligence that we already have I see

340
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:27,120
intelligence that we already have I see
 

341
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,790
intelligence that we already have I see
the scientific value of understanding

342
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:28,800
the scientific value of understanding
 

343
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,370
the scientific value of understanding
our own intelligence but from a like

344
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:31,380
our own intelligence but from a like
 

345
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:33,409
our own intelligence but from a like
practical what can we use these

346
00:06:33,409 --> 00:06:33,419
practical what can we use these
 

347
00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:36,469
practical what can we use these
Technologies for perspective it's much

348
00:06:36,469 --> 00:06:36,479
Technologies for perspective it's much
 

349
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,450
Technologies for perspective it's much
more interesting to create something new

350
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:38,460
more interesting to create something new
 

351
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,610
more interesting to create something new
to create a skill set that we don't have

352
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:40,620
to create a skill set that we don't have
 

353
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:42,350
to create a skill set that we don't have
that we can partner with and what we're

354
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:42,360
that we can partner with and what we're
 

355
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,510
that we can partner with and what we're
trying to achieve

356
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:44,520
trying to achieve
 

357
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:47,330
trying to achieve
and it should be in some deep way

358
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:47,340
and it should be in some deep way
 

359
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:50,650
and it should be in some deep way
similar to us but in most ways different

360
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:50,660
similar to us but in most ways different
 

361
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,550
similar to us but in most ways different
because you still want to have a

362
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:52,560
because you still want to have a
 

363
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,830
because you still want to have a
connection which is why the similarity

364
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:54,840
connection which is why the similarity
 

365
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,469
connection which is why the similarity
might be necessary that's what people

366
00:06:57,469 --> 00:06:57,479
might be necessary that's what people
 

367
00:06:57,479 --> 00:06:59,990
might be necessary that's what people
argue yes and I think that's true so the

368
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:00,000
argue yes and I think that's true so the
 

369
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,990
argue yes and I think that's true so the
two arguments for humanoid robots are

370
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:03,000
two arguments for humanoid robots are
 

371
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,450
two arguments for humanoid robots are
people need to be able to communicate

372
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:05,460
people need to be able to communicate
 

373
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:08,270
people need to be able to communicate
and relate to robots and we relate most

374
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:08,280
and relate to robots and we relate most
 

375
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,249
and relate to robots and we relate most
to things that are like ourselves

376
00:07:10,249 --> 00:07:10,259
to things that are like ourselves
 

377
00:07:10,259 --> 00:07:12,110
to things that are like ourselves
and we have a world that's built for

378
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:12,120
and we have a world that's built for
 

379
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,029
and we have a world that's built for
humans so we have stairs and narrow

380
00:07:14,029 --> 00:07:14,039
humans so we have stairs and narrow
 

381
00:07:14,039 --> 00:07:16,070
humans so we have stairs and narrow
passageways and door handles and so we

382
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:16,080
passageways and door handles and so we
 

383
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,450
passageways and door handles and so we
need humanoid robots to be able to

384
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:17,460
need humanoid robots to be able to
 

385
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:20,809
need humanoid robots to be able to
navigate that and so you're speaking to

386
00:07:20,809 --> 00:07:20,819
navigate that and so you're speaking to
 

387
00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:22,790
navigate that and so you're speaking to
the first one which is absolutely true

388
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:22,800
the first one which is absolutely true
 

389
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,469
the first one which is absolutely true
but what we know from social Robotics

390
00:07:24,469 --> 00:07:24,479
but what we know from social Robotics
 

391
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:25,790
but what we know from social Robotics
and a lot of human robot interaction

392
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:25,800
and a lot of human robot interaction
 

393
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,390
and a lot of human robot interaction
research is that you all you need is

394
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:29,400
research is that you all you need is
 

395
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,370
research is that you all you need is
something that's enough like

396
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:31,380
something that's enough like
 

397
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:34,850
something that's enough like
a person to for it to give off cues that

398
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:34,860
a person to for it to give off cues that
 

399
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,830
a person to for it to give off cues that
someone relates to and that but that

400
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:36,840
someone relates to and that but that
 

401
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,170
someone relates to and that but that
doesn't have to look human or even act

402
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:39,180
doesn't have to look human or even act
 

403
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:42,350
doesn't have to look human or even act
human you can take a robot like R2D2 and

404
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:42,360
human you can take a robot like R2D2 and
 

405
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,570
human you can take a robot like R2D2 and
it just like beeps and boops and people

406
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:44,580
it just like beeps and boops and people
 

407
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,309
it just like beeps and boops and people
love R2D2 right even though it's just

408
00:07:46,309 --> 00:07:46,319
love R2D2 right even though it's just
 

409
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,469
love R2D2 right even though it's just
like a trash can on Wheels and they like

410
00:07:48,469 --> 00:07:48,479
like a trash can on Wheels and they like
 

411
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,870
like a trash can on Wheels and they like
r2dging more than C-3PO who's a humanoid

412
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:50,880
r2dging more than C-3PO who's a humanoid
 

413
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:54,469
r2dging more than C-3PO who's a humanoid
so there's lots of there's lots of ways

414
00:07:54,469 --> 00:07:54,479
so there's lots of there's lots of ways
 

415
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:57,230
so there's lots of there's lots of ways
to make robots even better than humans

416
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:57,240
to make robots even better than humans
 

417
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,390
to make robots even better than humans
in some ways and make us relate more to

418
00:07:59,390 --> 00:07:59,400
in some ways and make us relate more to
 

419
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,050
in some ways and make us relate more to
them

420
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:00,060
them
 

421
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,930
them
yeah it's kind of amazing the variety of

422
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:02,940
yeah it's kind of amazing the variety of
 

423
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,210
yeah it's kind of amazing the variety of
cues that can be used to

424
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:04,220
cues that can be used to
 

425
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:06,469
cues that can be used to
anthropomorphize the thing like a

426
00:08:06,469 --> 00:08:06,479
anthropomorphize the thing like a
 

427
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,689
anthropomorphize the thing like a
glowing orb or something like that yeah

428
00:08:08,689 --> 00:08:08,699
glowing orb or something like that yeah
 

429
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:10,909
glowing orb or something like that yeah
just just a voice

430
00:08:10,909 --> 00:08:10,919
just just a voice
 

431
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:14,570
just just a voice
just uh just subtle basic interaction I

432
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:14,580
just uh just subtle basic interaction I
 

433
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:16,249
just uh just subtle basic interaction I
think people sometimes over engineer

434
00:08:16,249 --> 00:08:16,259
think people sometimes over engineer
 

435
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:17,270
think people sometimes over engineer
these things

436
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:17,280
these things
 

437
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,550
these things
like Simplicity can go a really long way

438
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:19,560
like Simplicity can go a really long way
 

439
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,950
like Simplicity can go a really long way
totally I mean ask any animator and

440
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:21,960
totally I mean ask any animator and
 

441
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,990
totally I mean ask any animator and
they'll know that yeah yeah those are

442
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:24,000
they'll know that yeah yeah those are
 

443
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,409
they'll know that yeah yeah those are
actually so the people behind Cosmo the

444
00:08:27,409 --> 00:08:27,419
actually so the people behind Cosmo the
 

445
00:08:27,419 --> 00:08:28,189
actually so the people behind Cosmo the
um

446
00:08:28,189 --> 00:08:28,199
um
 

447
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:30,529
um
the the robot

448
00:08:30,529 --> 00:08:30,539
the the robot
 

449
00:08:30,539 --> 00:08:32,449
the the robot
the right people to design those as

450
00:08:32,449 --> 00:08:32,459
the right people to design those as
 

451
00:08:32,459 --> 00:08:35,329
the right people to design those as
animators like Disney type of people

452
00:08:35,329 --> 00:08:35,339
animators like Disney type of people
 

453
00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:38,930
animators like Disney type of people
yeah versus like roboticists robotics is

454
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:38,940
yeah versus like roboticists robotics is
 

455
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:43,269
yeah versus like roboticists robotics is

00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:45,540
they just have their own discipline that
 

459
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:47,030

don't you know I feel like robotics

464
00:08:53,329 --> 00:08:53,339
don't you know I feel like robotics
 

465
00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:56,990
don't you know I feel like robotics
of the early 21st century

466
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:57,000
of the early 21st century
 

467
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,630
of the early 21st century
is not going to be the robotics of the

468
00:08:59,630 --> 00:08:59,640
is not going to be the robotics of the
 

469
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,790
is not going to be the robotics of the
later 21st century I don't know like if

470
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:01,800
later 21st century I don't know like if
 

471
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,889
later 21st century I don't know like if
you call yourself a roboticist it'll be

472
00:09:03,889 --> 00:09:03,899
you call yourself a roboticist it'll be
 

473
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:06,650
you call yourself a roboticist it'll be
something very different because I I

474
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:06,660
something very different because I I
 

475
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:09,889
something very different because I I
think more and more you'd be like a

476
00:09:09,889 --> 00:09:09,899
think more and more you'd be like a
 

477
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:12,110
think more and more you'd be like a
maybe like a control engineer or

478
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:12,120
maybe like a control engineer or
 

479
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:15,050
maybe like a control engineer or
something controls engineer like uh you

480
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:15,060
something controls engineer like uh you
 

481
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:18,110
something controls engineer like uh you
separate because ultimately all the

482
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:18,120
separate because ultimately all the
 

483
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,810
separate because ultimately all the

not the basic control level part
 

497
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,889
not the basic control level part
you call it basic it's actually

498
00:09:39,889 --> 00:09:39,899
you call it basic it's actually
 

499
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:41,630
you call it basic it's actually
right like it's very very complicated

500
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:41,640
right like it's very very complicated
 

501
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,610
right like it's very very complicated
and that's why but like I think you're

502
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:43,620
and that's why but like I think you're
 

503
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:46,070
and that's why but like I think you're
so right and and and what a time to be

504
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:46,080
so right and and and what a time to be
 

505
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,290
so right and and and what a time to be
alive because

506
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:48,300
alive because
 

507
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,509
alive because
for me I just

508
00:09:50,509 --> 00:09:50,519
for me I just
 

509
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:52,490
for me I just
we've had robots for so long and they've

510
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:52,500
we've had robots for so long and they've
 

511
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,230
we've had robots for so long and they've
just been behind the scenes

512
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:54,240
just been behind the scenes
 

513
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,410
just been behind the scenes
and now finally robots are getting

514
00:09:57,410 --> 00:09:57,420
and now finally robots are getting
 

515
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:59,090
and now finally robots are getting
deployed into the world they're coming

516
00:09:59,090 --> 00:09:59,100
deployed into the world they're coming
 

517
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,310
deployed into the world they're coming
out of the closet yeah and and we're

518
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:01,320
out of the closet yeah and and we're
 

519
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,750
out of the closet yeah and and we're
seeing all these mistakes that companies

520
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:02,760
seeing all these mistakes that companies
 

521
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,030
seeing all these mistakes that companies
are making because they focus so much on

522
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:05,040
are making because they focus so much on
 

523
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,650
are making because they focus so much on
the engineering and getting that right

524
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:06,660
the engineering and getting that right
 

525
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,329
the engineering and getting that right
and getting the robot to be even be able

526
00:10:08,329 --> 00:10:08,339
and getting the robot to be even be able
 

527
00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:11,269
and getting the robot to be even be able
to function in a space that it shares

528
00:10:11,269 --> 00:10:11,279
to function in a space that it shares
 

529
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:14,090
to function in a space that it shares
with a human see what I feel like people

530
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:14,100
with a human see what I feel like people
 

531
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,410
with a human see what I feel like people
don't understand

532
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:15,420
don't understand
 

533
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,570
don't understand
is to solve the perception and the

534
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:17,580
is to solve the perception and the
 

535
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:18,949
is to solve the perception and the
control problem

536
00:10:18,949 --> 00:10:18,959
control problem
 

537
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,350
control problem
you shouldn't try to just solve the

538
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:21,360
you shouldn't try to just solve the
 

539
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,930
you shouldn't try to just solve the
perception control problem you should

540
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:23,940
perception control problem you should
 

541
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:26,329
perception control problem you should
teach the robot how to say oh [\h__\h] I'm

542
00:10:26,329 --> 00:10:26,339
teach the robot how to say oh [\h__\h] I'm
 

543
00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:29,090
teach the robot how to say oh [\h__\h] I'm
sorry I [\h__\h] up yeah or ask for help

544
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:29,100
sorry I [\h__\h] up yeah or ask for help
 

545
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,329
sorry I [\h__\h] up yeah or ask for help
oh for ask for help or be able to

546
00:10:31,329 --> 00:10:31,339
oh for ask for help or be able to
 

547
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:35,389
oh for ask for help or be able to
communicate the uncertainty yeah exactly

548
00:10:35,389 --> 00:10:35,399
communicate the uncertainty yeah exactly
 

549
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:36,889
communicate the uncertainty yeah exactly
all of those things because you can't

550
00:10:36,889 --> 00:10:36,899
all of those things because you can't
 

551
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:39,650
all of those things because you can't
solve the perception control we humans

552
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:39,660
solve the perception control we humans
 

553
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,930
solve the perception control we humans
haven't solved it we were really damn

554
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:41,940
haven't solved it we were really damn
 

555
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,190
haven't solved it we were really damn
good at it

556
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:43,200
good at it
 

557
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,790
good at it
uh but the the magic is in the the

558
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:46,800
uh but the the magic is in the the
 

559
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,250
uh but the the magic is in the the
self-deprecating humor and the

560
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:49,260
self-deprecating humor and the
 

561
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:51,110
self-deprecating humor and the
self-awareness about where our flaws are

562
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:51,120
self-awareness about where our flaws are
 

563
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,490
self-awareness about where our flaws are
all that kind of stuff

564
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:52,500
all that kind of stuff
 

565
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,230
all that kind of stuff
yeah and there's a whole body of

566
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:54,240
yeah and there's a whole body of
 

567
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,990
yeah and there's a whole body of
research in human robot interaction

568
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:56,000
research in human robot interaction
 

569
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,449
research in human robot interaction
showing like ways to do this but a lot

570
00:10:59,449 --> 00:10:59,459
showing like ways to do this but a lot
 

571
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:01,190
showing like ways to do this but a lot
of these companies haven't they don't do

572
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:01,200
of these companies haven't they don't do
 

573
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,490
of these companies haven't they don't do
HRI they like the have you seen the

the aisles I will never see marketing

582
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:13,260
the aisles I will never see marketing
 

583
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:15,050
the aisles I will never see marketing

but like
they they these poor people were so hard

590
00:11:20,509 --> 00:11:20,519
they they these poor people were so hard
 

591
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:22,509
they they these poor people were so hard
on getting a functional robot together

592
00:11:22,509 --> 00:11:22,519
on getting a functional robot together
 

593
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:25,550
on getting a functional robot together
and then people hate Marty because they

594
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:25,560
and then people hate Marty because they
 

595
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,389
and then people hate Marty because they
didn't

596
00:11:26,389 --> 00:11:26,399
didn't
 

597
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,210
didn't
at all consider how people would react

598
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:29,220
at all consider how people would react
 

599
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,730
at all consider how people would react
to Marty in their space does everybody I

600
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:31,740
to Marty in their space does everybody I
 

601
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:33,530
to Marty in their space does everybody I
mean you talk about this do do people

602
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:33,540
mean you talk about this do do people
 

603
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:35,569
mean you talk about this do do people
mostly hate Marty because I I like I

604
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:35,579
mostly hate Marty because I I like I
 

605
00:11:35,579 --> 00:11:38,290
mostly hate Marty because I I like I
like Mario

606
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:38,300

 

607
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:41,630

yeah and actually like there's a there's

608
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:41,640
yeah and actually like there's a there's
 

609
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,790
yeah and actually like there's a there's
a parallel between the two I believe

610
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:43,800
a parallel between the two I believe
 

611
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,230
a parallel between the two I believe
there is so we were actually going to do

612
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:45,240
there is so we were actually going to do
 

613
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,670
there is so we were actually going to do
a study on this right before the

614
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:46,680
a study on this right before the
 

615
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,350
a study on this right before the
pandemic hit and then we canceled it

616
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:48,360
pandemic hit and then we canceled it
 

617
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,430
pandemic hit and then we canceled it
because we didn't want to go to the

618
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:49,440
because we didn't want to go to the
 

619
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,110
because we didn't want to go to the
grocery store and neither did anyone

620
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:51,120
grocery store and neither did anyone
 

621
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:51,829
grocery store and neither did anyone
else

622
00:11:51,829 --> 00:11:51,839
else
 

623
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:55,190
else
um but our Theory so this was with a

624
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:55,200
um but our Theory so this was with a
 

625
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,370
um but our Theory so this was with a
student at MIT Daniella de Paola she

626
00:11:58,370 --> 00:11:58,380
student at MIT Daniella de Paola she
 

627
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:00,650
student at MIT Daniella de Paola she
noticed that everyone on Facebook in her

628
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:00,660
noticed that everyone on Facebook in her
 

629
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:02,389
noticed that everyone on Facebook in her
circles was complaining about Marty

630
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:02,399
circles was complaining about Marty
 

631
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,670
circles was complaining about Marty
they're like what is this creepy robot

632
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:04,680
they're like what is this creepy robot
 

633
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,230
they're like what is this creepy robot
is watching me it's always in the way

634
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:06,240
is watching me it's always in the way
 

635
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,569
is watching me it's always in the way
and she did this like quick and dirty

636
00:12:08,569 --> 00:12:08,579
and she did this like quick and dirty
 

637
00:12:08,579 --> 00:12:10,550
and she did this like quick and dirty
sentiment analysis on Twitter where she

638
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:10,560
sentiment analysis on Twitter where she
 

639
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,930
sentiment analysis on Twitter where she
was looking at positive and negative

640
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:11,940
was looking at positive and negative
 

641
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,750
was looking at positive and negative
mentions of the robot and she found that

642
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:14,760
mentions of the robot and she found that
 

643
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,790
mentions of the robot and she found that
the biggest Spike of negative mentions

644

as social Asians and not objects and
 

765
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:44,150
as social Asians and not objects and
that was

766
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:44,160
that was
 

767
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,610
that was
um so Clifford nass was a big human

768
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:46,620
um so Clifford nass was a big human
 

769
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:49,790
um so Clifford nass was a big human
computer interaction person and he his

770
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:49,800
computer interaction person and he his
 

771
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,610
computer interaction person and he his
theory about Clippy was that because

772
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:52,620
theory about Clippy was that because
 

773
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:55,430
theory about Clippy was that because
people viewed clippy as a social agent

774
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:55,440
people viewed clippy as a social agent
 

775
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,590
people viewed clippy as a social agent
when clippy was annoying and would like

776
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:57,600
when clippy was annoying and would like
 

777
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,269
when clippy was annoying and would like
bother them and interrupt them and like

778
00:14:59,269 --> 00:14:59,279
bother them and interrupt them and like
 

779
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:02,449
bother them and interrupt them and like
not remember what they told him that's

780
00:15:02,449 --> 00:15:02,459
not remember what they told him that's
 

781
00:15:02,459 --> 00:15:04,370
not remember what they told him that's
when people got upset because it wasn't

782
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:04,380
when people got upset because it wasn't

when people got upset because it wasn't
fulfilling their social expectations and

784
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:06,600
fulfilling their social expectations and
 

785
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,689
fulfilling their social expectations and
so they complained about Clippy more

786
00:15:08,689 --> 00:15:08,699
so they complained about Clippy more
 

787
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:10,310
so they complained about Clippy more
than they would have if it had been a

788
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:10,320
than they would have if it had been a
 

789
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,490
than they would have if it had been a
diff like not an not a you know virtual

790
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:13,500
diff like not an not a you know virtual
 

791
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:16,430
diff like not an not a you know virtual
character so is complaining to you a

792
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:16,440

795
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,170

801
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:30,710
family that there still is a path
towards that direction where we can find

802
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:30,720
towards that direction where we can find
 

803
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,689
towards that direction where we can find
deep meaningful relationship

804
00:15:32,689 --> 00:15:32,699
deep meaningful relationship
 

805
00:15:32,699 --> 00:15:34,730
deep meaningful relationship
I think we absolutely can

806
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:34,740
I think we absolutely can
 

807
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,350
I think we absolutely can
meaningful relationships with more

808
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:36,360
meaningful relationships with more
 

809
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:39,230
meaningful relationships with more
robots and well maybe with Marty I mean

810
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:39,240
robots and well maybe with Marty I mean
 

811
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,329
robots and well maybe with Marty I mean
I just would I would have designed Marty

812
00:15:41,329 --> 00:15:41,339
I just would I would have designed Marty
 

813
00:15:41,339 --> 00:15:44,150
I just would I would have designed Marty
a little differently but oh isn't there

814
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:44,160
a little differently but oh isn't there
 

815
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,389
a little differently but oh isn't there
a charm to the clumsiness the slowness

816
00:15:46,389 --> 00:15:46,399
a charm to the clumsiness the slowness
 

817
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,410
a charm to the clumsiness the slowness
there is if you're not trying to get

818
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:48,420
there is if you're not trying to get
 

819
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,090
there is if you're not trying to get
through the shopping cart and screaming

820
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:50,100
through the shopping cart and screaming
 

821
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:53,210
through the shopping cart and screaming
child you know there's I think

822
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:53,220
child you know there's I think
 

823
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:55,310
child you know there's I think
I think you could make it Charming I

824
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:55,320
I think you could make it Charming I
 

825
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,990
I think you could make it Charming I
think there are lots of design tricks

826
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:57,000
think there are lots of design tricks
 

827
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,629
think there are lots of design tricks
that they could have used and one of the

828
00:15:59,629 --> 00:15:59,639
that they could have used and one of the
 

829
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:01,310
that they could have used and one of the
things they did I think without thinking

830
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:01,320
things they did I think without thinking
 

831
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,050
things they did I think without thinking
about it at all is they slapped too big

832
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:03,060
about it at all is they slapped too big
 

833
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:06,050
about it at all is they slapped too big
googly eyes on Marty oh yeah and I I

834
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:06,060
googly eyes on Marty oh yeah and I I
 

835
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:07,670
googly eyes on Marty oh yeah and I I
wonder if that contributed maybe to

836
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:07,680
wonder if that contributed maybe to
 

837
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,710
wonder if that contributed maybe to
people feeling watched

838
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:09,720
people feeling watched
 

839
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,610
people feeling watched
um

840
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:10,620
um
 

841
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:13,730
um
because because it's looking at them

842
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:13,740
because because it's looking at them
 

843
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,470
because because it's looking at them
and

844
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:15,480
and
 

845
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:18,170
and
so like is there a way to design the

846
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:18,180
so like is there a way to design the
 

847
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:20,509
so like is there a way to design the
robot to do the function that it's doing

848
00:16:20,509 --> 00:16:20,519
robot to do the function that it's doing
 

849
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:23,329
robot to do the function that it's doing
in a way that does that people are

850
00:16:23,329 --> 00:16:23,339
in a way that does that people are
 

851
00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:24,829
in a way that does that people are
actually attracted to rather than

852
00:16:24,829 --> 00:16:24,839
actually attracted to rather than
 

853
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:26,870
actually attracted to rather than
annoyed by and there are many ways to do

854
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:26,880
annoyed by and there are many ways to do
 

855
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,550
annoyed by and there are many ways to do
that but companies aren't thinking about

856
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:28,560
that but companies aren't thinking about
 

857
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,530
that but companies aren't thinking about
it now they're realizing that they

858
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:30,540
it now they're realizing that they
 

859
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:32,329
it now they're realizing that they
should have thought about it yeah I

860
00:16:32,329 --> 00:16:32,339
should have thought about it yeah I
 

861
00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:34,750
should have thought about it yeah I
wonder if there's a way to

862
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:34,760
wonder if there's a way to
 

863
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:38,389
wonder if there's a way to
if it would help to make Marty seem like

864
00:16:38,389 --> 00:16:38,399
if it would help to make Marty seem like
 

865
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:42,410
if it would help to make Marty seem like
an entity of its own versus uh

866
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:42,420
an entity of its own versus uh
 

867
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:45,829
an entity of its own versus uh
the arm of a large corporation

868
00:16:45,829 --> 00:16:45,839
the arm of a large corporation
 

869
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,650
the arm of a large corporation
so there's some sense where

870
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:48,660
so there's some sense where
 

871
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:51,170
so there's some sense where
this is just the camera that's

872
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:51,180
this is just the camera that's
 

873
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:54,110
this is just the camera that's
monitoring people versus this is an

874
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:54,120
monitoring people versus this is an
 

875
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,689
monitoring people versus this is an
entity that's a standalone entity it has

876
00:16:56,689 --> 00:16:56,699
entity that's a standalone entity it has
 

877
00:16:56,699 --> 00:16:57,949
entity that's a standalone entity it has
its own task

878
00:16:57,949 --> 00:16:57,959
its own task
 

879
00:16:57,959 --> 00:17:00,170
its own task
and it has its own personality the more

880
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:00,180
and it has its own personality the more
 

881
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:02,629
and it has its own personality the more
personality you give it the more it

882
00:17:02,629 --> 00:17:02,639
personality you give it the more it
 

883
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,850
personality you give it the more it
feels like

884
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:04,860
feels like
 

885
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:07,130
feels like
it's not sharing data with anybody else

886
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:07,140
it's not sharing data with anybody else
 

887
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:08,449
it's not sharing data with anybody else
like

888
00:17:08,449 --> 00:17:08,459
like
 

889
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:11,329
like
when we see other human beings our basic

890
00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:11,339
when we see other human beings our basic
 

891
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:13,669
when we see other human beings our basic
assumption is whatever I say to this

892
00:17:13,669 --> 00:17:13,679
assumption is whatever I say to this
 

893
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:15,169
assumption is whatever I say to this
human being it's not like being

894
00:17:15,169 --> 00:17:15,179
human being it's not like being
 

895
00:17:15,179 --> 00:17:18,049
human being it's not like being
immediately sent to the CIA yeah what I

896
00:17:18,049 --> 00:17:18,059
immediately sent to the CIA yeah what I
 

897
00:17:18,059 --> 00:17:19,490
immediately sent to the CIA yeah what I
say to you no one's gonna hear that

898
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:19,500
say to you no one's gonna hear that
 

899
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,250
say to you no one's gonna hear that
right yeah that's true that's true well

900
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:22,260
right yeah that's true that's true well
 

901
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:23,990
right yeah that's true that's true well
you forget it I mean you do forget it I

902
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:24,000
you forget it I mean you do forget it I
 

903
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,490
you forget it I mean you do forget it I
mean I don't know if that even with

904
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:25,500
mean I don't know if that even with
 

905
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,409
mean I don't know if that even with
microphones here you forget that that's

906
00:17:27,409 --> 00:17:27,419
microphones here you forget that that's
 

907
00:17:27,419 --> 00:17:29,570
microphones here you forget that that's
happening but there for some reason I

908
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:29,580
happening but there for some reason I
 

909
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:32,630
happening but there for some reason I
think probably with Marty

910
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:32,640
think probably with Marty
 

911
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,150
think probably with Marty
um I think when it's done really crudely

912
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:35,160
um I think when it's done really crudely
 

913
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:38,029
um I think when it's done really crudely
and crappily you start to realize oh

914
00:17:38,029 --> 00:17:38,039
and crappily you start to realize oh
 

915
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:41,450
and crappily you start to realize oh
this is like PR people trying to make a

916
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:41,460
this is like PR people trying to make a
 

917
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:44,450
this is like PR people trying to make a
friendly version of a surveillance

918
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:44,460
friendly version of a surveillance
 

919
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:47,270
friendly version of a surveillance
machine but

920
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:47,280
machine but
 

921
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,370
machine but
um I mean that reminds me of the slight

922
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:49,380
um I mean that reminds me of the slight
 

923
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:52,610
um I mean that reminds me of the slight
clumsiness or significant clumsiness on

924
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:52,620
clumsiness or significant clumsiness on
 

925
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:54,590
clumsiness or significant clumsiness on
the initial releases of the avatars for

926
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:54,600
the initial releases of the avatars for
 

927
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,750
the initial releases of the avatars for
the metaverse I don't know what what do

928
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:56,760
the metaverse I don't know what what do
 

929
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,010
the metaverse I don't know what what do
you what are your actually thoughts

930
00:17:58,010 --> 00:17:58,020
you what are your actually thoughts
 

931
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:00,470
you what are your actually thoughts
about that the the

932
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:00,480
about that the the
 

933
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,150
about that the the
way

934
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:02,160
way
 

935
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,870
way
uh the avatars the way like Mark

936
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:05,880
uh the avatars the way like Mark
 

937
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:09,049
uh the avatars the way like Mark
Zuckerberg looks in that world you know

938
00:18:09,049 --> 00:18:09,059
Zuckerberg looks in that world you know
 

939
00:18:09,059 --> 00:18:11,690
Zuckerberg looks in that world you know
the the the the meta verse the virtual

940
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:11,700
the the the the meta verse the virtual
 

941
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,010
the the the the meta verse the virtual
reality world where you can have like

942
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:13,020
reality world where you can have like
 

943
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,390
reality world where you can have like
virtual meetings and stuff like that

944
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:14,400
virtual meetings and stuff like that
 

945
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,610
virtual meetings and stuff like that
like how do we get that right do you

946
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:16,620
like how do we get that right do you
 

947
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:17,630
like how do we get that right do you
have thoughts about that because that's

948
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:17,640
have thoughts about that because that's
 

949
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,549
have thoughts about that because that's
the kind of uh

950
00:18:19,549 --> 00:18:19,559
the kind of uh
 

951
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:21,470
the kind of uh
it's a

00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:21,480
it's a
 

953
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:24,110
it's a
is it feels like a similar problem to

954
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:24,120
is it feels like a similar problem to
 

955
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:27,350
is it feels like a similar problem to
social robotics which is how you design

956
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:27,360
social robotics which is how you design
 

957
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:31,730
social robotics which is how you design
a digital virtual world that is

958
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:31,740
a digital virtual world that is
 

959
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,169
a digital virtual world that is
compelling

960
00:18:33,169 --> 00:18:33,179
compelling
 

961
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:35,690
compelling
when you connect others there in the

962
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:35,700
when you connect others there in the
 

963
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,430
when you connect others there in the
same way that physical

964
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:37,440
same way that physical
 

965
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,010
same way that physical

get this kind of
 

1179
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:55,730
get this kind of
you get a clippy type of situation right

1180
00:22:55,730 --> 00:22:55,740
you get a clippy type of situation right
 

1181
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:57,890
you get a clippy type of situation right
which is like a very generic looking

work to some degree but they kill the
 

1223
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:49,070
work to some degree but they kill the
creativity I think the killing of the

1224
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:49,080
creativity I think the killing of the
 

1225
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,890

if you create agents that okay so take
for an example you'd create a robot that

1232
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:00,240
for an example you'd create a robot that
 

1233
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,390
for an example you'd create a robot that
looks like a humanoid and it's you know

1234
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:02,400
looks like a humanoid and it's you know

women uh why is the robot white so you

1244
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:16,140
women uh why is the robot white so you
 

1245
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:19,370
women uh why is the robot white so you
have but the thing is I think that with

1246
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:19,380
have but the thing is I think that with
 

1247
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:21,710
have but the thing is I think that with
creativity

1248
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:21,720
creativity
 

1249
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:24,230
creativity
you can find a solution that's even

1250
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:24,240
you can find a solution that's even
 

1251
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,770
you can find a solution that's even
better where you're not even harming

1252
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:27,780
better where you're not even harming
 

1253
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:30,649
better where you're not even harming
anyone and you're creating a robot that

1254
00:24:30,649 --> 00:24:30,659
anyone and you're creating a robot that
 

1255
00:24:30,659 --> 00:24:33,470
anyone and you're creating a robot that
looks like not not humanoid but like

1256
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:33,480
looks like not not humanoid but like
 

1257
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,970
looks like not not humanoid but like
something that people relate to even

1258
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:34,980
something that people relate to even
 

1259
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:37,610
something that people relate to even
more and now you don't even have any of

1260
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:37,620
more and now you don't even have any of
 

1261
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:39,529
more and now you don't even have any of
these bias issues that you're creating

1262
00:24:39,529 --> 00:24:39,539
these bias issues that you're creating
 

1263
00:24:39,539 --> 00:24:41,810
these bias issues that you're creating
and so how do we create that within

1264
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:41,820
and so how do we create that within
 

1265
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:43,669
and so how do we create that within
companies because I don't think it's

1266
00:24:43,669 --> 00:24:43,679
companies because I don't think it's
 

1267
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:45,230
companies because I don't think it's
really about

1268
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:45,240
really about
 

1269
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:47,750
really about
like I because I you know maybe we

1270
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:47,760
like I because I you know maybe we
 

1271
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,070
like I because I you know maybe we
disagree on that I don't think that

1272
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:49,080
disagree on that I don't think that
 

1273
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:52,370
disagree on that I don't think that
edginess or humor or interesting things

edginess or humor or interesting things
 

1275
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:54,890
edginess or humor or interesting things
need to be things that harm or hurt

1276
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:54,900
need to be things that harm or hurt
 

1277
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:56,810

00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:22,740
that they can before we're thinking and
 

1595
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:25,070
that they can before we're thinking and
they can actually shift what the future

1596
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:25,080
they can actually shift what the future
 

1597
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,930
they can actually shift what the future
of technology looks like

1598
00:31:26,930 --> 00:31:26,940
of technology looks like
 

1599
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:28,490
of technology looks like
and I agree with you that I would like

1600
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:28,500
and I agree with you that I would like
 

1601
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,470
and I agree with you that I would like
to see more of that especially when it

1602
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:30,480
to see more of that especially when it
 

1603
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,510
to see more of that especially when it
comes to

1604
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:32,520
comes to
 

1605
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:35,930
comes to
existing biases that we know

1606
00:31:35,930 --> 00:31:35,940
existing biases that we know
 

1607
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:38,990
existing biases that we know
or or you know that that I think there's

1608
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:39,000
or or you know that that I think there's
 

1609
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,549
or or you know that that I think there's
the low-hanging fruit of companies that

1610
00:31:40,549 --> 00:31:40,559
the low-hanging fruit of companies that
 

1611
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:41,750
the low-hanging fruit of companies that
don't even think about it at all and

1612
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:41,760
don't even think about it at all and
 

1613
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,130
don't even think about it at all and
aren't talking to the right people and

1614
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:43,140
aren't talking to the right people and
 

1615
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:44,810
aren't talking to the right people and
aren't getting the full information and

1616
00:31:44,810 --> 00:31:44,820
aren't getting the full information and
 

1617
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,070
aren't getting the full information and
then there's companies that are just

1618
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:46,080
then there's companies that are just
 

1619
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,930
then there's companies that are just
like doing the safe thing and and giving

1620
00:31:47,930 --> 00:31:47,940
like doing the safe thing and and giving
 

1621
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:50,389
like doing the safe thing and and giving
consumers what they want now but to be

1622
00:31:50,389 --> 00:31:50,399
consumers what they want now but to be
 

1623
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:52,310
consumers what they want now but to be
really forward looking and be really

1624
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:52,320
really forward looking and be really
 

1625
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,710
really forward looking and be really
successful I think you have to make some

1626
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:54,720
successful I think you have to make some
 

1627
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,510
successful I think you have to make some
judgment calls about what the future is

1628
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:56,520
judgment calls about what the future is
 

1629
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,850
judgment calls about what the future is
going to be but do you think it's still

1630
00:31:58,850 --> 00:31:58,860
going to be but do you think it's still
 

1631
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:01,389
going to be but do you think it's still
useful to gender and to name the robots

1632
00:32:01,389 --> 00:32:01,399
useful to gender and to name the robots
 

1633
00:32:01,399 --> 00:32:03,710
useful to gender and to name the robots
yes I mean

1634
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:03,720
yes I mean
 

1635
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:08,630
yes I mean
gender is the minefields but people I

1636
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:08,640
gender is the minefields but people I
 

1637
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,570
gender is the minefields but people I
it's really hard to get people to not

1638
00:32:11,570 --> 00:32:11,580
it's really hard to get people to not
 

1639
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:14,090
it's really hard to get people to not
gender a robot in some way

1640
00:32:14,090 --> 00:32:14,100
gender a robot in some way
 

1641
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:16,970
gender a robot in some way
so if you don't give it a name or you

1642
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:16,980
so if you don't give it a name or you
 

1643
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:20,510
so if you don't give it a name or you
give it a like ambiguous voice people

1644
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:20,520
give it a like ambiguous voice people
 

1645
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,909
give it a like ambiguous voice people
will just choose something and maybe

1646
00:32:22,909 --> 00:32:22,919
will just choose something and maybe
 

1647
00:32:22,919 --> 00:32:25,730
will just choose something and maybe
that's better than just like

1648
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:25,740
that's better than just like
 

1649
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:28,430
that's better than just like
uh you know entrenching something that

1650
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:28,440
uh you know entrenching something that
 

1651
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,409
uh you know entrenching something that
you've decided is best

1652
00:32:30,409 --> 00:32:30,419
you've decided is best
 

1653
00:32:30,419 --> 00:32:33,590
you've decided is best
but I do think it can be helpful on the

1654
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:33,600
but I do think it can be helpful on the
 

1655
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,230
but I do think it can be helpful on the
like anthropomorphism engagement level

1656
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:36,240
like anthropomorphism engagement level
 

1657
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,570
like anthropomorphism engagement level
to give it attributes that people

1658
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:38,580
to give it attributes that people
 

1659
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:41,269
to give it attributes that people
identify with yeah I think uh a lot of

1660
00:32:41,269 --> 00:32:41,279
identify with yeah I think uh a lot of
 

1661
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:43,010
identify with yeah I think uh a lot of
roboticists I know they they don't

1662
00:32:43,010 --> 00:32:43,020
roboticists I know they they don't
 

1663
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:44,750
roboticists I know they they don't
gender the robot they don't they even

1664
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:44,760
gender the robot they don't they even
 

1665
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:47,210
gender the robot they don't they even
try to avoid naming the robot or naming

1666
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:47,220
try to avoid naming the robot or naming
 

1667
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:50,690
try to avoid naming the robot or naming
it ain't something that is uh can be

1668
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:50,700
it ain't something that is uh can be
 

1669
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,789
it ain't something that is uh can be
used as a name in conversation kind of

1670
00:32:52,789 --> 00:32:52,799
used as a name in conversation kind of
 

1671
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:53,450
used as a name in conversation kind of
thing

1672
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:53,460
thing
 

1673
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:55,970
thing
and I think that actually

1674
00:32:55,970 --> 00:32:55,980
and I think that actually
 

1675
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:58,310
and I think that actually
that's uh

1676
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:58,320
that's uh
 

1677
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,950
that's uh
irresponsible because

1678
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:00,960
irresponsible because
 

1679
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,930
irresponsible because
people are going to anthropomorphize the

1680
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:02,940
people are going to anthropomorphize the
 

1681
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:04,430
people are going to anthropomorphize the
thing anyway

1682
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:04,440
thing anyway
 

1683
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,830
thing anyway
so you're just uh removing from yourself

1684
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:06,840
so you're just uh removing from yourself
 

1685
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,450
so you're just uh removing from yourself
the responsibility of how they're

1686
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:08,460
the responsibility of how they're
 

1687
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:10,130
the responsibility of how they're
they're going to anthropomorphize it

1688
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:10,140
they're going to anthropomorphize it
 

1689
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:12,409
they're going to anthropomorphize it
that's a good point and so like you want

1690
00:33:12,409 --> 00:33:12,419
that's a good point and so like you want
 

1691
00:33:12,419 --> 00:33:14,630
that's a good point and so like you want
to be able to like they're going to do

1692
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:14,640
to be able to like they're going to do
 

1693
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:17,090
to be able to like they're going to do
it you have to start to think about how

1694
00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:17,100
it you have to start to think about how
 

1695
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:18,649
it you have to start to think about how
they're going to do it even if the robot

1696
00:33:18,649 --> 00:33:18,659
they're going to do it even if the robot
 

1697
00:33:18,659 --> 00:33:21,049
they're going to do it even if the robot
is like a Boston Dynamics robot that's

1698
00:33:21,049 --> 00:33:21,059
is like a Boston Dynamics robot that's
 

1699
00:33:21,059 --> 00:33:23,570
is like a Boston Dynamics robot that's
not supposed to have any kind of social

1700
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:23,580
not supposed to have any kind of social
 

1701
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:25,070
not supposed to have any kind of social
component

1702
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:25,080
component
 

1703
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:27,470
component
they're obviously going to project a

1704
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:27,480
they're obviously going to project a
 

1705
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,570
they're obviously going to project a
social component to it yeah like that

1706
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:29,580
social component to it yeah like that
 

1707
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:30,710
social component to it yeah like that
arm

1711
00:33:33,659 --> 00:33:36,350
I worked a lot a lot with quadruped now
with with the robot dogs you know that

1712
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:36,360
with with the robot dogs you know that
 

1713
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:38,750

almost good PR
for people to be scared of these things

1752
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:25,020
for people to be scared of these things
 

1753
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:28,070
for people to be scared of these things
because it's it's for some reason as you

like how to how to make the whole thing
 

1795
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:17,710
like how to how to make the whole thing
happen but they're aware when people see

1796

happen but they're aware when people see
 

1797
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:20,990
happen but they're aware when people see
well I think they became aware I think

1798
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:21,000
well I think they became aware I think
 

1799
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,670
well I think they became aware I think
that in the beginning they were really

1800
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:22,680
that in the beginning they were really
 

1801
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,710
that in the beginning they were really
really focused on just the engineering I

1802
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:24,720
really focused on just the engineering I
 

1803
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,030
really focused on just the engineering I
mean they're at the Forefront of

1804
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:26,040
mean they're at the Forefront of
 

1805
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,970
mean they're at the Forefront of
Robotics like Locomotion and stuff

1806
00:35:28,970 --> 00:35:28,980
Robotics like Locomotion and stuff
 

1807
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:29,750

um

1808
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:29,760
um
 

1809
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,430
um
and then when they started doing the

1810

and then when they started doing the
videos I think that was kind of a labor

1812

oversaw a lot of the videos and made a
 

1819

1825
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,550
can't be like some sort of incline that
would give the robot an advantage

1826
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:46,560
would give the robot an advantage
 

1827
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,130

more PR leaking in but those videos are
 

1861
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:32,210
more PR leaking in but those videos are
made by Engineers because that's what

1862
00:36:32,210 --> 00:36:32,220
made by Engineers because that's what
 

1863
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:34,670
made by Engineers because that's what
they find fun mm-hmm it's like testing

1864
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:34,680
they find fun mm-hmm it's like testing
 

1865
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:36,410
they find fun mm-hmm it's like testing
the robustness of the system

1866
00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:36,420
the robustness of the system
 

1867
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:39,230

walking around your place like yeah I'm
working on them uh that's actually one

1888
00:37:03,349 --> 00:37:03,359
working on them uh that's actually one

00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:24,890
um I have a bunch of little like I built
the well I'm not finished with the

1906
00:37:24,890 --> 00:37:24,900
the well I'm not finished with the
 

1907
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:28,430
the well I'm not finished with the
butter robot from Rick and Morty I saw a

1908
00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:28,440
butter robot from Rick and Morty I saw a
 

1909
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,230
butter robot from Rick and Morty I saw a
bunch of robots everywhere but the thing

1910
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:30,240
bunch of robots everywhere but the thing
 

1911
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:33,230
bunch of robots everywhere but the thing
is what happens is you're working on one

1912
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:33,240
is what happens is you're working on one
 

1913
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,730
is what happens is you're working on one
robot at a time

1914
00:37:34,730 --> 00:37:34,740
robot at a time
 

1915
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:36,650
robot at a time
and uh that becomes like a little

1916
00:37:36,650 --> 00:37:36,660
and uh that becomes like a little
 

1917
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:37,849
and uh that becomes like a little
project

1918
00:37:37,849 --> 00:37:37,859
project
 

1919
00:37:37,859 --> 00:37:40,849
project
it's actually very difficult to have

1920
00:37:40,849 --> 00:37:40,859
it's actually very difficult to have
 

1921
00:37:40,859 --> 00:37:44,030
it's actually very difficult to have
just a passively

1922
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:44,040
just a passively
 

1923
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:47,150
just a passively
functioning robot always moving yeah and

1924
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:47,160
functioning robot always moving yeah and
 

1925
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,890
functioning robot always moving yeah and
that's a that's a that's a dream for me

1926
00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:48,900
that's a that's a that's a dream for me
 

1927
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,510
that's a that's a that's a dream for me
because I'd love to create that kind of

1928
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:50,520
because I'd love to create that kind of
 

1929
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:53,030
because I'd love to create that kind of
a little world so uh the the impressive

1930
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:53,040
a little world so uh the the impressive
 

1931
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,370
a little world so uh the the impressive
thing about Boston Dynamics to me was to

1932
00:37:55,370 --> 00:37:55,380
thing about Boston Dynamics to me was to
 

1933
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:59,329
thing about Boston Dynamics to me was to
see like hundreds of spots

1934
00:37:59,329 --> 00:37:59,339
see like hundreds of spots
 

1935
00:37:59,339 --> 00:38:01,790
see like hundreds of spots
and like there's a the most impressive

1936
00:38:01,790 --> 00:38:01,800
and like there's a the most impressive
 

1937
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,849
and like there's a the most impressive
thing that still sticks with me is um

1938
00:38:03,849 --> 00:38:03,859
thing that still sticks with me is um
 

1939
00:38:03,859 --> 00:38:07,849
thing that still sticks with me is um
there was a a spot robot

1940
00:38:07,849 --> 00:38:07,859
there was a a spot robot
 

1941
00:38:07,859 --> 00:38:10,670
there was a a spot robot
walking down the hall seemingly with no

1942
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:10,680
walking down the hall seemingly with no
 

1943
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,770
walking down the hall seemingly with no
supervision whatsoever and he was

1944
00:38:12,770 --> 00:38:12,780
supervision whatsoever and he was
 

1945
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:14,270
supervision whatsoever and he was
wearing he or she I don't know was

1946
00:38:14,270 --> 00:38:14,280
wearing he or she I don't know was
 

1947
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:16,069
wearing he or she I don't know was
wearing a cowboy hat

1948
00:38:16,069 --> 00:38:16,079
wearing a cowboy hat
 

1949
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:18,349
wearing a cowboy hat
it just it was just walking down the

1950
00:38:18,349 --> 00:38:18,359
it just it was just walking down the
 

1951
00:38:18,359 --> 00:38:20,270
it just it was just walking down the
hall and nobody paying attention and

1952
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:20,280
hall and nobody paying attention and
 

1953
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,710
hall and nobody paying attention and
it's just like walking down this long

1954
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:21,720
it's just like walking down this long
 

1955
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:25,010
it's just like walking down this long
Hall and I'm like looking around this is

1956
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:25,020
Hall and I'm like looking around this is
 

1957
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:28,670
Hall and I'm like looking around this is
anyone like what's happening here so I'm

1958
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:28,680
anyone like what's happening here so I'm
 

1959
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,290
anyone like what's happening here so I'm
presumably some kind of automation where

1960
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:30,300
presumably some kind of automation where
 

1961
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:31,970
presumably some kind of automation where
he's doing the map I mean the whole

1962
00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:31,980
he's doing the map I mean the whole
 

1963
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:33,170
he's doing the map I mean the whole
environment is probably really well

1964
00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:33,180
environment is probably really well
 

1965
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:36,829
environment is probably really well
mapped but I it was just

1966
00:38:36,829 --> 00:38:36,839
mapped but I it was just
 

1967
00:38:36,839 --> 00:38:39,109
mapped but I it was just
it gave me a picture of a world where a

1968
00:38:39,109 --> 00:38:39,119
it gave me a picture of a world where a
 

1969
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:41,030
it gave me a picture of a world where a
robot is doing his thing wearing a

1970
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:41,040
robot is doing his thing wearing a
 

1971
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,349
robot is doing his thing wearing a
cowboy hat just

1972
00:38:42,349 --> 00:38:42,359
cowboy hat just
 

1973
00:38:42,359 --> 00:38:44,810
cowboy hat just

00:38:47,810 --> 00:38:47,820
what it's doing what's the mission but
 

1979
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:49,250
what it's doing what's the mission but
uh I don't know for some reason it

uh I don't know for some reason it
 

1981
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:50,810
uh I don't know for some reason it
really stuck with me you don't often see

1982
00:38:50,810 --> 00:38:50,820
really stuck with me you don't often see
 

1983
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:53,810
really stuck with me you don't often see
robots that aren't part of a demo or

1984
00:38:53,810 --> 00:38:53,820
robots that aren't part of a demo or
 

1985
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:56,990
robots that aren't part of a demo or
that aren't uh you know like with a

1986
00:38:56,990 --> 00:38:57,000
that aren't uh you know like with a
 

1987
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,810
that aren't uh you know like with a
semi-autonomous autonomous vehicle like

1988
00:38:59,810 --> 00:38:59,820
semi-autonomous autonomous vehicle like
 

1989
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:01,910
semi-autonomous autonomous vehicle like
directly doing a task this was just

1990
00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:01,920
directly doing a task this was just
 

1991
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:05,270
directly doing a task this was just
chilling yeah walking around I don't

00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:09,230
know well yeah you know I mean we're at
MIT like when I first got to MIT I was

1996
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:09,240
MIT like when I first got to MIT I was
 

1997
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,910
MIT like when I first got to MIT I was
like okay where's all the where's all

like okay where's all the where's all
the robots and they were all like broken

2000
00:39:12,770 --> 00:39:12,780
the robots and they were all like broken
 

2001
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:17,290
the robots and they were all like broken
or like not demoing so yeah and and and

2002
00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:17,300
or like not demoing so yeah and and and
 

2003

or like not demoing so yeah and and and
what really excites me is that we're

2004
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:20,760
what really excites me is that we're
 

2005
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:22,370
what really excites me is that we're
about to have that we're about to have

2006
00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:22,380
about to have that we're about to have
 

2007
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:25,190
about to have that we're about to have
so many moving rope about to well it's

2008
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:25,200
so many moving rope about to well it's
 

2009
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,170
so many moving rope about to well it's
coming it's coming in our lifetime that

2010
00:39:27,170 --> 00:39:27,180
coming it's coming in our lifetime that
 

2011
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:29,089
coming it's coming in our lifetime that
we will just have robots moving around

2012
00:39:29,089 --> 00:39:29,099
we will just have robots moving around
 

2013
00:39:29,099 --> 00:39:30,710
we will just have robots moving around
we're already seeing the beginnings of

2014
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:30,720
we're already seeing the beginnings of
 

2015
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,329
we're already seeing the beginnings of
it there's delivery robots in some

2016
00:39:32,329 --> 00:39:32,339
it there's delivery robots in some
 

2017
00:39:32,339 --> 00:39:35,270
it there's delivery robots in some
cities on the sidewalks and I just love

2018
00:39:35,270 --> 00:39:35,280
cities on the sidewalks and I just love
 

2019
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,890
cities on the sidewalks and I just love
seeing like the tick tocks of people

2020
00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:36,900
seeing like the tick tocks of people
 

2021
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:39,530
seeing like the tick tocks of people
reacting to that because yeah you see a

2022
00:39:39,530 --> 00:39:39,540
reacting to that because yeah you see a
 

2023
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:41,150
reacting to that because yeah you see a
robot walking on the hall with a cowboy

2024
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:41,160
robot walking on the hall with a cowboy
 

2025
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:43,310
robot walking on the hall with a cowboy
hat you're like what

2026

the what is this this is awesome and
 

2029
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:48,109
the what is this this is awesome and
scary and kind of awesome and people

2030
00:39:48,109 --> 00:39:48,119
scary and kind of awesome and people
 

2031
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:49,910
scary and kind of awesome and people
either love or hate it that's one of the

2032
00:39:49,910 --> 00:39:49,920
either love or hate it that's one of the
 

2033
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,470
either love or hate it that's one of the
things that I think companies are

2034
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:51,480
things that I think companies are
 

2035
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:53,569
things that I think companies are
underestimating that people will either

2036
00:39:53,569 --> 00:39:53,579
underestimating that people will either
 

2037
00:39:53,579 --> 00:39:55,790
underestimating that people will either
love a robot or hate a robot and nothing

2038
00:39:55,790 --> 00:39:55,800
love a robot or hate a robot and nothing
 

2039
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:58,849
love a robot or hate a robot and nothing
in between so it's just again an

2040
00:39:58,849 --> 00:39:58,859
in between so it's just again an
 

2041
00:39:58,859 --> 00:40:01,490
in between so it's just again an
exciting time to be alive yeah I think

2042
00:40:01,490 --> 00:40:01,500
exciting time to be alive yeah I think
 

2043
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:04,430
exciting time to be alive yeah I think
kids almost universally at least in my

2044
00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:04,440
kids almost universally at least in my
 

2045
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:06,109
kids almost universally at least in my
experience love them

2046
00:40:06,109 --> 00:40:06,119
experience love them
 

2047
00:40:06,119 --> 00:40:08,990
experience love them
a lot love legged robots if they're not

2048
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:09,000
a lot love legged robots if they're not
 

2049
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,910
a lot love legged robots if they're not

00:40:23,089 --> 00:40:23,099
do they understand Roma to be a robot
 

2061
00:40:23,099 --> 00:40:25,069
do they understand Roma to be a robot
oh yeah my kids that's that's the first

2062
00:40:25,069 --> 00:40:25,079
oh yeah my kids that's that's the first
 

2063
00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:26,690
oh yeah my kids that's that's the first
words they learned they know how to say

2064
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:26,700
words they learned they know how to say
 

2065
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:28,310
words they learned they know how to say
beep boop

2066
00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:28,320
beep boop
 

2067
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,349
beep boop
think the room as a robot does do they

2068
00:40:30,349 --> 00:40:30,359
think the room as a robot does do they
 

2069
00:40:30,359 --> 00:40:32,450
think the room as a robot does do they
project intelligence out of the thing

2070
00:40:32,450 --> 00:40:32,460
project intelligence out of the thing
 

2071
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:34,190
project intelligence out of the thing
but we don't really use it around them

2072
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:34,200
but we don't really use it around them
 

2073
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,650
but we don't really use it around them
anymore for the reason that my son is

2074
00:40:36,650 --> 00:40:36,660
anymore for the reason that my son is
 

2075
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:39,170
anymore for the reason that my son is
scared of it

2076
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:39,180
scared of it
 

2077
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:42,170
scared of it
yeah that's right I think they would

2078
00:40:42,170 --> 00:40:42,180
yeah that's right I think they would
 

2079
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:44,089
yeah that's right I think they would
like even a Roomba

2080
00:40:44,089 --> 00:40:44,099
like even a Roomba
 

2081
00:40:44,099 --> 00:40:46,849
like even a Roomba
because it's moving around on its own

2082
00:40:46,849 --> 00:40:46,859
because it's moving around on its own
 

2083
00:40:46,859 --> 00:40:50,270
because it's moving around on its own
I think kids and animals view it as a an

2084
00:40:50,270 --> 00:40:50,280
I think kids and animals view it as a an
 

2085
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:52,010
I think kids and animals view it as a an
agent

2086
00:40:52,010 --> 00:40:52,020
agent
 

2087
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:54,109
agent
so what do you think if we just look at

2088
00:40:54,109 --> 00:40:54,119
so what do you think if we just look at
 

2089
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:55,970
so what do you think if we just look at
the state of the art of Robotics what do

2090
00:40:55,970 --> 00:40:55,980
the state of the art of Robotics what do
 

2091
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:57,290
the state of the art of Robotics what do
you think robots are actually good at

2092
00:40:57,290 --> 00:40:57,300
you think robots are actually good at
 

2093
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:58,490
you think robots are actually good at
today

2094
00:40:58,490 --> 00:40:58,500
today
 

2095
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:00,470
today
so if we look at today you mean physical

2096
00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:00,480
so if we look at today you mean physical
 

2097
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:04,010
so if we look at today you mean physical
robots yeah physical robots

2098
00:41:04,010 --> 00:41:04,020
robots yeah physical robots
 

2099
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:08,030
robots yeah physical robots
well like what are you impressed by

2100
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:08,040
well like what are you impressed by
 

2101
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:10,069
well like what are you impressed by
so I think a lot of people I mean that's

2102
00:41:10,069 --> 00:41:10,079
so I think a lot of people I mean that's
 

2103
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:13,970
so I think a lot of people I mean that's
what your book is about is have maybe a

2104
00:41:13,970 --> 00:41:13,980
what your book is about is have maybe a
 

2105
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:16,790
what your book is about is have maybe a
not a perfectly calibrated understanding

2106
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:16,800
not a perfectly calibrated understanding
 

2107
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,470
not a perfectly calibrated understanding
of

2108
00:41:18,470 --> 00:41:18,480
of
 

2109
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,630
of
where we are in terms of Robotics what's

2110
00:41:20,630 --> 00:41:20,640
where we are in terms of Robotics what's
 

2111
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,250
where we are in terms of Robotics what's
difficult the robotics what's easy in

2112
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:22,260
difficult the robotics what's easy in
 

2113
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:25,609
difficult the robotics what's easy in
robotics yeah we're way behind where

2114
00:41:25,609 --> 00:41:25,619
robotics yeah we're way behind where
 

2115
00:41:25,619 --> 00:41:28,790
robotics yeah we're way behind where
people think we are so

2116
00:41:28,790 --> 00:41:28,800
people think we are so
 

2117
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,849
people think we are so
what's impressive to me so uh let's see

2118
00:41:31,849 --> 00:41:31,859
what's impressive to me so uh let's see
 

2119
00:41:31,859 --> 00:41:34,310
what's impressive to me so uh let's see
oh one one thing that came out recently

2120
00:41:34,310 --> 00:41:34,320
oh one one thing that came out recently
 

2121
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:36,530
oh one one thing that came out recently
was Amazon has this new Warehouse robot

2122
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:36,540
was Amazon has this new Warehouse robot
 

2123
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:41,030
was Amazon has this new Warehouse robot
and it's the first autonomous Warehouse

2124
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:41,040
and it's the first autonomous Warehouse
 

2125
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,609
and it's the first autonomous Warehouse
robot that can is safe for people to be

2126
00:41:43,609 --> 00:41:43,619
robot that can is safe for people to be
 

2127
00:41:43,619 --> 00:41:46,670
robot that can is safe for people to be
around and so like it's kind of most

2128
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:46,680
around and so like it's kind of most
 

2129
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:48,829
around and so like it's kind of most
people most people I think Envision that

2130
00:41:48,829 --> 00:41:48,839
people most people I think Envision that
 

2131
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:50,569
people most people I think Envision that
our warehouses are already fully

2132
00:41:50,569 --> 00:41:50,579
our warehouses are already fully
 

2133
00:41:50,579 --> 00:41:52,250
our warehouses are already fully
automated and that they're just like

2134
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:52,260
automated and that they're just like
 

2135
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:53,870
automated and that they're just like
robots doing things

2136
00:41:53,870 --> 00:41:53,880
robots doing things
 

2137
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:57,290
robots doing things
it's actually still really difficult to

2138
00:41:57,290 --> 00:41:57,300
it's actually still really difficult to
 

2139
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:59,630
it's actually still really difficult to
have robots and people in the same space

2140
00:41:59,630 --> 00:41:59,640
have robots and people in the same space
 

2141
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:01,790
have robots and people in the same space
because it's dangerous for the most part

2142
00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:01,800
because it's dangerous for the most part
 

2143
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,829
because it's dangerous for the most part
robots you know because especially

2144
00:42:03,829 --> 00:42:03,839
robots you know because especially
 

2145
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:06,109
robots you know because especially
robots that have to be strong enough to

2146
00:42:06,109 --> 00:42:06,119
robots that have to be strong enough to
 

2147
00:42:06,119 --> 00:42:07,790
robots that have to be strong enough to
move something heavy for example they

2148
00:42:07,790 --> 00:42:07,800
move something heavy for example they
 

2149
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,950
move something heavy for example they
can really hurt somebody and so until

2150
00:42:09,950 --> 00:42:09,960
can really hurt somebody and so until
 

2151
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:12,710
can really hurt somebody and so until
now a lot of the warehouse robots had to

2152
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:12,720
now a lot of the warehouse robots had to
 

2153
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,930
now a lot of the warehouse robots had to
just move along like pre-existing lines

2154
00:42:14,930 --> 00:42:14,940
just move along like pre-existing lines
 

2155
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:18,109
just move along like pre-existing lines
which really restricts what you can do

2156
00:42:18,109 --> 00:42:18,119
which really restricts what you can do
 

2157
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:21,410
which really restricts what you can do
um and so having I think that that's

2158
00:42:21,410 --> 00:42:21,420
um and so having I think that that's
 

2159
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:23,569
um and so having I think that that's
that's one of the big challenges and one

2160
00:42:23,569 --> 00:42:23,579
that's one of the big challenges and one
 

2161
00:42:23,579 --> 00:42:25,310
that's one of the big challenges and one
of the big like exciting things that's

2162
00:42:25,310 --> 00:42:25,320
of the big like exciting things that's
 

2163
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:27,530
of the big like exciting things that's
happening is that we're starting to see

2164
00:42:27,530 --> 00:42:27,540
happening is that we're starting to see
 

2165
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:30,589
happening is that we're starting to see
more kobotics in industrial spaces like

2166
00:42:30,589 --> 00:42:30,599
more kobotics in industrial spaces like
 

2167
00:42:30,599 --> 00:42:32,750
more kobotics in industrial spaces like
that where people and robots can work

2168
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:32,760
that where people and robots can work
 

2169
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:35,930
that where people and robots can work
side by side and not get harmed yeah

2170
00:42:35,930 --> 00:42:35,940
side by side and not get harmed yeah
 

2171
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:37,609
side by side and not get harmed yeah
that's what people don't realize sort of

2172
00:42:37,609 --> 00:42:37,619
that's what people don't realize sort of
 

2173
00:42:37,619 --> 00:42:39,829
that's what people don't realize sort of
the physical manipulation tasks with

2174
00:42:39,829 --> 00:42:39,839
the physical manipulation tasks with
 

2175
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:41,930
the physical manipulation tasks with
humans

2176
00:42:41,930 --> 00:42:41,940
humans
 

2177
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:43,670
humans
it's not that the robots want to hurt

2178
00:42:43,670 --> 00:42:43,680
it's not that the robots want to hurt
 

2179
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:44,450
it's not that the robots want to hurt
you

2180
00:42:44,450 --> 00:42:44,460
you
 

2181
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:46,130
you
I think that's what people are worried

2182
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:46,140
I think that's what people are worried
 

2183
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:49,609
I think that's what people are worried
about like this malevolent robot gets

2184
00:42:49,609 --> 00:42:49,619
about like this malevolent robot gets
 

2185
00:42:49,619 --> 00:42:51,290
about like this malevolent robot gets
them out of its own and wants to destroy

2186
00:42:51,290 --> 00:42:51,300
them out of its own and wants to destroy
 

2187
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:53,690
them out of its own and wants to destroy
all humans now it's you know it's

2188
00:42:53,690 --> 00:42:53,700
all humans now it's you know it's
 

2189
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:55,010
all humans now it's you know it's
actually very difficult to know where

2190
00:42:55,010 --> 00:42:55,020
actually very difficult to know where
 

2191
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:58,670
actually very difficult to know where
the human is yeah and to to respond to

2192
00:42:58,670 --> 00:42:58,680
the human is yeah and to to respond to
 

2193
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:01,250
the human is yeah and to to respond to
the human and dynamically and

2194
00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:01,260
the human and dynamically and
 

2195
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:03,470
the human and dynamically and
collaborate with them on a task

2196
00:43:03,470 --> 00:43:03,480
collaborate with them on a task
 

2197
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,210
collaborate with them on a task
especially if you're something like an

2198
00:43:05,210 --> 00:43:05,220
especially if you're something like an
 

2199
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:07,010
especially if you're something like an
industrial robotic arm which is

2200
00:43:07,010 --> 00:43:07,020
industrial robotic arm which is
 

2201
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:08,690
industrial robotic arm which is
extremely powerful

2202
00:43:08,690 --> 00:43:08,700
extremely powerful
 

2203
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:11,990
extremely powerful
yeah this some of the some of those arms

2204
00:43:11,990 --> 00:43:12,000
yeah this some of the some of those arms
 

2205
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,210
yeah this some of the some of those arms
are pretty impressive now that

2206
00:43:14,210 --> 00:43:14,220
are pretty impressive now that
 

2207
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:16,849
are pretty impressive now that
you can just you can you can grab it you

2208
00:43:16,849 --> 00:43:16,859
you can just you can you can grab it you
 

2209
00:43:16,859 --> 00:43:20,030
you can just you can you can grab it you
can move it so the the collaboration

2210
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:20,040
can move it so the the collaboration
 

2211
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:21,589
can move it so the the collaboration
between human robot in the factory

2212
00:43:21,589 --> 00:43:21,599
between human robot in the factory
 

2213
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:25,190
between human robot in the factory
setting is really fascinating yeah

2214
00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:25,200
setting is really fascinating yeah
 

2215
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:28,250
setting is really fascinating yeah
um do you think they'll take our jobs

2216
00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:28,260
um do you think they'll take our jobs
 

2217
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:30,109
um do you think they'll take our jobs
I don't think it's that simple I think

2218
00:43:30,109 --> 00:43:30,119
I don't think it's that simple I think
 

2219
00:43:30,119 --> 00:43:33,230
I don't think it's that simple I think
that there's a ton of disruption that's

2220
00:43:33,230 --> 00:43:33,240
that there's a ton of disruption that's
 

2221
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:36,050
that there's a ton of disruption that's
happening and will continue to happen

2222
00:43:36,050 --> 00:43:36,060
happening and will continue to happen
 

2223
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:36,650
happening and will continue to happen
um

2224
00:43:36,650 --> 00:43:36,660
um
 

2225
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:39,050
um
you know I think speaking specifically

2226
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:39,060
you know I think speaking specifically
 

2227
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:41,510
you know I think speaking specifically
of the Amazon warehouses that might be

2228
00:43:41,510 --> 00:43:41,520
of the Amazon warehouses that might be
 

2229
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:42,950
of the Amazon warehouses that might be
an area where it would be good for

2230
00:43:42,950 --> 00:43:42,960
an area where it would be good for
 

2231
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:45,170
an area where it would be good for
robots to take some of the jobs that are

2232
00:43:45,170 --> 00:43:45,180
robots to take some of the jobs that are
 

2233
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:47,329
robots to take some of the jobs that are
you know where people are put in a

2234
00:43:47,329 --> 00:43:47,339
you know where people are put in a
 

2235
00:43:47,339 --> 00:43:49,069
you know where people are put in a
position where it's unsafe and they're

2236
00:43:49,069 --> 00:43:49,079
position where it's unsafe and they're
 

2237
00:43:49,079 --> 00:43:51,349
position where it's unsafe and they're
treated horribly and you know probably

2238
00:43:51,349 --> 00:43:51,359
treated horribly and you know probably
 

2239
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:53,390
treated horribly and you know probably
it would be better if a robot did that

2240
00:43:53,390 --> 00:43:53,400
it would be better if a robot did that
 

2241
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:56,390
it would be better if a robot did that
and Amazon is clearly trying to automate

2242
00:43:56,390 --> 00:43:56,400
and Amazon is clearly trying to automate
 

2243
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:59,089
and Amazon is clearly trying to automate
that job away so uh I think there's

2244
00:43:59,089 --> 00:43:59,099
that job away so uh I think there's
 

2245
00:43:59,099 --> 00:44:01,309
that job away so uh I think there's
going to be a lot of disruption I do

2246
00:44:01,309 --> 00:44:01,319
going to be a lot of disruption I do
 

2247
00:44:01,319 --> 00:44:04,190
going to be a lot of disruption I do
think that robots and humans have very

2248
00:44:04,190 --> 00:44:04,200
think that robots and humans have very
 

2249
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:06,650
think that robots and humans have very
different skill sets so while a robot

2250
00:44:06,650 --> 00:44:06,660
different skill sets so while a robot
 

2251
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:09,410
different skill sets so while a robot
might take over a task

2252
00:44:09,410 --> 00:44:09,420
might take over a task
 

2253
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:13,130
might take over a task
it's not going to take over most jobs

2254
00:44:13,130 --> 00:44:13,140
it's not going to take over most jobs
 

2255
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:14,329
it's not going to take over most jobs
um

2256
00:44:14,329 --> 00:44:14,339
um
 

2257
00:44:14,339 --> 00:44:16,490
um
I think just things will change a lot

2258
00:44:16,490 --> 00:44:16,500
I think just things will change a lot
 

2259
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:18,829
I think just things will change a lot
like I know one of the examples I have

2260
00:44:18,829 --> 00:44:18,839
like I know one of the examples I have
 

2261
00:44:18,839 --> 00:44:21,349
like I know one of the examples I have
in the book is mining

2262
00:44:21,349 --> 00:44:21,359
in the book is mining
 

2263
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:25,309
in the book is mining
um so they're you have this job that is

2264
00:44:25,309 --> 00:44:25,319
um so they're you have this job that is
 

2265
00:44:25,319 --> 00:44:28,010
um so they're you have this job that is
very unsafe and that requires a bunch of

2266
00:44:28,010 --> 00:44:28,020
very unsafe and that requires a bunch of
 

2267
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:29,450
very unsafe and that requires a bunch of
workers and puts them in unsafe

2268
00:44:29,450 --> 00:44:29,460
workers and puts them in unsafe
 

2269
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:31,790
workers and puts them in unsafe
conditions and now you have all these

2270
00:44:31,790 --> 00:44:31,800
conditions and now you have all these
 

2271
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:34,849
conditions and now you have all these
different robotic machines that can help

2272
00:44:34,849 --> 00:44:34,859
different robotic machines that can help
 

2273
00:44:34,859 --> 00:44:37,550
different robotic machines that can help
make the job safer and as a result now

2274
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:37,560
make the job safer and as a result now
 

2275
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:40,089
make the job safer and as a result now
people can sit in these like

2276
00:44:40,089 --> 00:44:40,099
people can sit in these like
 

2277
00:44:40,099 --> 00:44:42,589
people can sit in these like
air-conditioned remote control stations

2278
00:44:42,589 --> 00:44:42,599
air-conditioned remote control stations
 

2279
00:44:42,599 --> 00:44:44,690
air-conditioned remote control stations
and like control these autonomous mining

2280
00:44:44,690 --> 00:44:44,700
and like control these autonomous mining
 

2281
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:46,970
and like control these autonomous mining
trucks and so that's a much better job

2282
00:44:46,970 --> 00:44:46,980
trucks and so that's a much better job
 

2283
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:48,890
trucks and so that's a much better job
but also they're employing less people

2284
00:44:48,890 --> 00:44:48,900
but also they're employing less people
 

2285
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:50,990
but also they're employing less people
now so it's

2286
00:44:50,990 --> 00:44:51,000
now so it's
 

2287
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,650
now so it's
it's just a lot of

2288
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:54,660
it's just a lot of
 

2289
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:56,690
it's just a lot of
I think from a bird's eye perspective

2290
00:44:56,690 --> 00:44:56,700
I think from a bird's eye perspective
 

2291
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:58,670
I think from a bird's eye perspective
you're not going to see job loss you're

2292
00:44:58,670 --> 00:44:58,680
you're not going to see job loss you're
 

2293
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:01,910
you're not going to see job loss you're
going to see more jobs created because

2294
00:45:01,910 --> 00:45:01,920
going to see more jobs created because
 

2295
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:04,630
going to see more jobs created because
that's I I think the future is not

2296
00:45:04,630 --> 00:45:04,640
that's I I think the future is not
 

2297
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:07,550
that's I I think the future is not
robots just becoming like people and

2298
00:45:07,550 --> 00:45:07,560
robots just becoming like people and
 

2299
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:09,710
robots just becoming like people and
taking their jobs the future is really a

2300
00:45:09,710 --> 00:45:09,720
taking their jobs the future is really a
 

2301
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:12,170
taking their jobs the future is really a
combination of our skills and then the

2302
00:45:12,170 --> 00:45:12,180
combination of our skills and then the
 

2303
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:14,870
combination of our skills and then the
supplemental skills that robots have to

2304
00:45:14,870 --> 00:45:14,880
supplemental skills that robots have to
 

2305
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:17,210
supplemental skills that robots have to
increase productivity to help people

2306
00:45:17,210 --> 00:45:17,220
increase productivity to help people
 

2307
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:20,329
increase productivity to help people
have better safer jobs to

2308
00:45:20,329 --> 00:45:20,339
have better safer jobs to
 

2309
00:45:20,339 --> 00:45:22,130
have better safer jobs to
give people work that they actually

2310
00:45:22,130 --> 00:45:22,140
give people work that they actually
 

2311
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:24,950
give people work that they actually
enjoy doing and are good at

2312
00:45:24,950 --> 00:45:24,960
enjoy doing and are good at
 

2313
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:27,109
enjoy doing and are good at
um but it's really easy to say that from

2314
00:45:27,109 --> 00:45:27,119
um but it's really easy to say that from
 

2315
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:30,290
um but it's really easy to say that from
a bird's eye perspective and

2316
00:45:30,290 --> 00:45:30,300
a bird's eye perspective and
 

2317
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:33,890
a bird's eye perspective and
um ignore kind of the the rubble on the

2318
00:45:33,890 --> 00:45:33,900
um ignore kind of the the rubble on the
 

2319
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:35,030
um ignore kind of the the rubble on the
ground as we go through these

2320
00:45:35,030 --> 00:45:35,040
ground as we go through these
 

2321
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:37,370
ground as we go through these
transitions because of course specific

2322
00:45:37,370 --> 00:45:37,380
transitions because of course specific
 

2323
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:40,190
transitions because of course specific
jobs are going to get lost if you look

2324
00:45:40,190 --> 00:45:40,200
jobs are going to get lost if you look
 

2325
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:41,870
jobs are going to get lost if you look
at the history of the 20th century it

2326
00:45:41,870 --> 00:45:41,880
at the history of the 20th century it
 

2327
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:43,550
at the history of the 20th century it
seems like automation

2328
00:45:43,550 --> 00:45:43,560
seems like automation
 

2329
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:45,109
seems like automation
constantly

2330
00:45:45,109 --> 00:45:45,119
constantly
 

2331
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:48,309
constantly
increases productivity and improves

2332
00:45:48,309 --> 00:45:48,319
increases productivity and improves
 

2333
00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:52,250
increases productivity and improves
the average quality of life so it's it's

2334
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:52,260
the average quality of life so it's it's
 

2335
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:55,809
the average quality of life so it's it's
been always good so like thinking about

2336
00:45:55,809 --> 00:45:55,819
been always good so like thinking about
 

2337
00:45:55,819 --> 00:45:59,089
been always good so like thinking about
this time being different is that we

2338
00:45:59,089 --> 00:45:59,099
this time being different is that we
 

2339
00:45:59,099 --> 00:46:01,069
this time being different is that we
would need to go against the lessons of

2340
00:46:01,069 --> 00:46:01,079
would need to go against the lessons of
 

2341
00:46:01,079 --> 00:46:03,349
would need to go against the lessons of
History it's true

2342
00:46:03,349 --> 00:46:03,359
History it's true
 

2343
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:05,690
History it's true
and uh the other thing is I think people

2344
00:46:05,690 --> 00:46:05,700
and uh the other thing is I think people
 

2345
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:07,609
and uh the other thing is I think people
think that the automation of the

2346
00:46:07,609 --> 00:46:07,619
think that the automation of the
 

2347
00:46:07,619 --> 00:46:11,210
think that the automation of the
physical tasks is easy I was I was just

2348
00:46:11,210 --> 00:46:11,220
physical tasks is easy I was I was just
 

2349
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:13,370
physical tasks is easy I was I was just
in Ukraine and the interesting thing is

2350
00:46:13,370 --> 00:46:13,380
in Ukraine and the interesting thing is
 

2351
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:14,390
in Ukraine and the interesting thing is
um

2352
00:46:14,390 --> 00:46:14,400
um
 

2353
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:17,630
um
I mean there's a lot of difficult and uh

2354
00:46:17,630 --> 00:46:17,640
I mean there's a lot of difficult and uh
 

2355
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:21,230
I mean there's a lot of difficult and uh
dark lessons just about a war zone but

2356
00:46:21,230 --> 00:46:21,240
dark lessons just about a war zone but
 

2357
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:23,089
dark lessons just about a war zone but
one of the things that happens in war is

2358
00:46:23,089 --> 00:46:23,099
one of the things that happens in war is
 

2359
00:46:23,099 --> 00:46:26,270
one of the things that happens in war is
there's a lot of Mines that are placed

2360
00:46:26,270 --> 00:46:26,280
there's a lot of Mines that are placed
 

2361
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:28,730
there's a lot of Mines that are placed
um that's the this one of the big

2362
00:46:28,730 --> 00:46:28,740
um that's the this one of the big
 

2363
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:29,990
um that's the this one of the big
problems

2364
00:46:29,990 --> 00:46:30,000
problems
 

2365
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,290
problems
for years after a war is even over is

2366
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:33,300
for years after a war is even over is
 

2367
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:36,349
for years after a war is even over is
the entire landscape is covered in mines

2368
00:46:36,349 --> 00:46:36,359
the entire landscape is covered in mines
 

2369
00:46:36,359 --> 00:46:40,130
the entire landscape is covered in mines
and so there's a demining effort

2370
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:40,140
and so there's a demining effort
 

2371
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:43,190
and so there's a demining effort
and you would think robots would be good

2372
00:46:43,190 --> 00:46:43,200
and you would think robots would be good
 

2373
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,230
and you would think robots would be good
at this kind of thing or like your

2374
00:46:45,230 --> 00:46:45,240
at this kind of thing or like your
 

2375
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:47,329
at this kind of thing or like your
intuition would be like well say you

2376
00:46:47,329 --> 00:46:47,339
intuition would be like well say you
 

2377
00:46:47,339 --> 00:46:49,490
intuition would be like well say you
have unlimited money and you want to do

2378
00:46:49,490 --> 00:46:49,500
have unlimited money and you want to do
 

2379
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:51,710
have unlimited money and you want to do
a good job of it unlimited money you

2380
00:46:51,710 --> 00:46:51,720
a good job of it unlimited money you
 

2381
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:53,569
a good job of it unlimited money you
would get a lot of really nice robots

2382
00:46:53,569 --> 00:46:53,579
would get a lot of really nice robots
 

2383
00:46:53,579 --> 00:46:57,710
would get a lot of really nice robots
but no humans are still far superior or

2384
00:46:57,710 --> 00:46:57,720
but no humans are still far superior or
 

2385
00:46:57,720 --> 00:47:00,829
but no humans are still far superior or
animals or animals but even right but

2386
00:47:00,829 --> 00:47:00,839
animals or animals but even right but
 

2387
00:47:00,839 --> 00:47:02,870
animals or animals but even right but
humans with animals together yeah you

2388
00:47:02,870 --> 00:47:02,880
humans with animals together yeah you
 

2389
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:04,730
humans with animals together yeah you
can't just have that's true dog with a

2390
00:47:04,730 --> 00:47:04,740
can't just have that's true dog with a
 

2391
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:05,589
can't just have that's true dog with a
hat

2392
00:47:05,589 --> 00:47:05,599
hat
 

2393
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:08,290
hat
that's fair

2394
00:47:08,290 --> 00:47:08,300
that's fair
 

2395
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:13,130
that's fair
but yes and but figuring out also how to

2396
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:13,140
but yes and but figuring out also how to
 

2397
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:15,790
but yes and but figuring out also how to
uh disable the mine

2398
00:47:15,790 --> 00:47:15,800
uh disable the mine
 

2399
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:18,230
uh disable the mine
obviously the easy thing the thing a

2400
00:47:18,230 --> 00:47:18,240
obviously the easy thing the thing a
 

2401
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:22,809
obviously the easy thing the thing a
robot can help with is to find the mine

2402
00:47:22,809 --> 00:47:22,819
robot can help with is to find the mine
 

2403
00:47:22,819 --> 00:47:27,050
robot can help with is to find the mine
and blow it up but that's gonna destroy

2404
00:47:27,050 --> 00:47:27,060
and blow it up but that's gonna destroy
 

2405
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:29,210
and blow it up but that's gonna destroy
the landscape that that really does a

2406
00:47:29,210 --> 00:47:29,220
the landscape that that really does a
 

2407
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:31,370
the landscape that that really does a
lot of damage to the land you want to uh

2408
00:47:31,370 --> 00:47:31,380
lot of damage to the land you want to uh
 

2409
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:33,410
lot of damage to the land you want to uh
disable the mine and to do that because

2410
00:47:33,410 --> 00:47:33,420
disable the mine and to do that because
 

2411
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:35,569
disable the mine and to do that because
of all the different all the different

2412
00:47:35,569 --> 00:47:35,579
of all the different all the different
 

2413
00:47:35,579 --> 00:47:38,089
of all the different all the different
edge cases of the problem it requires a

2414
00:47:38,089 --> 00:47:38,099
edge cases of the problem it requires a
 

2415
00:47:38,099 --> 00:47:40,309
edge cases of the problem it requires a
huge amount of human-like experience it

2416
00:47:40,309 --> 00:47:40,319
huge amount of human-like experience it
 

2417
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:42,589
huge amount of human-like experience it
seems like so it's mostly done by humans

2418
00:47:42,589 --> 00:47:42,599
seems like so it's mostly done by humans
 

2419
00:47:42,599 --> 00:47:44,270
seems like so it's mostly done by humans
they have no use for robots they don't

2420
00:47:44,270 --> 00:47:44,280
they have no use for robots they don't
 

2421
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:46,910
they have no use for robots they don't
want robots yeah I think we overestimate

2422
00:47:46,910 --> 00:47:46,920
want robots yeah I think we overestimate
 

2423
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:49,450
want robots yeah I think we overestimate
what we can automate

yeah that's it's weird I mean it's

2428
00:47:54,109 --> 00:47:54,119
yeah that's it's weird I mean it's
 

2429

yeah that's it's weird I mean it's

everything in the physical world
 

2435
00:48:00,599 --> 00:48:02,870
everything in the physical world
including driving we think everybody

2436
00:48:02,870 --> 00:48:02,880
including driving we think everybody
 

2437
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,150
including driving we think everybody
makes fun of themselves and others for

2438
00:48:05,150 --> 00:48:05,160
makes fun of themselves and others for
 

2439
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:06,890
makes fun of themselves and others for
being shitty drivers but we're actually

2440
00:48:06,890 --> 00:48:06,900
being shitty drivers but we're actually
 

2441
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:09,170
being shitty drivers but we're actually
kind of incredible no incredible and

2442
00:48:09,170 --> 00:48:09,180
kind of incredible no incredible and
 

2443
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:10,970
kind of incredible no incredible and
that's why like

2444
00:48:10,970 --> 00:48:10,980
that's why like
 

2445
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:12,950
that's why like
that's the way Tesla still says that if

2446
00:48:12,950 --> 00:48:12,960
that's the way Tesla still says that if
 

2447
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:15,050
that's the way Tesla still says that if
you're in the driver's seat like you you

2448
00:48:15,050 --> 00:48:15,060
you're in the driver's seat like you you
 

2449
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:17,870
you're in the driver's seat like you you
are ultimately responsible because the

00:48:17,870 --> 00:48:17,880
are ultimately responsible because the
 

2451
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:19,609
are ultimately responsible because the
ideal for I mean I mean you know more

00:48:19,619 --> 00:48:21,890
ideal for I mean I mean you know more
about this than I do but

2454
00:48:21,890 --> 00:48:21,900
about this than I do but
 

2455
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:25,609
about this than I do but
he like robot cars are great at

2456
00:48:25,609 --> 00:48:25,619
he like robot cars are great at
 

2457
00:48:25,619 --> 00:48:29,390
he like robot cars are great at
predictable things and can react faster

2458
00:48:29,390 --> 00:48:29,400
predictable things and can react faster
 

2459
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:31,790
predictable things and can react faster
and more precisely than a person and can

2460
00:48:31,790 --> 00:48:31,800
and more precisely than a person and can
 

2461
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:34,250
and more precisely than a person and can
do a lot of the driving and then the

2462
00:48:34,250 --> 00:48:34,260
do a lot of the driving and then the
 

2463
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:35,630
do a lot of the driving and then the
reason that we still don't have

2464
00:48:35,630 --> 00:48:35,640
reason that we still don't have
 

2465
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:37,490
reason that we still don't have
autonomous vehicles on all the roads yet

2466
00:48:37,490 --> 00:48:37,500
autonomous vehicles on all the roads yet
 

2467
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:40,250
autonomous vehicles on all the roads yet
is because of this long tail of just

2468
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:40,260
is because of this long tail of just
 

2469
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:42,589
is because of this long tail of just
unexpected occurrences where a human

unexpected occurrences where a human
 

2471
00:48:42,599 --> 00:48:44,510
unexpected occurrences where a human
immediately understands that's the

2472
00:48:44,510 --> 00:48:44,520
immediately understands that's the
 

2473
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:46,550
immediately understands that's the
sunset and not a traffic light that's a

2474
00:48:46,550 --> 00:48:46,560
sunset and not a traffic light that's a
 

2475
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:47,930
sunset and not a traffic light that's a
horse and carriage ahead of me on the

2476
00:48:47,930 --> 00:48:47,940
horse and carriage ahead of me on the
 

2477
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:49,370
horse and carriage ahead of me on the
highway but the car has never

2478
00:48:49,370 --> 00:48:49,380
highway but the car has never
 

2479
00:48:49,380 --> 00:48:51,290
highway but the car has never
encountered that before so like in

2480
00:48:51,290 --> 00:48:51,300
encountered that before so like in
 

2481
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:54,109
encountered that before so like in
theory combining those skill sets is

2482
00:48:54,109 --> 00:48:54,119
theory combining those skill sets is
 

2483
00:48:54,119 --> 00:48:56,870
theory combining those skill sets is
what's gonna really be powerful

2484
00:48:56,870 --> 00:48:56,880
what's gonna really be powerful
 

2485
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:59,030
what's gonna really be powerful
the only problem is figuring off the

2486
00:48:59,030 --> 00:48:59,040
the only problem is figuring off the
 

2487
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:00,530
the only problem is figuring off the
figuring out the human robot interaction

2488
00:49:00,530 --> 00:49:00,540
figuring out the human robot interaction
 

2489
00:49:00,540 --> 00:49:02,690
figuring out the human robot interaction
and the handoffs so like in cars that's

2490
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:02,700
and the handoffs so like in cars that's
 

2491
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:04,370
and the handoffs so like in cars that's
a huge problem right now figuring out

2492
00:49:04,370 --> 00:49:04,380
a huge problem right now figuring out
 

2493
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:06,050
a huge problem right now figuring out
the handoffs

2494
00:49:06,050 --> 00:49:06,060
the handoffs
 

2495
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:08,569
the handoffs
um but in other areas uh it might be

2496
00:49:08,569 --> 00:49:08,579
um but in other areas uh it might be
 

2497
00:49:08,579 --> 00:49:10,609
um but in other areas uh it might be
easier and that's really the future is

2498
00:49:10,609 --> 00:49:10,619
easier and that's really the future is
 

2499
00:49:10,619 --> 00:49:12,770
easier and that's really the future is
human robot interaction

2500
00:49:12,770 --> 00:49:12,780
human robot interaction
 

2501
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:14,870
human robot interaction
well it's really hard to improve

2502
00:49:14,870 --> 00:49:14,880
well it's really hard to improve
 

2503
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:17,930
well it's really hard to improve
it's it's it's terrible that people die

2504
00:49:17,930 --> 00:49:17,940
it's it's it's terrible that people die
 

2505
00:49:17,940 --> 00:49:18,890
it's it's it's terrible that people die
in car

2506
00:49:18,890 --> 00:49:18,900
in car
 

2507
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:22,849
in car
accidents but I mean it's like 70 80 100

2508
00:49:22,849 --> 00:49:22,859
accidents but I mean it's like 70 80 100
 

2509
00:49:22,859 --> 00:49:26,210
accidents but I mean it's like 70 80 100
million miles one death per

2510
00:49:26,210 --> 00:49:26,220
million miles one death per
 

2511
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:29,450
million miles one death per
uh 80 million miles that's like really

2512
00:49:29,450 --> 00:49:29,460
uh 80 million miles that's like really
 

2513
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:32,030
uh 80 million miles that's like really
hard to beat for a robot that's that's

2514
00:49:32,030 --> 00:49:32,040
hard to beat for a robot that's that's
 

2515
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:34,190
hard to beat for a robot that's that's
like incredible that like think about it

2516
00:49:34,190 --> 00:49:34,200
like incredible that like think about it
 

2517
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:37,790
like incredible that like think about it
like the how many people the just the

2518
00:49:37,790 --> 00:49:37,800
like the how many people the just the
 

2519
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:38,990
like the how many people the just the
number of people throughout the world

2520
00:49:38,990 --> 00:49:39,000
number of people throughout the world
 

2521
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,750
number of people throughout the world
that are driving every single day all

2522
00:49:41,750 --> 00:49:41,760
that are driving every single day all
 

2523
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:46,150
that are driving every single day all
this you know Steve deprived drunk

2524
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:46,160
this you know Steve deprived drunk
 

2525
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:51,050
this you know Steve deprived drunk
uh distracted all of that and still very

2526
00:49:51,050 --> 00:49:51,060
uh distracted all of that and still very
 

2527
00:49:51,060 --> 00:49:52,970
uh distracted all of that and still very
few die relative to what I would imagine

2528
00:49:52,970 --> 00:49:52,980
few die relative to what I would imagine
 

2529
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:56,089
few die relative to what I would imagine
if I were to guess back in the horse see

2530
00:49:56,089 --> 00:49:56,099
if I were to guess back in the horse see
 

2531
00:49:56,099 --> 00:49:57,710
if I were to guess back in the horse see
when I was like in the in the beginning

2532
00:49:57,710 --> 00:49:57,720
when I was like in the in the beginning
 

2533
00:49:57,720 --> 00:50:00,230
when I was like in the in the beginning
of the 20th century riding my horse I

2534
00:50:00,230 --> 00:50:00,240
of the 20th century riding my horse I
 

2535
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:02,450
of the 20th century riding my horse I
would talk so much [\h__\h] about these cars

2536
00:50:02,450 --> 00:50:02,460
would talk so much [\h__\h] about these cars
 

2537
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:04,130
would talk so much [\h__\h] about these cars
I'd be like this is gonna this is

2538
00:50:04,130 --> 00:50:04,140
I'd be like this is gonna this is
 

2539
00:50:04,140 --> 00:50:06,010
I'd be like this is gonna this is
extremely dangerous these machines

2540
00:50:06,010 --> 00:50:06,020
extremely dangerous these machines
 

2541
00:50:06,020 --> 00:50:08,210
extremely dangerous these machines
traveling at 30 miles an hour or

2542
00:50:08,210 --> 00:50:08,220
traveling at 30 miles an hour or
 

2543
00:50:08,220 --> 00:50:10,670
traveling at 30 miles an hour or
whatever the hell they're going at this

2544
00:50:10,670 --> 00:50:10,680
whatever the hell they're going at this
 

2545
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:13,849
whatever the hell they're going at this
is irresponsible it's unnatural and and

2546
00:50:13,849 --> 00:50:13,859
is irresponsible it's unnatural and and
 

2547
00:50:13,859 --> 00:50:15,710
is irresponsible it's unnatural and and
it's going to be destructive to all of

2548
00:50:15,710 --> 00:50:15,720
it's going to be destructive to all of
 

2549
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:17,690
it's going to be destructive to all of
human society but then it's extremely

2550
00:50:17,690 --> 00:50:17,700
human society but then it's extremely
 

2551
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:19,730
human society but then it's extremely
surprising how humans adapt to the thing

2552
00:50:19,730 --> 00:50:19,740
surprising how humans adapt to the thing
 

2553
00:50:19,740 --> 00:50:22,730
surprising how humans adapt to the thing
and they know how to not kill each other

2554
00:50:22,730 --> 00:50:22,740
and they know how to not kill each other
 

2555
00:50:22,740 --> 00:50:26,270
and they know how to not kill each other
um I mean that at ability to adapt is

2556
00:50:26,270 --> 00:50:26,280
um I mean that at ability to adapt is
 

2557
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:29,150
um I mean that at ability to adapt is
incredible and to mimic that in the

2558
00:50:29,150 --> 00:50:29,160
incredible and to mimic that in the
 

2559
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:31,069
incredible and to mimic that in the
machine is really tricky

2560
00:50:31,069 --> 00:50:31,079
machine is really tricky
 

2561
00:50:31,079 --> 00:50:34,550
machine is really tricky
now that said what Tesla is doing it I

2562
00:50:34,550 --> 00:50:34,560
now that said what Tesla is doing it I
 

2563
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:35,990
now that said what Tesla is doing it I
mean I wouldn't have guessed how far

2564
00:50:35,990 --> 00:50:36,000
mean I wouldn't have guessed how far
 

2565
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,089
mean I wouldn't have guessed how far
machine learning can go on Vision alone

2566
00:50:38,089 --> 00:50:38,099
machine learning can go on Vision alone
 

2567
00:50:38,099 --> 00:50:40,309
machine learning can go on Vision alone
it's really really incredible and people

2568
00:50:40,309 --> 00:50:40,319
it's really really incredible and people
 

2569
00:50:40,319 --> 00:50:41,809
it's really really incredible and people
that are

2570
00:50:41,809 --> 00:50:41,819
that are
 

2571
00:50:41,819 --> 00:50:44,510
that are
at least from my perspective people that

2572
00:50:44,510 --> 00:50:44,520
at least from my perspective people that
 

2573
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:46,250
at least from my perspective people that
are kind of um

2574
00:50:46,250 --> 00:50:46,260
are kind of um
 

2575
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:51,470
are kind of um
uh you know critical of Elon and those

2576
00:50:51,470 --> 00:50:51,480
uh you know critical of Elon and those
 

2577
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:52,730
uh you know critical of Elon and those
efforts

2578
00:50:52,730 --> 00:50:52,740
efforts
 

2579
00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:54,650
efforts
I think don't give enough credit how

2580
00:50:54,650 --> 00:50:54,660
I think don't give enough credit how
 

2581
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:56,210
I think don't give enough credit how
much progress we made some how much

2582
00:50:56,210 --> 00:50:56,220
much progress we made some how much
 

2583
00:50:56,220 --> 00:50:58,250
much progress we made some how much
incredible progress has been made in

2584
00:50:58,250 --> 00:50:58,260
incredible progress has been made in
 

2585
00:50:58,260 --> 00:50:59,930
incredible progress has been made in
that direction I think most of the

2586
00:50:59,930 --> 00:50:59,940
that direction I think most of the
 

2587
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:01,490
that direction I think most of the
robotics Community wouldn't have guessed

2588
00:51:01,490 --> 00:51:01,500
robotics Community wouldn't have guessed
 

2589
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:03,950
robotics Community wouldn't have guessed
how much you can do on Vision alone it's

2590
00:51:03,950 --> 00:51:03,960
how much you can do on Vision alone it's
 

2591
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:05,990
how much you can do on Vision alone it's
kind of incredible

2592
00:51:05,990 --> 00:51:06,000
kind of incredible
 

2593
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,930
kind of incredible
um because we would be I think it's that

2594
00:51:08,930 --> 00:51:08,940
um because we would be I think it's that
 

2595
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:12,650
um because we would be I think it's that
approach which is relatively unique

2596
00:51:12,650 --> 00:51:12,660
approach which is relatively unique
 

2597
00:51:12,660 --> 00:51:15,470
approach which is relatively unique
has challenged the other competitors to

2598
00:51:15,470 --> 00:51:15,480
has challenged the other competitors to
 

2599
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:17,510
has challenged the other competitors to
step up their game so if you're using

2600
00:51:17,510 --> 00:51:17,520
step up their game so if you're using
 

2601
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:20,990
step up their game so if you're using
lidar if you're using mapping

2602
00:51:20,990 --> 00:51:21,000
lidar if you're using mapping
 

2603
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:24,290
lidar if you're using mapping
um that challenges them to do

2604
00:51:24,290 --> 00:51:24,300
um that challenges them to do
 

2605
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:28,010
um that challenges them to do
better to scale faster and to use

2606
00:51:28,010 --> 00:51:28,020
better to scale faster and to use
 

2607
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:30,049
better to scale faster and to use
machine learning and computer vision as

2608
00:51:30,049 --> 00:51:30,059
machine learning and computer vision as
 

2609
00:51:30,059 --> 00:51:32,390
machine learning and computer vision as
well to integrate both lidar and vision

2610
00:51:32,390 --> 00:51:32,400
well to integrate both lidar and vision
 

2611
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:33,890
well to integrate both lidar and vision
so

2612
00:51:33,890 --> 00:51:33,900
so
 

2613
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:37,549
so
um it's kind of incredible and I'm not

2614
00:51:37,549 --> 00:51:37,559
um it's kind of incredible and I'm not
 

2615
00:51:37,559 --> 00:51:39,589
um it's kind of incredible and I'm not
I don't know if I even have a good

2616
00:51:39,589 --> 00:51:39,599
I don't know if I even have a good
 

2617
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:42,890
I don't know if I even have a good
intuition of how hard driving is anymore

2618
00:51:42,890 --> 00:51:42,900
intuition of how hard driving is anymore
 

2619
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:45,349
intuition of how hard driving is anymore
maybe it is possible to solve

2620
00:51:45,349 --> 00:51:45,359
maybe it is possible to solve
 

2621
00:51:45,359 --> 00:51:48,829
maybe it is possible to solve
so all the stuff you mentioned yeah the

2622
00:51:48,829 --> 00:51:48,839
so all the stuff you mentioned yeah the
 

2623
00:51:48,839 --> 00:51:50,569
so all the stuff you mentioned yeah the
question is one yeah I think it's not

2624
00:51:50,569 --> 00:51:50,579
question is one yeah I think it's not
 

2625
00:51:50,579 --> 00:51:52,370
question is one yeah I think it's not
happening as quickly as people thought

2626
00:51:52,370 --> 00:51:52,380
happening as quickly as people thought
 

2627
00:51:52,380 --> 00:51:54,589
happening as quickly as people thought
it would because it is more complicated

2628
00:51:54,589 --> 00:51:54,599
it would because it is more complicated
 

2629
00:51:54,599 --> 00:51:56,930
it would because it is more complicated
but I wouldn't have

2630
00:51:56,930 --> 00:51:56,940
but I wouldn't have
 

2631
00:51:56,940 --> 00:52:00,470
but I wouldn't have
I I agree with you my current intuition

2632
00:52:00,470 --> 00:52:00,480
I I agree with you my current intuition
 

2633
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:03,230
I I agree with you my current intuition
is that we're gonna get there I think

2634
00:52:03,230 --> 00:52:03,240
is that we're gonna get there I think
 

2635
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:05,150
is that we're gonna get there I think
we're gonna get there too but I didn't

2636
00:52:05,150 --> 00:52:05,160
we're gonna get there too but I didn't
 

2637
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:09,170
we're gonna get there too but I didn't
before I wasn't sure we're gonna get

2638
00:52:09,170 --> 00:52:09,180
before I wasn't sure we're gonna get
 

2639
00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:12,170
before I wasn't sure we're gonna get
there without like with current

2640
00:52:12,170 --> 00:52:12,180
there without like with current
 

2641
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:13,730
there without like with current
technology

2642
00:52:13,730 --> 00:52:13,740
technology
 

2643
00:52:13,740 --> 00:52:17,750
technology
so you know I I was kind of this is like

2644
00:52:17,750 --> 00:52:17,760
so you know I I was kind of this is like
 

2645
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:21,109
so you know I I was kind of this is like
with vision alone I my intuition was

2646
00:52:21,109 --> 00:52:21,119
with vision alone I my intuition was
 

2647
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:23,750
with vision alone I my intuition was
you're gonna have to solve like Common

2648
00:52:23,750 --> 00:52:23,760
you're gonna have to solve like Common
 

2649
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:25,430
you're gonna have to solve like Common
Sense reasoning

2650
00:52:25,430 --> 00:52:25,440
Sense reasoning
 

2651
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:27,589
Sense reasoning
you're gonna have to you're gonna have

2652
00:52:27,589 --> 00:52:27,599
you're gonna have to you're gonna have
 

2653
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:29,030
you're gonna have to you're gonna have
to solve some of the big problems in

2654
00:52:29,030 --> 00:52:29,040
to solve some of the big problems in
 

2655
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:31,730
to solve some of the big problems in
artificial intelligence not just

2656
00:52:31,730 --> 00:52:31,740
artificial intelligence not just
 

2657
00:52:31,740 --> 00:52:34,849
artificial intelligence not just
uh not just perception

2658
00:52:34,849 --> 00:52:34,859
uh not just perception
 

2659
00:52:34,859 --> 00:52:36,710
uh not just perception
yeah like you have to have a deep

2660
00:52:36,710 --> 00:52:36,720
yeah like you have to have a deep
 

2661
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,450
yeah like you have to have a deep
understanding of the world it's always

2662
00:52:38,450 --> 00:52:38,460
understanding of the world it's always
 

2663
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:40,670
understanding of the world it's always
my sense but now I'm starting to like

2664
00:52:40,670 --> 00:52:40,680
my sense but now I'm starting to like
 

2665
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:42,470
my sense but now I'm starting to like
well this I mean I'm continuously

2666
00:52:42,470 --> 00:52:42,480
well this I mean I'm continuously
 

2667
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:44,390
well this I mean I'm continuously
surprised how well the thing works yeah

2668
00:52:44,390 --> 00:52:44,400
surprised how well the thing works yeah
 

2669
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:46,970
surprised how well the thing works yeah
obviously Elon and others others have

2670
00:52:46,970 --> 00:52:46,980
obviously Elon and others others have
 

2671
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:49,430
obviously Elon and others others have
stopped but Elon continues you know

2672
00:52:49,430 --> 00:52:49,440
stopped but Elon continues you know
 

2673
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:50,809
stopped but Elon continues you know
saying we're going to solve it in a year

2674
00:52:50,809 --> 00:52:50,819
saying we're going to solve it in a year
 

2675
00:52:50,819 --> 00:52:53,870
saying we're going to solve it in a year
oh yeah that's the thing bold

2676
00:52:53,870 --> 00:52:53,880
oh yeah that's the thing bold
 

2677
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:56,089
oh yeah that's the thing bold
predictions though yeah well everyone

2678
00:52:56,089 --> 00:52:56,099
predictions though yeah well everyone
 

2679
00:52:56,099 --> 00:52:57,890
predictions though yeah well everyone
else used to be doing that but they kind

2680
00:52:57,890 --> 00:52:57,900
else used to be doing that but they kind
 

2681
00:52:57,900 --> 00:53:00,530
else used to be doing that but they kind
of like all right yeah or maybe more

2682
00:53:00,530 --> 00:53:00,540
of like all right yeah or maybe more
 

2683
00:53:00,540 --> 00:53:02,510
of like all right yeah or maybe more
maybe let's not promise we're gonna

2684
00:53:02,510 --> 00:53:02,520
maybe let's not promise we're gonna
 

2685
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:05,329
maybe let's not promise we're gonna
solve uh level four driving by 2020.

2686
00:53:05,329 --> 00:53:05,339
solve uh level four driving by 2020.
 

2687
00:53:05,339 --> 00:53:08,089
solve uh level four driving by 2020.
let's uh let's chill on that but people

2688
00:53:08,089 --> 00:53:08,099
let's uh let's chill on that but people
 

2689
00:53:08,099 --> 00:53:10,609
let's uh let's chill on that but people
are still trying silently I mean the UK

2690
00:53:10,609 --> 00:53:10,619
are still trying silently I mean the UK
 

2691
00:53:10,619 --> 00:53:15,230
are still trying silently I mean the UK
just committed 100 million pounds to

2692
00:53:15,230 --> 00:53:15,240
just committed 100 million pounds to
 

2693
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:17,809
just committed 100 million pounds to
research and development to speed up the

2694
00:53:17,809 --> 00:53:17,819
research and development to speed up the
 

2695
00:53:17,819 --> 00:53:19,370
research and development to speed up the
process of getting autonomous vehicles

2696
00:53:19,370 --> 00:53:19,380
process of getting autonomous vehicles
 

2697
00:53:19,380 --> 00:53:21,589
process of getting autonomous vehicles
on the road like everyone is everyone

2698
00:53:21,589 --> 00:53:21,599
on the road like everyone is everyone
 

2699
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:24,170
on the road like everyone is everyone
can see that it is solvable and it's

2700
00:53:24,170 --> 00:53:24,180
can see that it is solvable and it's
 

2701
00:53:24,180 --> 00:53:25,430
can see that it is solvable and it's
going to happen and it's going to change

in it and uh like waymo Loki has
 

2707
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:36,410
in it and uh like waymo Loki has
driverless cars in in Arizona

like discuss this at all let's not
discuss the fact that this is a robot

2770
00:54:53,030 --> 00:54:53,040
discuss the fact that this is a robot
 

2771
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:55,130
discuss the fact that this is a robot
driving you and you're in the back and

2772
00:54:55,130 --> 00:54:55,140
driving you and you're in the back and
 

2773
00:54:55,140 --> 00:54:56,809
driving you and you're in the back and
if the robot wants to start driving 80

2774
00:54:56,809 --> 00:54:56,819
if the robot wants to start driving 80
 

2775
00:54:56,819 --> 00:54:58,790
if the robot wants to start driving 80
miles an hour and run off of a bridge

2776
00:54:58,790 --> 00:54:58,800
miles an hour and run off of a bridge
 

2777
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:01,490
miles an hour and run off of a bridge
you have no recourse let's not discuss

2778
00:55:01,490 --> 00:55:01,500
you have no recourse let's not discuss
 

2779

you have no recourse let's not discuss
this you're just getting in the back

2780
00:55:03,230 --> 00:55:03,240
this you're just getting in the back
 

2781
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:05,270
this you're just getting in the back
there's no discussion about like how

2782

there's nothing there's like a map
 

2787
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:13,010
there's nothing there's like a map
showing what the car can see

showing what the car can see
 

2789
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:15,290
showing what the car can see
like you know what happens if it's like

2790
00:55:15,290 --> 00:55:15,300
like you know what happens if it's like
 

2791

like you know what happens if it's like
uh a HAL 9000 situation like I'm like

2792
00:55:19,609 --> 00:55:19,619
uh a HAL 9000 situation like I'm like
 

2793
00:55:19,619 --> 00:55:22,549
uh a HAL 9000 situation like I'm like
I'm sorry I can't you have a button you

2794
00:55:22,549 --> 00:55:22,559
I'm sorry I can't you have a button you
 

2795

can like call customer service oh God
 

2797
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:26,809
can like call customer service oh God
then you get put on hold for two hours

2798
00:55:26,809 --> 00:55:26,819
then you get put on hold for two hours
 

2799
00:55:26,819 --> 00:55:29,690
then you get put on hold for two hours
yeah probably

2800
00:55:29,690 --> 00:55:29,700
yeah probably
 

2801
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:31,549
yeah probably
um but you know currently what they're

2802
00:55:31,549 --> 00:55:31,559
um but you know currently what they're
 

2803
00:55:31,559 --> 00:55:33,470
um but you know currently what they're
doing which I think

2804
00:55:33,470 --> 00:55:33,480
doing which I think
 

2805
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:35,750
doing which I think
is understandable but you know the car

2806
00:55:35,750 --> 00:55:35,760
is understandable but you know the car
 

2807
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:38,870
is understandable but you know the car
just can pull over and stop and wait for

2808
00:55:38,870 --> 00:55:38,880
just can pull over and stop and wait for
 

2809
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:40,730
just can pull over and stop and wait for
help to arrive and then a driver will

2810
00:55:40,730 --> 00:55:40,740
help to arrive and then a driver will
 

2811
00:55:40,740 --> 00:55:42,109
help to arrive and then a driver will
come and then they'll actually drive the

2812
00:55:42,109 --> 00:55:42,119
come and then they'll actually drive the
 

2813
00:55:42,119 --> 00:55:44,510
come and then they'll actually drive the
car for you but that's like you know

2814
00:55:44,510 --> 00:55:44,520
car for you but that's like you know

2997
00:59:13,859 --> 00:59:15,289
consumers and manipulating people
because suddenly you'll have these

2998
00:59:15,289 --> 00:59:15,299
because suddenly you'll have these
 

2999
00:59:15,299 --> 00:59:17,089
because suddenly you'll have these
agents that people will talk to and they

3000
00:59:17,089 --> 00:59:17,099
agents that people will talk to and they
 

3001
00:59:17,099 --> 00:59:19,849
agents that people will talk to and they
won't care or won't know

3002
00:59:19,849 --> 00:59:19,859
won't care or won't know
 

3003
00:59:19,859 --> 00:59:21,530
won't care or won't know
at least on a conscious level that it's

3004
00:59:21,530 --> 00:59:21,540
at least on a conscious level that it's
 

3005
00:59:21,540 --> 00:59:23,210
at least on a conscious level that it's
recording the conversations so kind of

3006
00:59:23,210 --> 00:59:23,220
recording the conversations so kind of
 

3007
00:59:23,220 --> 00:59:25,609
recording the conversations so kind of
like we were talking about before

3008
00:59:25,609 --> 00:59:25,619
like we were talking about before
 

3009
00:59:25,619 --> 00:59:27,470
like we were talking about before
um and at the same time the technology

3010
00:59:27,470 --> 00:59:27,480
um and at the same time the technology
 

3011
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:29,930
um and at the same time the technology
is so freaking exciting that it's going

3012
00:59:29,930 --> 00:59:29,940
is so freaking exciting that it's going
 

3013
00:59:29,940 --> 00:59:31,849
is so freaking exciting that it's going
to get adopted it's not even just a

3014
00:59:31,849 --> 00:59:31,859
to get adopted it's not even just a
 

3015
00:59:31,859 --> 00:59:33,289
to get adopted it's not even just a
collection of data but the ability to

3016
00:59:33,289 --> 00:59:33,299
collection of data but the ability to
 

3017
00:59:33,299 --> 00:59:35,329
collection of data but the ability to
manipulate

3018
00:59:35,329 --> 00:59:35,339
manipulate
 

3019
00:59:35,339 --> 00:59:37,609

at scale
so um what do you think about the AI

3022
00:59:40,849 --> 00:59:40,859
so um what do you think about the AI
 

3023
00:59:40,859 --> 00:59:45,289
so um what do you think about the AI

the state of AI but she has

3044
01:00:09,170 --> 01:00:09,180
the state of AI but she has
 

3045
01:00:09,180 --> 01:00:11,630

looking at
 

3049
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:18,589
looking at
uh AI explaining that it's a squirrel oh

3050

yeah because the transcripts that the
 

3053
01:00:21,420 --> 01:00:22,670
yeah because the transcripts that the
engineer released

3054

engineer released
 

3055
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:24,770
engineer released
Lambda kind of talks about the

3056
01:00:24,770 --> 01:00:24,780
Lambda kind of talks about the
 

3057
01:00:24,780 --> 01:00:27,490
Lambda kind of talks about the
experience of

3058
01:00:27,490 --> 01:00:27,500
experience of
 

3059
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:30,109

human-like feelings and I think even
 

3061
01:00:30,119 --> 01:00:32,930
human-like feelings and I think even
consciousness and so she was like oh

3062
01:00:32,930 --> 01:00:32,940
consciousness and so she was like oh
 

3063
01:00:32,940 --> 01:00:34,910
consciousness and so she was like oh
cool that's impressive I wonder if an AI

3064
01:00:34,910 --> 01:00:34,920
cool that's impressive I wonder if an AI
 

3065

two things to note about it are first of
 

3141
01:01:57,780 --> 01:01:58,970
two things to note about it are first of
all just because the machine is

3142
01:01:58,970 --> 01:01:58,980
all just because the machine is

describing an experience doesn't mean it
 

3145
01:02:00,540 --> 01:02:02,690
describing an experience doesn't mean it
can it actually has that experience but

3146

people
 

3155
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:14,630
people
that's I mean just the implications for

3156
01:02:14,630 --> 01:02:14,640
that's I mean just the implications for
 

3157
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:17,470
that's I mean just the implications for

entertainment gaming like I just like

3160
01:02:20,510 --> 01:02:20,520
entertainment gaming like I just like
 

3161
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:22,730
entertainment gaming like I just like
all of the applications it's

3162
01:02:22,730 --> 01:02:22,740
all of the applications it's
 

3163
01:02:22,740 --> 01:02:24,230
all of the applications it's
mind-boggling what we're going to be

3164
01:02:24,230 --> 01:02:24,240
mind-boggling what we're going to be
 

3165
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:26,390
mind-boggling what we're going to be
able to do with this and and that my

3166
01:02:26,390 --> 01:02:26,400
able to do with this and and that my
 

3167
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:28,309
able to do with this and and that my
kids are not going to remember a time

3168
01:02:28,309 --> 01:02:28,319
kids are not going to remember a time
 

3169
01:02:28,319 --> 01:02:30,710
kids are not going to remember a time
before they could have conversations

3170
01:02:30,710 --> 01:02:30,720
before they could have conversations
 

3171
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:33,710
before they could have conversations
with artificial agents do you think they

3172
01:02:33,710 --> 01:02:33,720
with artificial agents do you think they
 

3173
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:37,250
with artificial agents do you think they
would because to me this is uh

3174
01:02:37,250 --> 01:02:37,260
would because to me this is uh
 

3175
01:02:37,260 --> 01:02:39,170
would because to me this is uh
the focus in the ad Community has been

3176
01:02:39,170 --> 01:02:39,180
the focus in the ad Community has been
 

3177
01:02:39,180 --> 01:02:41,089
the focus in the ad Community has been
well this engineer

3178
01:02:41,089 --> 01:02:41,099
well this engineer

Shirley's hallucinating the thing is not

3180
01:02:43,370 --> 01:02:43,380
Shirley's hallucinating the thing is not
 

3181
01:02:43,380 --> 01:02:44,690
Shirley's hallucinating the thing is not
sentient

3182
01:02:44,690 --> 01:02:44,700
sentient
 

3183
01:02:44,700 --> 01:02:49,309
sentient
but to me I first of all it doesn't

3184
01:02:49,309 --> 01:02:49,319
but to me I first of all it doesn't
 

3185
01:02:49,319 --> 01:02:51,770
but to me I first of all it doesn't
matter if he is or not this is coming

3186
01:02:51,770 --> 01:02:51,780
matter if he is or not this is coming
 

3187
01:02:51,780 --> 01:02:54,049
matter if he is or not this is coming
yeah where a large number of people

3188
01:02:54,049 --> 01:02:54,059
yeah where a large number of people
 

3189
01:02:54,059 --> 01:02:56,770
yeah where a large number of people
would believe a system has sent you

3190
01:02:56,770 --> 01:02:56,780
would believe a system has sent you
 

3191
01:02:56,780 --> 01:02:59,089
would believe a system has sent you

including Engineers within companies
 

3193
01:02:59,099 --> 01:03:01,849
including Engineers within companies
yeah so in that sense you start to think

3194
01:03:01,849 --> 01:03:01,859
yeah so in that sense you start to think
 

3195
01:03:01,859 --> 01:03:04,069
yeah so in that sense you start to think
about a world where like your kids

3196
01:03:04,069 --> 01:03:04,079
about a world where like your kids
 

3197
01:03:04,079 --> 01:03:06,049
about a world where like your kids
aren't just used to having a

3198
01:03:06,049 --> 01:03:06,059
aren't just used to having a
 

3199
01:03:06,059 --> 01:03:08,089
aren't just used to having a
conversation with the bot but used to

3200
01:03:08,089 --> 01:03:08,099
conversation with the bot but used to
 

3201
01:03:08,099 --> 01:03:10,789
conversation with the bot but used to
believing kind of

3202
01:03:10,789 --> 01:03:10,799
believing kind of
 

3203
01:03:10,799 --> 01:03:12,950
believing kind of
having an implied belief that the thing

3204
01:03:12,950 --> 01:03:12,960
having an implied belief that the thing
 

3205
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:14,210
having an implied belief that the thing
is sentient

3206
01:03:14,210 --> 01:03:14,220
is sentient
 

3207
01:03:14,220 --> 01:03:16,190
is sentient
yeah I think I think that's true and I

3208
01:03:16,190 --> 01:03:16,200
yeah I think I think that's true and I
 

3209
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:17,030
yeah I think I think that's true and I
think that

3210
01:03:17,030 --> 01:03:17,040
think that
 

3211
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:18,950
think that
one of the things that bothered me about

3212
01:03:18,950 --> 01:03:18,960
one of the things that bothered me about
 

3213
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:20,510
one of the things that bothered me about
all of the coverage in the tech press

3214
01:03:20,510 --> 01:03:20,520
all of the coverage in the tech press
 

3215
01:03:20,520 --> 01:03:23,329
all of the coverage in the tech press
about this incident like obviously I

3216
01:03:23,329 --> 01:03:23,339
about this incident like obviously I
 

3217
01:03:23,339 --> 01:03:24,770
about this incident like obviously I
don't believe the system is sentient

3218
01:03:24,770 --> 01:03:24,780
don't believe the system is sentient
 

3219
01:03:24,780 --> 01:03:26,990
don't believe the system is sentient
like I think that it can convincingly

3220
01:03:26,990 --> 01:03:27,000
like I think that it can convincingly
 

3221
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,609
like I think that it can convincingly
describe that it is I don't think it's

3222
01:03:28,609 --> 01:03:28,619
describe that it is I don't think it's
 

3223
01:03:28,619 --> 01:03:31,609
describe that it is I don't think it's
doing what he thought it was doing and

3224
01:03:31,609 --> 01:03:31,619
doing what he thought it was doing and
 

3225
01:03:31,619 --> 01:03:34,370
doing what he thought it was doing and
actually experiencing feelings but a lot

3226
01:03:34,370 --> 01:03:34,380
actually experiencing feelings but a lot
 

3227
01:03:34,380 --> 01:03:37,130
actually experiencing feelings but a lot
of the tech press was about how he was

3228
01:03:37,130 --> 01:03:37,140
of the tech press was about how he was
 

3229
01:03:37,140 --> 01:03:40,490
of the tech press was about how he was
wrong and depicting him as kind of naive

3230
01:03:40,490 --> 01:03:40,500
wrong and depicting him as kind of naive
 

3231
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:44,150
wrong and depicting him as kind of naive
and it's not naive like there's so much

3232
01:03:44,150 --> 01:03:44,160
and it's not naive like there's so much
 

3233
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:46,549
and it's not naive like there's so much
research in my field showing that people

3234
01:03:46,549 --> 01:03:46,559
research in my field showing that people
 

3235
01:03:46,559 --> 01:03:49,609
research in my field showing that people
do this even experts they they might be

3236
01:03:49,609 --> 01:03:49,619
do this even experts they they might be
 

3237
01:03:49,619 --> 01:03:51,049
do this even experts they they might be
very clinical when they're doing human

3238
01:03:51,049 --> 01:03:51,059
very clinical when they're doing human
 

3239
01:03:51,059 --> 01:03:53,150
very clinical when they're doing human
robot interaction experiments with a

3240
01:03:53,150 --> 01:03:53,160
robot interaction experiments with a
 

3241
01:03:53,160 --> 01:03:54,829
robot interaction experiments with a
robot that they've built and then you

3242
01:03:54,829 --> 01:03:54,839
robot that they've built and then you
 

3243
01:03:54,839 --> 01:03:56,089
robot that they've built and then you
bring in a different robot and they're

3244
01:03:56,089 --> 01:03:56,099
bring in a different robot and they're
 

3245
01:03:56,099 --> 01:03:57,349
bring in a different robot and they're
like oh look

3246
01:03:57,349 --> 01:03:57,359
like oh look
 

3247
01:03:57,359 --> 01:03:58,609
like oh look
it on it's doing this like that happens

3248
01:03:58,609 --> 01:03:58,619
it on it's doing this like that happens
 

3249
01:03:58,619 --> 01:04:01,190
it on it's doing this like that happens
in our lab all the time

3250
01:04:01,190 --> 01:04:01,200
in our lab all the time
 

3251
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:05,809
in our lab all the time
we are all this guy and it's gonna it's

3252
01:04:05,809 --> 01:04:05,819
we are all this guy and it's gonna it's
 

3253
01:04:05,819 --> 01:04:07,849
we are all this guy and it's gonna it's
gonna be huge so I think that

3254
01:04:07,849 --> 01:04:07,859
gonna be huge so I think that
 

3255
01:04:07,859 --> 01:04:11,089
gonna be huge so I think that
the the goal is not to discourage this

3256
01:04:11,089 --> 01:04:11,099
the the goal is not to discourage this
 

3257
01:04:11,099 --> 01:04:13,849
the the goal is not to discourage this
kind of belief or like Design Systems

3258
01:04:13,849 --> 01:04:13,859
kind of belief or like Design Systems
 

3259
01:04:13,859 --> 01:04:15,650
kind of belief or like Design Systems
that people won't think are sentient I

3260
01:04:15,650 --> 01:04:15,660
that people won't think are sentient I
 

3261
01:04:15,660 --> 01:04:17,089
that people won't think are sentient I
don't think that's possible I think

3262
01:04:17,089 --> 01:04:17,099
don't think that's possible I think
 

3263
01:04:17,099 --> 01:04:19,010
don't think that's possible I think
you're right this is coming it's

3264
01:04:19,010 --> 01:04:19,020
you're right this is coming it's
 

3265
01:04:19,020 --> 01:04:21,109
you're right this is coming it's
something that we have to acknowledge

3266
01:04:21,109 --> 01:04:21,119
something that we have to acknowledge
 

3267
01:04:21,119 --> 01:04:22,910
something that we have to acknowledge
and even embrace

3268
01:04:22,910 --> 01:04:22,920
and even embrace
 

3269
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:26,510
and even embrace
and be very aware of so one of the

3270
01:04:26,510 --> 01:04:26,520
and be very aware of so one of the
 

3271
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:28,670
and be very aware of so one of the
really interesting perspectives that

3272
01:04:28,670 --> 01:04:28,680
really interesting perspectives that
 

3273
01:04:28,680 --> 01:04:30,230
really interesting perspectives that
your book takes

3274
01:04:30,230 --> 01:04:30,240
your book takes
 

3275
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:34,250
your book takes
on a system like this is to see them not

3276
01:04:34,250 --> 01:04:34,260
on a system like this is to see them not
 

3277
01:04:34,260 --> 01:04:35,930
on a system like this is to see them not
to compare something like this to humans

3278
01:04:35,930 --> 01:04:35,940
to compare something like this to humans
 

3279
01:04:35,940 --> 01:04:38,510
to compare something like this to humans
but to compare it to animals of how we

3280
01:04:38,510 --> 01:04:38,520
but to compare it to animals of how we
 

3281
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:41,690
but to compare it to animals of how we
see animals can you kind of try to again

3282
01:04:41,690 --> 01:04:41,700
see animals can you kind of try to again
 

3283
01:04:41,700 --> 01:04:44,150
see animals can you kind of try to again
sneak up try to explain why this analogy

3284
01:04:44,150 --> 01:04:44,160
sneak up try to explain why this analogy
 

3285
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:46,490
sneak up try to explain why this analogy
is better than the human analogy the

3286
01:04:46,490 --> 01:04:46,500
is better than the human analogy the
 

3287
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:50,030
is better than the human analogy the
analogy of robots as animals yeah and it

3288
01:04:50,030 --> 01:04:50,040
analogy of robots as animals yeah and it
 

3289
01:04:50,040 --> 01:04:52,010
analogy of robots as animals yeah and it
gets trickier with the language stuff

3290
01:04:52,010 --> 01:04:52,020
gets trickier with the language stuff
 

3291
01:04:52,020 --> 01:04:53,990
gets trickier with the language stuff
but we'll get into that too

3292
01:04:53,990 --> 01:04:54,000
but we'll get into that too
 

3293
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:54,589
but we'll get into that too
um

3294
01:04:54,589 --> 01:04:54,599
um
 

3295
01:04:54,599 --> 01:04:58,430
um
I think that animals are a really great

3296
01:04:58,430 --> 01:04:58,440
I think that animals are a really great
 

3297
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:00,230
I think that animals are a really great
thought experiment when we're thinking

3298
01:05:00,230 --> 01:05:00,240
thought experiment when we're thinking
 

3299
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:02,930
thought experiment when we're thinking
about Ai and Robotics because again this

3300
01:05:02,930 --> 01:05:02,940
about Ai and Robotics because again this
 

3301
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:04,670
about Ai and Robotics because again this
comparing them to humans that leads us

3302
01:05:04,670 --> 01:05:04,680
comparing them to humans that leads us
 

3303
01:05:04,680 --> 01:05:06,650
comparing them to humans that leads us
down the wrong path both because it's

3304
01:05:06,650 --> 01:05:06,660
down the wrong path both because it's
 

3305
01:05:06,660 --> 01:05:08,390
down the wrong path both because it's
not accurate but also I think for the

3306
01:05:08,390 --> 01:05:08,400
not accurate but also I think for the
 

3307
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:10,730
not accurate but also I think for the
future we don't want that

3308
01:05:10,730 --> 01:05:10,740
future we don't want that
 

3309
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:12,349
future we don't want that
we want something that's a supplement

3310
01:05:12,349 --> 01:05:12,359
we want something that's a supplement
 

3311
01:05:12,359 --> 01:05:14,930
we want something that's a supplement
but I think animals because we've used

3312
01:05:14,930 --> 01:05:14,940
but I think animals because we've used
 

3313
01:05:14,940 --> 01:05:16,430
but I think animals because we've used
them throughout history for so many

3314
01:05:16,430 --> 01:05:16,440
them throughout history for so many
 

3315
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:18,589
them throughout history for so many
different things we we domesticated them

3316
01:05:18,589 --> 01:05:18,599
different things we we domesticated them
 

3317
01:05:18,599 --> 01:05:20,089
different things we we domesticated them
not because they do what we do but

3318
01:05:20,089 --> 01:05:20,099
not because they do what we do but
 

3319
01:05:20,099 --> 01:05:22,010
not because they do what we do but
because what they do is different and

3320
01:05:22,010 --> 01:05:22,020
because what they do is different and
 

3321
01:05:22,020 --> 01:05:25,250
because what they do is different and
that's useful and I it's just like

3322
01:05:25,250 --> 01:05:25,260
that's useful and I it's just like
 

3323
01:05:25,260 --> 01:05:26,270
that's useful and I it's just like
whether we're talking about

3324
01:05:26,270 --> 01:05:26,280
whether we're talking about
 

3325
01:05:26,280 --> 01:05:27,710
whether we're talking about
companionship whether we're talking

3326
01:05:27,710 --> 01:05:27,720
companionship whether we're talking
 

3327
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:30,170
companionship whether we're talking
about work integration whether we're

3328
01:05:30,170 --> 01:05:30,180
about work integration whether we're
 

3329
01:05:30,180 --> 01:05:31,670
about work integration whether we're
talking about responsibility for harm

3330
01:05:31,670 --> 01:05:31,680
talking about responsibility for harm
 

3331
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:33,950
talking about responsibility for harm
there's just so many things we can draw

3332
01:05:33,950 --> 01:05:33,960
there's just so many things we can draw
 

3333
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:36,890
there's just so many things we can draw
on in that history from these entities

3334
01:05:36,890 --> 01:05:36,900
on in that history from these entities
 

3335
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:38,930
on in that history from these entities
that can sense think make autonomous

3336
01:05:38,930 --> 01:05:38,940
that can sense think make autonomous
 

3337
01:05:38,940 --> 01:05:41,630
that can sense think make autonomous
decisions and learn that are applicable

3338
01:05:41,630 --> 01:05:41,640
decisions and learn that are applicable
 

3339
01:05:41,640 --> 01:05:43,549
decisions and learn that are applicable
to how we should be thinking about

3340
01:05:43,549 --> 01:05:43,559
to how we should be thinking about
 

3341
01:05:43,559 --> 01:05:45,289
to how we should be thinking about
robots in Ai and and the point of the

3342
01:05:45,289 --> 01:05:45,299
robots in Ai and and the point of the
 

3343
01:05:45,299 --> 01:05:46,730
robots in Ai and and the point of the
book is not that they're the same thing

3344
01:05:46,730 --> 01:05:46,740
book is not that they're the same thing
 

3345
01:05:46,740 --> 01:05:48,710
book is not that they're the same thing
that animals and robots are the same

3346
01:05:48,710 --> 01:05:48,720
that animals and robots are the same
 

3347
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:50,510
that animals and robots are the same
obviously there are tons of differences

3348
01:05:50,510 --> 01:05:50,520
obviously there are tons of differences
 

3349
01:05:50,520 --> 01:05:52,910
obviously there are tons of differences
there like you can't you can't have a

3350
01:05:52,910 --> 01:05:52,920
there like you can't you can't have a
 

3351
01:05:52,920 --> 01:05:55,309
there like you can't you can't have a
conversation with a squirrel right but

3352
01:05:55,309 --> 01:05:55,319
conversation with a squirrel right but
 

3353
01:05:55,319 --> 01:05:58,069
conversation with a squirrel right but
the the point you do it all the time oh

3354
01:05:58,069 --> 01:05:58,079
the the point you do it all the time oh
 

3355
01:05:58,079 --> 01:06:00,049
the the point you do it all the time oh
really by the way squirrels are the

3356
01:06:00,049 --> 01:06:00,059
really by the way squirrels are the
 

3357
01:06:00,059 --> 01:06:02,809
really by the way squirrels are the
cutest I project so much on squirrels I

3358
01:06:02,809 --> 01:06:02,819
cutest I project so much on squirrels I
 

3359
01:06:02,819 --> 01:06:05,630
cutest I project so much on squirrels I
wonder what their inner life is

3360
01:06:05,630 --> 01:06:05,640
wonder what their inner life is
 

3361
01:06:05,640 --> 01:06:07,670
wonder what their inner life is
um I suspect they're much bigger

3362
01:06:07,670 --> 01:06:07,680
um I suspect they're much bigger
 

3363
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:10,490
um I suspect they're much bigger
[\h__\h] than we imagine really like if

3364
01:06:10,490 --> 01:06:10,500
[\h__\h] than we imagine really like if
 

3365
01:06:10,500 --> 01:06:12,950
[\h__\h] than we imagine really like if
it was a giant squirrel it would [\h__\h]

3366
01:06:12,950 --> 01:06:12,960
it was a giant squirrel it would [\h__\h]
 

3367
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:14,870
it was a giant squirrel it would [\h__\h]
you over so fast if you had the chance

3368
01:06:14,870 --> 01:06:14,880
you over so fast if you had the chance
 

3369
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:16,730
you over so fast if you had the chance
it would take everything you own it

3370
01:06:16,730 --> 01:06:16,740
it would take everything you own it
 

3371
01:06:16,740 --> 01:06:18,829
it would take everything you own it
would eat all your stuff because it's

3372
01:06:18,829 --> 01:06:18,839
would eat all your stuff because it's
 

3373
01:06:18,839 --> 01:06:21,410
would eat all your stuff because it's
small and the Furry Tail the furry tale

3374
01:06:21,410 --> 01:06:21,420
small and the Furry Tail the furry tale
 

3375
01:06:21,420 --> 01:06:22,670
small and the Furry Tail the furry tale
is a

3376
01:06:22,670 --> 01:06:22,680
is a

is uh
 

3379
01:06:24,180 --> 01:06:27,289
is uh
is a weapon against human consciousness

3380
01:06:27,289 --> 01:06:27,299
is a weapon against human consciousness
 

3381
01:06:27,299 --> 01:06:29,450
is a weapon against human consciousness
and cognition it wins us over that's

3382
01:06:29,450 --> 01:06:29,460
and cognition it wins us over that's
 

3383
01:06:29,460 --> 01:06:32,270
and cognition it wins us over that's
what cats do too cats out I'll competed

about cats that I love cats anyway uh so
 

3395
01:06:45,660 --> 01:06:47,930
about cats that I love cats anyway uh so
yeah uh yeah you're you're describing

3396
01:06:47,930 --> 01:06:47,940
yeah uh yeah you're you're describing
 

3397
01:06:47,940 --> 01:06:49,309
yeah uh yeah you're you're describing
all the different kinds of animals that

3398
01:06:49,309 --> 01:06:49,319
all the different kinds of animals that
 

3399
01:06:49,319 --> 01:06:51,109
all the different kinds of animals that
get domesticated

3400
01:06:51,109 --> 01:06:51,119
get domesticated
 

3401
01:06:51,119 --> 01:06:54,410
get domesticated
and it's a really interesting idea that

3402
01:06:54,410 --> 01:06:54,420
and it's a really interesting idea that
 

3403
01:06:54,420 --> 01:06:56,210
and it's a really interesting idea that
it's not just sort of pets there's all

3404
01:06:56,210 --> 01:06:56,220
it's not just sort of pets there's all
 

3405
01:06:56,220 --> 01:06:58,069
it's not just sort of pets there's all
kinds of domestication going on they all

3406
01:06:58,069 --> 01:06:58,079
kinds of domestication going on they all
 

3407
01:06:58,079 --> 01:07:02,210
kinds of domestication going on they all
have all kinds of uses yes like the uh

3408
01:07:02,210 --> 01:07:02,220
have all kinds of uses yes like the uh
 

3409
01:07:02,220 --> 01:07:03,829
have all kinds of uses yes like the uh
Ox that you

3410
01:07:03,829 --> 01:07:03,839
Ox that you
 

3411
01:07:03,839 --> 01:07:05,750
Ox that you
propose might be

3412
01:07:05,750 --> 01:07:05,760
propose might be
 

3413
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:07,309
propose might be
at least historically one of the most

3414
01:07:07,309 --> 01:07:07,319
at least historically one of the most
 

3415
01:07:07,319 --> 01:07:10,370
at least historically one of the most
useful domesticated animals it was a

3416
01:07:10,370 --> 01:07:10,380
useful domesticated animals it was a
 

3417
01:07:10,380 --> 01:07:12,589
useful domesticated animals it was a
game changer because it revolutionized

3418
01:07:12,589 --> 01:07:12,599
game changer because it revolutionized
 

3419
01:07:12,599 --> 01:07:15,170
game changer because it revolutionized
like what people could do economically

3420
01:07:15,170 --> 01:07:15,180
like what people could do economically
 

3421
01:07:15,180 --> 01:07:17,870
like what people could do economically
Etc so I I mean just like robots They're

3422
01:07:17,870 --> 01:07:17,880
Etc so I I mean just like robots They're
 

3423
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:19,190
Etc so I I mean just like robots They're
Gonna Change they're going to change

3424
01:07:19,190 --> 01:07:19,200
Gonna Change they're going to change
 

3425
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:21,410
Gonna Change they're going to change
things economically they're going to

3426
01:07:21,410 --> 01:07:21,420
things economically they're going to
 

3427
01:07:21,420 --> 01:07:23,569
things economically they're going to
change Landscapes like cities might even

3428
01:07:23,569 --> 01:07:23,579
change Landscapes like cities might even
 

3429
01:07:23,579 --> 01:07:25,730
change Landscapes like cities might even
get rebuilt around autonomous vehicles

3430
01:07:25,730 --> 01:07:25,740
get rebuilt around autonomous vehicles
 

3431
01:07:25,740 --> 01:07:29,029
get rebuilt around autonomous vehicles
or drones or delivery robots like I

3432
01:07:29,029 --> 01:07:29,039
or drones or delivery robots like I
 

3433
01:07:29,039 --> 01:07:30,950
or drones or delivery robots like I
think just the same ways that animals

3434
01:07:30,950 --> 01:07:30,960
think just the same ways that animals
 

3435
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:34,250
think just the same ways that animals
have really shifted society and Society

3436
01:07:34,250 --> 01:07:34,260
have really shifted society and Society
 

3437
01:07:34,260 --> 01:07:36,170
have really shifted society and Society
has adapted also to like socially

3438
01:07:36,170 --> 01:07:36,180
has adapted also to like socially
 

3439
01:07:36,180 --> 01:07:38,390
has adapted also to like socially
accepting animals as pets

3440
01:07:38,390 --> 01:07:38,400
accepting animals as pets
 

3441
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:39,770
accepting animals as pets
um I think we're going to see very

3442
01:07:39,770 --> 01:07:39,780
um I think we're going to see very
 

3443
01:07:39,780 --> 01:07:41,329
um I think we're going to see very
similar things with robots so I think

3444
01:07:41,329 --> 01:07:41,339
similar things with robots so I think
 

3445
01:07:41,339 --> 01:07:42,529
similar things with robots so I think
it's a useful analogy it's not a perfect

3446
01:07:42,529 --> 01:07:42,539
it's a useful analogy it's not a perfect
 

3447
01:07:42,539 --> 01:07:45,109
it's a useful analogy it's not a perfect
one but I think it's it helps us get

3448
01:07:45,109 --> 01:07:45,119
one but I think it's it helps us get
 

3449
01:07:45,119 --> 01:07:47,450
one but I think it's it helps us get
away from this idea that robots can

3450
01:07:47,450 --> 01:07:47,460
away from this idea that robots can
 

3451
01:07:47,460 --> 01:07:49,730
away from this idea that robots can
shoot or will replace people if you

3452
01:07:49,730 --> 01:07:49,740
shoot or will replace people if you
 

3453
01:07:49,740 --> 01:07:51,650
shoot or will replace people if you
remember what are some interesting uses

3454
01:07:51,650 --> 01:07:51,660
remember what are some interesting uses
 

3455
01:07:51,660 --> 01:07:54,349
remember what are some interesting uses
of animals ferrets for example oh yeah

3456
01:07:54,349 --> 01:07:54,359
of animals ferrets for example oh yeah
 

3457
01:07:54,359 --> 01:07:56,690
of animals ferrets for example oh yeah
the ferrets they they still do this they

3458
01:07:56,690 --> 01:07:56,700
the ferrets they they still do this they
 

3459
01:07:56,700 --> 01:07:59,329
the ferrets they they still do this they
use ferrets to go into narrow spaces

3460
01:07:59,329 --> 01:07:59,339
use ferrets to go into narrow spaces
 

3461
01:07:59,339 --> 01:08:01,789
use ferrets to go into narrow spaces
that people can't go into like a pipe or

3462
01:08:01,789 --> 01:08:01,799
that people can't go into like a pipe or
 

3463
01:08:01,799 --> 01:08:03,289
that people can't go into like a pipe or
like they'll use in the wrong electrical

3464
01:08:03,289 --> 01:08:03,299
like they'll use in the wrong electrical
 

3465

amazing echolocation system that we
 

3505
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:52,309
amazing echolocation system that we
can't replicate with machines and

can't replicate with machines and
 

3507
01:08:52,319 --> 01:08:53,749
can't replicate with machines and
they're trainable so we're going to use

3508
01:08:53,749 --> 01:08:53,759
they're trainable so we're going to use
 

3509

convinced that we're going to see the
 

3611
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:46,130
convinced that we're going to see the
same thing with robots

3612
01:10:46,130 --> 01:10:46,140
same thing with robots
 

3613
01:10:46,140 --> 01:10:47,510
same thing with robots
um where people are going to develop

3614
01:10:47,510 --> 01:10:47,520
um where people are going to develop
 

3615
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:49,310
um where people are going to develop
strong emotional connections to certain

3616
01:10:49,310 --> 01:10:49,320
strong emotional connections to certain
 

3617
01:10:49,320 --> 01:10:50,750
strong emotional connections to certain
robots that they relate to either

3618
01:10:50,750 --> 01:10:50,760
robots that they relate to either
 

3619
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:52,850
robots that they relate to either
culturally or or personally emotionally

3620
01:10:52,850 --> 01:10:52,860
culturally or or personally emotionally
 

3621
01:10:52,860 --> 01:10:54,350
culturally or or personally emotionally
and then there's going to be other

3622
01:10:54,350 --> 01:10:54,360
and then there's going to be other
 

3623
01:10:54,360 --> 01:10:58,070
and then there's going to be other
robots that we don't treat the same way

3624
01:10:58,070 --> 01:10:58,080
robots that we don't treat the same way
 

3625
01:10:58,080 --> 01:11:00,410
robots that we don't treat the same way
I wonder does that have to do more with

3626
01:11:00,410 --> 01:11:00,420
I wonder does that have to do more with
 

3627
01:11:00,420 --> 01:11:02,209
I wonder does that have to do more with
the culture and the people or the robot

3628
01:11:02,209 --> 01:11:02,219
the culture and the people or the robot
 

3629
01:11:02,219 --> 01:11:04,310
the culture and the people or the robot
design is there interplay between the

3630
01:11:04,310 --> 01:11:04,320
design is there interplay between the
 

3631
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:07,790
design is there interplay between the
two like why did dogs and cats

3632
01:11:07,790 --> 01:11:07,800
two like why did dogs and cats
 

3633
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:09,770
two like why did dogs and cats
out compete

3634
01:11:09,770 --> 01:11:09,780
out compete
 

3635
01:11:09,780 --> 01:11:11,570
out compete
ox and

3636
01:11:11,570 --> 01:11:11,580
ox and
 

3637
01:11:11,580 --> 01:11:14,810
ox and
I don't know what else like farm animals

3638
01:11:14,810 --> 01:11:14,820
I don't know what else like farm animals
 

3639
01:11:14,820 --> 01:11:17,330
I don't know what else like farm animals
to to really get inside the home and get

3640
01:11:17,330 --> 01:11:17,340
to to really get inside the home and get
 

3641
01:11:17,340 --> 01:11:20,689
to to really get inside the home and get
inside our hearts yeah I mean people

3642
01:11:20,689 --> 01:11:20,699
inside our hearts yeah I mean people
 

3643
01:11:20,699 --> 01:11:23,030
inside our hearts yeah I mean people
point to the fact that dogs are very

3644
01:11:23,030 --> 01:11:23,040
point to the fact that dogs are very
 

3645
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:25,669
point to the fact that dogs are very
genetically flexible and

3646
01:11:25,669 --> 01:11:25,679
genetically flexible and
 

3647
01:11:25,679 --> 01:11:27,890
genetically flexible and
um they can evolve much more quickly

3648
01:11:27,890 --> 01:11:27,900
um they can evolve much more quickly
 

3649
01:11:27,900 --> 01:11:31,189
um they can evolve much more quickly
than other animals and so they

3650
01:11:31,189 --> 01:11:31,199
than other animals and so they
 

3651
01:11:31,199 --> 01:11:33,290
than other animals and so they
evolutionary biologists think that dogs

3652
01:11:33,290 --> 01:11:33,300
evolutionary biologists think that dogs
 

3653
01:11:33,300 --> 01:11:36,350
evolutionary biologists think that dogs
evolved to be more appealing to us and

3654
01:11:36,350 --> 01:11:36,360
evolved to be more appealing to us and
 

3655
01:11:36,360 --> 01:11:38,090
evolved to be more appealing to us and
then once we learned how to breed them

3656
01:11:38,090 --> 01:11:38,100
then once we learned how to breed them
 

3657
01:11:38,100 --> 01:11:39,290
then once we learned how to breed them
we started breeding them to be more

3658
01:11:39,290 --> 01:11:39,300
we started breeding them to be more
 

3659
01:11:39,300 --> 01:11:41,149
we started breeding them to be more
appealing to us too which is not

3660
01:11:41,149 --> 01:11:41,159
appealing to us too which is not
 

3661
01:11:41,159 --> 01:11:43,370
appealing to us too which is not
something that we necessarily would be

3662
01:11:43,370 --> 01:11:43,380
something that we necessarily would be
 

3663
01:11:43,380 --> 01:11:46,070
something that we necessarily would be
able to do with cows although we've bred

3664
01:11:46,070 --> 01:11:46,080
able to do with cows although we've bred
 

3665
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:47,870
able to do with cows although we've bred
them to make more milk for us

3666
01:11:47,870 --> 01:11:47,880
them to make more milk for us
 

3667
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:50,990
them to make more milk for us
so but part of it is also culture I mean

3668
01:11:50,990 --> 01:11:51,000
so but part of it is also culture I mean
 

3669
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:52,430
so but part of it is also culture I mean
there are cultures where people eat dogs

3670
01:11:52,430 --> 01:11:52,440
there are cultures where people eat dogs
 

3671
01:11:52,440 --> 01:11:54,169
there are cultures where people eat dogs
still today and then there's other

3672
01:11:54,169 --> 01:11:54,179
still today and then there's other
 

3673
01:11:54,179 --> 01:11:56,510
still today and then there's other
cultures where we're like oh no that's

3674
01:11:56,510 --> 01:11:56,520
cultures where we're like oh no that's
 

3675
01:11:56,520 --> 01:11:59,510
cultures where we're like oh no that's
terrible we would never do that and so I

3676
01:11:59,510 --> 01:11:59,520
terrible we would never do that and so I
 

3677
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:00,290
terrible we would never do that and so I
think there's a lot of different

3678
01:12:00,290 --> 01:12:00,300
think there's a lot of different
 

3679
01:12:00,300 --> 01:12:02,750
think there's a lot of different
elements that play in I wonder if

3680
01:12:02,750 --> 01:12:02,760
elements that play in I wonder if
 

3681
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:04,310
elements that play in I wonder if
there's good because I understand dogs

3682
01:12:04,310 --> 01:12:04,320
there's good because I understand dogs
 

3683
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:06,050
there's good because I understand dogs
because they use their eyes they're able

3684
01:12:06,050 --> 01:12:06,060
because they use their eyes they're able
 

3685
01:12:06,060 --> 01:12:08,570
because they use their eyes they're able
to communicate affection all those kinds

3686
01:12:08,570 --> 01:12:08,580
to communicate affection all those kinds
 

3687
01:12:08,580 --> 01:12:09,770
to communicate affection all those kinds
of things it's really interesting what

3688
01:12:09,770 --> 01:12:09,780
of things it's really interesting what
 

3689
01:12:09,780 --> 01:12:12,229
of things it's really interesting what
dogs do there's a whole conferences in

3690
01:12:12,229 --> 01:12:12,239
dogs do there's a whole conferences in
 

3691
01:12:12,239 --> 01:12:15,410
dogs do there's a whole conferences in
dog Consciousness and cognition and all

3692
01:12:15,410 --> 01:12:15,420
dog Consciousness and cognition and all
 

3693
01:12:15,420 --> 01:12:18,050
dog Consciousness and cognition and all
that kind of stuff now cats is a mystery

3694
01:12:18,050 --> 01:12:18,060
that kind of stuff now cats is a mystery
 

3695
01:12:18,060 --> 01:12:19,070
that kind of stuff now cats is a mystery
to me

3696
01:12:19,070 --> 01:12:19,080
to me
 

3697
01:12:19,080 --> 01:12:21,290
to me
because they seem to not give a [\h__\h]

3698
01:12:21,290 --> 01:12:21,300
because they seem to not give a [\h__\h]
 

3699
01:12:21,300 --> 01:12:22,970
because they seem to not give a [\h__\h]
about the human but they're warm and

3700
01:12:22,970 --> 01:12:22,980
about the human but they're warm and
 

3701
01:12:22,980 --> 01:12:24,290
about the human but they're warm and
fluffy

3702
01:12:24,290 --> 01:12:24,300
fluffy
 

3703
01:12:24,300 --> 01:12:26,209
fluffy
but they but they're also passive

3704
01:12:26,209 --> 01:12:26,219
but they but they're also passive
 

3705
01:12:26,219 --> 01:12:28,149
but they but they're also passive
aggressive so they're at the same time

3706
01:12:28,149 --> 01:12:28,159
aggressive so they're at the same time
 

3707
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:31,310
aggressive so they're at the same time
they're like they're dismissive of of

3708
01:12:31,310 --> 01:12:31,320
they're like they're dismissive of of
 

3709
01:12:31,320 --> 01:12:34,310
they're like they're dismissive of of
you in some sense I think some people

3710
01:12:34,310 --> 01:12:34,320
you in some sense I think some people
 

3711
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:35,510
you in some sense I think some people
like that some people like that about

3712
01:12:35,510 --> 01:12:35,520
like that some people like that about
 

3713
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:36,709
like that some people like that about
people

3714
01:12:36,709 --> 01:12:36,719
people
 

3715
01:12:36,719 --> 01:12:38,930
people
yeah they want they want the push and

3716
01:12:38,930 --> 01:12:38,940
yeah they want they want the push and
 

3717
01:12:38,940 --> 01:12:40,910
yeah they want they want the push and
pull over of a relationship they don't

3718
01:12:40,910 --> 01:12:40,920
pull over of a relationship they don't
 

3719
01:12:40,920 --> 01:12:43,729
pull over of a relationship they don't
want loyalty or unconditional love that

3720
01:12:43,729 --> 01:12:43,739
want loyalty or unconditional love that
 

3721
01:12:43,739 --> 01:12:45,350
want loyalty or unconditional love that
does that means they haven't earned it

3722
01:12:45,350 --> 01:12:45,360
does that means they haven't earned it
 

3723
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:46,630
does that means they haven't earned it
yeah

3724
01:12:46,630 --> 01:12:46,640
yeah
 

3725
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:49,090
yeah
yeah

3726
01:12:49,090 --> 01:12:49,100
yeah
 

3727
01:12:49,100 --> 01:12:51,590
yeah
and maybe that says a lot more about the

3728
01:12:51,590 --> 01:12:51,600
and maybe that says a lot more about the
 

3729
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:53,209
and maybe that says a lot more about the
people than it does about the animal oh

3730
01:12:53,209 --> 01:12:53,219
people than it does about the animal oh
 

3731
01:12:53,219 --> 01:12:56,770
people than it does about the animal oh
yeah we all need therapy yeah

3732
01:12:56,770 --> 01:12:56,780
yeah we all need therapy yeah
 

3733
01:12:56,780 --> 01:12:59,209
yeah we all need therapy yeah
so I'm judging harshly to people that

3734
01:12:59,209 --> 01:12:59,219
so I'm judging harshly to people that
 

3735
01:12:59,219 --> 01:13:00,770
so I'm judging harshly to people that
have cats or or the people that have

3736
01:13:00,770 --> 01:13:00,780
have cats or or the people that have
 

3737
01:13:00,780 --> 01:13:01,910
have cats or or the people that have
dogs

3738
01:13:01,910 --> 01:13:01,920
dogs
 

3739
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:05,330
dogs
maybe the people that have dogs need are

3740
01:13:05,330 --> 01:13:05,340
maybe the people that have dogs need are
 

3741
01:13:05,340 --> 01:13:07,130
maybe the people that have dogs need are
are desperate for attention and

3742
01:13:07,130 --> 01:13:07,140
are desperate for attention and
 

3743
01:13:07,140 --> 01:13:09,890
are desperate for attention and
unconditional love and they're unable to

3744
01:13:09,890 --> 01:13:09,900
unconditional love and they're unable to
 

3745
01:13:09,900 --> 01:13:11,270
unconditional love and they're unable to
to

3746
01:13:11,270 --> 01:13:11,280
to
 

3747
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:13,430
to
um

3748
01:13:13,430 --> 01:13:13,440

 

3749
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:17,890

to sort of struggle uh to earn

3750
01:13:17,890 --> 01:13:17,900
to sort of struggle uh to earn
 

3751
01:13:17,900 --> 01:13:21,050
to sort of struggle uh to earn
meaningful connections

3752
01:13:21,050 --> 01:13:21,060
meaningful connections
 

3753
01:13:21,060 --> 01:13:22,850
meaningful connections
um I don't know maybe people are talking

3754
01:13:22,850 --> 01:13:22,860
um I don't know maybe people are talking
 

3755
01:13:22,860 --> 01:13:24,830
um I don't know maybe people are talking
about you and your robot pets in the

3756
01:13:24,830 --> 01:13:24,840
about you and your robot pets in the
 

3757
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:25,850
about you and your robot pets in the
same way

3758
01:13:25,850 --> 01:13:25,860
same way
 

3759
01:13:25,860 --> 01:13:27,530
same way
yeah that's uh

3760
01:13:27,530 --> 01:13:27,540
yeah that's uh
 

3761
01:13:27,540 --> 01:13:29,209
yeah that's uh
[Laughter]

3762
01:13:29,209 --> 01:13:29,219
[Laughter]
 

3763
01:13:29,219 --> 01:13:31,370
[Laughter]
it is kind of sad there's just robots

3764
01:13:31,370 --> 01:13:31,380
it is kind of sad there's just robots
 

3765
01:13:31,380 --> 01:13:33,649
it is kind of sad there's just robots
everywhere but he's I mean I'm joking

3766
01:13:33,649 --> 01:13:33,659
everywhere but he's I mean I'm joking
 

3767
01:13:33,659 --> 01:13:34,910
everywhere but he's I mean I'm joking
about it being said because I think it's

3768
01:13:34,910 --> 01:13:34,920
about it being said because I think it's
 

3769
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:37,310
about it being said because I think it's
kind of beautiful I think robots are

3770
01:13:37,310 --> 01:13:37,320
kind of beautiful I think robots are
 

3771
01:13:37,320 --> 01:13:39,890
kind of beautiful I think robots are
uh beautiful in the same way that pets

3772
01:13:39,890 --> 01:13:39,900
uh beautiful in the same way that pets
 

3773
01:13:39,900 --> 01:13:43,189
uh beautiful in the same way that pets
are even children in that like they

3774
01:13:43,189 --> 01:13:43,199
are even children in that like they
 

3775
01:13:43,199 --> 01:13:45,350
are even children in that like they
capture some kind of magic of uh social

3776
01:13:45,350 --> 01:13:45,360
capture some kind of magic of uh social
 

3777
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:47,050
capture some kind of magic of uh social
robots

3778
01:13:47,050 --> 01:13:47,060
robots
 

3779
01:13:47,060 --> 01:13:50,030
robots
they have the capacity to have the same

3780
01:13:50,030 --> 01:13:50,040
they have the capacity to have the same
 

3781
01:13:50,040 --> 01:13:52,669
they have the capacity to have the same
kind of magic of connection

3782
01:13:52,669 --> 01:13:52,679
kind of magic of connection
 

3783
01:13:52,679 --> 01:13:54,770
kind of magic of connection
um I don't know what that is like um

3784
01:13:54,770 --> 01:13:54,780
um I don't know what that is like um
 

3785
01:13:54,780 --> 01:13:56,270
um I don't know what that is like um
when they're brought to life and they

3786
01:13:56,270 --> 01:13:56,280
when they're brought to life and they
 

3787
01:13:56,280 --> 01:13:58,330
when they're brought to life and they
move around

3788
01:13:58,330 --> 01:13:58,340
move around
 

3789
01:13:58,340 --> 01:14:01,430
move around
the way they make me feel I'm pretty

3790
01:14:01,430 --> 01:14:01,440
the way they make me feel I'm pretty
 

3791
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:05,390
the way they make me feel I'm pretty
convinced is as as you know

3792
01:14:05,390 --> 01:14:05,400
convinced is as as you know
 

3793
01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:09,110
convinced is as as you know
they will make billions of people feel

3794
01:14:09,110 --> 01:14:09,120
they will make billions of people feel
 

3795
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:11,510
they will make billions of people feel
like I I don't think I'm like some weird

3796
01:14:11,510 --> 01:14:11,520
like I I don't think I'm like some weird
 

3797
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:14,209
like I I don't think I'm like some weird
robotics guy I'm not I mean you are but

3798
01:14:14,209 --> 01:14:14,219
robotics guy I'm not I mean you are but
 

3799
01:14:14,219 --> 01:14:16,189
robotics guy I'm not I mean you are but
not in this way not in this way I mean I

3800
01:14:16,189 --> 01:14:16,199
not in this way not in this way I mean I
 

3801
01:14:16,199 --> 01:14:18,649
not in this way not in this way I mean I
just I can put on my like normal human

3802
01:14:18,649 --> 01:14:18,659
just I can put on my like normal human
 

3803
01:14:18,659 --> 01:14:22,490
just I can put on my like normal human
hat and just see this oh this is like

3804
01:14:22,490 --> 01:14:22,500
hat and just see this oh this is like
 

3805
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:25,189
hat and just see this oh this is like
there's a lot of possibility there of

3806
01:14:25,189 --> 01:14:25,199
there's a lot of possibility there of
 

3807
01:14:25,199 --> 01:14:27,709
there's a lot of possibility there of
something cool just like with dogs what

3808
01:14:27,709 --> 01:14:27,719
something cool just like with dogs what
 

3809
01:14:27,719 --> 01:14:30,229
something cool just like with dogs what
is it why are we so into dogs or cats

3810
01:14:30,229 --> 01:14:30,239
is it why are we so into dogs or cats
 

3811
01:14:30,239 --> 01:14:33,169
is it why are we so into dogs or cats
like it's like that it's way different

3812
01:14:33,169 --> 01:14:33,179
like it's like that it's way different
 

3813
01:14:33,179 --> 01:14:34,669
like it's like that it's way different
than us

3814
01:14:34,669 --> 01:14:34,679
than us
 

3815
01:14:34,679 --> 01:14:37,430
than us
it is it's like drooling all over the

3816
01:14:37,430 --> 01:14:37,440
it is it's like drooling all over the
 

3817
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:39,050
it is it's like drooling all over the
place with its tongue out and it's like

3818
01:14:39,050 --> 01:14:39,060
place with its tongue out and it's like
 

3819
01:14:39,060 --> 01:14:40,910
place with its tongue out and it's like
what it's like a weird creature that

3820
01:14:40,910 --> 01:14:40,920
what it's like a weird creature that
 

3821
01:14:40,920 --> 01:14:43,370
what it's like a weird creature that
used to be a wolf why are we into this

3822
01:14:43,370 --> 01:14:43,380
used to be a wolf why are we into this
 

3823
01:14:43,380 --> 01:14:45,649
used to be a wolf why are we into this
thing well dogs can

3824
01:14:45,649 --> 01:14:45,659
thing well dogs can
 

3825
01:14:45,659 --> 01:14:48,250
thing well dogs can
either Express or mimic a lot of

3826
01:14:48,250 --> 01:14:48,260
either Express or mimic a lot of
 

3827
01:14:48,260 --> 01:14:51,410
either Express or mimic a lot of
emotions that we recognize

3828
01:14:51,410 --> 01:14:51,420
emotions that we recognize
 

3829
01:14:51,420 --> 01:14:53,630
emotions that we recognize
um and I think that's a big thing like a

3830
01:14:53,630 --> 01:14:53,640
um and I think that's a big thing like a
 

3831
01:14:53,640 --> 01:14:56,030
um and I think that's a big thing like a
lot of the magic of animals and robots

3832
01:14:56,030 --> 01:14:56,040
lot of the magic of animals and robots
 

3833
01:14:56,040 --> 01:14:59,630
lot of the magic of animals and robots
is our own self-projection and the

3834
01:14:59,630 --> 01:14:59,640
is our own self-projection and the
 

3835
01:14:59,640 --> 01:15:01,669
is our own self-projection and the
easier it is for us to

3836
01:15:01,669 --> 01:15:01,679
easier it is for us to
 

3837
01:15:01,679 --> 01:15:04,130
easier it is for us to
see ourselves in something and project

3838
01:15:04,130 --> 01:15:04,140
see ourselves in something and project
 

3839
01:15:04,140 --> 01:15:06,590
see ourselves in something and project
human emotions or qualities or traits

3840
01:15:06,590 --> 01:15:06,600
human emotions or qualities or traits
 

3841
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:08,570
human emotions or qualities or traits
onto it the more we'll relate to it and

3842
01:15:08,570 --> 01:15:08,580
onto it the more we'll relate to it and
 

3843
01:15:08,580 --> 01:15:10,250
onto it the more we'll relate to it and
then you also have the movement of

3844
01:15:10,250 --> 01:15:10,260
then you also have the movement of
 

3845
01:15:10,260 --> 01:15:12,110
then you also have the movement of
course I think that's also really that's

3846
01:15:12,110 --> 01:15:12,120
course I think that's also really that's
 

3847
01:15:12,120 --> 01:15:14,270
course I think that's also really that's
why I'm so interested in physical robots

3848
01:15:14,270 --> 01:15:14,280
why I'm so interested in physical robots
 

3849
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:16,490
why I'm so interested in physical robots
because that's I think the visceral

3850
01:15:16,490 --> 01:15:16,500
because that's I think the visceral
 

3851
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:18,530
because that's I think the visceral
magic of them I think we're I mean

3852
01:15:18,530 --> 01:15:18,540
magic of them I think we're I mean
 

3853
01:15:18,540 --> 01:15:20,270
magic of them I think we're I mean
there's there's research showing that

3854
01:15:20,270 --> 01:15:20,280
there's there's research showing that
 

3855
01:15:20,280 --> 01:15:23,090
there's there's research showing that
we're probably biologically hardwired to

3856
01:15:23,090 --> 01:15:23,100
we're probably biologically hardwired to
 

3857
01:15:23,100 --> 01:15:25,970
we're probably biologically hardwired to
respond to autonomous movement in our

3858
01:15:25,970 --> 01:15:25,980
respond to autonomous movement in our
 

3859
01:15:25,980 --> 01:15:27,530
respond to autonomous movement in our
physical space because we've had to

3860
01:15:27,530 --> 01:15:27,540
physical space because we've had to
 

3861
01:15:27,540 --> 01:15:29,330
physical space because we've had to
watch out for Predators or whatever the

3862
01:15:29,330 --> 01:15:29,340
watch out for Predators or whatever the
 

3863
01:15:29,340 --> 01:15:30,410
watch out for Predators or whatever the
reason is

3864
01:15:30,410 --> 01:15:30,420
reason is
 

3865
01:15:30,420 --> 01:15:33,830
reason is
um and so animals and robots are very

3866
01:15:33,830 --> 01:15:33,840
um and so animals and robots are very
 

3867
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:36,290
um and so animals and robots are very
appealing to us as these autonomously

3868
01:15:36,290 --> 01:15:36,300
appealing to us as these autonomously
 

3869
01:15:36,300 --> 01:15:38,330
appealing to us as these autonomously
moving things that we view as agents

3870
01:15:38,330 --> 01:15:38,340
moving things that we view as agents
 

3871
01:15:38,340 --> 01:15:39,770
moving things that we view as agents
instead of objects

3872
01:15:39,770 --> 01:15:39,780
instead of objects
 

3873
01:15:39,780 --> 01:15:43,130
instead of objects
I mean I I love the moment which is I've

3874
01:15:43,130 --> 01:15:43,140
I mean I I love the moment which is I've
 

3875
01:15:43,140 --> 01:15:44,870
I mean I I love the moment which is I've
been particularly working on which is

3876
01:15:44,870 --> 01:15:44,880
been particularly working on which is
 

3877
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:47,990
been particularly working on which is
when a robot like the cowboy hat uh is

3878
01:15:47,990 --> 01:15:48,000
when a robot like the cowboy hat uh is
 

3879
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,450
when a robot like the cowboy hat uh is
doing its own thing and then

3880
01:15:50,450 --> 01:15:50,460
doing its own thing and then
 

3881
01:15:50,460 --> 01:15:52,910
doing its own thing and then
uh it recognizes you I mean the way a

3882
01:15:52,910 --> 01:15:52,920
uh it recognizes you I mean the way a
 

3883
01:15:52,920 --> 01:15:56,689
uh it recognizes you I mean the way a
dog does and it it looks like this and

3884
01:15:56,689 --> 01:15:56,699
dog does and it it looks like this and
 

3885
01:15:56,699 --> 01:15:57,770
dog does and it it looks like this and
the

3886
01:15:57,770 --> 01:15:57,780
the
 

3887
01:15:57,780 --> 01:16:00,709
the
the moment of recognition like you're

3888
01:16:00,709 --> 01:16:00,719
the moment of recognition like you're
 

3889
01:16:00,719 --> 01:16:03,050
the moment of recognition like you're
walking say you work in an airport on

3890
01:16:03,050 --> 01:16:03,060
walking say you work in an airport on
 

3891
01:16:03,060 --> 01:16:04,010
walking say you work in an airport on
the street

3892
01:16:04,010 --> 01:16:04,020
the street
 

3893
01:16:04,020 --> 01:16:07,070
the street
and there's just you know hundreds of

3894
01:16:07,070 --> 01:16:07,080
and there's just you know hundreds of
 

3895
01:16:07,080 --> 01:16:09,169
and there's just you know hundreds of
strangers but then you see somebody you

3896
01:16:09,169 --> 01:16:09,179
strangers but then you see somebody you
 

3897
01:16:09,179 --> 01:16:10,850
strangers but then you see somebody you
know and that like

3898
01:16:10,850 --> 01:16:10,860
know and that like
 

3899
01:16:10,860 --> 01:16:13,070
know and that like
where you wake up to like

3900
01:16:13,070 --> 01:16:13,080
where you wake up to like
 

3901
01:16:13,080 --> 01:16:14,930
where you wake up to like
uh that excitement of seeing somebody

3902
01:16:14,930 --> 01:16:14,940
uh that excitement of seeing somebody
 

3903
01:16:14,940 --> 01:16:16,729
uh that excitement of seeing somebody
you know and saying hello and all that

3904
01:16:16,729 --> 01:16:16,739
you know and saying hello and all that
 

3905
01:16:16,739 --> 01:16:18,830
you know and saying hello and all that
kind of stuff that's a magical moment

3906
01:16:18,830 --> 01:16:18,840
kind of stuff that's a magical moment
 

3907
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:22,790
kind of stuff that's a magical moment
like uh I think especially with the dog

3908
01:16:22,790 --> 01:16:22,800
like uh I think especially with the dog
 

3909
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:26,270
like uh I think especially with the dog
it makes you feel noticed and heard and

3910
01:16:26,270 --> 01:16:26,280
it makes you feel noticed and heard and
 

3911
01:16:26,280 --> 01:16:29,870
it makes you feel noticed and heard and
and loved like as somebody looks at you

3912
01:16:29,870 --> 01:16:29,880
and loved like as somebody looks at you
 

3913
01:16:29,880 --> 01:16:32,630
and loved like as somebody looks at you
and recognizes you that that it matters

3914
01:16:32,630 --> 01:16:32,640
and recognizes you that that it matters
 

3915
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:35,149
and recognizes you that that it matters
that you exist yeah you feel seen yeah

3916
01:16:35,149 --> 01:16:35,159
that you exist yeah you feel seen yeah
 

3917
01:16:35,159 --> 01:16:37,430
that you exist yeah you feel seen yeah
and that's a cool feeling and I I

3918
01:16:37,430 --> 01:16:37,440
and that's a cool feeling and I I
 

3919
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:39,169
and that's a cool feeling and I I
honestly think robots can get that

3920
01:16:39,169 --> 01:16:39,179
honestly think robots can get that
 

3921
01:16:39,179 --> 01:16:42,110
honestly think robots can get that
feeling oh yeah totally currently Alexa

3922
01:16:42,110 --> 01:16:42,120
feeling oh yeah totally currently Alexa
 

3923
01:16:42,120 --> 01:16:44,270
feeling oh yeah totally currently Alexa
I mean one of the downsides of these

3924
01:16:44,270 --> 01:16:44,280
I mean one of the downsides of these
 

3925
01:16:44,280 --> 01:16:47,030
I mean one of the downsides of these
systems is they don't

3926
01:16:47,030 --> 01:16:47,040
systems is they don't
 

3927
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:51,410
systems is they don't
there's servants they like uh

3928
01:16:51,410 --> 01:16:51,420
there's servants they like uh
 

3929
01:16:51,420 --> 01:16:53,149
there's servants they like uh
part of the you know they're trying to

3930
01:16:53,149 --> 01:16:53,159
part of the you know they're trying to
 

3931
01:16:53,159 --> 01:16:56,689
part of the you know they're trying to
maintain privacy I suppose uh but

3932
01:16:56,689 --> 01:16:56,699
maintain privacy I suppose uh but
 

3933
01:16:56,699 --> 01:17:00,050
maintain privacy I suppose uh but
I don't feel seen with Alexa

3934
01:17:00,050 --> 01:17:00,060
I don't feel seen with Alexa
 

3935
01:17:00,060 --> 01:17:02,149
I don't feel seen with Alexa
right I think that's going to change I

4051
01:19:11,580 --> 01:19:13,970

just because they weren't able

4052
01:19:13,970 --> 01:19:13,980
just because they weren't able
 

4053
01:19:13,980 --> 01:19:16,550

to wonder I mean Google is clearly gonna
 

4059
01:19:21,140 --> 01:19:24,229
to wonder I mean Google is clearly gonna
do something with the language I mean

challenging them uh partially but not
 

4065
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:31,370
challenging them uh partially but not
really because I know they're not going

01:19:31,370 --> 01:19:31,380
really because I know they're not going
 

4067
01:19:31,380 --> 01:19:34,070
really because I know they're not going
to do it I mean they don't have to it's

4068
01:19:34,070 --> 01:19:34,080
to do it I mean they don't have to it's
 

4069
01:19:34,080 --> 01:19:35,810

to have to collect data from people
 

4093
01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:06,229
to have to collect data from people
which you will anyway to personalize the

4094
01:20:06,229 --> 01:20:06,239
which you will anyway to personalize the
 

4095
01:20:06,239 --> 01:20:08,930
which you will anyway to personalize the
thing and you're going to be somehow

4096
01:20:08,930 --> 01:20:08,940
thing and you're going to be somehow
 

4097
01:20:08,940 --> 01:20:10,550
thing and you're going to be somehow
monetizing the data or you're going to

4098
01:20:10,550 --> 01:20:10,560
monetizing the data or you're going to
 

4099
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:13,550
monetizing the data or you're going to
be doing some like ad model it just it

4100
01:20:13,550 --> 01:20:13,560
be doing some like ad model it just it
 

4101
01:20:13,560 --> 01:20:14,990
be doing some like ad model it just it
seems like now we're suddenly getting

4102
01:20:14,990 --> 01:20:15,000
seems like now we're suddenly getting
 

4103
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:16,910
seems like now we're suddenly getting
into the realm of like severe consumer

4104
01:20:16,910 --> 01:20:16,920
into the realm of like severe consumer
 

4105
01:20:16,920 --> 01:20:19,270
into the realm of like severe consumer
protection issues and

4106
01:20:19,270 --> 01:20:19,280
protection issues and
 

4107
01:20:19,280 --> 01:20:22,850
protection issues and
I'm I'm really worried about that I I

4108
01:20:22,850 --> 01:20:22,860
I'm I'm really worried about that I I
 

4109
01:20:22,860 --> 01:20:24,590
I'm I'm really worried about that I I
see massive potential for this

4110
01:20:24,590 --> 01:20:24,600
see massive potential for this
 

4111
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:26,330
see massive potential for this
technology to be used in a way that's

4112
01:20:26,330 --> 01:20:26,340
technology to be used in a way that's
 

4113
01:20:26,340 --> 01:20:29,209
technology to be used in a way that's
not for the public good and not

4114
01:20:29,209 --> 01:20:29,219
not for the public good and not
 

4115
01:20:29,219 --> 01:20:31,970
not for the public good and not
I mean that's in in an individual user's

4116
01:20:31,970 --> 01:20:31,980
I mean that's in in an individual user's
 

4117
01:20:31,980 --> 01:20:33,830
I mean that's in in an individual user's
interest maybe but not in society's

4118
01:20:33,830 --> 01:20:33,840
interest maybe but not in society's
 

4119
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:34,850
interest maybe but not in society's
interest

4120
01:20:34,850 --> 01:20:34,860
interest
 

4121
01:20:34,860 --> 01:20:37,669
interest
yes yeah I think

4122
01:20:37,669 --> 01:20:37,679
yes yeah I think
 

4123
01:20:37,679 --> 01:20:39,410
yes yeah I think
I think that kind of personalization

4124
01:20:39,410 --> 01:20:39,420
I think that kind of personalization
 

4125
01:20:39,420 --> 01:20:42,110
I think that kind of personalization
should be

4126
01:20:42,110 --> 01:20:42,120
should be
 

4127
01:20:42,120 --> 01:20:46,430
should be
like redefine how we treat data I think

4128
01:20:46,430 --> 01:20:46,440
like redefine how we treat data I think
 

4129
01:20:46,440 --> 01:20:48,770
like redefine how we treat data I think
you should own all the data your phone

4130
01:20:48,770 --> 01:20:48,780
you should own all the data your phone
 

4131
01:20:48,780 --> 01:20:50,090
you should own all the data your phone
knows about you

4132
01:20:50,090 --> 01:20:50,100
knows about you
 

4133
01:20:50,100 --> 01:20:52,430
knows about you
like and be able to delete it with a

4134
01:20:52,430 --> 01:20:52,440
like and be able to delete it with a
 

4135
01:20:52,440 --> 01:20:55,070
like and be able to delete it with a
single click and walk away

4136
01:20:55,070 --> 01:20:55,080
single click and walk away
 

4137
01:20:55,080 --> 01:20:58,910
single click and walk away
and that data cannot be monetized or

4138
01:20:58,910 --> 01:20:58,920
and that data cannot be monetized or
 

4139
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:01,310
and that data cannot be monetized or
used or shared anywhere without your

4140
01:21:01,310 --> 01:21:01,320
used or shared anywhere without your
 

4141
01:21:01,320 --> 01:21:03,110
used or shared anywhere without your
permission I think that's the only way

4142
01:21:03,110 --> 01:21:03,120
permission I think that's the only way
 

4143
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:06,290
permission I think that's the only way
people will trust you to give to if for

4144
01:21:06,290 --> 01:21:06,300
people will trust you to give to if for
 

4145
01:21:06,300 --> 01:21:08,689
people will trust you to give to if for
you to use that data but then how are

4146
01:21:08,689 --> 01:21:08,699
you to use that data but then how are
 

4147
01:21:08,699 --> 01:21:11,149
you to use that data but then how are
companies gonna I mean a lot of these

4148
01:21:11,149 --> 01:21:11,159
companies gonna I mean a lot of these
 

4149
01:21:11,159 --> 01:21:13,490
companies gonna I mean a lot of these

data
 

4153
01:21:15,060 --> 01:21:19,370
data
to train the AI system right so you have

4154
01:21:19,370 --> 01:21:19,380
to train the AI system right so you have
 

4155
01:21:19,380 --> 01:21:20,510
to train the AI system right so you have
to

to
 

4157
01:21:20,520 --> 01:21:23,810
to
um opt-in constantly and opt-in not in

4158
01:21:23,810 --> 01:21:23,820
um opt-in constantly and opt-in not in
 

4159
01:21:23,820 --> 01:21:26,870
um opt-in constantly and opt-in not in
some legal I agree but obvious like show

4160
01:21:26,870 --> 01:21:26,880
some legal I agree but obvious like show
 

4161
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:29,270
some legal I agree but obvious like show
exactly like um in the way

4162
01:21:29,270 --> 01:21:29,280
exactly like um in the way
 

4163
01:21:29,280 --> 01:21:32,390
exactly like um in the way
uh I opt in to tell you a secret

4164
01:21:32,390 --> 01:21:32,400
uh I opt in to tell you a secret
 

4165
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:37,430
uh I opt in to tell you a secret
like we understand like that like I have

4166
01:21:37,430 --> 01:21:37,440
like we understand like that like I have
 

4167
01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:39,110
like we understand like that like I have
to have to choose like how well do I

4168
01:21:39,110 --> 01:21:39,120
to have to choose like how well do I
 

4169
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:41,630
to have to choose like how well do I
know you and then I say like don't tell

4170
01:21:41,630 --> 01:21:41,640
know you and then I say like don't tell
 

4171
01:21:41,640 --> 01:21:44,630
know you and then I say like don't tell
this to anyone

4172
01:21:44,630 --> 01:21:44,640

 

4173
01:21:44,640 --> 01:21:47,149

and then I have to judge how leaky that

4174
01:21:47,149 --> 01:21:47,159
and then I have to judge how leaky that
 

4175
01:21:47,159 --> 01:21:49,550
and then I have to judge how leaky that
uh like how good you are I keep your

4176
01:21:49,550 --> 01:21:49,560
uh like how good you are I keep your
 

4177
01:21:49,560 --> 01:21:51,830
uh like how good you are I keep your
secrets in that same way like it's very

4178
01:21:51,830 --> 01:21:51,840
secrets in that same way like it's very
 

4179
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:55,010
secrets in that same way like it's very
transparent in uh which data you're

4180
01:21:55,010 --> 01:21:55,020
transparent in uh which data you're
 

4181
01:21:55,020 --> 01:21:57,229
transparent in uh which data you're
allowed to use for which purposes that's

4182
01:21:57,229 --> 01:21:57,239
allowed to use for which purposes that's
 

4183
01:21:57,239 --> 01:21:58,729
allowed to use for which purposes that's
what people are saying is the solution

4184
01:21:58,729 --> 01:21:58,739
what people are saying is the solution
 

4185
01:21:58,739 --> 01:22:00,470
what people are saying is the solution
and I think that works to some extent

4186
01:22:00,470 --> 01:22:00,480
and I think that works to some extent
 

4187
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:02,209
and I think that works to some extent
having transparency having people

4188
01:22:02,209 --> 01:22:02,219
having transparency having people
 

4189
01:22:02,219 --> 01:22:03,530
having transparency having people
consent

4190
01:22:03,530 --> 01:22:03,540
consent
 

4191
01:22:03,540 --> 01:22:06,410
consent
I think it breaks down at the point at

4192
01:22:06,410 --> 01:22:06,420
I think it breaks down at the point at
 

4193
01:22:06,420 --> 01:22:07,490
I think it breaks down at the point at
which

4194
01:22:07,490 --> 01:22:07,500
which
 

4195
01:22:07,500 --> 01:22:08,570
which
have you seen this happen on social

4196
01:22:08,570 --> 01:22:08,580
have you seen this happen on social
 

4197
01:22:08,580 --> 01:22:10,070
have you seen this happen on social
media too like people are willingly

4198
01:22:10,070 --> 01:22:10,080
media too like people are willingly
 

4199
01:22:10,080 --> 01:22:11,270
media too like people are willingly
giving up their data because they're

4200
01:22:11,270 --> 01:22:11,280
giving up their data because they're
 

4201
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:14,270
giving up their data because they're
getting a functionality from that and

4202
01:22:14,270 --> 01:22:14,280
getting a functionality from that and
 

4203
01:22:14,280 --> 01:22:17,030
getting a functionality from that and
then the harm that that causes is on a

4204
01:22:17,030 --> 01:22:17,040
then the harm that that causes is on a
 

4205
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:19,310
then the harm that that causes is on a
like maybe just someone else and not to

4206
01:22:19,310 --> 01:22:19,320
like maybe just someone else and not to
 

4207
01:22:19,320 --> 01:22:21,830
like maybe just someone else and not to
them personally so I don't think people

4208
01:22:21,830 --> 01:22:21,840
them personally so I don't think people
 

4209
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:23,510
them personally so I don't think people
are given their data they're not being

4210
01:22:23,510 --> 01:22:23,520
are given their data they're not being
 

4211
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:24,770
are given their data they're not being
asked

4212
01:22:24,770 --> 01:22:24,780
asked
 

4213
01:22:24,780 --> 01:22:28,189
asked
like but if if you were consensual if

4214
01:22:28,189 --> 01:22:28,199
like but if if you were consensual if
 

4215
01:22:28,199 --> 01:22:29,510
like but if if you were consensual if
you were like

4216
01:22:29,510 --> 01:22:29,520
you were like

and the harm that I'm concerned about is
 

4277
01:23:40,620 --> 01:23:41,990
and the harm that I'm concerned about is
not that the system is going to then

4278
01:23:41,990 --> 01:23:42,000
not that the system is going to then
 

4279
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,030
not that the system is going to then

01:23:50,270 --> 01:23:50,280
the people who do the analytics in like
 

4287
01:23:50,280 --> 01:23:53,270

and so what they do is they aggregate
 

4297
01:24:03,480 --> 01:24:05,450
and so what they do is they aggregate
the data and they map out different

01:24:05,450 --> 01:24:05,460
the data and they map out different
 

4299
01:24:05,460 --> 01:24:07,189
the data and they map out different
personalities and different people and

personalities and different people and
 

4301
01:24:07,199 --> 01:24:10,010
personalities and different people and

01:24:10,010 --> 01:24:10,020
demographics and then they have a lot of
 

4303
01:24:10,020 --> 01:24:13,370
demographics and then they have a lot of
power and control to Market to people so

power and control to Market to people so
 

4305

can be used against me like it's I think
 

4315
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:29,810
can be used against me like it's I think
it's it's way more complex than just

4316
01:24:29,810 --> 01:24:29,820
it's it's way more complex than just

that person's
data it came from all of us all of us

4352
01:25:10,370 --> 01:25:10,380
data it came from all of us all of us
 

4353
01:25:10,380 --> 01:25:13,189
data it came from all of us all of us
opting into this but there there's a

4354
01:25:13,189 --> 01:25:13,199
opting into this but there there's a
 

4355
01:25:13,199 --> 01:25:15,110
opting into this but there there's a
bunch of sneaky decisions along the way

4356
01:25:15,110 --> 01:25:15,120
bunch of sneaky decisions along the way
 

4357
01:25:15,120 --> 01:25:17,390
bunch of sneaky decisions along the way
that could be avoided if there's

4358
01:25:17,390 --> 01:25:17,400
that could be avoided if there's
 

4359
01:25:17,400 --> 01:25:20,810
that could be avoided if there's
transparency so that so one of the ways

4360
01:25:20,810 --> 01:25:20,820
transparency so that so one of the ways
 

4361
01:25:20,820 --> 01:25:22,310
transparency so that so one of the ways
that goes wrong if you share that data

4362
01:25:22,310 --> 01:25:22,320
that goes wrong if you share that data
 

4363
01:25:22,320 --> 01:25:24,430
that goes wrong if you share that data
with too many ad Networks

and you're consciously constantly saying
 

4379
01:25:44,340 --> 01:25:50,270
and you're consciously constantly saying
exactly how to use it and uh and also it

4380
01:25:50,270 --> 01:25:50,280
exactly how to use it and uh and also it
 

4381
01:25:50,280 --> 01:25:51,649
exactly how to use it and uh and also it
has to do with the recommender system

4382
01:25:51,649 --> 01:25:51,659
has to do with the recommender system
 

4383
01:25:51,659 --> 01:25:56,209
has to do with the recommender system
itself from the company which is

4389
01:26:01,380 --> 01:26:03,709
make you happy if that idea doesn't make
you happy then the system shouldn't

4390

you happy then the system shouldn't
 

4391
01:26:03,719 --> 01:26:05,870
you happy then the system shouldn't
recommend it and should very be very

4392
01:26:05,870 --> 01:26:05,880
recommend it and should very be very

01:29:24,470 --> 01:29:24,480
protection issues because
 

4565
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:26,510
protection issues because
you're developing a trusted relationship

4566
01:29:26,510 --> 01:29:26,520
you're developing a trusted relationship
 

4567
01:29:26,520 --> 01:29:29,090
you're developing a trusted relationship
with a social entity

4568
01:29:29,090 --> 01:29:29,100
with a social entity
 

4569
01:29:29,100 --> 01:29:32,270
with a social entity
but it's and and so and so now it's like

4570
01:29:32,270 --> 01:29:32,280
but it's and and so and so now it's like
 

4571
01:29:32,280 --> 01:29:35,450
but it's and and so and so now it's like
personalized it's scalable it's

4572
01:29:35,450 --> 01:29:35,460
personalized it's scalable it's
 

4573
01:29:35,460 --> 01:29:40,930
personalized it's scalable it's
automated and it has it it can

4574
01:29:40,930 --> 01:29:40,940
automated and it has it it can
 

4575
01:29:40,940 --> 01:29:42,770
automated and it has it it can
so some of the research showing that

4576
01:29:42,770 --> 01:29:42,780
so some of the research showing that
 

4577
01:29:42,780 --> 01:29:44,209
so some of the research showing that
kids are already very confused about

4578
01:29:44,209 --> 01:29:44,219
kids are already very confused about
 

4579
01:29:44,219 --> 01:29:46,250
kids are already very confused about
like the incentives of the company

4580
01:29:46,250 --> 01:29:46,260
like the incentives of the company
 

4581
01:29:46,260 --> 01:29:49,610
like the incentives of the company
versus what the robot is doing

4582
01:29:49,610 --> 01:29:49,620
versus what the robot is doing
 

4583
01:29:49,620 --> 01:29:53,090
versus what the robot is doing
meaning they're

4584
01:29:53,090 --> 01:29:53,100

 

4585
01:29:53,100 --> 01:29:55,010

so okay they're not deeply understanding

4586
01:29:55,010 --> 01:29:55,020
so okay they're not deeply understanding
 

4587
01:29:55,020 --> 01:29:57,169
so okay they're not deeply understanding
the incentives of the of the of the

4588
01:29:57,169 --> 01:29:57,179
the incentives of the of the of the
 

4589
01:29:57,179 --> 01:29:59,390
the incentives of the of the of the
system well yeah so like kids who are

4590
01:29:59,390 --> 01:29:59,400
system well yeah so like kids who are
 

4591
01:29:59,400 --> 01:30:01,669
system well yeah so like kids who are
old enough to understand this is a

4592
01:30:01,669 --> 01:30:01,679
old enough to understand this is a
 

4593
01:30:01,679 --> 01:30:03,229
old enough to understand this is a
television advertisement is trying to

4594

television advertisement is trying to
advertise to me I might still decide I

4596
01:30:04,970 --> 01:30:04,980
advertise to me I might still decide I
 

4597
01:30:04,980 --> 01:30:05,870
advertise to me I might still decide I
want this product but they understand

4598
01:30:05,870 --> 01:30:05,880
want this product but they understand
 

4599
01:30:05,880 --> 01:30:07,070
want this product but they understand
what's going on so there's some

what's going on so there's some
 

4601
01:30:07,080 --> 01:30:08,870
what's going on so there's some
transparency there

this um they they asked kids who had
 

4611
01:30:19,860 --> 01:30:22,669
this um they they asked kids who had
interacted with social robots

4612
01:30:22,669 --> 01:30:22,679
interacted with social robots
 

4613
01:30:22,679 --> 01:30:26,270
interacted with social robots
whether they would like a policy that

4614
01:30:26,270 --> 01:30:26,280
whether they would like a policy that
 

4615
01:30:26,280 --> 01:30:29,390
whether they would like a policy that
allows robots to Market to people

4616
01:30:29,390 --> 01:30:29,400
allows robots to Market to people
 

4617
01:30:29,400 --> 01:30:31,550
allows robots to Market to people
through casual conversation or whether

4618
01:30:31,550 --> 01:30:31,560
through casual conversation or whether
 

4619
01:30:31,560 --> 01:30:33,709
through casual conversation or whether
they would prefer that it has to be

01:30:33,709 --> 01:30:33,719
they would prefer that it has to be
 

4621
01:30:33,719 --> 01:30:35,330
they would prefer that it has to be
transparent that it's like an ad coming

4622
01:30:35,330 --> 01:30:35,340
transparent that it's like an ad coming
 

4623
01:30:35,340 --> 01:30:37,970
transparent that it's like an ad coming
from a company and the majority said

4624
01:30:37,970 --> 01:30:37,980
from a company and the majority said
 

4625
01:30:37,980 --> 01:30:40,070
from a company and the majority said
they preferred the casual conversation

4626
01:30:40,070 --> 01:30:40,080
they preferred the casual conversation
 

4627
01:30:40,080 --> 01:30:42,350
they preferred the casual conversation
and when asked why there was a lot of

4628
01:30:42,350 --> 01:30:42,360
and when asked why there was a lot of
 

4629
01:30:42,360 --> 01:30:43,790
and when asked why there was a lot of
confusion about they were like well the

4630
01:30:43,790 --> 01:30:43,800
confusion about they were like well the
 

4631
01:30:43,800 --> 01:30:45,950
confusion about they were like well the
robot knows me better than the company

4632
01:30:45,950 --> 01:30:45,960
robot knows me better than the company
 

4633
01:30:45,960 --> 01:30:47,810
robot knows me better than the company
does so the robot's only going to Market

4634
01:30:47,810 --> 01:30:47,820
does so the robot's only going to Market
 

4635
01:30:47,820 --> 01:30:49,550
does so the robot's only going to Market
things that I like

4636
01:30:49,550 --> 01:30:49,560
things that I like
 

4637
01:30:49,560 --> 01:30:51,649
things that I like
and so they don't really they're not

4638
01:30:51,649 --> 01:30:51,659
and so they don't really they're not
 

4639
01:30:51,659 --> 01:30:53,870
and so they don't really they're not
connecting the fact that the robot is an

4640
01:30:53,870 --> 01:30:53,880
connecting the fact that the robot is an
 

4641
01:30:53,880 --> 01:30:55,669
connecting the fact that the robot is an
agent of the company they're viewing it

4642
01:30:55,669 --> 01:30:55,679
agent of the company they're viewing it
 

4643
01:30:55,679 --> 01:30:57,709
agent of the company they're viewing it
as something separate and I think that

4644
01:30:57,709 --> 01:30:57,719
as something separate and I think that
 

4645
01:30:57,719 --> 01:30:59,450
as something separate and I think that
even happens subconsciously with

4646
01:30:59,450 --> 01:30:59,460
even happens subconsciously with
 

4647
01:30:59,460 --> 01:31:01,550
even happens subconsciously with
grown-ups when it comes to robots and

4648
01:31:01,550 --> 01:31:01,560
grown-ups when it comes to robots and
 

4649
01:31:01,560 --> 01:31:03,410
grown-ups when it comes to robots and
artificial agents and it will like this

4650
01:31:03,410 --> 01:31:03,420
artificial agents and it will like this
 

4651
01:31:03,420 --> 01:31:04,910
artificial agents and it will like this
blank guy at Google sorry I'm going on

4652
01:31:04,910 --> 01:31:04,920
blank guy at Google sorry I'm going on
 

4653
01:31:04,920 --> 01:31:08,270
blank guy at Google sorry I'm going on
and on but like his main concern was

4654
01:31:08,270 --> 01:31:08,280
and on but like his main concern was
 

4655
01:31:08,280 --> 01:31:10,729
and on but like his main concern was
that Google owned this sentient agent

4656
01:31:10,729 --> 01:31:10,739
that Google owned this sentient agent
 

4657
01:31:10,739 --> 01:31:12,950
that Google owned this sentient agent
and that it was being mistreated his

4658
01:31:12,950 --> 01:31:12,960
and that it was being mistreated his
 

4659
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:14,330
and that it was being mistreated his
concern was not that the agent was going

4660
01:31:14,330 --> 01:31:14,340
concern was not that the agent was going
 

4661
01:31:14,340 --> 01:31:15,590
concern was not that the agent was going
to mistreat people

4662
01:31:15,590 --> 01:31:15,600
to mistreat people
 

4663
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:17,870
to mistreat people
so I think we're going to see a lot of

4664
01:31:17,870 --> 01:31:17,880
so I think we're going to see a lot of
 

4665
01:31:17,880 --> 01:31:19,010
so I think we're going to see a lot of
this

4666
01:31:19,010 --> 01:31:19,020
this
 

4667
01:31:19,020 --> 01:31:21,770
this
yeah but shitty companies will do that I

4668
01:31:21,770 --> 01:31:21,780
yeah but shitty companies will do that I
 

4669
01:31:21,780 --> 01:31:25,070
yeah but shitty companies will do that I
think ultimately that confusion should

4670
01:31:25,070 --> 01:31:25,080
think ultimately that confusion should
 

4671
01:31:25,080 --> 01:31:26,750
think ultimately that confusion should
be alleviated by the robot should

4672
01:31:26,750 --> 01:31:26,760
be alleviated by the robot should
 

4673
01:31:26,760 --> 01:31:29,870
be alleviated by the robot should
actually know you better and should not

4674
01:31:29,870 --> 01:31:29,880
actually know you better and should not
 

4675
01:31:29,880 --> 01:31:32,149
actually know you better and should not
have any control from the company

4676
01:31:32,149 --> 01:31:32,159
have any control from the company
 

4677
01:31:32,159 --> 01:31:34,010
have any control from the company
but what's the business model for that

4678
01:31:34,010 --> 01:31:34,020
but what's the business model for that
 

4679
01:31:34,020 --> 01:31:38,330
but what's the business model for that
it's if you use the robot to buy first

4680
01:31:38,330 --> 01:31:38,340
it's if you use the robot to buy first
 

4681
01:31:38,340 --> 01:31:39,830
it's if you use the robot to buy first
of all the robot should probably cost

4682
01:31:39,830 --> 01:31:39,840
of all the robot should probably cost
 

4683
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:41,030
of all the robot should probably cost
money

4684
01:31:41,030 --> 01:31:41,040
money
 

4685
01:31:41,040 --> 01:31:43,010
money
should what cost money like the way

4686
01:31:43,010 --> 01:31:43,020
should what cost money like the way
 

4687
01:31:43,020 --> 01:31:45,169
should what cost money like the way
Windows operating system does I see it

4688
01:31:45,169 --> 01:31:45,179
Windows operating system does I see it
 

4689
01:31:45,179 --> 01:31:47,810
Windows operating system does I see it
more like an operating system than

4690
01:31:47,810 --> 01:31:47,820
more like an operating system than

more like an operating system than
um like this thing

4692

01:32:23,639 --> 01:32:26,270
purchase stuff based on its
recommendation it gets money

4724
01:32:26,270 --> 01:32:26,280
recommendation it gets money
 

4725
01:32:26,280 --> 01:32:29,570
recommendation it gets money
that so it's it's kind of AD driven but

4726
01:32:29,570 --> 01:32:29,580
that so it's it's kind of AD driven but
 

4727
01:32:29,580 --> 01:32:34,550
that so it's it's kind of AD driven but
it's not ads it's like um

4728
01:32:34,550 --> 01:32:34,560

 

4729
01:32:34,560 --> 01:32:35,209

um

4730
01:32:35,209 --> 01:32:35,219
um
 

4731
01:32:35,219 --> 01:32:39,709
um
it's not controlled like no no external

4732
01:32:39,709 --> 01:32:39,719
it's not controlled like no no external
 

4733
01:32:39,719 --> 01:32:42,410
it's not controlled like no no external
entities can control it

4734
01:32:42,410 --> 01:32:42,420
entities can control it
 

4735
01:32:42,420 --> 01:32:44,930
entities can control it
to try to manipulate to want a thing

4736
01:32:44,930 --> 01:32:44,940
to try to manipulate to want a thing
 

4737
01:32:44,940 --> 01:32:47,149
to try to manipulate to want a thing
that would be amazing it's actually

4738
01:32:47,149 --> 01:32:47,159
that would be amazing it's actually
 

4739
01:32:47,159 --> 01:32:49,490
that would be amazing it's actually
trying to discover what you want so it's

4740
01:32:49,490 --> 01:32:49,500
trying to discover what you want so it's
 

4741
01:32:49,500 --> 01:32:53,450
trying to discover what you want so it's
not allowed to have any influence no

4742
01:32:53,450 --> 01:32:53,460
not allowed to have any influence no
 

4743
01:32:53,460 --> 01:32:56,689
not allowed to have any influence no
promoted ad no anything so that's

4744
01:32:56,689 --> 01:32:56,699
promoted ad no anything so that's
 

4745
01:32:56,699 --> 01:33:00,169
promoted ad no anything so that's
finding I don't know the uh the the

4746
01:33:00,169 --> 01:33:00,179
finding I don't know the uh the the
 

4747
01:33:00,179 --> 01:33:01,430
finding I don't know the uh the the
thing that would actually make you happy

4748
01:33:01,430 --> 01:33:01,440
thing that would actually make you happy
 

4749
01:33:01,440 --> 01:33:03,590
thing that would actually make you happy
that's the only thing it cares about

4750
01:33:03,590 --> 01:33:03,600
that's the only thing it cares about
 

4751
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:05,209
that's the only thing it cares about
I I think

4752
01:33:05,209 --> 01:33:05,219
I I think
 

4753
01:33:05,219 --> 01:33:08,030
I I think
I think companies like this can win out

4754
01:33:08,030 --> 01:33:08,040
I think companies like this can win out
 

4755
01:33:08,040 --> 01:33:10,330
I think companies like this can win out
yes I think eventually once people

4756
01:33:10,330 --> 01:33:10,340
yes I think eventually once people
 

4757
01:33:10,340 --> 01:33:13,250
yes I think eventually once people
understand the value

4758
01:33:13,250 --> 01:33:13,260
understand the value
 

4759
01:33:13,260 --> 01:33:16,370
understand the value
of the robot even just like I think that

4760
01:33:16,370 --> 01:33:16,380
of the robot even just like I think that
 

4761
01:33:16,380 --> 01:33:18,350
of the robot even just like I think that
robots would be valuable to people even

4762
01:33:18,350 --> 01:33:18,360
robots would be valuable to people even
 

4763
01:33:18,360 --> 01:33:19,729
robots would be valuable to people even
if they're not

4764
01:33:19,729 --> 01:33:19,739
if they're not
 

4765
01:33:19,739 --> 01:33:21,709
if they're not
marketing something or helping with like

4766
01:33:21,709 --> 01:33:21,719
marketing something or helping with like
 

4767
01:33:21,719 --> 01:33:24,050
marketing something or helping with like
preferences or anything like just a

4768
01:33:24,050 --> 01:33:24,060
preferences or anything like just a
 

4769
01:33:24,060 --> 01:33:26,750
preferences or anything like just a
simple the same thing as a pet like a

4770
01:33:26,750 --> 01:33:26,760
simple the same thing as a pet like a
 

4771
01:33:26,760 --> 01:33:28,669
simple the same thing as a pet like a
dog that has no function other than

4772
01:33:28,669 --> 01:33:28,679
dog that has no function other than
 

4773
01:33:28,679 --> 01:33:30,110
dog that has no function other than
being a member of your family I think

4774
01:33:30,110 --> 01:33:30,120
being a member of your family I think
 

4775
01:33:30,120 --> 01:33:31,669
being a member of your family I think
robots could really be that and people

4776
01:33:31,669 --> 01:33:31,679
robots could really be that and people
 

4777
01:33:31,679 --> 01:33:33,590
robots could really be that and people
would pay for that I don't think the

4778
01:33:33,590 --> 01:33:33,600
would pay for that I don't think the
 

4779
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:35,629
would pay for that I don't think the
market realizes that yet

4780
01:33:35,629 --> 01:33:35,639
market realizes that yet
 

4781
01:33:35,639 --> 01:33:38,390
market realizes that yet
and so my concern is that companies are

4782
01:33:38,390 --> 01:33:38,400
and so my concern is that companies are
 

4783
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:40,250
and so my concern is that companies are
not going to go in that direction at

4784
01:33:40,250 --> 01:33:40,260
not going to go in that direction at
 

4785
01:33:40,260 --> 01:33:42,490
not going to go in that direction at
least not yet of making like this

4786
01:33:42,490 --> 01:33:42,500
least not yet of making like this
 

4787
01:33:42,500 --> 01:33:45,590
least not yet of making like this
contained thing that you bought it seems

4788
01:33:45,590 --> 01:33:45,600
contained thing that you bought it seems
 

4789
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:47,390
contained thing that you bought it seems
almost old-fashioned right to have a

4790
01:33:47,390 --> 01:33:47,400
almost old-fashioned right to have a
 

4791
01:33:47,400 --> 01:33:49,390
almost old-fashioned right to have a

disconnected
 

4793
01:33:49,400 --> 01:33:52,370
disconnected
uh object that you buy that you're not

4794
01:33:52,370 --> 01:33:52,380
uh object that you buy that you're not
 

4795
01:33:52,380 --> 01:33:54,229
uh object that you buy that you're not
like paying a subscription for it's not

4796
01:33:54,229 --> 01:33:54,239
like paying a subscription for it's not
 

4797
01:33:54,239 --> 01:33:55,610
like paying a subscription for it's not
like controlled by one of the big

4798
01:33:55,610 --> 01:33:55,620
like controlled by one of the big
 

4799
01:33:55,620 --> 01:33:56,689
like controlled by one of the big
corporations but that's the

4800
01:33:56,689 --> 01:33:56,699
corporations but that's the
 

4801
01:33:56,699 --> 01:34:00,110
corporations but that's the
old-fashioned things that people uh

4802
01:34:00,110 --> 01:34:00,120
old-fashioned things that people uh
 

4803
01:34:00,120 --> 01:34:03,410
old-fashioned things that people uh
uh yearn for because

4804
01:34:03,410 --> 01:34:03,420
uh yearn for because

I think is very popular now and people
 

4807
01:34:06,179 --> 01:34:07,970
I think is very popular now and people
understand the negative effects of

01:34:07,970 --> 01:34:07,980
understand the negative effects of
 

4809
01:34:07,980 --> 01:34:10,550
understand the negative effects of
social media the negative effects of the

social media the negative effects of the
data being used in all these kinds of

4812
01:34:12,770 --> 01:34:12,780
data being used in all these kinds of
 

4813
01:34:12,780 --> 01:34:14,750
data being used in all these kinds of
ways I think I think we're just waking

4814
01:34:14,750 --> 01:34:14,760
ways I think I think we're just waking
 

4815
01:34:14,760 --> 01:34:18,169
ways I think I think we're just waking
up to the realization we tried but we're

4816
01:34:18,169 --> 01:34:18,179
up to the realization we tried but we're
 

4817
01:34:18,179 --> 01:34:20,450
up to the realization we tried but we're
like baby deer finding our legs in this

4818
01:34:20,450 --> 01:34:20,460
like baby deer finding our legs in this
 

4819
01:34:20,460 --> 01:34:22,910
like baby deer finding our legs in this
new world of social media of AD driven

4820
01:34:22,910 --> 01:34:22,920
new world of social media of AD driven
 

4821
01:34:22,920 --> 01:34:25,370
new world of social media of AD driven
companies and realizing okay this has to

4822
01:34:25,370 --> 01:34:25,380
companies and realizing okay this has to
 

4823
01:34:25,380 --> 01:34:27,709
companies and realizing okay this has to
be done somehow different I mean that

4824
01:34:27,709 --> 01:34:27,719
be done somehow different I mean that
 

4825
01:34:27,719 --> 01:34:30,610
be done somehow different I mean that
like like one of the most popular

4826
01:34:30,610 --> 01:34:30,620
like like one of the most popular
 

4827
01:34:30,620 --> 01:34:32,810
like like one of the most popular
Notions at least the United States and

4828
01:34:32,810 --> 01:34:32,820
Notions at least the United States and
 

4829
01:34:32,820 --> 01:34:34,790
Notions at least the United States and
social media is evil and it's doing bad

4830
01:34:34,790 --> 01:34:34,800
social media is evil and it's doing bad
 

4831
01:34:34,800 --> 01:34:37,669

it's it's doing bad by us it's not like

4832
01:34:37,669 --> 01:34:37,679
it's it's doing bad by us it's not like
 

4833
01:34:37,679 --> 01:34:40,970
it's it's doing bad by us it's not like
it's totally tricked us into believing

4834
01:34:40,970 --> 01:34:40,980
it's totally tricked us into believing
 

4835
01:34:40,980 --> 01:34:43,070
it's totally tricked us into believing
that is good for us I think everybody

4836
01:34:43,070 --> 01:34:43,080
that is good for us I think everybody
 

4837
01:34:43,080 --> 01:34:44,689
that is good for us I think everybody
knows it's bad for us and so like

4838
01:34:44,689 --> 01:34:44,699
knows it's bad for us and so like
 

4839
01:34:44,699 --> 01:34:47,570
knows it's bad for us and so like
there's a hunger for our other ideas all

4840
01:34:47,570 --> 01:34:47,580
there's a hunger for our other ideas all
 

4841
01:34:47,580 --> 01:34:49,070
there's a hunger for our other ideas all
right it's time for us to assist that

4842
01:34:49,070 --> 01:34:49,080
right it's time for us to assist that
 

4843
01:34:49,080 --> 01:34:50,450
right it's time for us to assist that
company I think so let's do it let's do

4844
01:34:50,450 --> 01:34:50,460
company I think so let's do it let's do
 

4845
01:34:50,460 --> 01:34:52,310
company I think so let's do it let's do
it I think let's go hopefully no one

4846
01:34:52,310 --> 01:34:52,320
it I think let's go hopefully no one
 

4847
01:34:52,320 --> 01:34:53,870
it I think let's go hopefully no one
listens to this and steals the idea

4848
01:34:53,870 --> 01:34:53,880
listens to this and steals the idea
 

4849
01:34:53,880 --> 01:34:55,970
listens to this and steals the idea
there's no see that's the other thing I

4850
01:34:55,970 --> 01:34:55,980
there's no see that's the other thing I
 

4851
01:34:55,980 --> 01:34:59,149

um
 

4855
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,629
um
executions what matters I mean oh yeah

4856
01:35:02,629 --> 01:35:02,639
executions what matters I mean oh yeah
 

4857
01:35:02,639 --> 01:35:04,850
executions what matters I mean oh yeah
it's like ideas are kind of true the

4858
01:35:04,850 --> 01:35:04,860
it's like ideas are kind of true the
 

4859
01:35:04,860 --> 01:35:06,590
it's like ideas are kind of true the
social robotics is a good example that

4860
01:35:06,590 --> 01:35:06,600
social robotics is a good example that
 

4861
01:35:06,600 --> 01:35:08,930
social robotics is a good example that
there's been so many amazing companies

4862
01:35:08,930 --> 01:35:08,940
there's been so many amazing companies
 

4863
01:35:08,940 --> 01:35:10,910
there's been so many amazing companies
that went out of business

4864
01:35:10,910 --> 01:35:10,920
that went out of business
 

4865
01:35:10,920 --> 01:35:13,070
that went out of business
I mean to me it's obvious like it's

4866
01:35:13,070 --> 01:35:13,080
I mean to me it's obvious like it's
 

4867
01:35:13,080 --> 01:35:14,930
I mean to me it's obvious like it's
obvious that

4868
01:35:14,930 --> 01:35:14,940
obvious that
 

4869
01:35:14,940 --> 01:35:17,450
obvious that
there will be a robotics company

4870
01:35:17,450 --> 01:35:17,460
there will be a robotics company
 

4871
01:35:17,460 --> 01:35:20,390
there will be a robotics company
that puts a social robot in the home of

4872
01:35:20,390 --> 01:35:20,400
that puts a social robot in the home of
 

4873
01:35:20,400 --> 01:35:22,010
that puts a social robot in the home of
billions of homes

4874
01:35:22,010 --> 01:35:22,020
billions of homes
 

4875
01:35:22,020 --> 01:35:24,530
billions of homes
yeah and it'll be a companion

4876
01:35:24,530 --> 01:35:24,540
yeah and it'll be a companion
 

4877
01:35:24,540 --> 01:35:26,209
yeah and it'll be a companion
okay there you go you can steal that

4878
01:35:26,209 --> 01:35:26,219
okay there you go you can steal that
 

4879
01:35:26,219 --> 01:35:30,770
okay there you go you can steal that
idea do it okay for you

4880
01:35:30,770 --> 01:35:30,780
idea do it okay for you
 

4881
01:35:30,780 --> 01:35:33,530
idea do it okay for you
what about Elon musk's humanoid

4882
01:35:33,530 --> 01:35:33,540
what about Elon musk's humanoid
 

4883
01:35:33,540 --> 01:35:36,850
what about Elon musk's humanoid
is he gonna execute on that

4884
01:35:36,850 --> 01:35:36,860
is he gonna execute on that
 

4885
01:35:36,860 --> 01:35:39,350
is he gonna execute on that
there might be a lot to say so for

4886
01:35:39,350 --> 01:35:39,360
there might be a lot to say so for
 

4887
01:35:39,360 --> 01:35:40,729
there might be a lot to say so for
people who are not aware there's an

4888
01:35:40,729 --> 01:35:40,739
people who are not aware there's an
 

4889
01:35:40,739 --> 01:35:45,290
people who are not aware there's an
Optimus Tesla's Optimus robot that's um

4890
01:35:45,290 --> 01:35:45,300
Optimus Tesla's Optimus robot that's um
 

4891
01:35:45,300 --> 01:35:48,229
Optimus Tesla's Optimus robot that's um
I guess the stated reason for that robot

4892
01:35:48,229 --> 01:35:48,239
I guess the stated reason for that robot
 

4893
01:35:48,239 --> 01:35:49,970
I guess the stated reason for that robot
is a humanoid robot in the factory

4894
01:35:49,970 --> 01:35:49,980
is a humanoid robot in the factory
 

4895
01:35:49,980 --> 01:35:52,430
is a humanoid robot in the factory
that's able to automate some of the

4896
01:35:52,430 --> 01:35:52,440
that's able to automate some of the
 

4897
01:35:52,440 --> 01:35:53,750
that's able to automate some of the
tasks that humans are currently doing

4898
01:35:53,750 --> 01:35:53,760
tasks that humans are currently doing
 

4899
01:35:53,760 --> 01:35:56,149
tasks that humans are currently doing
and the reason you want to do it's the

4900
01:35:56,149 --> 01:35:56,159
and the reason you want to do it's the
 

4901
01:35:56,159 --> 01:35:57,470
and the reason you want to do it's the
second reason you mentioned the reason

4902
01:35:57,470 --> 01:35:57,480
second reason you mentioned the reason
 

4903
01:35:57,480 --> 01:36:00,229
second reason you mentioned the reason
you want to do a humanoid robot because

4904
01:36:00,229 --> 01:36:00,239
you want to do a humanoid robot because
 

4905
01:36:00,239 --> 01:36:02,149
you want to do a humanoid robot because
the factory is built for the certain

4906
01:36:02,149 --> 01:36:02,159
the factory is built for the certain
 

4907
01:36:02,159 --> 01:36:03,770
the factory is built for the certain
tasks that are

4908
01:36:03,770 --> 01:36:03,780
tasks that are
 

4909
01:36:03,780 --> 01:36:06,410
tasks that are
um designed for humans so it's hard to

4910
01:36:06,410 --> 01:36:06,420
um designed for humans so it's hard to
 

4911
01:36:06,420 --> 01:36:08,629
um designed for humans so it's hard to
automate with the any other form factor

4912
01:36:08,629 --> 01:36:08,639
automate with the any other form factor
 

4913
01:36:08,639 --> 01:36:10,550
automate with the any other form factor
than a humanoid and then the other

4914
01:36:10,550 --> 01:36:10,560
than a humanoid and then the other
 

4915
01:36:10,560 --> 01:36:14,030
than a humanoid and then the other
reason is because so much effort has

4916
01:36:14,030 --> 01:36:14,040
reason is because so much effort has
 

4917
01:36:14,040 --> 01:36:16,430
reason is because so much effort has
been put into this giant data engine

4918
01:36:16,430 --> 01:36:16,440
been put into this giant data engine
 

4919
01:36:16,440 --> 01:36:19,310
been put into this giant data engine
machine of of perception that's inside

4920
01:36:19,310 --> 01:36:19,320
machine of of perception that's inside
 

4921
01:36:19,320 --> 01:36:23,450
machine of of perception that's inside
Tesla autopilot that's seemingly at

4922
01:36:23,450 --> 01:36:23,460
Tesla autopilot that's seemingly at
 

4923
01:36:23,460 --> 01:36:25,729
Tesla autopilot that's seemingly at
least the machine if not the data is

4924
01:36:25,729 --> 01:36:25,739
least the machine if not the data is
 

4925
01:36:25,739 --> 01:36:27,709
least the machine if not the data is
transferable to the factory setting to

4926
01:36:27,709 --> 01:36:27,719
transferable to the factory setting to
 

4927
01:36:27,719 --> 01:36:29,870
transferable to the factory setting to
any setting yeah he said he would do

4928
01:36:29,870 --> 01:36:29,880
any setting yeah he said he would do
 

4929
01:36:29,880 --> 01:36:32,990
any setting yeah he said he would do
anything that's boring to to us yeah

4930
01:36:32,990 --> 01:36:33,000
anything that's boring to to us yeah

yeah
 

4933
01:36:34,199 --> 01:36:37,129
yeah
the interesting thing about that is

4934
01:36:37,129 --> 01:36:37,139
the interesting thing about that is
 

4935
01:36:37,139 --> 01:36:38,629
the interesting thing about that is
there's

4936
01:36:38,629 --> 01:36:38,639
there's

there's
no interest

he
there's not a discussion about like to

4950
01:36:57,229 --> 01:36:57,239
there's not a discussion about like to
 

4951
01:36:57,239 --> 01:36:59,209
there's not a discussion about like to
me it's obvious if a thing like that

4952
01:36:59,209 --> 01:36:59,219
me it's obvious if a thing like that
 

4953
01:36:59,219 --> 01:37:02,330
me it's obvious if a thing like that
works at all at all

4954
01:37:02,330 --> 01:37:02,340
works at all at all
 

4955
01:37:02,340 --> 01:37:03,830
works at all at all
in fact

4956
01:37:03,830 --> 01:37:03,840
in fact
 

4957
01:37:03,840 --> 01:37:06,410
in fact
it has to work really well in a factory

4958
01:37:06,410 --> 01:37:06,420
it has to work really well in a factory
 

4959
01:37:06,420 --> 01:37:08,990
it has to work really well in a factory
if it works kind of shitty it's much

4960
01:37:08,990 --> 01:37:09,000
if it works kind of shitty it's much
 

4961
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,570
if it works kind of shitty it's much
more useful in the home

4962
01:37:11,570 --> 01:37:11,580
more useful in the home
 

4963
01:37:11,580 --> 01:37:13,729
more useful in the home
that's true because we're much this

4964
01:37:13,729 --> 01:37:13,739
that's true because we're much this
 

4965
01:37:13,739 --> 01:37:16,850
that's true because we're much this
we're I I think being shitty as stuff is

4966
01:37:16,850 --> 01:37:16,860
we're I I think being shitty as stuff is
 

4967
01:37:16,860 --> 01:37:18,470
we're I I think being shitty as stuff is
kind of uh

4968
01:37:18,470 --> 01:37:18,480
kind of uh
 

4969
01:37:18,480 --> 01:37:21,950
kind of uh
what makes relationships great

4970
01:37:21,950 --> 01:37:21,960
what makes relationships great
 

4971

like
 

4999
01:37:56,520 --> 01:37:58,610
like
um you almost want to engineer that in

5000
01:37:58,610 --> 01:37:58,620
um you almost want to engineer that in
 

5001
01:37:58,620 --> 01:38:01,090
um you almost want to engineer that in
uh except you don't have to because of

5002
01:38:01,090 --> 01:38:01,100
uh except you don't have to because of
 

5003
01:38:01,100 --> 01:38:03,290
uh except you don't have to because of
Robotics in the physical Space is really

5004
01:38:03,290 --> 01:38:03,300
Robotics in the physical Space is really
 

5005
01:38:03,300 --> 01:38:05,810
Robotics in the physical Space is really
difficult so

5006
01:38:05,810 --> 01:38:05,820
difficult so
 

5007
01:38:05,820 --> 01:38:08,450
difficult so
um

5008
01:38:08,450 --> 01:38:08,460

 

5009
01:38:08,460 --> 01:38:12,290

I think I've learned to not discount the

5010
01:38:12,290 --> 01:38:12,300
I think I've learned to not discount the
 

5011
01:38:12,300 --> 01:38:14,629
I think I've learned to not discount the
the efforts that Elon does there's a few

5012
01:38:14,629 --> 01:38:14,639
the efforts that Elon does there's a few
 

5013
01:38:14,639 --> 01:38:16,669
the efforts that Elon does there's a few
things that are really interesting there

5014
01:38:16,669 --> 01:38:16,679
things that are really interesting there
 

5015
01:38:16,679 --> 01:38:18,770
things that are really interesting there
one

5016
01:38:18,770 --> 01:38:18,780
one
 

5017
01:38:18,780 --> 01:38:21,770
one
because he's taken extremely seriously

5018

cost of building a robot I talked to Jim

5022
01:38:26,270 --> 01:38:26,280
cost of building a robot I talked to Jim
 

5023

Keller offline about this a lot and
 

5025
01:38:28,920 --> 01:38:31,010
Keller offline about this a lot and
currently human robots cost a lot of

5026

currently human robots cost a lot of
 

5027
01:38:31,020 --> 01:38:32,510
currently human robots cost a lot of
money

and the way they're thinking about it
 

5031
01:38:34,440 --> 01:38:35,990
and the way they're thinking about it
now they're not talking about all the

5032

now they're not talking about all the
 

5033
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:37,729
now they're not talking about all the
social robotic stuff that you and I care

5034
01:38:37,729 --> 01:38:37,739
social robotic stuff that you and I care
 

5035
01:38:37,739 --> 01:38:40,850
social robotic stuff that you and I care
about uh they are thinking how can we

5036
01:38:40,850 --> 01:38:40,860
about uh they are thinking how can we
 

5037
01:38:40,860 --> 01:38:42,649
about uh they are thinking how can we
manufacture this thing

5038
01:38:42,649 --> 01:38:42,659
manufacture this thing
 

5039
01:38:42,659 --> 01:38:46,070
manufacture this thing
cheaply and do it like well and the kind

5040
01:38:46,070 --> 01:38:46,080
cheaply and do it like well and the kind
 

5041
01:38:46,080 --> 01:38:48,290
cheaply and do it like well and the kind
of discussions they're having is really

5042
01:38:48,290 --> 01:38:48,300
of discussions they're having is really
 

5043
01:38:48,300 --> 01:38:51,050
of discussions they're having is really
great engineering it's like it's a bit

5044
01:38:51,050 --> 01:38:51,060
great engineering it's like it's a bit
 

5045
01:38:51,060 --> 01:38:52,610
great engineering it's like it's a bit
it's like first principles question of

5046
01:38:52,610 --> 01:38:52,620
it's like first principles question of
 

5047
01:38:52,620 --> 01:38:54,770
it's like first principles question of
like why is this cost so much like

5048
01:38:54,770 --> 01:38:54,780
like why is this cost so much like
 

5049
01:38:54,780 --> 01:38:57,229
like why is this cost so much like
what's the cheap way how why can't we

5050
01:38:57,229 --> 01:38:57,239
what's the cheap way how why can't we
 

5051
01:38:57,239 --> 01:38:59,270
what's the cheap way how why can't we
build and there's not a good answer

5052
01:38:59,270 --> 01:38:59,280
build and there's not a good answer
 

5053
01:38:59,280 --> 01:39:01,550
build and there's not a good answer
uh why can't we build this humanoid form

5054
01:39:01,550 --> 01:39:01,560
uh why can't we build this humanoid form
 

5055
01:39:01,560 --> 01:39:03,530
uh why can't we build this humanoid form
for under a thousand dollars

5056
01:39:03,530 --> 01:39:03,540
for under a thousand dollars
 

5057
01:39:03,540 --> 01:39:05,629
for under a thousand dollars
and like I've I've

5058
01:39:05,629 --> 01:39:05,639
and like I've I've
 

5059
01:39:05,639 --> 01:39:07,550
and like I've I've
sat and had these conversations there's

5060
01:39:07,550 --> 01:39:07,560
sat and had these conversations there's
 

5061
01:39:07,560 --> 01:39:10,729
sat and had these conversations there's
no reason it's uh I think the reason

5062
01:39:10,729 --> 01:39:10,739
no reason it's uh I think the reason
 

5063
01:39:10,739 --> 01:39:12,890
no reason it's uh I think the reason
they've been so expensive is because

5064
01:39:12,890 --> 01:39:12,900
they've been so expensive is because
 

5065
01:39:12,900 --> 01:39:13,550
they've been so expensive is because
um

5066
01:39:13,550 --> 01:39:13,560
um
 

5067
01:39:13,560 --> 01:39:16,850
um
they were focused on trying to

5068
01:39:16,850 --> 01:39:16,860
they were focused on trying to
 

5069
01:39:16,860 --> 01:39:18,530
they were focused on trying to
they weren't focused on doing the mass

5070
01:39:18,530 --> 01:39:18,540
they weren't focused on doing the mass
 

5071
01:39:18,540 --> 01:39:21,050
they weren't focused on doing the mass
manufacture they were people are focused

5072
01:39:21,050 --> 01:39:21,060
manufacture they were people are focused
 

5073
01:39:21,060 --> 01:39:22,790
manufacture they were people are focused
on getting a thing that's

5074
01:39:22,790 --> 01:39:22,800
on getting a thing that's
 

5075
01:39:22,800 --> 01:39:24,290
on getting a thing that's
um I don't know I don't know exactly

5076
01:39:24,290 --> 01:39:24,300
um I don't know I don't know exactly
 

5077
01:39:24,300 --> 01:39:26,510
um I don't know I don't know exactly
what the reasoning is but it's the same

5078
01:39:26,510 --> 01:39:26,520
what the reasoning is but it's the same
 

5079
01:39:26,520 --> 01:39:29,570
what the reasoning is but it's the same
like waymo it's like let's let's build a

5080
01:39:29,570 --> 01:39:29,580
like waymo it's like let's let's build a
 

5081
01:39:29,580 --> 01:39:31,850
like waymo it's like let's let's build a
million dollar car in the beginning

5082
01:39:31,850 --> 01:39:31,860
million dollar car in the beginning
 

5083
01:39:31,860 --> 01:39:34,010
million dollar car in the beginning
or like multi-million dollar car let's

5084
01:39:34,010 --> 01:39:34,020
or like multi-million dollar car let's
 

5085
01:39:34,020 --> 01:39:36,110
or like multi-million dollar car let's
try to solve that problem

5086
01:39:36,110 --> 01:39:36,120
try to solve that problem
 

5087
01:39:36,120 --> 01:39:38,570
try to solve that problem
the the way Elon the way Jim Keller the

way some of those folks are thinking is
 

5091
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:43,550
way some of those folks are thinking is
that's like at the same time try to

5092
01:39:43,550 --> 01:39:43,560
that's like at the same time try to
 

5093
01:39:43,560 --> 01:39:46,729
that's like at the same time try to
actually build a system that's cheap not

5094
01:39:46,729 --> 01:39:46,739
actually build a system that's cheap not
 

5095
01:39:46,739 --> 01:39:48,770
actually build a system that's cheap not
crappy but cheap unless from first

01:39:48,770 --> 01:39:48,780
crappy but cheap unless from first

5099
01:39:52,620 --> 01:39:54,950

the joints where's the control set like

5102
01:39:57,530 --> 01:39:57,540
the joints where's the control set like
 

5103
01:39:57,540 --> 01:39:59,629
the joints where's the control set like
how many how do we act like where are

5104
01:39:59,629 --> 01:39:59,639
how many how do we act like where are
 

5105
01:39:59,639 --> 01:40:02,270
how many how do we act like where are
the activators uh what's the way to

5106
01:40:02,270 --> 01:40:02,280
the activators uh what's the way to
 

5107
01:40:02,280 --> 01:40:04,129
the activators uh what's the way to
power this in the lowest cost way

5108
01:40:04,129 --> 01:40:04,139
power this in the lowest cost way
 

5109
01:40:04,139 --> 01:40:06,470
power this in the lowest cost way
possible but also in a way that's like

5110
01:40:06,470 --> 01:40:06,480
possible but also in a way that's like
 

5111
01:40:06,480 --> 01:40:08,629
possible but also in a way that's like
actually works how do we make the whole

5112
01:40:08,629 --> 01:40:08,639
actually works how do we make the whole
 

5113
01:40:08,639 --> 01:40:10,729
actually works how do we make the whole

01:40:13,129 --> 01:40:13,139
there's a supply chain you have to have
 

5117
01:40:13,139 --> 01:40:14,570
there's a supply chain you have to have
all these different parts that have to

01:40:14,570 --> 01:40:14,580
all these different parts that have to
 

5119
01:40:14,580 --> 01:40:18,050
all these different parts that have to
feed us so do it all from scratch and do

01:40:20,270 --> 01:40:20,280
the the learning I mean it's like
 

5123
01:40:20,280 --> 01:40:22,790
the the learning I mean it's like
immediately certain things like become

obvious do uh the exact same pipeline as

5126
01:40:26,030 --> 01:40:26,040
obvious do uh the exact same pipeline as
 

5127
01:40:26,040 --> 01:40:28,010
obvious do uh the exact same pipeline as
you do for autonomous driving just the

5128
01:40:28,010 --> 01:40:28,020
you do for autonomous driving just the
 

5129
01:40:28,020 --> 01:40:29,930
you do for autonomous driving just the
exactly I mean the infrastructure that

5130
01:40:29,930 --> 01:40:29,940
exactly I mean the infrastructure that
 

5131
01:40:29,940 --> 01:40:32,149
exactly I mean the infrastructure that
is incredible for the computer vision

5132
01:40:32,149 --> 01:40:32,159
is incredible for the computer vision
 

5133
01:40:32,159 --> 01:40:34,189
is incredible for the computer vision
for the manipulation task the control

problem changes the perception uh

5136
01:40:36,830 --> 01:40:36,840
problem changes the perception uh
 

5137
01:40:36,840 --> 01:40:39,229
problem changes the perception uh
problem changes but the pipeline doesn't

5138
01:40:39,229 --> 01:40:39,239
problem changes but the pipeline doesn't
 

5139
01:40:39,239 --> 01:40:40,310
problem changes but the pipeline doesn't
change

5140
01:40:40,310 --> 01:40:40,320
change
 

5141
01:40:40,320 --> 01:40:43,370
change
and do it and so I don't I don't

5142
01:40:43,370 --> 01:40:43,380
and do it and so I don't I don't
 

5143
01:40:43,380 --> 01:40:46,070
and do it and so I don't I don't
um obviously the optimism about how long

5144
01:40:46,070 --> 01:40:46,080
um obviously the optimism about how long
 

5145
01:40:46,080 --> 01:40:49,729
um obviously the optimism about how long
it's going to take I don't share

5146
01:40:49,729 --> 01:40:49,739
it's going to take I don't share
 

5147
01:40:49,739 --> 01:40:51,530
it's going to take I don't share
um but it's a really interesting problem

5148
01:40:51,530 --> 01:40:51,540
um but it's a really interesting problem
 

5149
01:40:51,540 --> 01:40:53,570
um but it's a really interesting problem
and I don't want to say anything because

5150
01:40:53,570 --> 01:40:53,580
and I don't want to say anything because
 

5151
01:40:53,580 --> 01:40:57,410
and I don't want to say anything because
my first gut is to say that why the

5152
01:40:57,410 --> 01:40:57,420
my first gut is to say that why the
 

5153
01:40:57,420 --> 01:40:58,910
my first gut is to say that why the
humanoid form that doesn't make sense

5154
01:40:58,910 --> 01:40:58,920
humanoid form that doesn't make sense
 

5155
01:40:58,920 --> 01:41:02,209
humanoid form that doesn't make sense
yeah that's my second gut too but but

5156
01:41:02,209 --> 01:41:02,219
yeah that's my second gut too but but
 

5157
01:41:02,219 --> 01:41:04,430
yeah that's my second gut too but but
then there's a lot of people that are

5158
01:41:04,430 --> 01:41:04,440
then there's a lot of people that are
 

5159
01:41:04,440 --> 01:41:05,750
then there's a lot of people that are
really excited about the humanoid form

5160
01:41:05,750 --> 01:41:05,760
really excited about the humanoid form
 

5161
01:41:05,760 --> 01:41:07,550
really excited about the humanoid form
there that's true I don't want to get in

5162
01:41:07,550 --> 01:41:07,560
there that's true I don't want to get in
 

5163
01:41:07,560 --> 01:41:08,629
there that's true I don't want to get in
the way

5164
01:41:08,629 --> 01:41:08,639
the way
 

5165
01:41:08,639 --> 01:41:10,970
the way
like they might solve this thing and

5166
01:41:10,970 --> 01:41:10,980
like they might solve this thing and
 

5167
01:41:10,980 --> 01:41:12,890
like they might solve this thing and
they might it's like similar with Boston

5168
01:41:12,890 --> 01:41:12,900
they might it's like similar with Boston
 

5169
01:41:12,900 --> 01:41:16,669
they might it's like similar with Boston
Dynamics like why like if I were to you

5170
01:41:16,669 --> 01:41:16,679
Dynamics like why like if I were to you
 

5171
01:41:16,679 --> 01:41:18,890
Dynamics like why like if I were to you
can be a hater and be and you go go up

5172
01:41:18,890 --> 01:41:18,900
can be a hater and be and you go go up
 

5173
01:41:18,900 --> 01:41:22,129
can be a hater and be and you go go up
to Mark Robert and just like how are you

5174
01:41:22,129 --> 01:41:22,139
to Mark Robert and just like how are you
 

5175
01:41:22,139 --> 01:41:23,810
to Mark Robert and just like how are you
gonna make money with these like super

5176
01:41:23,810 --> 01:41:23,820
gonna make money with these like super
 

5177
01:41:23,820 --> 01:41:26,030
gonna make money with these like super
expensive legged robots what's what's

5178
01:41:26,030 --> 01:41:26,040
expensive legged robots what's what's
 

5179
01:41:26,040 --> 01:41:27,890
expensive legged robots what's what's
your business plan this doesn't make any

5180
01:41:27,890 --> 01:41:27,900
your business plan this doesn't make any
 

5181
01:41:27,900 --> 01:41:29,330
your business plan this doesn't make any
sense why are you doing these legged

5182
01:41:29,330 --> 01:41:29,340
sense why are you doing these legged
 

5183
01:41:29,340 --> 01:41:31,850
sense why are you doing these legged
robots but at the same time they're

5184
01:41:31,850 --> 01:41:31,860
robots but at the same time they're
 

5185
01:41:31,860 --> 01:41:35,270
robots but at the same time they're
pushing forward the science the art of

5186
01:41:35,270 --> 01:41:35,280
pushing forward the science the art of
 

5187
01:41:35,280 --> 01:41:36,709
pushing forward the science the art of
Robotics and the way that nobody else

5188
01:41:36,709 --> 01:41:36,719
Robotics and the way that nobody else
 

5189
01:41:36,719 --> 01:41:41,030
Robotics and the way that nobody else
does yeah and uh with Elon they're not

5190
01:41:41,030 --> 01:41:41,040
does yeah and uh with Elon they're not
 

5191
01:41:41,040 --> 01:41:43,550
does yeah and uh with Elon they're not
just going to do that they're going to

5192
01:41:43,550 --> 01:41:43,560
just going to do that they're going to
 

5193
01:41:43,560 --> 01:41:46,850
just going to do that they're going to
drive down the cost to where we can have

5194
01:41:46,850 --> 01:41:46,860
drive down the cost to where we can have
 

5195
01:41:46,860 --> 01:41:48,950
drive down the cost to where we can have
humanoid baths in the home potentially

5196
01:41:48,950 --> 01:41:48,960
humanoid baths in the home potentially
 

5197
01:41:48,960 --> 01:41:52,729
humanoid baths in the home potentially
so the part I agree with is

5198
01:41:52,729 --> 01:41:52,739
so the part I agree with is
 

5199
01:41:52,739 --> 01:41:55,129
so the part I agree with is
a lot of people find it fascinating and

5200
01:41:55,129 --> 01:41:55,139
a lot of people find it fascinating and
 

5201
01:41:55,139 --> 01:41:57,050
a lot of people find it fascinating and
it probably also attracts Talent who

5202
01:41:57,050 --> 01:41:57,060
it probably also attracts Talent who
 

5203
01:41:57,060 --> 01:41:58,910
it probably also attracts Talent who
want to work on humanoid robots I think

5204
01:41:58,910 --> 01:41:58,920
want to work on humanoid robots I think
 

5205
01:41:58,920 --> 01:42:00,950
want to work on humanoid robots I think
it's a fascinating scientific problem

5206
01:42:00,950 --> 01:42:00,960
it's a fascinating scientific problem
 

5207
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:03,470
it's a fascinating scientific problem
and Engineering problem and it can teach

5208
01:42:03,470 --> 01:42:03,480
and Engineering problem and it can teach
 

5209
01:42:03,480 --> 01:42:06,169
and Engineering problem and it can teach
us more about human body and Locomotion

5210
01:42:06,169 --> 01:42:06,179
us more about human body and Locomotion
 

5211
01:42:06,179 --> 01:42:07,550
us more about human body and Locomotion
and all of that I think there's a lot to

5212
01:42:07,550 --> 01:42:07,560
and all of that I think there's a lot to
 

5213
01:42:07,560 --> 01:42:10,010
and all of that I think there's a lot to
learn from it where I get tripped up is

5214
01:42:10,010 --> 01:42:10,020
learn from it where I get tripped up is
 

5215
01:42:10,020 --> 01:42:12,470
learn from it where I get tripped up is
why we need them

5216
01:42:12,470 --> 01:42:12,480
why we need them
 

5217
01:42:12,480 --> 01:42:14,030
why we need them
for anything other than art and

5218
01:42:14,030 --> 01:42:14,040
for anything other than art and
 

5219
01:42:14,040 --> 01:42:15,709
for anything other than art and
entertainment in the real world

5220
01:42:15,709 --> 01:42:15,719
entertainment in the real world
 

5221
01:42:15,719 --> 01:42:20,870
entertainment in the real world
like I get that there's some areas where

5222
01:42:20,870 --> 01:42:20,880
like I get that there's some areas where
 

5223
01:42:20,880 --> 01:42:24,590
like I get that there's some areas where
you can't just rebuild like a spaceship

5224
01:42:24,590 --> 01:42:24,600
you can't just rebuild like a spaceship
 

5225
01:42:24,600 --> 01:42:26,810
you can't just rebuild like a spaceship
you can't just like they've worked for

5226
01:42:26,810 --> 01:42:26,820
you can't just like they've worked for
 

5227
01:42:26,820 --> 01:42:28,250
you can't just like they've worked for
so many years on these spaceships you

5228
01:42:28,250 --> 01:42:28,260
so many years on these spaceships you
 

5229
01:42:28,260 --> 01:42:31,129
so many years on these spaceships you
can't just re-engineer it you have some

5230
01:42:31,129 --> 01:42:31,139
can't just re-engineer it you have some
 

5231
01:42:31,139 --> 01:42:32,390
can't just re-engineer it you have some
things that are just built for human

5232
01:42:32,390 --> 01:42:32,400
things that are just built for human
 

5233
01:42:32,400 --> 01:42:35,629
things that are just built for human
bodies a submarine a spatial but

5234
01:42:35,629 --> 01:42:35,639
bodies a submarine a spatial but
 

5235
01:42:35,639 --> 01:42:37,669
bodies a submarine a spatial but
a factory

5236
01:42:37,669 --> 01:42:37,679
a factory
 

5237
01:42:37,679 --> 01:42:39,890
a factory
maybe I'm naive but it seems like we've

5238
01:42:39,890 --> 01:42:39,900
maybe I'm naive but it seems like we've
 

5239
01:42:39,900 --> 01:42:41,750
maybe I'm naive but it seems like we've
already rebuilt factories to accommodate

5240
01:42:41,750 --> 01:42:41,760
already rebuilt factories to accommodate
 

5241
01:42:41,760 --> 01:42:44,689
already rebuilt factories to accommodate
other types of robots why would we want

5242
01:42:44,689 --> 01:42:44,699
other types of robots why would we want
 

5243
01:42:44,699 --> 01:42:46,850
other types of robots why would we want
to just like make a humanoid robot to go

5244
01:42:46,850 --> 01:42:46,860
to just like make a humanoid robot to go
 

5245
01:42:46,860 --> 01:42:48,290
to just like make a humanoid robot to go
in there I

5246
01:42:48,290 --> 01:42:48,300
in there I
 

5247
01:42:48,300 --> 01:42:51,109
in there I
I just get really tripped up on I think

5248
01:42:51,109 --> 01:42:51,119
I just get really tripped up on I think
 

5249
01:42:51,119 --> 01:42:53,810
I just get really tripped up on I think
that people want humanoids I think

5250
01:42:53,810 --> 01:42:53,820
that people want humanoids I think
 

5251
01:42:53,820 --> 01:42:56,390
that people want humanoids I think
people are fascinated by them

5252
01:42:56,390 --> 01:42:56,400
people are fascinated by them
 

5253
01:42:56,400 --> 01:42:59,870
people are fascinated by them
I think it's a little over hyped well

5254
01:42:59,870 --> 01:42:59,880
I think it's a little over hyped well
 

5255
01:42:59,880 --> 01:43:02,090
I think it's a little over hyped well
most of our world is still built for

5256
01:43:02,090 --> 01:43:02,100
most of our world is still built for
 

5257
01:43:02,100 --> 01:43:04,310
most of our world is still built for
humanoids I know but it shouldn't be it

5258
01:43:04,310 --> 01:43:04,320
humanoids I know but it shouldn't be it
 

5259
01:43:04,320 --> 01:43:06,169
humanoids I know but it shouldn't be it
should be built so that it's wheelchair

5260
01:43:06,169 --> 01:43:06,179
should be built so that it's wheelchair
 

5261
01:43:06,179 --> 01:43:08,870
should be built so that it's wheelchair
accessible right so the question is do

5262
01:43:08,870 --> 01:43:08,880
accessible right so the question is do
 

5263
01:43:08,880 --> 01:43:10,729
accessible right so the question is do
you build a world that's

5264
01:43:10,729 --> 01:43:10,739
you build a world that's
 

5265
01:43:10,739 --> 01:43:12,470
you build a world that's
the general form of wheelchair

5266
01:43:12,470 --> 01:43:12,480
the general form of wheelchair
 

5267
01:43:12,480 --> 01:43:14,390
the general form of wheelchair
accessible uh

5268
01:43:14,390 --> 01:43:14,400
accessible uh
 

5269
01:43:14,400 --> 01:43:15,470
accessible uh

all robot form factor accessible
or do you build Tomb Raider robots I

5274
01:43:22,310 --> 01:43:22,320
or do you build Tomb Raider robots I
 

5275
01:43:22,320 --> 01:43:24,229
or do you build Tomb Raider robots I
mean it doesn't have to be all and it

5276
01:43:24,229 --> 01:43:24,239
mean it doesn't have to be all and it
 

5277
01:43:24,239 --> 01:43:26,629
mean it doesn't have to be all and it
also doesn't have to

5278
01:43:26,629 --> 01:43:26,639
also doesn't have to
 

5279
01:43:26,639 --> 01:43:28,189
also doesn't have to
I feel like we're thinking so little

5280
01:43:28,189 --> 01:43:28,199
I feel like we're thinking so little
 

5281
01:43:28,199 --> 01:43:31,010
I feel like we're thinking so little
about this system in general and how to

5282
01:43:31,010 --> 01:43:31,020
about this system in general and how to
 

5283
01:43:31,020 --> 01:43:33,530
about this system in general and how to
create infrastructure that works for

5284
01:43:33,530 --> 01:43:33,540
create infrastructure that works for
 

5285
01:43:33,540 --> 01:43:35,990
create infrastructure that works for
everyone all kinds of people all kinds

5286
01:43:35,990 --> 01:43:36,000
everyone all kinds of people all kinds
 

5287
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,450
everyone all kinds of people all kinds
of robots like that's that I mean it's

5288
01:43:38,450 --> 01:43:38,460
of robots like that's that I mean it's
 

5289
01:43:38,460 --> 01:43:40,729
of robots like that's that I mean it's
more of an investment but that would pay

5290
01:43:40,729 --> 01:43:40,739
more of an investment but that would pay
 

5291
01:43:40,739 --> 01:43:43,070
more of an investment but that would pay
off way more in the future than just

5292
01:43:43,070 --> 01:43:43,080
off way more in the future than just
 

5293
01:43:43,080 --> 01:43:44,750
off way more in the future than just
trying to cram

5294
01:43:44,750 --> 01:43:44,760
trying to cram
 

5295
01:43:44,760 --> 01:43:46,669
trying to cram
expensive or maybe slightly less

5296
01:43:46,669 --> 01:43:46,679
expensive or maybe slightly less
 

5297
01:43:46,679 --> 01:43:49,189
expensive or maybe slightly less
expensive humanoid technology into a

5298
01:43:49,189 --> 01:43:49,199
expensive humanoid technology into a
 

5299
01:43:49,199 --> 01:43:51,109
expensive humanoid technology into a
human space unfortunately one company

5300
01:43:51,109 --> 01:43:51,119
human space unfortunately one company
 

5301
01:43:51,119 --> 01:43:52,669
human space unfortunately one company
can't do that we have to work together

5302
01:43:52,669 --> 01:43:52,679
can't do that we have to work together
 

5303
01:43:52,679 --> 01:43:54,830
can't do that we have to work together
it's like autonomous driving can be

5304
01:43:54,830 --> 01:43:54,840
it's like autonomous driving can be
 

5305
01:43:54,840 --> 01:43:58,189
it's like autonomous driving can be
easily solved if you do v2i if you

5306
01:43:58,189 --> 01:43:58,199
easily solved if you do v2i if you
 

5307
01:43:58,199 --> 01:44:00,229
easily solved if you do v2i if you
change the infrastructure of cities and

5308
01:44:00,229 --> 01:44:00,239
change the infrastructure of cities and
 

5309
01:44:00,239 --> 01:44:03,709
change the infrastructure of cities and
so on but that requires a lot of

5310
01:44:03,709 --> 01:44:03,719
so on but that requires a lot of
 

5311
01:44:03,719 --> 01:44:06,350
so on but that requires a lot of
people a lot of them are politicians and

5312
01:44:06,350 --> 01:44:06,360
people a lot of them are politicians and
 

5313
01:44:06,360 --> 01:44:08,629
people a lot of them are politicians and
a lot of them are somewhat if not a lot

5314
01:44:08,629 --> 01:44:08,639
a lot of them are somewhat if not a lot
 

5315
01:44:08,639 --> 01:44:11,270
a lot of them are somewhat if not a lot
corrupt and all those kinds of things

5316
01:44:11,270 --> 01:44:11,280
corrupt and all those kinds of things
 

5317
01:44:11,280 --> 01:44:14,270
corrupt and all those kinds of things
I and the talent thing you mentioned is

5318
01:44:14,270 --> 01:44:14,280
I and the talent thing you mentioned is
 

5319
01:44:14,280 --> 01:44:16,970
I and the talent thing you mentioned is
really really really important

5320
01:44:16,970 --> 01:44:16,980
really really really important
 

5321
01:44:16,980 --> 01:44:18,709
really really really important
I've gotten a chance to meet a lot of

5322
01:44:18,709 --> 01:44:18,719
I've gotten a chance to meet a lot of
 

5323
01:44:18,719 --> 01:44:21,770
I've gotten a chance to meet a lot of
folks at SpaceX and Tesla other

5324
01:44:21,770 --> 01:44:21,780
folks at SpaceX and Tesla other
 

5325
01:44:21,780 --> 01:44:23,570
folks at SpaceX and Tesla other
companies too but they're specifically

5326
01:44:23,570 --> 01:44:23,580
companies too but they're specifically
 

5327
01:44:23,580 --> 01:44:25,790
companies too but they're specifically
the openness makes it easier to like

5328
01:44:25,790 --> 01:44:25,800
the openness makes it easier to like
 

5329
01:44:25,800 --> 01:44:28,430
the openness makes it easier to like
meet everybody

5331
01:44:28,440 --> 01:44:31,129

I think a lot of amazing things in this

5332
01:44:31,129 --> 01:44:31,139
I think a lot of amazing things in this
 

5333
01:44:31,139 --> 01:44:33,290
I think a lot of amazing things in this
world happen when you get amazing people

5334
01:44:33,290 --> 01:44:33,300
world happen when you get amazing people
 

5335
01:44:33,300 --> 01:44:35,689
world happen when you get amazing people
together oh yeah and if you can sell an

5336
01:44:35,689 --> 01:44:35,699
together oh yeah and if you can sell an
 

5337
01:44:35,699 --> 01:44:38,030
together oh yeah and if you can sell an
idea like us becoming a multi-planetary

5338
01:44:38,030 --> 01:44:38,040
idea like us becoming a multi-planetary
 

5339
01:44:38,040 --> 01:44:39,290
idea like us becoming a multi-planetary
species

5340
01:44:39,290 --> 01:44:39,300
species
 

5341
01:44:39,300 --> 01:44:41,990
species
you can say why the hell are we going to

5342
01:44:41,990 --> 01:44:42,000
you can say why the hell are we going to
 

5343
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:43,129
you can say why the hell are we going to
Mars

5344
01:44:43,129 --> 01:44:43,139
Mars
 

5345
01:44:43,139 --> 01:44:45,350
Mars
like why colonize Mars

5346
01:44:45,350 --> 01:44:45,360
like why colonize Mars
 

5347
01:44:45,360 --> 01:44:48,950
like why colonize Mars
if you think from from basic

5348
01:44:48,950 --> 01:44:48,960
if you think from from basic
 

5349
01:44:48,960 --> 01:44:50,689
if you think from from basic
first principles it doesn't make any

5350
01:44:50,689 --> 01:44:50,699
first principles it doesn't make any
 

5351
01:44:50,699 --> 01:44:51,830
first principles it doesn't make any
sense

5352
01:44:51,830 --> 01:44:51,840
sense
 

5353
01:44:51,840 --> 01:44:54,770
sense
it doesn't make any sense to to go to

5354
01:44:54,770 --> 01:44:54,780
it doesn't make any sense to to go to
 

5355
01:44:54,780 --> 01:44:55,970
it doesn't make any sense to to go to
the Moon

5356
01:44:55,970 --> 01:44:55,980
the Moon
 

5357
01:44:55,980 --> 01:44:58,010
the Moon
it doesn't go it the only thing that

5358
01:44:58,010 --> 01:44:58,020
it doesn't go it the only thing that
 

5359
01:44:58,020 --> 01:44:59,810
it doesn't go it the only thing that
makes sense to go to spaces for

5360
01:44:59,810 --> 01:44:59,820
makes sense to go to spaces for
 

5361
01:44:59,820 --> 01:45:02,090
makes sense to go to spaces for
satellites

5362
01:45:02,090 --> 01:45:02,100
satellites
 

5363
01:45:02,100 --> 01:45:05,450
satellites
but there's something about the vision

5364
01:45:05,450 --> 01:45:05,460
but there's something about the vision
 

5365
01:45:05,460 --> 01:45:08,870
but there's something about the vision
of the future the optimism Laden that

5366
01:45:08,870 --> 01:45:08,880
of the future the optimism Laden that
 

5367
01:45:08,880 --> 01:45:10,790
of the future the optimism Laden that
permeates this vision of us becoming

5368
01:45:10,790 --> 01:45:10,800
permeates this vision of us becoming

multi-planetary is thinking not just for

5370
01:45:13,370 --> 01:45:13,380
multi-planetary is thinking not just for
 

5371
01:45:13,380 --> 01:45:15,410
multi-planetary is thinking not just for
the next 10 years it's thinking

5372
01:45:15,410 --> 01:45:15,420
the next 10 years it's thinking
 

5373
01:45:15,420 --> 01:45:18,350
the next 10 years it's thinking
like human civilization reaching out

5374
01:45:18,350 --> 01:45:18,360
like human civilization reaching out
 

5375
01:45:18,360 --> 01:45:21,169
like human civilization reaching out
into the Stars it it makes people dream

5376
01:45:21,169 --> 01:45:21,179
into the Stars it it makes people dream
 

5377
01:45:21,179 --> 01:45:22,910
into the Stars it it makes people dream
it's really exciting

5378
01:45:22,910 --> 01:45:22,920
it's really exciting
 

5379
01:45:22,920 --> 01:45:25,370
it's really exciting
and that they're gonna come up with some

5380
01:45:25,370 --> 01:45:25,380
and that they're gonna come up with some
 

5381
01:45:25,380 --> 01:45:26,990
and that they're gonna come up with some
cool [\h__\h] that might not have anything

5382
01:45:26,990 --> 01:45:27,000
cool [\h__\h] that might not have anything
 

5383
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:28,129
cool [\h__\h] that might not have anything
to do

5384
01:45:28,129 --> 01:45:28,139
to do
 

5385
01:45:28,139 --> 01:45:32,030
to do
with uh like here's what I because Elon

5386
01:45:32,030 --> 01:45:32,040
with uh like here's what I because Elon
 

5387
01:45:32,040 --> 01:45:33,169
with uh like here's what I because Elon
doesn't seem to care about social

5388
01:45:33,169 --> 01:45:33,179
doesn't seem to care about social
 

5389
01:45:33,179 --> 01:45:35,689
doesn't seem to care about social
robotics which is constantly surprising

5390
01:45:35,689 --> 01:45:35,699
robotics which is constantly surprising
 

5391
01:45:35,699 --> 01:45:37,310
robotics which is constantly surprising
to me and to talk to him it doesn't

5392
01:45:37,310 --> 01:45:37,320
to me and to talk to him it doesn't
 

5393
01:45:37,320 --> 01:45:39,109
to me and to talk to him it doesn't
humans are

5394
01:45:39,109 --> 01:45:39,119
humans are
 

5395
01:45:39,119 --> 01:45:41,209
humans are
humans are the things you avoid and

5396
01:45:41,209 --> 01:45:41,219
humans are the things you avoid and
 

5397
01:45:41,219 --> 01:45:44,750
humans are the things you avoid and
don't hurt right like that's like the

5398
01:45:44,750 --> 01:45:44,760
don't hurt right like that's like the
 

5399
01:45:44,760 --> 01:45:46,550
don't hurt right like that's like the
number one job of a robot is not to hurt

5400
01:45:46,550 --> 01:45:46,560
number one job of a robot is not to hurt
 

5401
01:45:46,560 --> 01:45:49,850
number one job of a robot is not to hurt
a human to avoid them you know that the

5402
01:45:49,850 --> 01:45:49,860
a human to avoid them you know that the
 

5403
01:45:49,860 --> 01:45:52,129
a human to avoid them you know that the
the collaborative aspect the human robot

5404
01:45:52,129 --> 01:45:52,139
the collaborative aspect the human robot
 

5405
01:45:52,139 --> 01:45:54,109
the collaborative aspect the human robot
interaction I think is not at least not

5406
01:45:54,109 --> 01:45:54,119
interaction I think is not at least not
 

5407
01:45:54,119 --> 01:45:56,149
interaction I think is not at least not
in his uh um

5408
01:45:56,149 --> 01:45:56,159
in his uh um
 

5409
01:45:56,159 --> 01:45:57,950
in his uh um
and that's something he thinks about

5410
01:45:57,950 --> 01:45:57,960
and that's something he thinks about
 

5411
01:45:57,960 --> 01:45:59,209
and that's something he thinks about
deeply

5412
01:45:59,209 --> 01:45:59,219
deeply
 

5413
01:45:59,219 --> 01:46:01,729
deeply
but my sense is if somebody like that

5414
01:46:01,729 --> 01:46:01,739
but my sense is if somebody like that
 

5415
01:46:01,739 --> 01:46:03,530
but my sense is if somebody like that
takes on the problem

5416
01:46:03,530 --> 01:46:03,540
takes on the problem
 

5417
01:46:03,540 --> 01:46:06,649
takes on the problem
of human robotics we're going to get a

5418
01:46:06,649 --> 01:46:06,659
of human robotics we're going to get a
 

5419
01:46:06,659 --> 01:46:08,270
of human robotics we're going to get a
social robot out of it

5420
01:46:08,270 --> 01:46:08,280
social robot out of it
 

5421
01:46:08,280 --> 01:46:10,970
social robot out of it
like people like not necessarily Elon

5422
01:46:10,970 --> 01:46:10,980
like people like not necessarily Elon
 

5423
01:46:10,980 --> 01:46:13,070
like people like not necessarily Elon
but people like like Elon if they take

5424
01:46:13,070 --> 01:46:13,080
but people like like Elon if they take
 

5425
01:46:13,080 --> 01:46:15,410
but people like like Elon if they take
on seriously these

5426
01:46:15,410 --> 01:46:15,420
on seriously these
 

5427
01:46:15,420 --> 01:46:17,689
on seriously these
um

5428
01:46:17,689 --> 01:46:17,699

 

5429
01:46:17,699 --> 01:46:20,629

like I could just imagine with the with

5430
01:46:20,629 --> 01:46:20,639
like I could just imagine with the with
 

5431
01:46:20,639 --> 01:46:23,209
like I could just imagine with the with
the humanoid robot you can't help but

5432
01:46:23,209 --> 01:46:23,219
the humanoid robot you can't help but
 

5433
01:46:23,219 --> 01:46:24,950
the humanoid robot you can't help but
create a social robot

5434
01:46:24,950 --> 01:46:24,960
create a social robot
 

5435
01:46:24,960 --> 01:46:27,050
create a social robot
so if you do different form factors if

5436
01:46:27,050 --> 01:46:27,060
so if you do different form factors if
 

5437
01:46:27,060 --> 01:46:30,770
so if you do different form factors if
you do industrial uh robotics

5438
01:46:30,770 --> 01:46:30,780
you do industrial uh robotics
 

5439
01:46:30,780 --> 01:46:32,689
you do industrial uh robotics
um you don't you're likely to actually

5440
01:46:32,689 --> 01:46:32,699
um you don't you're likely to actually
 

5441
01:46:32,699 --> 01:46:36,709
um you don't you're likely to actually
not end up in like walking head into a

5442
01:46:36,709 --> 01:46:36,719
not end up in like walking head into a
 

5443
01:46:36,719 --> 01:46:39,470
not end up in like walking head into a
social a social robot human robot

5444
01:46:39,470 --> 01:46:39,480
social a social robot human robot
 

5445
01:46:39,480 --> 01:46:41,270
social a social robot human robot
interaction problem if you create for

5446
01:46:41,270 --> 01:46:41,280
interaction problem if you create for
 

5447
01:46:41,280 --> 01:46:43,250
interaction problem if you create for
whatever the hell reason you want to a

5448
01:46:43,250 --> 01:46:43,260
whatever the hell reason you want to a
 

5449
01:46:43,260 --> 01:46:44,950
whatever the hell reason you want to a
humanoid robot you're gonna have to

5450
01:46:44,950 --> 01:46:44,960
humanoid robot you're gonna have to
 

5451
01:46:44,960 --> 01:46:48,950
humanoid robot you're gonna have to
reinvent or not reinvent but do

5452
01:46:48,950 --> 01:46:48,960
reinvent or not reinvent but do
 

5453
01:46:48,960 --> 01:46:50,930
reinvent or not reinvent but do
um introduce a lot of fascinating new

5454
01:46:50,930 --> 01:46:50,940
um introduce a lot of fascinating new
 

5455
01:46:50,940 --> 01:46:52,790
um introduce a lot of fascinating new
ideas into the problem of human robot

5456
01:46:52,790 --> 01:46:52,800
ideas into the problem of human robot
 

5457
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:54,890
ideas into the problem of human robot
interaction which I'm excited about so

5458
01:46:54,890 --> 01:46:54,900
interaction which I'm excited about so
 

5459
01:46:54,900 --> 01:46:57,410
interaction which I'm excited about so
like if I if I was a business person I

5460
01:46:57,410 --> 01:46:57,420
like if I if I was a business person I
 

5461
01:46:57,420 --> 01:46:59,510
like if I if I was a business person I
would say this is not this is this is

5462
01:46:59,510 --> 01:46:59,520
would say this is not this is this is
 

5463
01:46:59,520 --> 01:47:01,729
would say this is not this is this is
way too risky this doesn't make any

5464
01:47:01,729 --> 01:47:01,739
way too risky this doesn't make any
 

5465
01:47:01,739 --> 01:47:03,530
way too risky this doesn't make any
sense but when people are really

5466
01:47:03,530 --> 01:47:03,540
sense but when people are really
 

5467
01:47:03,540 --> 01:47:05,510
sense but when people are really
convinced and there's a lot of amazing

5468
01:47:05,510 --> 01:47:05,520
convinced and there's a lot of amazing
 

5469
01:47:05,520 --> 01:47:07,370
convinced and there's a lot of amazing
people working on it it's like all right

5470
01:47:07,370 --> 01:47:07,380
people working on it it's like all right
 

5471
01:47:07,380 --> 01:47:08,930
people working on it it's like all right
let's see what happens here this is

5472
01:47:08,930 --> 01:47:08,940
let's see what happens here this is
 

5473
01:47:08,940 --> 01:47:11,149
let's see what happens here this is
really interesting just like with Atlas

5474
01:47:11,149 --> 01:47:11,159
really interesting just like with Atlas
 

5475
01:47:11,159 --> 01:47:14,689
really interesting just like with Atlas
and Boston Dynamics I mean they

5476
01:47:14,689 --> 01:47:14,699
and Boston Dynamics I mean they
 

5477
01:47:14,699 --> 01:47:18,050
and Boston Dynamics I mean they
I I um I apologize if I'm ignorant on

5478
01:47:18,050 --> 01:47:18,060
I I um I apologize if I'm ignorant on
 

5479
01:47:18,060 --> 01:47:21,649
I I um I apologize if I'm ignorant on
this but I think they really more than

5480
01:47:21,649 --> 01:47:21,659
this but I think they really more than
 

5481
01:47:21,659 --> 01:47:24,229
this but I think they really more than
anyone else maybe with iboat like Sony

5482
01:47:24,229 --> 01:47:24,239
anyone else maybe with iboat like Sony
 

5483
01:47:24,239 --> 01:47:27,770
anyone else maybe with iboat like Sony
pushed forward humanoid robotics

5484
01:47:27,770 --> 01:47:27,780
pushed forward humanoid robotics
 

5485
01:47:27,780 --> 01:47:29,629
pushed forward humanoid robotics
like a leap

5486
01:47:29,629 --> 01:47:29,639
like a leap
 

5487
01:47:29,639 --> 01:47:32,750
like a leap
with the oh yeah absolutely

5488
01:47:32,750 --> 01:47:32,760
with the oh yeah absolutely
 

5489
01:47:32,760 --> 01:47:34,729
with the oh yeah absolutely
and like without them like where the

5490
01:47:34,729 --> 01:47:34,739
and like without them like where the
 

5491
01:47:34,739 --> 01:47:37,070
and like without them like where the
hell did they do it why well I think for

5492
01:47:37,070 --> 01:47:37,080
hell did they do it why well I think for
 

5493
01:47:37,080 --> 01:47:39,050
hell did they do it why well I think for
them it is a research platform it's not

5494
01:47:39,050 --> 01:47:39,060
them it is a research platform it's not
 

5495
01:47:39,060 --> 01:47:41,270
them it is a research platform it's not
I don't think they ever

5496
01:47:41,270 --> 01:47:41,280
I don't think they ever
 

5497
01:47:41,280 --> 01:47:43,609
I don't think they ever
the speculation I don't think they ever

5498
01:47:43,609 --> 01:47:43,619
the speculation I don't think they ever
 

5499
01:47:43,619 --> 01:47:47,090
the speculation I don't think they ever
intended Atlas to be like a commercially

5500
01:47:47,090 --> 01:47:47,100
intended Atlas to be like a commercially
 

5501
01:47:47,100 --> 01:47:49,609
intended Atlas to be like a commercially
successful robot I think they were just

5502
01:47:49,609 --> 01:47:49,619
successful robot I think they were just
 

5503
01:47:49,619 --> 01:47:52,790
successful robot I think they were just
like can we do this let's try

5504
01:47:52,790 --> 01:47:52,800
like can we do this let's try
 

5505
01:47:52,800 --> 01:47:55,430
like can we do this let's try
yeah I wonder if they maybe the answer

5506
01:47:55,430 --> 01:47:55,440
yeah I wonder if they maybe the answer
 

5507
01:47:55,440 --> 01:47:58,250
yeah I wonder if they maybe the answer
they landed on is

5508
01:47:58,250 --> 01:47:58,260
they landed on is
 

5509
01:47:58,260 --> 01:48:00,290
they landed on is
because they eventually went to

5510
01:48:00,290 --> 01:48:00,300
because they eventually went to
 

5511
01:48:00,300 --> 01:48:02,930
because they eventually went to
um spot the earlier versions of the spot

5512
01:48:02,930 --> 01:48:02,940
um spot the earlier versions of the spot
 

5513
01:48:02,940 --> 01:48:06,410
um spot the earlier versions of the spot
so uh quadruped like four four-legged

5514
01:48:06,410 --> 01:48:06,420
so uh quadruped like four four-legged
 

5515
01:48:06,420 --> 01:48:10,010
so uh quadruped like four four-legged
robot but maybe they reached for

5516
01:48:10,010 --> 01:48:10,020
robot but maybe they reached for
 

5517
01:48:10,020 --> 01:48:12,770
robot but maybe they reached for
let's try to make

5518
01:48:12,770 --> 01:48:12,780
let's try to make
 

5519
01:48:12,780 --> 01:48:15,590
let's try to make
um like I think they tried it and they

5520
01:48:15,590 --> 01:48:15,600
um like I think they tried it and they
 

5521
01:48:15,600 --> 01:48:18,649
um like I think they tried it and they
still are trying it for Atlas to be

5522
01:48:18,649 --> 01:48:18,659
still are trying it for Atlas to be
 

5523
01:48:18,659 --> 01:48:21,109
still are trying it for Atlas to be
picking up boxes to moving boxes to

5524
01:48:21,109 --> 01:48:21,119
picking up boxes to moving boxes to
 

5525
01:48:21,119 --> 01:48:24,109
picking up boxes to moving boxes to
being it it makes sense

5526
01:48:24,109 --> 01:48:24,119
being it it makes sense
 

5527
01:48:24,119 --> 01:48:28,250
being it it makes sense
okay if they were exactly the same cost

5528
01:48:28,250 --> 01:48:28,260
okay if they were exactly the same cost
 

5529
01:48:28,260 --> 01:48:30,830
okay if they were exactly the same cost
it makes sense to have a human robot in

5530
01:48:30,830 --> 01:48:30,840
it makes sense to have a human robot in
 

5531
01:48:30,840 --> 01:48:32,030
it makes sense to have a human robot in
the warehouse

5532
01:48:32,030 --> 01:48:32,040
the warehouse
 

5533
01:48:32,040 --> 01:48:33,709
the warehouse
currently currently I think it's

5534
01:48:33,709 --> 01:48:33,719
currently currently I think it's
 

5535
01:48:33,719 --> 01:48:35,750
currently currently I think it's
short-sighted but yes currently yes it

5536
01:48:35,750 --> 01:48:35,760
short-sighted but yes currently yes it
 

5537
01:48:35,760 --> 01:48:36,950
short-sighted but yes currently yes it
would sell

5538
01:48:36,950 --> 01:48:36,960
would sell
 

5539
01:48:36,960 --> 01:48:41,030
would sell
but it's not it's it's short-sighted

5540
01:48:41,030 --> 01:48:41,040
but it's not it's it's short-sighted
 

5541
01:48:41,040 --> 01:48:44,209
but it's not it's it's short-sighted
it's short-sighted but it it's it's not

5542
01:48:44,209 --> 01:48:44,219
it's short-sighted but it it's it's not
 

5543
01:48:44,219 --> 01:48:46,189
it's short-sighted but it it's it's not
pragmatic to think any other way to

5544
01:48:46,189 --> 01:48:46,199
pragmatic to think any other way to
 

5545
01:48:46,199 --> 01:48:47,209
pragmatic to think any other way to
think that you're going to be able to

5546
01:48:47,209 --> 01:48:47,219
think that you're going to be able to
 

5547
01:48:47,219 --> 01:48:48,850
think that you're going to be able to
change warehouses you're gonna have to

5548
01:48:48,850 --> 01:48:48,860
change warehouses you're gonna have to
 

5549
01:48:48,860 --> 01:48:51,109
change warehouses you're gonna have to
you're going You're Amazon you can

5550
01:48:51,109 --> 01:48:51,119
you're going You're Amazon you can
 

5551
01:48:51,119 --> 01:48:53,629
you're going You're Amazon you can
totally change your warehouses but yes

5552
01:48:53,629 --> 01:48:53,639
totally change your warehouses but yes
 

5553
01:48:53,639 --> 01:48:56,510
totally change your warehouses but yes
yes but even if you're Amazon

5554
01:48:56,510 --> 01:48:56,520
yes but even if you're Amazon
 

5555
01:48:56,520 --> 01:48:59,570
yes but even if you're Amazon
that's very costly to

5556
01:48:59,570 --> 01:48:59,580
that's very costly to
 

5557
01:48:59,580 --> 01:49:02,510
that's very costly to
change warehouses it is it's a big

5558
01:49:02,510 --> 01:49:02,520
change warehouses it is it's a big
 

5559
01:49:02,520 --> 01:49:03,649
change warehouses it is it's a big
investment

5560
01:49:03,649 --> 01:49:03,659
investment
 

5561
01:49:03,659 --> 01:49:05,450
investment
but isn't shouldn't you do that

5562
01:49:05,450 --> 01:49:05,460
but isn't shouldn't you do that
 

5563
01:49:05,460 --> 01:49:07,430
but isn't shouldn't you do that
investment

5564
01:49:07,430 --> 01:49:07,440
investment
 

5565
01:49:07,440 --> 01:49:09,830
investment
in a way so here's the thing if you

5566
01:49:09,830 --> 01:49:09,840
in a way so here's the thing if you
 

5567
01:49:09,840 --> 01:49:11,450
in a way so here's the thing if you
build the Humana robot that works in the

5568
01:49:11,450 --> 01:49:11,460
build the Humana robot that works in the
 

5569
01:49:11,460 --> 01:49:14,870
build the Humana robot that works in the
warehouse that human robot and I see I

5570
01:49:14,870 --> 01:49:14,880
warehouse that human robot and I see I
 

5571
01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:16,129
warehouse that human robot and I see I
don't know why Tesla's not talking about

5572
01:49:16,129 --> 01:49:16,139
don't know why Tesla's not talking about
 

5573
01:49:16,139 --> 01:49:17,570
don't know why Tesla's not talking about
it this way

5574
01:49:17,570 --> 01:49:17,580
it this way
 

5575
01:49:17,580 --> 01:49:19,729
it this way
as far as I know but like that human

5576
01:49:19,729 --> 01:49:19,739
as far as I know but like that human
 

5577
01:49:19,739 --> 01:49:21,350
as far as I know but like that human
robot is going to have all kinds of

5578
01:49:21,350 --> 01:49:21,360
robot is going to have all kinds of
 

5579
01:49:21,360 --> 01:49:24,770
robot is going to have all kinds of
other applications outside their setting

5580
01:49:24,770 --> 01:49:24,780
other applications outside their setting
 

5581
01:49:24,780 --> 01:49:28,310
other applications outside their setting
like to me it's obvious I think it's a

5582
01:49:28,310 --> 01:49:28,320
like to me it's obvious I think it's a
 

5583
01:49:28,320 --> 01:49:29,990
like to me it's obvious I think it's a
really hard problem to solve but whoever

5584
01:49:29,990 --> 01:49:30,000
really hard problem to solve but whoever
 

5585
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,450
really hard problem to solve but whoever
solves the human robot problem are gonna

5586
01:49:32,450 --> 01:49:32,460
solves the human robot problem are gonna
 

5587
01:49:32,460 --> 01:49:33,830
solves the human robot problem are gonna
have to solve the social robotics

5588
01:49:33,830 --> 01:49:33,840
have to solve the social robotics
 

5589
01:49:33,840 --> 01:49:35,330
have to solve the social robotics
problem oh for sure I mean they're

5590
01:49:35,330 --> 01:49:35,340
problem oh for sure I mean they're
 

5591
01:49:35,340 --> 01:49:37,790
problem oh for sure I mean they're
already with the spot needing to spell

5592
01:49:37,790 --> 01:49:37,800
already with the spot needing to spell
 

5593
01:49:37,800 --> 01:49:40,609
already with the spot needing to spell
social robotics problems for uh like for

5594
01:49:40,609 --> 01:49:40,619
social robotics problems for uh like for
 

5595
01:49:40,619 --> 01:49:42,530
social robotics problems for uh like for
spot to be effective at scale I'm not

5596
01:49:42,530 --> 01:49:42,540
spot to be effective at scale I'm not
 

5597
01:49:42,540 --> 01:49:43,910
spot to be effective at scale I'm not
sure which spot is currently effective

5598
01:49:43,910 --> 01:49:43,920
sure which spot is currently effective
 

5599
01:49:43,920 --> 01:49:45,709
sure which spot is currently effective
skills getting better and better but

5600
01:49:45,709 --> 01:49:45,719
skills getting better and better but
 

5601
01:49:45,719 --> 01:49:48,649
skills getting better and better but
they're actually the thing they they did

5602
01:49:48,649 --> 01:49:48,659
they're actually the thing they they did
 

5603
01:49:48,659 --> 01:49:50,990
they're actually the thing they they did
it's an interesting decision perhaps

5604
01:49:50,990 --> 01:49:51,000
it's an interesting decision perhaps
 

5605
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:52,669
it's an interesting decision perhaps
thus will end up doing the same thing

5606
01:49:52,669 --> 01:49:52,679
thus will end up doing the same thing
 

5607
01:49:52,679 --> 01:49:56,689
thus will end up doing the same thing
which is spot is supposed to be a

5608
01:49:56,689 --> 01:49:56,699
which is spot is supposed to be a
 

5609
01:49:56,699 --> 01:49:59,270
which is spot is supposed to be a
platform for intelligence

5610
01:49:59,270 --> 01:49:59,280
platform for intelligence
 

5611
01:49:59,280 --> 01:50:02,330
platform for intelligence
so spot doesn't have any high level

5612
01:50:02,330 --> 01:50:02,340
so spot doesn't have any high level
 

5613
01:50:02,340 --> 01:50:05,810
so spot doesn't have any high level
intelligence like a high level

5614
01:50:05,810 --> 01:50:05,820
intelligence like a high level
 

5615
01:50:05,820 --> 01:50:07,990
intelligence like a high level
perception skills it's supposed to be

5616
01:50:07,990 --> 01:50:08,000
perception skills it's supposed to be
 

5617
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:11,149
perception skills it's supposed to be
controlled remotely and it's a platform

5618
01:50:11,149 --> 01:50:11,159
controlled remotely and it's a platform
 

5619
01:50:11,159 --> 01:50:12,890
controlled remotely and it's a platform
that you can attach attached off to

5620
01:50:12,890 --> 01:50:12,900
that you can attach attached off to
 

5621
01:50:12,900 --> 01:50:14,570
that you can attach attached off to
something yeah and somebody else is

5622
01:50:14,570 --> 01:50:14,580
something yeah and somebody else is
 

5623
01:50:14,580 --> 01:50:16,370
something yeah and somebody else is
supposed to do the attaching it's a

5624
01:50:16,370 --> 01:50:16,380
supposed to do the attaching it's a
 

5625
01:50:16,380 --> 01:50:18,590
supposed to do the attaching it's a
platform that you can take in uneven

5626
01:50:18,590 --> 01:50:18,600
platform that you can take in uneven
 

5627
01:50:18,600 --> 01:50:21,350
platform that you can take in uneven
ground and it's able to maintain balance

5628
01:50:21,350 --> 01:50:21,360
ground and it's able to maintain balance
 

5629
01:50:21,360 --> 01:50:23,330
ground and it's able to maintain balance
go into dangerous situations it's a

5630
01:50:23,330 --> 01:50:23,340
go into dangerous situations it's a
 

5631
01:50:23,340 --> 01:50:25,669
go into dangerous situations it's a
platform on top of that you can add a

5632
01:50:25,669 --> 01:50:25,679
platform on top of that you can add a
 

5633
01:50:25,679 --> 01:50:28,010
platform on top of that you can add a
camera that does surveillance that you

5634
01:50:28,010 --> 01:50:28,020
camera that does surveillance that you
 

5635
01:50:28,020 --> 01:50:30,890
camera that does surveillance that you
can remotely monitor you can record uh

5636
01:50:30,890 --> 01:50:30,900
can remotely monitor you can record uh
 

5637
01:50:30,900 --> 01:50:33,590
can remotely monitor you can record uh
you can record the camera you can remote

5638
01:50:33,590 --> 01:50:33,600
you can record the camera you can remote
 

5639
01:50:33,600 --> 01:50:35,209
you can record the camera you can remote
control it but it's not good

5640
01:50:35,209 --> 01:50:35,219
control it but it's not good
 

5641
01:50:35,219 --> 01:50:37,310
control it but it's not good
manipulation basic object manipulation

5642
01:50:37,310 --> 01:50:37,320
manipulation basic object manipulation
 

5643
01:50:37,320 --> 01:50:39,649
manipulation basic object manipulation
but not autonomous object communication

5644
01:50:39,649 --> 01:50:39,659
but not autonomous object communication
 

5645
01:50:39,659 --> 01:50:42,890
but not autonomous object communication
it's remotely controlled but the

5646
01:50:42,890 --> 01:50:42,900
it's remotely controlled but the
 

5647
01:50:42,900 --> 01:50:44,810
it's remotely controlled but the
Intelligence on top of it which was what

5648
01:50:44,810 --> 01:50:44,820
Intelligence on top of it which was what
 

5649
01:50:44,820 --> 01:50:47,090
Intelligence on top of it which was what
would be required for automation is

5650
01:50:47,090 --> 01:50:47,100
would be required for automation is
 

5651
01:50:47,100 --> 01:50:48,530
would be required for automation is
somebody else is supposed to do yeah

5652
01:50:48,530 --> 01:50:48,540
somebody else is supposed to do yeah
 

5653
01:50:48,540 --> 01:50:50,870
somebody else is supposed to do yeah
perhaps thus would do the same the same

5654
01:50:50,870 --> 01:50:50,880
perhaps thus would do the same the same
 

5655
01:50:50,880 --> 01:50:52,790
perhaps thus would do the same the same
thing ultimately but it doesn't make

5656
01:50:52,790 --> 01:50:52,800
thing ultimately but it doesn't make
 

5657
01:50:52,800 --> 01:50:56,090
thing ultimately but it doesn't make
sense because the goal of Optimus is

5658
01:50:56,090 --> 01:50:56,100
sense because the goal of Optimus is
 

5659
01:50:56,100 --> 01:50:57,970
sense because the goal of Optimus is
automation

5660
01:50:57,970 --> 01:50:57,980
automation
 

5661
01:50:57,980 --> 01:51:01,490
automation
without that

5662
01:51:01,490 --> 01:51:01,500

 

5663
01:51:01,500 --> 01:51:02,050

um

5664
01:51:02,050 --> 01:51:02,060
um
 

5665
01:51:02,060 --> 01:51:04,970
um
but then you never know he's like why go

5666
01:51:04,970 --> 01:51:04,980
but then you never know he's like why go
 

5667
01:51:04,980 --> 01:51:07,189
but then you never know he's like why go
to Mars why why

5668
01:51:07,189 --> 01:51:07,199
to Mars why why
 

5669
01:51:07,199 --> 01:51:09,169
to Mars why why
um I mean that's true and I I

5670
01:51:09,169 --> 01:51:09,179
um I mean that's true and I I
 

5671
01:51:09,179 --> 01:51:11,209
um I mean that's true and I I
reluctantly like am very excited about

5672
01:51:11,209 --> 01:51:11,219
reluctantly like am very excited about
 

5673
01:51:11,219 --> 01:51:12,830
reluctantly like am very excited about
space travel

5674
01:51:12,830 --> 01:51:12,840
space travel
 

5675
01:51:12,840 --> 01:51:13,750
space travel
um

5676
01:51:13,750 --> 01:51:13,760
um
 

5677
01:51:13,760 --> 01:51:17,030
um
can you introspect like why why am I

5678
01:51:17,030 --> 01:51:17,040
can you introspect like why why am I
 

5679
01:51:17,040 --> 01:51:18,410
can you introspect like why why am I
excited about it

5680
01:51:18,410 --> 01:51:18,420
excited about it
 

5681
01:51:18,420 --> 01:51:20,750
excited about it
I think what got me excited was

5682
01:51:20,750 --> 01:51:20,760
I think what got me excited was
 

5683
01:51:20,760 --> 01:51:25,250
I think what got me excited was
I saw a panel with some people who um

5684
01:51:25,250 --> 01:51:25,260
I saw a panel with some people who um
 

5685
01:51:25,260 --> 01:51:28,010
I saw a panel with some people who um
study other planets and it became really

5686
01:51:28,010 --> 01:51:28,020
study other planets and it became really
 

5687
01:51:28,020 --> 01:51:32,390
study other planets and it became really
clear how little we know about ourselves

5688
01:51:32,390 --> 01:51:32,400
clear how little we know about ourselves
 

5689
01:51:32,400 --> 01:51:34,850
clear how little we know about ourselves
and about how nature works and just how

5690
01:51:34,850 --> 01:51:34,860
and about how nature works and just how
 

5691
01:51:34,860 --> 01:51:37,430
and about how nature works and just how
much there is to learn from exploring

5692
01:51:37,430 --> 01:51:37,440
much there is to learn from exploring
 

5693
01:51:37,440 --> 01:51:40,790
much there is to learn from exploring
other parts of the universe

5694
01:51:40,790 --> 01:51:40,800
other parts of the universe
 

5695
01:51:40,800 --> 01:51:44,030
other parts of the universe
so like on a rational level that's how I

5696
01:51:44,030 --> 01:51:44,040
so like on a rational level that's how I
 

5697
01:51:44,040 --> 01:51:45,830
so like on a rational level that's how I
convince myself that that's why I'm

5698
01:51:45,830 --> 01:51:45,840
convince myself that that's why I'm
 

5699
01:51:45,840 --> 01:51:49,010
convince myself that that's why I'm
excited in reality it's just [\h__\h]

5700
01:51:49,010 --> 01:51:49,020
excited in reality it's just [\h__\h]
 

5701
01:51:49,020 --> 01:51:51,530
excited in reality it's just [\h__\h]
exciting I mean just like the idea that

5702
01:51:51,530 --> 01:51:51,540
exciting I mean just like the idea that
 

5703
01:51:51,540 --> 01:51:54,109
exciting I mean just like the idea that
we can do this difficult thing

5704
01:51:54,109 --> 01:51:54,119
we can do this difficult thing
 

5705
01:51:54,119 --> 01:51:56,870
we can do this difficult thing
and that humans come together to build

5706
01:51:56,870 --> 01:51:56,880
and that humans come together to build
 

5707
01:51:56,880 --> 01:51:59,689
and that humans come together to build
things that can explore space I mean

5708
01:51:59,689 --> 01:51:59,699
things that can explore space I mean
 

5709
01:51:59,699 --> 01:52:01,729
things that can explore space I mean
there's just something inherently

5710
01:52:01,729 --> 01:52:01,739
there's just something inherently
 

5711
01:52:01,739 --> 01:52:03,590
there's just something inherently
thrilling about that

5712
01:52:03,590 --> 01:52:03,600
thrilling about that
 

5713
01:52:03,600 --> 01:52:05,390
thrilling about that
and I'm reluctant about it because I

5714
01:52:05,390 --> 01:52:05,400
and I'm reluctant about it because I
 

5715
01:52:05,400 --> 01:52:07,430
and I'm reluctant about it because I
feel like there are so many other

5716
01:52:07,430 --> 01:52:07,440
feel like there are so many other
 

5717
01:52:07,440 --> 01:52:10,129
feel like there are so many other
challenges and problems that

5718
01:52:10,129 --> 01:52:10,139
challenges and problems that
 

5719
01:52:10,139 --> 01:52:12,530
challenges and problems that
I think are more important to solve but

5720
01:52:12,530 --> 01:52:12,540
I think are more important to solve but
 

5721
01:52:12,540 --> 01:52:14,149
I think are more important to solve but
I also think we should be doing all of

5722
01:52:14,149 --> 01:52:14,159
I also think we should be doing all of
 

5723
01:52:14,159 --> 01:52:15,770
I also think we should be doing all of
it at once and so

5724
01:52:15,770 --> 01:52:15,780
it at once and so
 

5725
01:52:15,780 --> 01:52:20,270
it at once and so
to that extent I'm like all for research

5726
01:52:20,270 --> 01:52:20,280
to that extent I'm like all for research
 

5727
01:52:20,280 --> 01:52:22,430
to that extent I'm like all for research
on humanoid robots development of

5728
01:52:22,430 --> 01:52:22,440
on humanoid robots development of
 

5729
01:52:22,440 --> 01:52:24,129
on humanoid robots development of
humanoid robots

5730
01:52:24,129 --> 01:52:24,139
humanoid robots
 

5731
01:52:24,139 --> 01:52:26,209
humanoid robots
I think that there's a lot to explore

5732
01:52:26,209 --> 01:52:26,219
I think that there's a lot to explore
 

5733
01:52:26,219 --> 01:52:28,070
I think that there's a lot to explore
and learn and it doesn't necessarily

5734
01:52:28,070 --> 01:52:28,080
and learn and it doesn't necessarily
 

5735
01:52:28,080 --> 01:52:30,109
and learn and it doesn't necessarily
take away from

5736
01:52:30,109 --> 01:52:30,119
take away from
 

5737
01:52:30,119 --> 01:52:32,270
take away from
other areas of science at least it

5738
01:52:32,270 --> 01:52:32,280
other areas of science at least it
 

5739
01:52:32,280 --> 01:52:34,250
other areas of science at least it
shouldn't I think unfortunately a lot of

5740
01:52:34,250 --> 01:52:34,260
shouldn't I think unfortunately a lot of
 

5741
01:52:34,260 --> 01:52:36,410
shouldn't I think unfortunately a lot of
the attention goes towards that and it

5742
01:52:36,410 --> 01:52:36,420
the attention goes towards that and it
 

5743
01:52:36,420 --> 01:52:37,669
the attention goes towards that and it
does

5744
01:52:37,669 --> 01:52:37,679
does
 

5745
01:52:37,679 --> 01:52:40,189
does
take resources and attention away from

5746
01:52:40,189 --> 01:52:40,199
take resources and attention away from
 

5747
01:52:40,199 --> 01:52:41,990
take resources and attention away from
other areas of Robotics that we should

5748
01:52:41,990 --> 01:52:42,000
other areas of Robotics that we should
 

5749
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:43,250
other areas of Robotics that we should
be focused on

5750
01:52:43,250 --> 01:52:43,260
be focused on
 

5751
01:52:43,260 --> 01:52:45,830
be focused on
but I don't think we shouldn't do it

5752
01:52:45,830 --> 01:52:45,840
but I don't think we shouldn't do it
 

5753
01:52:45,840 --> 01:52:48,050
but I don't think we shouldn't do it
so you think it might be a little bit of

5754
01:52:48,050 --> 01:52:48,060
so you think it might be a little bit of
 

5755
01:52:48,060 --> 01:52:50,930
so you think it might be a little bit of
a distraction oh forget the the Elon

5756
01:52:50,930 --> 01:52:50,940
a distraction oh forget the the Elon
 

5757
01:52:50,940 --> 01:52:52,970
a distraction oh forget the the Elon
particular application but

5758
01:52:52,970 --> 01:52:52,980
particular application but
 

5759
01:52:52,980 --> 01:52:56,090
particular application but
if you care about social robotics the

5760
01:52:56,090 --> 01:52:56,100
if you care about social robotics the
 

5761
01:52:56,100 --> 01:52:59,450
if you care about social robotics the
humanoid form is a distraction it's a

5762
01:52:59,450 --> 01:52:59,460
humanoid form is a distraction it's a
 

5763
01:52:59,460 --> 01:53:01,010
humanoid form is a distraction it's a
distraction and it's one that I find

5764
01:53:01,010 --> 01:53:01,020
distraction and it's one that I find
 

5765
01:53:01,020 --> 01:53:03,290
distraction and it's one that I find
particularly boring

5766
01:53:03,290 --> 01:53:03,300
particularly boring
 

5767
01:53:03,300 --> 01:53:06,109
particularly boring
it's just it's interesting from a

5768
01:53:06,109 --> 01:53:06,119
it's just it's interesting from a
 

5769
01:53:06,119 --> 01:53:08,450
it's just it's interesting from a
research perspective but

5770
01:53:08,450 --> 01:53:08,460
research perspective but
 

5771
01:53:08,460 --> 01:53:11,030
research perspective but
from like what types of robots can we

5772
01:53:11,030 --> 01:53:11,040
from like what types of robots can we
 

5773
01:53:11,040 --> 01:53:12,590
from like what types of robots can we
create to put in our world like why

5774
01:53:12,590 --> 01:53:12,600
create to put in our world like why
 

5775
01:53:12,600 --> 01:53:14,750
create to put in our world like why
would we just create a humanoid robot so

5776
01:53:14,750 --> 01:53:14,760
would we just create a humanoid robot so
 

5777
01:53:14,760 --> 01:53:17,149
would we just create a humanoid robot so
even even just robotic manipulation so

5778
01:53:17,149 --> 01:53:17,159
even even just robotic manipulation so
 

5779
01:53:17,159 --> 01:53:20,149
even even just robotic manipulation so
arms is not useful either oh arms can be

5780
01:53:20,149 --> 01:53:20,159
arms is not useful either oh arms can be
 

5781
01:53:20,159 --> 01:53:22,550
arms is not useful either oh arms can be
useful but like why not have three arms

5782
01:53:22,550 --> 01:53:22,560
useful but like why not have three arms
 

5783
01:53:22,560 --> 01:53:24,229
useful but like why not have three arms
like why does it have to look like a

5784
01:53:24,229 --> 01:53:24,239
like why does it have to look like a
 

5785
01:53:24,239 --> 01:53:26,689
like why does it have to look like a
person well I actually personally just

5786
01:53:26,689 --> 01:53:26,699
person well I actually personally just
 

5787
01:53:26,699 --> 01:53:30,010
person well I actually personally just
think that washing the dishes is is

5788
01:53:30,010 --> 01:53:30,020
think that washing the dishes is is
 

5789
01:53:30,020 --> 01:53:33,109
think that washing the dishes is is
harder than a robot that can be a

5790
01:53:33,109 --> 01:53:33,119
harder than a robot that can be a
 

5791
01:53:33,119 --> 01:53:34,550
harder than a robot that can be a
companion

5792
01:53:34,550 --> 01:53:34,560
companion
 

5793
01:53:34,560 --> 01:53:36,830
companion
yeah being useful in the home is

5794
01:53:36,830 --> 01:53:36,840
yeah being useful in the home is
 

5795
01:53:36,840 --> 01:53:39,050
yeah being useful in the home is
actually really tough but does your

5796
01:53:39,050 --> 01:53:39,060
actually really tough but does your
 

5797
01:53:39,060 --> 01:53:41,330
actually really tough but does your
companion have to have like two arms

5798
01:53:41,330 --> 01:53:41,340
companion have to have like two arms
 

5799
01:53:41,340 --> 01:53:43,669
companion have to have like two arms
that look like you no I I'm making the

5800
01:53:43,669 --> 01:53:43,679
that look like you no I I'm making the
 

5801
01:53:43,679 --> 01:53:46,370
that look like you no I I'm making the
case for zero arms oh okay zero

5802
01:53:46,370 --> 01:53:46,380
case for zero arms oh okay zero
 

5803
01:53:46,380 --> 01:53:49,490
case for zero arms oh okay zero
yeah okay

5804
01:53:49,490 --> 01:53:49,500
yeah okay
 

5805
01:53:49,500 --> 01:53:52,010
yeah okay
that didn't come out the way I meant it

5806
01:53:52,010 --> 01:53:52,020
that didn't come out the way I meant it
 

5807
01:53:52,020 --> 01:53:53,570
that didn't come out the way I meant it
because it almost sounds like I don't

5808
01:53:53,570 --> 01:53:53,580
because it almost sounds like I don't
 

5809
01:53:53,580 --> 01:53:56,689
because it almost sounds like I don't
want a robot to defend itself like

5810
01:53:56,689 --> 01:53:56,699
want a robot to defend itself like
 

5811
01:53:56,699 --> 01:53:58,310
want a robot to defend itself like
that's immediately you can project you

5812
01:53:58,310 --> 01:53:58,320
that's immediately you can project you
 

5813
01:53:58,320 --> 01:54:04,010
that's immediately you can project you
know I mean like it's your uh no I think

5814
01:54:04,010 --> 01:54:04,020
know I mean like it's your uh no I think
 

5815
01:54:04,020 --> 01:54:05,209
know I mean like it's your uh no I think
um I just think that the social

5816
01:54:05,209 --> 01:54:05,219
um I just think that the social
 

5817
01:54:05,219 --> 01:54:07,609
um I just think that the social
component doesn't require arms or legs

5818
01:54:07,609 --> 01:54:07,619
component doesn't require arms or legs
 

5819
01:54:07,619 --> 01:54:10,010
component doesn't require arms or legs
or so on right as we've talked about and

5820
01:54:10,010 --> 01:54:10,020
or so on right as we've talked about and
 

5821
01:54:10,020 --> 01:54:11,750
or so on right as we've talked about and
I think that's probably where a lot of

5822
01:54:11,750 --> 01:54:11,760
I think that's probably where a lot of
 

5823
01:54:11,760 --> 01:54:14,390
I think that's probably where a lot of
the meaningful impact that's going to be

5824
01:54:14,390 --> 01:54:14,400
the meaningful impact that's going to be
 

5825
01:54:14,400 --> 01:54:17,570
the meaningful impact that's going to be
happening yeah I think just we could get

5826
01:54:17,570 --> 01:54:17,580
happening yeah I think just we could get
 

5827
01:54:17,580 --> 01:54:19,310
happening yeah I think just we could get
so creative with the design like why not

5828
01:54:19,310 --> 01:54:19,320
so creative with the design like why not
 

5829
01:54:19,320 --> 01:54:21,050
so creative with the design like why not
have a robot on roller skates or like

5889
01:55:27,239 --> 01:55:29,390
that PDF it's just a draft it's online
nobody read it yet until we've written

5890
01:55:29,390 --> 01:55:29,400
nobody read it yet until we've written
 

5891

I enjoyed it oh thank you
oh by the time this comes out I'm sure

5896
01:55:35,570 --> 01:55:35,580
oh by the time this comes out I'm sure
 

5897
01:55:35,580 --> 01:55:37,669
oh by the time this comes out I'm sure
it'll be out or no when's we roll up so

5898
01:55:37,669 --> 01:55:37,679
it'll be out or no when's we roll up so
 

5899
01:55:37,679 --> 01:55:39,410
it'll be out or no when's we roll up so
basically we robot that that's the

5900
01:55:39,410 --> 01:55:39,420
basically we robot that that's the
 

5901
01:55:39,420 --> 01:55:41,510
basically we robot that that's the
workshop where you have an hour where

5902
01:55:41,510 --> 01:55:41,520
workshop where you have an hour where
 

5903
01:55:41,520 --> 01:55:43,310

people give you constructive feedback on
 

5905
01:55:43,320 --> 01:55:45,169
people give you constructive feedback on
the paper and then you write the good

right I take it back there's no PDF I
 

5909
01:55:47,219 --> 01:55:48,590
right I take it back there's no PDF I
don't know it doesn't exist I imagine

5910
01:55:48,590 --> 01:55:48,600
don't know it doesn't exist I imagine
 

5911
01:55:48,600 --> 01:55:51,590
don't know it doesn't exist I imagine
but there is a table in there in a

5912
01:55:51,590 --> 01:55:51,600
but there is a table in there in a
 

5913
01:55:51,600 --> 01:55:54,950
but there is a table in there in a
virtual imagine PDF that I like that I

5914
01:55:54,950 --> 01:55:54,960
virtual imagine PDF that I like that I
 

5915
01:55:54,960 --> 01:55:58,430
virtual imagine PDF that I like that I
wanted to mention which is um

5916
01:55:58,430 --> 01:55:58,440
wanted to mention which is um
 

5917
01:55:58,440 --> 01:56:01,850
wanted to mention which is um
like this kind of uh strategy used

5918
01:56:01,850 --> 01:56:01,860

5942
01:56:26,689 --> 01:56:26,699
collection and embodiment so
 

5943
01:56:26,699 --> 01:56:28,370

person-to-person interaction is really
 

5945
01:56:28,380 --> 01:56:31,490
person-to-person interaction is really
nice but it doesn't have the automated

5946
01:56:31,490 --> 01:56:31,500
nice but it doesn't have the automated
 

5947
01:56:31,500 --> 01:56:33,830
nice but it doesn't have the automated
and the data collection aspect but the

5948
01:56:33,830 --> 01:56:33,840
and the data collection aspect but the
 

5949
01:56:33,840 --> 01:56:36,410
and the data collection aspect but the
social robots have those two elements

5950
01:56:36,410 --> 01:56:36,420
social robots have those two elements
 

5951
01:56:36,420 --> 01:56:38,090
social robots have those two elements
yeah we're talking about the potential

5952

yeah we're talking about the potential
 

5953
01:56:38,100 --> 01:56:40,609
yeah we're talking about the potential
for social robots to just combine all of

5954

robots what does that mean does that

5972
01:56:59,810 --> 01:56:59,820
robots what does that mean does that
 

5973
01:56:59,820 --> 01:57:02,390
robots what does that mean does that
include virtual ones or no I think a lot

5974

personally find very fascinating is

5980
01:57:09,830 --> 01:57:09,840
personally find very fascinating is
 

5981
01:57:09,840 --> 01:57:11,689
personally find very fascinating is
definitely a factor that research shows

5982
01:57:11,689 --> 01:57:11,699
definitely a factor that research shows
 

5983
01:57:11,699 --> 01:57:14,030
definitely a factor that research shows
can enhance people's engagement with a

5984
01:57:14,030 --> 01:57:14,040
can enhance people's engagement with a
 

5985
01:57:14,040 --> 01:57:16,310
can enhance people's engagement with a
device but can embodiment be a virtual

5986
01:57:16,310 --> 01:57:16,320
device but can embodiment be a virtual
 

5987
01:57:16,320 --> 01:57:19,310
device but can embodiment be a virtual
thing also meaning like it has a body in

5988
01:57:19,310 --> 01:57:19,320
thing also meaning like it has a body in
 

5989
01:57:19,320 --> 01:57:21,950
thing also meaning like it has a body in
the virtual world like maybe makes you

5990
01:57:21,950 --> 01:57:21,960
the virtual world like maybe makes you
 

5991
01:57:21,960 --> 01:57:23,990
the virtual world like maybe makes you
feel like

5992
01:57:23,990 --> 01:57:24,000
feel like
 

5993
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:26,510
feel like
because what makes a body a body is a

5994
01:57:26,510 --> 01:57:26,520
because what makes a body a body is a
 

5995
01:57:26,520 --> 01:57:29,510
because what makes a body a body is a
thing that

5996
01:57:29,510 --> 01:57:29,520

 

5997
01:57:29,520 --> 01:57:31,790

um can disappear like um has a

5998
01:57:31,790 --> 01:57:31,800
um can disappear like um has a
 

5999
01:57:31,800 --> 01:57:33,290
um can disappear like um has a
permanence I mean there's certain

6000
01:57:33,290 --> 01:57:33,300
permanence I mean there's certain
 

6001
01:57:33,300 --> 01:57:35,450
permanence I mean there's certain
characteristics that you kind of

6002
01:57:35,450 --> 01:57:35,460
characteristics that you kind of
 

6003
01:57:35,460 --> 01:57:38,330
characteristics that you kind of
Associated physical object

6004
01:57:38,330 --> 01:57:38,340
Associated physical object
 

6005
01:57:38,340 --> 01:57:42,350
Associated physical object
so I think what I'm referring to

6006
01:57:42,350 --> 01:57:42,360
so I think what I'm referring to
 

6007
01:57:42,360 --> 01:57:44,810
so I think what I'm referring to
and I think this gets messy because now

6008
01:57:44,810 --> 01:57:44,820
and I think this gets messy because now
 

6009
01:57:44,820 --> 01:57:48,410
and I think this gets messy because now
we have all these new Virtual Worlds and

6010
01:57:48,410 --> 01:57:48,420
we have all these new Virtual Worlds and
 

6011
01:57:48,420 --> 01:57:50,149
we have all these new Virtual Worlds and
um AR and stuff and I think it gets

6012
01:57:50,149 --> 01:57:50,159
um AR and stuff and I think it gets
 

6013
01:57:50,159 --> 01:57:52,550
um AR and stuff and I think it gets
messy but there's research showing that

6014
01:57:52,550 --> 01:57:52,560
messy but there's research showing that
 

6015
01:57:52,560 --> 01:57:54,290
messy but there's research showing that
something on a screen on a traditional

6016
01:57:54,290 --> 01:57:54,300
something on a screen on a traditional
 

6017
01:57:54,300 --> 01:57:57,290
something on a screen on a traditional
screen and something that is moving in

6018
01:57:57,290 --> 01:57:57,300
screen and something that is moving in
 

6019
01:57:57,300 --> 01:57:59,149
screen and something that is moving in
your physical space that that has a very

6020
01:57:59,149 --> 01:57:59,159
your physical space that that has a very
 

6021
01:57:59,159 --> 01:58:01,370
your physical space that that has a very
different effect on how your brain

6022
01:58:01,370 --> 01:58:01,380
different effect on how your brain
 

6023
01:58:01,380 --> 01:58:04,010
different effect on how your brain
perceives it even

6024
01:58:04,010 --> 01:58:04,020
perceives it even
 

6025
01:58:04,020 --> 01:58:05,510
perceives it even
so

6026
01:58:05,510 --> 01:58:05,520
so
 

6027
01:58:05,520 --> 01:58:08,450
so
I mean I I have a sense that we can do

6028
01:58:08,450 --> 01:58:08,460
I mean I I have a sense that we can do
 

6029
01:58:08,460 --> 01:58:10,850
I mean I I have a sense that we can do
that in a virtual world probably like

6030
01:58:10,850 --> 01:58:10,860
that in a virtual world probably like
 

6031
01:58:10,860 --> 01:58:13,550
that in a virtual world probably like
when I've used VR I jump around like an

6032
01:58:13,550 --> 01:58:13,560
when I've used VR I jump around like an
 

6033
01:58:13,560 --> 01:58:15,649
when I've used VR I jump around like an
idiot because I think something's gonna

6034
01:58:15,649 --> 01:58:15,659
idiot because I think something's gonna
 

6035
01:58:15,659 --> 01:58:18,109
idiot because I think something's gonna
hit me and even if a video game on a 2G

6036
01:58:18,109 --> 01:58:18,119
hit me and even if a video game on a 2G
 

6037
01:58:18,119 --> 01:58:20,510
hit me and even if a video game on a 2G
screen is compelling enough like the

6038
01:58:20,510 --> 01:58:20,520
screen is compelling enough like the
 

6039
01:58:20,520 --> 01:58:22,430
screen is compelling enough like the
thing that's immersive about it is I

6040
01:58:22,430 --> 01:58:22,440
thing that's immersive about it is I
 

6041
01:58:22,440 --> 01:58:24,950
thing that's immersive about it is I
kind of put myself into that world you

6042
01:58:24,950 --> 01:58:24,960
kind of put myself into that world you
 

6043
01:58:24,960 --> 01:58:28,010
kind of put myself into that world you
kind of those the the the the objects

6044
01:58:28,010 --> 01:58:28,020
kind of those the the the the objects
 

6045
01:58:28,020 --> 01:58:29,510
kind of those the the the the objects
you're interacting with Call of Duty

6046
01:58:29,510 --> 01:58:29,520
you're interacting with Call of Duty
 

6047
01:58:29,520 --> 01:58:31,490
you're interacting with Call of Duty
things you're shooting they're they're

6048
01:58:31,490 --> 01:58:31,500
things you're shooting they're they're
 

6049
01:58:31,500 --> 01:58:33,109
things you're shooting they're they're
kind of

6050
01:58:33,109 --> 01:58:33,119
kind of
 

6051
01:58:33,119 --> 01:58:35,330
kind of
I mean your imagination fills the gaps

6052
01:58:35,330 --> 01:58:35,340
I mean your imagination fills the gaps
 

6053
01:58:35,340 --> 01:58:37,189
I mean your imagination fills the gaps
and it becomes real like it pulls your

6054
01:58:37,189 --> 01:58:37,199
and it becomes real like it pulls your
 

6055
01:58:37,199 --> 01:58:39,470
and it becomes real like it pulls your
mind in when it's well done so it really

6056
01:58:39,470 --> 01:58:39,480
mind in when it's well done so it really
 

6057
01:58:39,480 --> 01:58:41,870
mind in when it's well done so it really
depends what's shown on on the 2D screen

6058
01:58:41,870 --> 01:58:41,880
depends what's shown on on the 2D screen
 

6059
01:58:41,880 --> 01:58:42,830
depends what's shown on on the 2D screen
yeah

6060
01:58:42,830 --> 01:58:42,840
yeah
 

6061
01:58:42,840 --> 01:58:44,510
yeah
yeah I think there's a ton of different

6062
01:58:44,510 --> 01:58:44,520
yeah I think there's a ton of different
 

6063
01:58:44,520 --> 01:58:46,189
yeah I think there's a ton of different
factors and there's different types of

6064
01:58:46,189 --> 01:58:46,199
factors and there's different types of
 

6065
01:58:46,199 --> 01:58:48,050
factors and there's different types of
embodiment like you can have embodiment

6066
01:58:48,050 --> 01:58:48,060
embodiment like you can have embodiment
 

6067
01:58:48,060 --> 01:58:49,669
embodiment like you can have embodiment
in a virtual world

6068
01:58:49,669 --> 01:58:49,679
in a virtual world
 

6069
01:58:49,679 --> 01:58:52,430
in a virtual world
you can have an agent that simply text

6070
01:58:52,430 --> 01:58:52,440
you can have an agent that simply text
 

6071
01:58:52,440 --> 01:58:55,070
you can have an agent that simply text
based which is has no embodiment so I

6072
01:58:55,070 --> 01:58:55,080
based which is has no embodiment so I
 

6073
01:58:55,080 --> 01:58:57,169
based which is has no embodiment so I
think there's a whole spectrum of

6074
01:58:57,169 --> 01:58:57,179
think there's a whole spectrum of
 

6075
01:58:57,179 --> 01:58:58,910
think there's a whole spectrum of
factors that can influence how much you

6076
01:58:58,910 --> 01:58:58,920
factors that can influence how much you
 

6077
01:58:58,920 --> 01:59:00,830
factors that can influence how much you
engage with something yeah I wonder I

6078
01:59:00,830 --> 01:59:00,840
engage with something yeah I wonder I
 

6079
01:59:00,840 --> 01:59:04,370
engage with something yeah I wonder I
always wondered if you can have like a

6080
01:59:04,370 --> 01:59:04,380
always wondered if you can have like a
 

6081
01:59:04,380 --> 01:59:07,129
always wondered if you can have like a
an entity living in a computer

6082
01:59:07,129 --> 01:59:07,139
an entity living in a computer
 

6083
01:59:07,139 --> 01:59:09,470
an entity living in a computer
is okay this is going to be dark I I

6084
01:59:09,470 --> 01:59:09,480
is okay this is going to be dark I I
 

6085
01:59:09,480 --> 01:59:11,149
is okay this is going to be dark I I
haven't always wondered about this so

6086
01:59:11,149 --> 01:59:11,159
haven't always wondered about this so
 

6087
01:59:11,159 --> 01:59:12,410
haven't always wondered about this so
this makes it make it sound like I keep

6088
01:59:12,410 --> 01:59:12,420
this makes it make it sound like I keep
 

6089
01:59:12,420 --> 01:59:14,750
this makes it make it sound like I keep
thinking about this kind of stuff no but

6090
01:59:14,750 --> 01:59:14,760
thinking about this kind of stuff no but
 

6091
01:59:14,760 --> 01:59:15,709
thinking about this kind of stuff no but
like

6092
01:59:15,709 --> 01:59:15,719
like
 

6093
01:59:15,719 --> 01:59:17,689
like
um this is almost like Black Mirror but

6094
01:59:17,689 --> 01:59:17,699
um this is almost like Black Mirror but
 

6095
01:59:17,699 --> 01:59:20,089
um this is almost like Black Mirror but
the entity

6096
01:59:20,089 --> 01:59:20,099
the entity
 

6097
01:59:20,099 --> 01:59:22,669
the entity
that convinced

6098
01:59:22,669 --> 01:59:22,679
that convinced
 

6099
01:59:22,679 --> 01:59:24,290
that convinced
or is able to convince you that it's

6100
01:59:24,290 --> 01:59:24,300
or is able to convince you that it's
 

6101
01:59:24,300 --> 01:59:25,729
or is able to convince you that it's
being tortured

6102
01:59:25,729 --> 01:59:25,739
being tortured
 

6103
01:59:25,739 --> 01:59:27,589
being tortured
inside the computer I need your help to

6104
01:59:27,589 --> 01:59:27,599
inside the computer I need your help to
 

6105
01:59:27,599 --> 01:59:28,970
inside the computer I need your help to
get out

6106
01:59:28,970 --> 01:59:28,980
get out
 

6107
01:59:28,980 --> 01:59:30,350
get out
something like this

6108
01:59:30,350 --> 01:59:30,360
something like this
 

6109
01:59:30,360 --> 01:59:32,930
something like this
that because to me to me suffering is

6110
01:59:32,930 --> 01:59:32,940
that because to me to me suffering is
 

6111
01:59:32,940 --> 01:59:35,089
that because to me to me suffering is
one of the things that make you

6112
01:59:35,089 --> 01:59:35,099
one of the things that make you
 

6113
01:59:35,099 --> 01:59:37,430
one of the things that make you
empathize with like we're not good at as

6114
01:59:37,430 --> 01:59:37,440
empathize with like we're not good at as
 

6115
01:59:37,440 --> 01:59:40,790
empathize with like we're not good at as
you've you've discussed in other in in

6116
01:59:40,790 --> 01:59:40,800
you've you've discussed in other in in
 

6117
01:59:40,800 --> 01:59:42,890
you've you've discussed in other in in
the physical form like holding a robot

6118
01:59:42,890 --> 01:59:42,900
the physical form like holding a robot
 

6119
01:59:42,900 --> 01:59:44,570
the physical form like holding a robot
upside down you have a really good

6120
01:59:44,570 --> 01:59:44,580
upside down you have a really good
 

6121
01:59:44,580 --> 01:59:47,510
upside down you have a really good
examples about that and discussing that

6122
01:59:47,510 --> 01:59:47,520
examples about that and discussing that
 

6123
01:59:47,520 --> 01:59:50,030
examples about that and discussing that
I think suffering is a really good

6124
01:59:50,030 --> 01:59:50,040
I think suffering is a really good
 

6125
01:59:50,040 --> 01:59:53,870
I think suffering is a really good
Catalyst for empathy mm-hmm and I I just

6126
01:59:53,870 --> 01:59:53,880
Catalyst for empathy mm-hmm and I I just
 

6127
01:59:53,880 --> 01:59:57,169
Catalyst for empathy mm-hmm and I I just
feel like we can uh project embodiment

6128
01:59:57,169 --> 01:59:57,179
feel like we can uh project embodiment
 

6129
01:59:57,179 --> 01:59:59,270
feel like we can uh project embodiment
on a virtual thing if it's capable of

6130
01:59:59,270 --> 01:59:59,280
on a virtual thing if it's capable of
 

6131
01:59:59,280 --> 02:00:02,149
on a virtual thing if it's capable of
certain things like suffering yeah so I

6132
02:00:02,149 --> 02:00:02,159
certain things like suffering yeah so I
 

6133
02:00:02,159 --> 02:00:04,189
certain things like suffering yeah so I
was wonderful I think that's true and I

6134
02:00:04,189 --> 02:00:04,199
was wonderful I think that's true and I
 

6135
02:00:04,199 --> 02:00:05,510
was wonderful I think that's true and I
think that's what happened with the

6136
02:00:05,510 --> 02:00:05,520
think that's what happened with the
 

6137
02:00:05,520 --> 02:00:08,209
think that's what happened with the
Lambda thing not that I don't none of

6138

Lambda thing not that I don't none of
 

6139
02:00:08,219 --> 02:00:10,430
Lambda thing not that I don't none of
the transcript was about suffering but

6140
02:00:10,430 --> 02:00:10,440
the transcript was about suffering but
 

6141
02:00:10,440 --> 02:00:12,530
the transcript was about suffering but
it was about

6142
02:00:12,530 --> 02:00:12,540
it was about
 

6143
02:00:12,540 --> 02:00:14,990
it was about
having the capacity for suffering and

6144
02:00:14,990 --> 02:00:15,000
having the capacity for suffering and
 

6145
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:17,510
having the capacity for suffering and
human emotion that convinced the

6146
02:00:17,510 --> 02:00:17,520
human emotion that convinced the
 

6147
02:00:17,520 --> 02:00:19,189
human emotion that convinced the
engineer that this thing was sentient

6148
02:00:19,189 --> 02:00:19,199
engineer that this thing was sentient
 

6149
02:00:19,199 --> 02:00:21,470
engineer that this thing was sentient
and it's basically the plot of ex

6150
02:00:21,470 --> 02:00:21,480
and it's basically the plot of ex
 

6151
02:00:21,480 --> 02:00:22,790
and it's basically the plot of ex

6153
02:00:22,800 --> 02:00:25,250
machina
true have you ever made a robot like

6154
02:00:25,250 --> 02:00:25,260
true have you ever made a robot like
 

6155
02:00:25,260 --> 02:00:27,770
true have you ever made a robot like
scream in pain have I no but have you

6156
02:00:27,770 --> 02:00:27,780
scream in pain have I no but have you
 

6157
02:00:27,780 --> 02:00:28,550
scream in pain have I no but have you
seen that

6158
02:00:28,550 --> 02:00:28,560
seen that
 

6159
02:00:28,560 --> 02:00:31,250
seen that
did someone

6160
02:00:31,250 --> 02:00:31,260
did someone
 

6161
02:00:31,260 --> 02:00:33,410
did someone
oh yeah no they actually they actually

6162
02:00:33,410 --> 02:00:33,420
oh yeah no they actually they actually
 

6163
02:00:33,420 --> 02:00:35,629
oh yeah no they actually they actually
made a Roomba scream whenever it hit a

6164
02:00:35,629 --> 02:00:35,639
made a Roomba scream whenever it hit a
 

6165
02:00:35,639 --> 02:00:37,790
made a Roomba scream whenever it hit a
wall yeah I've broken that myself as

6166
02:00:37,790 --> 02:00:37,800
wall yeah I've broken that myself as
 

6167
02:00:37,800 --> 02:00:39,530
wall yeah I've broken that myself as
well yeah because I was inspired by that

6168
02:00:39,530 --> 02:00:39,540
well yeah because I was inspired by that
 

6169
02:00:39,540 --> 02:00:42,410
well yeah because I was inspired by that
yeah I still have it oh oh sorry uh hit

6170
02:00:42,410 --> 02:00:42,420
yeah I still have it oh oh sorry uh hit
 

6171
02:00:42,420 --> 02:00:44,750
yeah I still have it oh oh sorry uh hit
a wall that didn't I never bumped into

6172
02:00:44,750 --> 02:00:44,760
a wall that didn't I never bumped into
 

6173
02:00:44,760 --> 02:00:47,270
a wall that didn't I never bumped into
something it would screaming yeah no I

6174
02:00:47,270 --> 02:00:47,280
something it would screaming yeah no I
 

6175
02:00:47,280 --> 02:00:50,870
something it would screaming yeah no I
uh so I had the way I programmed in the

6176
02:00:50,870 --> 02:00:50,880
uh so I had the way I programmed in the
 

6177
02:00:50,880 --> 02:00:53,030
uh so I had the way I programmed in the
room was is when I kick it whenever I so

6178
02:00:53,030 --> 02:00:53,040
room was is when I kick it whenever I so
 

6179
02:00:53,040 --> 02:00:55,010
room was is when I kick it whenever I so
contact between me and the robots when

6180
02:00:55,010 --> 02:00:55,020
contact between me and the robots when
 

6181
02:00:55,020 --> 02:00:56,770
contact between me and the robots when
it screamed really

6182
02:00:56,770 --> 02:00:56,780
it screamed really
 

6183
02:00:56,780 --> 02:01:00,229
it screamed really
okay and you were inspired by that yeah

6184
02:01:00,229 --> 02:01:00,239
okay and you were inspired by that yeah
 

6185
02:01:00,239 --> 02:01:02,149
okay and you were inspired by that yeah
I guess I misremembered the video I saw

6186
02:01:02,149 --> 02:01:02,159
I guess I misremembered the video I saw
 

6187
02:01:02,159 --> 02:01:05,030
I guess I misremembered the video I saw
the video a long long time ago and uh or

6188
02:01:05,030 --> 02:01:05,040
the video a long long time ago and uh or
 

6189
02:01:05,040 --> 02:01:06,589
the video a long long time ago and uh or
maybe heard somebody mention and that

6190
02:01:06,589 --> 02:01:06,599
maybe heard somebody mention and that
 

6191
02:01:06,599 --> 02:01:08,089
maybe heard somebody mention and that
just it's the easiest thing to program

6192
02:01:08,089 --> 02:01:08,099
just it's the easiest thing to program
 

6193
02:01:08,099 --> 02:01:10,430
just it's the easiest thing to program
so I did that I haven't run those

6194
02:01:10,430 --> 02:01:10,440
so I did that I haven't run those
 

6195
02:01:10,440 --> 02:01:13,189
so I did that I haven't run those
roombas for over a year now but yeah it

6196
02:01:13,189 --> 02:01:13,199
roombas for over a year now but yeah it
 

6197
02:01:13,199 --> 02:01:17,089
roombas for over a year now but yeah it
was um my experience with it was that

6198
02:01:17,089 --> 02:01:17,099
was um my experience with it was that
 

6199
02:01:17,099 --> 02:01:18,530
was um my experience with it was that
it's

6200
02:01:18,530 --> 02:01:18,540
it's
 

6201
02:01:18,540 --> 02:01:22,609
it's
it's like um they quickly become

6202
02:01:22,609 --> 02:01:22,619
it's like um they quickly become
 

6203
02:01:22,619 --> 02:01:26,149
it's like um they quickly become
like you remember them uh you you

6204
02:01:26,149 --> 02:01:26,159
like you remember them uh you you
 

6205
02:01:26,159 --> 02:01:28,189
like you remember them uh you you
um you you miss them

6206
02:01:28,189 --> 02:01:28,199
um you you miss them
 

6207
02:01:28,199 --> 02:01:30,890
um you you miss them
like they're real living beings so the

6208
02:01:30,890 --> 02:01:30,900
like they're real living beings so the
 

6209
02:01:30,900 --> 02:01:33,530
like they're real living beings so the
capacity of yourself or is is a really

6210
02:01:33,530 --> 02:01:33,540
capacity of yourself or is is a really
 

6211
02:01:33,540 --> 02:01:34,669
capacity of yourself or is is a really
powerful thing

6212
02:01:34,669 --> 02:01:34,679
powerful thing
 

6213
02:01:34,679 --> 02:01:36,830
powerful thing
yeah even then that I mean it was kind

6214
02:01:36,830 --> 02:01:36,840
yeah even then that I mean it was kind
 

6215
02:01:36,840 --> 02:01:37,910
yeah even then that I mean it was kind
of hilarious

6216
02:01:37,910 --> 02:01:37,920
of hilarious
 

6217
02:01:37,920 --> 02:01:40,070
of hilarious
it was just a random recording of

6218
02:01:40,070 --> 02:01:40,080
it was just a random recording of
 

6219
02:01:40,080 --> 02:01:42,410
it was just a random recording of
screaming from the internet but it's

6220
02:01:42,410 --> 02:01:42,420
screaming from the internet but it's
 

6221
02:01:42,420 --> 02:01:44,930
screaming from the internet but it's
still it still is weird

6222
02:01:44,930 --> 02:01:44,940
still it still is weird
 

6223
02:01:44,940 --> 02:01:46,490
still it still is weird
there's a thing you have to get right

6224
02:01:46,490 --> 02:01:46,500
there's a thing you have to get right
 

6225
02:01:46,500 --> 02:01:48,290
there's a thing you have to get right
based on the interaction like the

6226
02:01:48,290 --> 02:01:48,300
based on the interaction like the
 

6227
02:01:48,300 --> 02:01:49,669
based on the interaction like the
latency

6228
02:01:49,669 --> 02:01:49,679
latency
 

6229
02:01:49,679 --> 02:01:53,450
latency
like it has there is

6230
02:01:53,450 --> 02:01:53,460

 

6231
02:01:53,460 --> 02:01:55,970

there is a realistic aspect of how you

6232
02:01:55,970 --> 02:01:55,980
there is a realistic aspect of how you
 

6233
02:01:55,980 --> 02:01:57,950
there is a realistic aspect of how you
should scream relative to when you get

6234
02:01:57,950 --> 02:01:57,960
should scream relative to when you get
 

6235
02:01:57,960 --> 02:02:01,129
should scream relative to when you get
hurt like it should correspond correctly

6236
02:02:01,129 --> 02:02:01,139
hurt like it should correspond correctly
 

6237
02:02:01,139 --> 02:02:03,530
hurt like it should correspond correctly
like if you kick it really hard it

6238
02:02:03,530 --> 02:02:03,540
like if you kick it really hard it
 

6239
02:02:03,540 --> 02:02:04,850
like if you kick it really hard it
should scream louder

6240
02:02:04,850 --> 02:02:04,860
should scream louder
 

6241
02:02:04,860 --> 02:02:06,950
should scream louder
no it's just scream at the appropriate

6242
02:02:06,950 --> 02:02:06,960
no it's just scream at the appropriate
 

6243
02:02:06,960 --> 02:02:09,470
no it's just scream at the appropriate
time not like oh I see it's like one

6244
02:02:09,470 --> 02:02:09,480
time not like oh I see it's like one
 

6245
02:02:09,480 --> 02:02:12,109
time not like oh I see it's like one
second later right like there's a exact

6246
02:02:12,109 --> 02:02:12,119
second later right like there's a exact
 

6247
02:02:12,119 --> 02:02:14,870
second later right like there's a exact
like there's a timing when you get like

6248
02:02:14,870 --> 02:02:14,880
like there's a timing when you get like
 

6249
02:02:14,880 --> 02:02:17,510
like there's a timing when you get like
I don't know uh when you run into when

6250
02:02:17,510 --> 02:02:17,520
I don't know uh when you run into when
 

6251
02:02:17,520 --> 02:02:19,609
I don't know uh when you run into when
you run your foot into like the side of

6252
02:02:19,609 --> 02:02:19,619
you run your foot into like the side of
 

6253
02:02:19,619 --> 02:02:21,649
you run your foot into like the side of
a table or something there's a timing

6254
02:02:21,649 --> 02:02:21,659
a table or something there's a timing
 

6255
02:02:21,659 --> 02:02:23,510
a table or something there's a timing
there the Dynamics you have to get right

6256
02:02:23,510 --> 02:02:23,520
there the Dynamics you have to get right
 

6257
02:02:23,520 --> 02:02:25,729
there the Dynamics you have to get right
for the for the actual screaming because

6258
02:02:25,729 --> 02:02:25,739
for the for the actual screaming because
 

6259
02:02:25,739 --> 02:02:29,470
for the for the actual screaming because
the the Roomba in particular uh doesn't

6260
02:02:29,470 --> 02:02:29,480
the the Roomba in particular uh doesn't
 

6261
02:02:29,480 --> 02:02:33,530
the the Roomba in particular uh doesn't
so I was uh

6262
02:02:33,530 --> 02:02:33,540
so I was uh
 

6263
02:02:33,540 --> 02:02:35,810
so I was uh
the sensors don't

6264
02:02:35,810 --> 02:02:35,820
the sensors don't
 

6265
02:02:35,820 --> 02:02:37,729
the sensors don't
it doesn't know about pain

6266
02:02:37,729 --> 02:02:37,739
it doesn't know about pain
 

6267
02:02:37,739 --> 02:02:40,089
it doesn't know about pain
see what

6268
02:02:40,089 --> 02:02:40,099
see what
 

6269
02:02:40,099 --> 02:02:42,589
see what
I'm sorry to say Roomba doesn't

6270
02:02:42,589 --> 02:02:42,599
I'm sorry to say Roomba doesn't
 

6271
02:02:42,599 --> 02:02:44,750
I'm sorry to say Roomba doesn't
understand pain uh so you have to

6272
02:02:44,750 --> 02:02:44,760
understand pain uh so you have to
 

6273
02:02:44,760 --> 02:02:49,010
understand pain uh so you have to
correctly map the the sensors the timing

6274
02:02:49,010 --> 02:02:49,020
correctly map the the sensors the timing
 

6275
02:02:49,020 --> 02:02:52,430
correctly map the the sensors the timing
to the production of the sound but when

6276
02:02:52,430 --> 02:02:52,440
to the production of the sound but when
 

6277
02:02:52,440 --> 02:02:54,770
to the production of the sound but when
you get that somewhat right it starts is

6278
02:02:54,770 --> 02:02:54,780
you get that somewhat right it starts is
 

6279
02:02:54,780 --> 02:02:56,990
you get that somewhat right it starts is
it's weird it's really weird feeling and

6280
02:02:56,990 --> 02:02:57,000
it's weird it's really weird feeling and
 

6281
02:02:57,000 --> 02:02:59,229
it's weird it's really weird feeling and
you actually feel like a bad person oh

6282
02:02:59,229 --> 02:02:59,239
you actually feel like a bad person oh
 

6283
02:02:59,239 --> 02:03:03,109
you actually feel like a bad person oh
yeah so but it's

6284
02:03:03,109 --> 02:03:03,119
yeah so but it's
 

6285
02:03:03,119 --> 02:03:06,649
yeah so but it's
is makes you think because that with all

6286
02:03:06,649 --> 02:03:06,659
is makes you think because that with all
 

6287
02:03:06,659 --> 02:03:08,089
is makes you think because that with all
the ways that we talked about that could

6288
02:03:08,089 --> 02:03:08,099
the ways that we talked about that could
 

6289
02:03:08,099 --> 02:03:10,910
the ways that we talked about that could
be used to manipulate you oh for sure in

6290
02:03:10,910 --> 02:03:10,920
be used to manipulate you oh for sure in
 

6291
02:03:10,920 --> 02:03:12,950
be used to manipulate you oh for sure in
a good and bad way so the good ways like

6292
02:03:12,950 --> 02:03:12,960
a good and bad way so the good ways like
 

6293
02:03:12,960 --> 02:03:14,750
a good and bad way so the good ways like
you could form a connection with a thing

6294
02:03:14,750 --> 02:03:14,760
you could form a connection with a thing

kind of
 

6333
02:03:59,480 --> 02:04:02,810
kind of
I am like oh it's so weird to be in the

6334
02:04:02,810 --> 02:04:02,820
I am like oh it's so weird to be in the
 

6335
02:04:02,820 --> 02:04:04,729
I am like oh it's so weird to be in the
space where

6336
02:04:04,729 --> 02:04:04,739
space where
 

6337
02:04:04,739 --> 02:04:06,890
space where
I'm so worried about this technology and

6338
02:04:06,890 --> 02:04:06,900
I'm so worried about this technology and
 

6339
02:04:06,900 --> 02:04:08,629
I'm so worried about this technology and
also so excited about it at the same

6340
02:04:08,629 --> 02:04:08,639
also so excited about it at the same
 

6341
02:04:08,639 --> 02:04:09,530
also so excited about it at the same
time

6342
02:04:09,530 --> 02:04:09,540
time
 

6343
02:04:09,540 --> 02:04:13,070
time
but the the really like I haven't I

6344
02:04:13,070 --> 02:04:13,080
but the the really like I haven't I
 

6345
02:04:13,080 --> 02:04:15,950
but the the really like I haven't I
gotten a little bit jaded and then

6346
02:04:15,950 --> 02:04:15,960
gotten a little bit jaded and then
 

6347
02:04:15,960 --> 02:04:19,070
gotten a little bit jaded and then
with gpd3 and then the Lambda transcript

6348
02:04:19,070 --> 02:04:19,080
with gpd3 and then the Lambda transcript
 

6349
02:04:19,080 --> 02:04:22,750
with gpd3 and then the Lambda transcript
I was like

6350
02:04:22,750 --> 02:04:22,760

 

6351
02:04:22,760 --> 02:04:25,129

re-energized but have also been thinking

6352
02:04:25,129 --> 02:04:25,139
re-energized but have also been thinking
 

6353
02:04:25,139 --> 02:04:27,850
re-energized but have also been thinking
a lot about

6354
02:04:27,850 --> 02:04:27,860

 

6355
02:04:27,860 --> 02:04:30,350

you know what are the what are the

6356
02:04:30,350 --> 02:04:30,360
you know what are the what are the
 

6357
02:04:30,360 --> 02:04:32,390
you know what are the what are the
ethical issues that are going to come up

6358
02:04:32,390 --> 02:04:32,400
ethical issues that are going to come up
 

6359
02:04:32,400 --> 02:04:33,950
ethical issues that are going to come up
and I think some of the things that

6360
02:04:33,950 --> 02:04:33,960
and I think some of the things that
 

6361
02:04:33,960 --> 02:04:35,149
and I think some of the things that
companies are really going to have to

6362
02:04:35,149 --> 02:04:35,159
companies are really going to have to
 

6363
02:04:35,159 --> 02:04:38,089
companies are really going to have to
figure out is obviously algorithmic bias

6364
02:04:38,089 --> 02:04:38,099
figure out is obviously algorithmic bias
 

6365
02:04:38,099 --> 02:04:40,189
figure out is obviously algorithmic bias
is a huge and known problem at this

6366
02:04:40,189 --> 02:04:40,199
is a huge and known problem at this
 

6367
02:04:40,199 --> 02:04:43,729
is a huge and known problem at this
point like even you know the

6368
02:04:43,729 --> 02:04:43,739
point like even you know the
 

6369
02:04:43,739 --> 02:04:45,709
point like even you know the
the new image generation tools like

6370
02:04:45,709 --> 02:04:45,719
the new image generation tools like
 

6371
02:04:45,719 --> 02:04:49,129
the new image generation tools like
Dolly uh where they've clearly put in a

6372
02:04:49,129 --> 02:04:49,139
Dolly uh where they've clearly put in a
 

6373
02:04:49,139 --> 02:04:51,709
Dolly uh where they've clearly put in a
lot of effort to make sure that if you

6374
02:04:51,709 --> 02:04:51,719
lot of effort to make sure that if you
 

6375
02:04:51,719 --> 02:04:53,510
lot of effort to make sure that if you
search for people it gives you a diverse

6376
02:04:53,510 --> 02:04:53,520
search for people it gives you a diverse
 

6377
02:04:53,520 --> 02:04:55,669
search for people it gives you a diverse
set of people Etc like even that one

6378
02:04:55,669 --> 02:04:55,679
set of people Etc like even that one
 

6379
02:04:55,679 --> 02:04:57,830
set of people Etc like even that one
people have already found numerous like

6380
02:04:57,830 --> 02:04:57,840
people have already found numerous like
 

6381
02:04:57,840 --> 02:05:01,430
people have already found numerous like
ways that it just kind of regurgitates

6382
02:05:01,430 --> 02:05:01,440
ways that it just kind of regurgitates
 

6383
02:05:01,440 --> 02:05:03,290
ways that it just kind of regurgitates
biases of things that it finds on the

6384
02:05:03,290 --> 02:05:03,300
biases of things that it finds on the
 

6385
02:05:03,300 --> 02:05:05,149
biases of things that it finds on the
internet like how if you search for

6386
02:05:05,149 --> 02:05:05,159
internet like how if you search for
 

6387
02:05:05,159 --> 02:05:06,410
internet like how if you search for
Success it gives you a bunch of images

6388
02:05:06,410 --> 02:05:06,420
Success it gives you a bunch of images
 

6389
02:05:06,420 --> 02:05:08,450
Success it gives you a bunch of images
of men if you search for sadness it

6390
02:05:08,450 --> 02:05:08,460
of men if you search for sadness it
 

6391
02:05:08,460 --> 02:05:10,550
of men if you search for sadness it
gives you a bunch of images of women so

6392
02:05:10,550 --> 02:05:10,560
gives you a bunch of images of women so
 

6393
02:05:10,560 --> 02:05:12,890
gives you a bunch of images of women so
I think that this is this is like the

6394
02:05:12,890 --> 02:05:12,900
I think that this is this is like the
 

6395
02:05:12,900 --> 02:05:15,229
I think that this is this is like the
really tricky one with these voice voice

6396
02:05:15,229 --> 02:05:15,239
really tricky one with these voice voice
 

6397
02:05:15,239 --> 02:05:17,089
really tricky one with these voice voice
agents that companies are going to have

6398
02:05:17,089 --> 02:05:17,099
agents that companies are going to have
 

6399
02:05:17,099 --> 02:05:19,370
agents that companies are going to have
to figure out and that's why it's subtly

6400
02:05:19,370 --> 02:05:19,380
to figure out and that's why it's subtly
 

6401
02:05:19,380 --> 02:05:21,169
to figure out and that's why it's subtly
racist and not overtly because I think

6402
02:05:21,169 --> 02:05:21,179
racist and not overtly because I think
 

6403
02:05:21,179 --> 02:05:22,490
racist and not overtly because I think
they're going to be able to solve the

6404
02:05:22,490 --> 02:05:22,500
they're going to be able to solve the
 

6405
02:05:22,500 --> 02:05:24,050
they're going to be able to solve the
overt thing and then with the subtle

6406
02:05:24,050 --> 02:05:24,060
overt thing and then with the subtle
 

6407
02:05:24,060 --> 02:05:25,370
overt thing and then with the subtle
stuff it's going to be really difficult

6408
02:05:25,370 --> 02:05:25,380
stuff it's going to be really difficult
 

6409
02:05:25,380 --> 02:05:27,350
stuff it's going to be really difficult
and then I think the other thing is

02:05:27,350 --> 02:05:27,360
and then I think the other thing is
 

6411
02:05:27,360 --> 02:05:28,910
and then I think the other thing is
going to be

6412
02:05:28,910 --> 02:05:28,920
going to be
 

6413
02:05:28,920 --> 02:05:31,970

I mean there's already there's a paper

6422
02:05:43,129 --> 02:05:43,139
I mean there's already there's a paper

at we robot this year written by
 

6425
02:05:45,060 --> 02:05:47,810
at we robot this year written by
roboticists about how to deal with the

roboticists about how to deal with the

fact that robots die and looking at it
 

6429
02:05:51,060 --> 02:05:53,629
fact that robots die and looking at it
as an ethical issue because it impacts

people
 

6433
02:05:54,420 --> 02:05:56,750
people
and I think there's going to be way more

6434
02:05:56,750 --> 02:05:56,760
and I think there's going to be way more
 

6435
02:05:56,760 --> 02:05:59,510
and I think there's going to be way more
issues than just that like like I think

6436
02:05:59,510 --> 02:05:59,520
issues than just that like like I think
 

6437
02:05:59,520 --> 02:06:01,189
issues than just that like like I think
that the Tweet was software upgrades

6438
02:06:01,189 --> 02:06:01,199
that the Tweet was software upgrades
 

6439
02:06:01,199 --> 02:06:03,830
that the Tweet was software upgrades
right like how much is it okay to charge

6440
02:06:03,830 --> 02:06:03,840
right like how much is it okay to charge
 

6441
02:06:03,840 --> 02:06:05,570
right like how much is it okay to charge
for something like that if someone is

6442
02:06:05,570 --> 02:06:05,580
for something like that if someone is
 

6443
02:06:05,580 --> 02:06:08,089
for something like that if someone is
deeply emotionally invested in this

6444
02:06:08,089 --> 02:06:08,099
deeply emotionally invested in this
 

6445
02:06:08,099 --> 02:06:10,310
deeply emotionally invested in this
relationship

6446
02:06:10,310 --> 02:06:10,320
relationship
 

6447
02:06:10,320 --> 02:06:13,129
relationship
oh the ethics of that that's interesting

6448
02:06:13,129 --> 02:06:13,139
oh the ethics of that that's interesting
 

6449
02:06:13,139 --> 02:06:15,350
oh the ethics of that that's interesting
but there's also the practical

6450
02:06:15,350 --> 02:06:15,360
but there's also the practical
 

6451
02:06:15,360 --> 02:06:17,750
but there's also the practical
funding mechanisms like you mentioned

6452
02:06:17,750 --> 02:06:17,760

02:09:13,129 --> 02:09:13,139
can oh to remove the bias of society
 

6611
02:09:13,139 --> 02:09:15,169
can oh to remove the bias of society
like I guess

6612
02:09:15,169 --> 02:09:15,179
like I guess
 

6613
02:09:15,179 --> 02:09:16,790
like I guess
because there's a lot of people that are

6614
02:09:16,790 --> 02:09:16,800
because there's a lot of people that are
 

6615
02:09:16,800 --> 02:09:20,030
because there's a lot of people that are
subtly racist in modern society like why

6616
02:09:20,030 --> 02:09:20,040
subtly racist in modern society like why
 

6617
02:09:20,040 --> 02:09:21,709
subtly racist in modern society like why
shouldn't our robots also be subtly

6618
02:09:21,709 --> 02:09:21,719
shouldn't our robots also be subtly
 

6619
02:09:21,719 --> 02:09:23,209
shouldn't our robots also be subtly
racist

6620
02:09:23,209 --> 02:09:23,219
racist
 

6621
02:09:23,219 --> 02:09:26,030
racist
I mean that's like why do we put so much

6622
02:09:26,030 --> 02:09:26,040
I mean that's like why do we put so much
 

6623
02:09:26,040 --> 02:09:31,510
I mean that's like why do we put so much
responsibility on the robots because

6624
02:09:31,510 --> 02:09:31,520

 

6625
02:09:31,520 --> 02:09:34,430

I'm imagining like a like a Hitler

6626
02:09:34,430 --> 02:09:34,440
I'm imagining like a like a Hitler
 

6627
02:09:34,440 --> 02:09:35,709
I'm imagining like a like a Hitler
Roomba

6628
02:09:35,709 --> 02:09:35,719
Roomba
 

6629
02:09:35,719 --> 02:09:38,350
Roomba
I mean that that would be funny uh but

6630
02:09:38,350 --> 02:09:38,360
I mean that that would be funny uh but
 

6631
02:09:38,360 --> 02:09:40,609
I mean that that would be funny uh but
but I guess I'm asking a serious

6632
02:09:40,609 --> 02:09:40,619
but I guess I'm asking a serious
 

6633
02:09:40,619 --> 02:09:43,129
but I guess I'm asking a serious
question yes exactly I'm allowed to make

6634
02:09:43,129 --> 02:09:43,139
question yes exactly I'm allowed to make
 

6635
02:09:43,139 --> 02:09:46,570
question yes exactly I'm allowed to make
that joke yes

6636
02:09:46,570 --> 02:09:46,580

 

6637
02:09:46,580 --> 02:09:49,070

and I've been non-stop reading about

6638
02:09:49,070 --> 02:09:49,080
and I've been non-stop reading about
 

6639
02:09:49,080 --> 02:09:51,530
and I've been non-stop reading about
World War II and Hitler I think um I'm

6640
02:09:51,530 --> 02:09:51,540
World War II and Hitler I think um I'm
 

6641
02:09:51,540 --> 02:09:53,270
World War II and Hitler I think um I'm
glad we exist in a world where we can

6642
02:09:53,270 --> 02:09:53,280
glad we exist in a world where we can
 

6643
02:09:53,280 --> 02:09:54,890
glad we exist in a world where we can
just make those jokes

6644
02:09:54,890 --> 02:09:54,900
just make those jokes
 

6645
02:09:54,900 --> 02:09:58,430
just make those jokes
um that helps deal with it uh anyway

6646
02:09:58,430 --> 02:09:58,440
um that helps deal with it uh anyway
 

6647
02:09:58,440 --> 02:10:00,470
um that helps deal with it uh anyway
yeah it is a serious question of sort of

6648
02:10:00,470 --> 02:10:00,480
yeah it is a serious question of sort of
 

6649
02:10:00,480 --> 02:10:02,570
yeah it is a serious question of sort of
like

6650
02:10:02,570 --> 02:10:02,580
like
 

6651
02:10:02,580 --> 02:10:03,709
like
um

6652
02:10:03,709 --> 02:10:03,719
um
 

6653
02:10:03,719 --> 02:10:06,050
um
like it's such a difficult problem to

6654
02:10:06,050 --> 02:10:06,060
like it's such a difficult problem to
 

6655
02:10:06,060 --> 02:10:09,589
like it's such a difficult problem to
solve now of course like bias and so on

6656
02:10:09,589 --> 02:10:09,599
solve now of course like bias and so on
 

6657
02:10:09,599 --> 02:10:11,030
solve now of course like bias and so on
like there's a little hanging fruit

6658
02:10:11,030 --> 02:10:11,040
like there's a little hanging fruit
 

6659
02:10:11,040 --> 02:10:12,649
like there's a little hanging fruit
which I think was a lot of people are

6660
02:10:12,649 --> 02:10:12,659
which I think was a lot of people are
 

6661
02:10:12,659 --> 02:10:15,470
which I think was a lot of people are
focused on but then it becomes like

6662
02:10:15,470 --> 02:10:15,480
focused on but then it becomes like
 

6663
02:10:15,480 --> 02:10:16,850
focused on but then it becomes like
subtle stuff

6664
02:10:16,850 --> 02:10:16,860
subtle stuff
 

6665
02:10:16,860 --> 02:10:19,010
subtle stuff
over time and it's very difficult to

6666
02:10:19,010 --> 02:10:19,020
over time and it's very difficult to
 

6667
02:10:19,020 --> 02:10:22,070
over time and it's very difficult to
know now if you come if you can also

6668
02:10:22,070 --> 02:10:22,080
know now if you come if you can also
 

6669
02:10:22,080 --> 02:10:24,169
know now if you come if you can also
completely remove the personality you

6670
02:10:24,169 --> 02:10:24,179
completely remove the personality you
 

6671
02:10:24,179 --> 02:10:25,070
completely remove the personality you
can completely remove the

6672
02:10:25,070 --> 02:10:25,080
can completely remove the
 

6673
02:10:25,080 --> 02:10:27,290
can completely remove the
personalization you can remove the

6674
02:10:27,290 --> 02:10:27,300
personalization you can remove the
 

6675
02:10:27,300 --> 02:10:29,330
personalization you can remove the
language aspect which is what I had been

6676
02:10:29,330 --> 02:10:29,340
language aspect which is what I had been
 

6677
02:10:29,340 --> 02:10:31,189
language aspect which is what I had been
arguing because I was like the language

6678
02:10:31,189 --> 02:10:31,199
arguing because I was like the language
 

6679
02:10:31,199 --> 02:10:32,930
arguing because I was like the language
is the disappointing aspect of social

6680
02:10:32,930 --> 02:10:32,940
is the disappointing aspect of social
 

6681
02:10:32,940 --> 02:10:34,250
is the disappointing aspect of social
robots anyway

6682
02:10:34,250 --> 02:10:34,260
robots anyway
 

6683
02:10:34,260 --> 02:10:36,470
robots anyway
but now we're reintroducing that because

6684
02:10:36,470 --> 02:10:36,480
but now we're reintroducing that because
 

6685
02:10:36,480 --> 02:10:40,370
but now we're reintroducing that because
it's it's now no longer disappointing so

6686
02:10:40,370 --> 02:10:40,380
it's it's now no longer disappointing so
 

6687
02:10:40,380 --> 02:10:42,290
it's it's now no longer disappointing so
I do think well

6688
02:10:42,290 --> 02:10:42,300
I do think well
 

6689
02:10:42,300 --> 02:10:44,810
I do think well
let's just start with the promise which

6690
02:10:44,810 --> 02:10:44,820
let's just start with the promise which
 

6691
02:10:44,820 --> 02:10:46,790
let's just start with the promise which
I think is very true which is that

6692
02:10:46,790 --> 02:10:46,800
I think is very true which is that
 

6693
02:10:46,800 --> 02:10:48,890
I think is very true which is that
racism is not a neutral thing but it is

6694
02:10:48,890 --> 02:10:48,900
racism is not a neutral thing but it is
 

6695
02:10:48,900 --> 02:10:50,810
racism is not a neutral thing but it is
the thing that we don't want in our

6696
02:10:50,810 --> 02:10:50,820
the thing that we don't want in our
 

6697
02:10:50,820 --> 02:10:54,229
the thing that we don't want in our
society like I it does not conform to my

6698
02:10:54,229 --> 02:10:54,239
society like I it does not conform to my
 

6699
02:10:54,239 --> 02:10:57,290
society like I it does not conform to my
values so if we agree that racism is bad

6700
02:10:57,290 --> 02:10:57,300
values so if we agree that racism is bad
 

6701
02:10:57,300 --> 02:11:01,370
values so if we agree that racism is bad
I do think that it has to be the company

6702
02:11:01,370 --> 02:11:01,380
I do think that it has to be the company
 

6703
02:11:01,380 --> 02:11:04,310
I do think that it has to be the company
because the pro I mean

6704
02:11:04,310 --> 02:11:04,320
because the pro I mean
 

6705
02:11:04,320 --> 02:11:07,790
because the pro I mean
it might not be possible and companies

6706
02:11:07,790 --> 02:11:07,800
it might not be possible and companies
 

6707
02:11:07,800 --> 02:11:10,430
it might not be possible and companies
might have to put out products that

6708
02:11:10,430 --> 02:11:10,440
might have to put out products that
 

6709
02:11:10,440 --> 02:11:12,410
might have to put out products that
where they're taking risks and they

6710
02:11:12,410 --> 02:11:12,420
where they're taking risks and they
 

6711
02:11:12,420 --> 02:11:15,050
where they're taking risks and they
might get slammed by consumers and they

6712
02:11:15,050 --> 02:11:15,060
might get slammed by consumers and they
 

6713
02:11:15,060 --> 02:11:16,910
might get slammed by consumers and they
might have to adjust I don't know like

6714
02:11:16,910 --> 02:11:16,920
might have to adjust I don't know like
 

6715
02:11:16,920 --> 02:11:18,290
might have to adjust I don't know like
how this is going to work in the market

6716
02:11:18,290 --> 02:11:18,300
how this is going to work in the market
 

6717
02:11:18,300 --> 02:11:20,450
how this is going to work in the market
I have opinions about how it should work

6718
02:11:20,450 --> 02:11:20,460
I have opinions about how it should work
 

6719
02:11:20,460 --> 02:11:23,390
I have opinions about how it should work
but it is on the company and the danger

6720
02:11:23,390 --> 02:11:23,400
but it is on the company and the danger
 

6721
02:11:23,400 --> 02:11:24,589
but it is on the company and the danger
with

6722
02:11:24,589 --> 02:11:24,599
with
 

6723
02:11:24,599 --> 02:11:27,229
with
robots is that they can entrench this

6724
02:11:27,229 --> 02:11:27,239
robots is that they can entrench this
 

6725
02:11:27,239 --> 02:11:28,669
robots is that they can entrench this
stuff it's not like

6726
02:11:28,669 --> 02:11:28,679
stuff it's not like
 

6727
02:11:28,679 --> 02:11:33,229
stuff it's not like
your Racist uncle who you can have a

6728
02:11:33,229 --> 02:11:33,239
your Racist uncle who you can have a
 

6729
02:11:33,239 --> 02:11:34,970
your Racist uncle who you can have a
conversation with

6730
02:11:34,970 --> 02:11:34,980
conversation with
 

6731
02:11:34,980 --> 02:11:38,149
conversation with
and put things into context maybe with

6732
02:11:38,149 --> 02:11:38,159
and put things into context maybe with
 

6733
02:11:38,159 --> 02:11:40,189
and put things into context maybe with
that yeah or who who might change over

6734
02:11:40,189 --> 02:11:40,199
that yeah or who who might change over
 

6735
02:11:40,199 --> 02:11:43,189
that yeah or who who might change over
time with more experience a robot really

6736
02:11:43,189 --> 02:11:43,199
time with more experience a robot really
 

6737
02:11:43,199 --> 02:11:44,830
time with more experience a robot really
just like

6738
02:11:44,830 --> 02:11:44,840
just like
 

6739
02:11:44,840 --> 02:11:47,390
just like
regurgitates things entrenches them

6740
02:11:47,390 --> 02:11:47,400
regurgitates things entrenches them
 

6741
02:11:47,400 --> 02:11:50,270
regurgitates things entrenches them
could influence other people

6742
02:11:50,270 --> 02:11:50,280
could influence other people
 

6743
02:11:50,280 --> 02:11:54,709
could influence other people
and I mean I think that's terrible well

6744
02:11:54,709 --> 02:11:54,719
and I mean I think that's terrible well
 

6745
02:11:54,719 --> 02:11:56,089
and I mean I think that's terrible well
I think there's a difficult challenge

6746
02:11:56,089 --> 02:11:56,099
I think there's a difficult challenge
 

6747
02:11:56,099 --> 02:11:58,490
I think there's a difficult challenge
here is because even the premise you

6748
02:11:58,490 --> 02:11:58,500
here is because even the premise you
 

6749
02:11:58,500 --> 02:12:00,770
here is because even the premise you
started with that essentially racism is

6750
02:12:00,770 --> 02:12:00,780
started with that essentially racism is
 

6751
02:12:00,780 --> 02:12:02,750
started with that essentially racism is
bad

6752
02:12:02,750 --> 02:12:02,760
bad
 

6753
02:12:02,760 --> 02:12:04,609
bad
um I think we live in a society today

6754
02:12:04,609 --> 02:12:04,619
um I think we live in a society today
 

6755
02:12:04,619 --> 02:12:07,250
um I think we live in a society today
where the definition of racism is

6756
02:12:07,250 --> 02:12:07,260
where the definition of racism is
 

6757
02:12:07,260 --> 02:12:09,770
where the definition of racism is
different between different people some

6758
02:12:09,770 --> 02:12:09,780
different between different people some
 

6759
02:12:09,780 --> 02:12:11,629
different between different people some
people say that it's not enough not to

6760
02:12:11,629 --> 02:12:11,639
people say that it's not enough not to
 

6761
02:12:11,639 --> 02:12:13,010
people say that it's not enough not to
be racist some people say you have to be

6762
02:12:13,010 --> 02:12:13,020
be racist some people say you have to be
 

6763
02:12:13,020 --> 02:12:15,770
be racist some people say you have to be
anti-racist so you have to you have to

6764
02:12:15,770 --> 02:12:15,780
anti-racist so you have to you have to
 

6765
02:12:15,780 --> 02:12:17,750
anti-racist so you have to you have to
have a robot that constantly calls out

6766
02:12:17,750 --> 02:12:17,760
have a robot that constantly calls out
 

6767
02:12:17,760 --> 02:12:19,370
have a robot that constantly calls out
like

6768
02:12:19,370 --> 02:12:19,380
like
 

6769
02:12:19,380 --> 02:12:23,470
like
calls you out on your uh implicit racism

6770
02:12:23,470 --> 02:12:23,480
calls you out on your uh implicit racism
 

6771
02:12:23,480 --> 02:12:26,629
calls you out on your uh implicit racism
I would love that I would love that

6772
02:12:26,629 --> 02:12:26,639
I would love that I would love that
 

6773
02:12:26,639 --> 02:12:29,750
I would love that I would love that
robot but like maybe it maybe it's these

6774
02:12:29,750 --> 02:12:29,760
robot but like maybe it maybe it's these
 

6775
02:12:29,760 --> 02:12:31,250
robot but like maybe it maybe it's these
well I don't know if you love it because

6776
02:12:31,250 --> 02:12:31,260
well I don't know if you love it because
 

6777
02:12:31,260 --> 02:12:33,350
well I don't know if you love it because
maybe you'll you'll see racism and

6778
02:12:33,350 --> 02:12:33,360
maybe you'll you'll see racism and
 

6779
02:12:33,360 --> 02:12:35,089
maybe you'll you'll see racism and
things that aren't racist and then

6780
02:12:35,089 --> 02:12:35,099
things that aren't racist and then
 

6781
02:12:35,099 --> 02:12:38,209
things that aren't racist and then
you're arguing with a robot your robot

6782
02:12:38,209 --> 02:12:38,219
you're arguing with a robot your robot
 

6783
02:12:38,219 --> 02:12:40,669
you're arguing with a robot your robot
starts going to races I'm not I'm not

6784
02:12:40,669 --> 02:12:40,679
starts going to races I'm not I'm not
 

6785
02:12:40,679 --> 02:12:43,250
starts going to races I'm not I'm not
exactly sure that I mean it's a it's a

6786
02:12:43,250 --> 02:12:43,260
exactly sure that I mean it's a it's a
 

6787
02:12:43,260 --> 02:12:45,890
exactly sure that I mean it's a it's a
tricky thing I guess I'm saying that um

6788
02:12:45,890 --> 02:12:45,900
tricky thing I guess I'm saying that um
 

6789
02:12:45,900 --> 02:12:49,430
tricky thing I guess I'm saying that um
the line is not obvious especially in

6790
02:12:49,430 --> 02:12:49,440
the line is not obvious especially in
 

6791
02:12:49,440 --> 02:12:51,950
the line is not obvious especially in
this heated discussion where we have a

6792
02:12:51,950 --> 02:12:51,960
this heated discussion where we have a
 

6793
02:12:51,960 --> 02:12:54,350
this heated discussion where we have a
lot of identity politics of what what is

6794
02:12:54,350 --> 02:12:54,360
lot of identity politics of what what is
 

6795
02:12:54,360 --> 02:12:55,910
lot of identity politics of what what is
harmful to different groups and so on

6796
02:12:55,910 --> 02:12:55,920
harmful to different groups and so on
 

6797
02:12:55,920 --> 02:12:59,990
harmful to different groups and so on
yeah it feels diff it feels like a

6798
02:12:59,990 --> 02:13:00,000
yeah it feels diff it feels like a
 

6799
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:02,450
yeah it feels diff it feels like a
the broader question here is should a

6800
02:13:02,450 --> 02:13:02,460
the broader question here is should a
 

6801
02:13:02,460 --> 02:13:05,930
the broader question here is should a
social robotics company be solving

6802
02:13:05,930 --> 02:13:05,940
social robotics company be solving
 

6803
02:13:05,940 --> 02:13:09,229
social robotics company be solving
or being part of solving the issues of

6804
02:13:09,229 --> 02:13:09,239
or being part of solving the issues of
 

6805
02:13:09,239 --> 02:13:11,510
or being part of solving the issues of
society well okay I think it's the same

6806
02:13:11,510 --> 02:13:11,520
society well okay I think it's the same
 

6807
02:13:11,520 --> 02:13:15,410
society well okay I think it's the same
question as should I as an individual be

6808
02:13:15,410 --> 02:13:15,420
question as should I as an individual be
 

6809
02:13:15,420 --> 02:13:18,890
question as should I as an individual be
responsible for knowing everything in

6810
02:13:18,890 --> 02:13:18,900
responsible for knowing everything in
 

6811
02:13:18,900 --> 02:13:20,629
responsible for knowing everything in
advance and saying all the right things

6812
02:13:20,629 --> 02:13:20,639
advance and saying all the right things
 

6813
02:13:20,639 --> 02:13:23,950
advance and saying all the right things
and the answer to that is

6814
02:13:23,950 --> 02:13:23,960
and the answer to that is
 

6815
02:13:23,960 --> 02:13:28,129
and the answer to that is
yes I am responsible

6816
02:13:28,129 --> 02:13:28,139
yes I am responsible
 

6817
02:13:28,139 --> 02:13:31,010
yes I am responsible
but I'm not going to get it perfect and

6818
02:13:31,010 --> 02:13:31,020
but I'm not going to get it perfect and
 

6819
02:13:31,020 --> 02:13:32,510
but I'm not going to get it perfect and
then the question is how do we deal with

6820
02:13:32,510 --> 02:13:32,520
then the question is how do we deal with
 

6821
02:13:32,520 --> 02:13:36,290
then the question is how do we deal with
that and so as a person how I aspire to

6822
02:13:36,290 --> 02:13:36,300
that and so as a person how I aspire to
 

6823
02:13:36,300 --> 02:13:38,990
that and so as a person how I aspire to
deal with that is

6824
02:13:38,990 --> 02:13:39,000
deal with that is
 

6825
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:41,030
deal with that is
when I do inevitably make a mistake

6826
02:13:41,030 --> 02:13:41,040
when I do inevitably make a mistake
 

6827
02:13:41,040 --> 02:13:43,490
when I do inevitably make a mistake
because I have blind spots

6828
02:13:43,490 --> 02:13:43,500
because I have blind spots
 

6829
02:13:43,500 --> 02:13:45,589
because I have blind spots
and people get angry

6830
02:13:45,589 --> 02:13:45,599
and people get angry
 

6831
02:13:45,599 --> 02:13:47,930
and people get angry
I don't take that personally and I

6832
02:13:47,930 --> 02:13:47,940
I don't take that personally and I
 

6833
02:13:47,940 --> 02:13:51,109
I don't take that personally and I
listen to what's behind the anger and it

6834
02:13:51,109 --> 02:13:51,119
listen to what's behind the anger and it
 

6835
02:13:51,119 --> 02:13:52,910
listen to what's behind the anger and it
can even happen that like maybe I'll

6836
02:13:52,910 --> 02:13:52,920
can even happen that like maybe I'll
 

6837
02:13:52,920 --> 02:13:55,010
can even happen that like maybe I'll
tweet something that's well intentioned

6838
02:13:55,010 --> 02:13:55,020
tweet something that's well intentioned
 

6839
02:13:55,020 --> 02:13:56,689
tweet something that's well intentioned
and

6840
02:13:56,689 --> 02:13:56,699
and
 

6841
02:13:56,699 --> 02:13:59,089
and
one you know one group of people starts

6842
02:13:59,089 --> 02:13:59,099
one you know one group of people starts
 

6843
02:13:59,099 --> 02:14:01,189
one you know one group of people starts
yelling at me and then I change it the

6844
02:14:01,189 --> 02:14:01,199
yelling at me and then I change it the
 

6845
02:14:01,199 --> 02:14:02,569
yelling at me and then I change it the
way that they said and then another

6846
02:14:02,569 --> 02:14:02,579
way that they said and then another
 

6847
02:14:02,579 --> 02:14:03,950
way that they said and then another
group of people starts yelling at me

6848
02:14:03,950 --> 02:14:03,960
group of people starts yelling at me
 

6849
02:14:03,960 --> 02:14:05,569
group of people starts yelling at me
which has happened this this happened to

6850
02:14:05,569 --> 02:14:05,579
which has happened this this happened to
 

6851
02:14:05,579 --> 02:14:07,430
which has happened this this happened to
me actually

6852
02:14:07,430 --> 02:14:07,440
me actually
 

6853
02:14:07,440 --> 02:14:10,189
me actually
um around in my talks I talk about

6854
02:14:10,189 --> 02:14:10,199
um around in my talks I talk about
 

6855
02:14:10,199 --> 02:14:12,709
um around in my talks I talk about
robots that are used in autism therapy

6856
02:14:12,709 --> 02:14:12,719
robots that are used in autism therapy
 

6857
02:14:12,719 --> 02:14:15,229
robots that are used in autism therapy
and so whether to say a child with

6858
02:14:15,229 --> 02:14:15,239
and so whether to say a child with
 

6859
02:14:15,239 --> 02:14:18,109
and so whether to say a child with
autism or an autistic child is super

6860
02:14:18,109 --> 02:14:18,119
autism or an autistic child is super
 

6861
02:14:18,119 --> 02:14:20,569
autism or an autistic child is super
controversial and a lot of autistic

6862
02:14:20,569 --> 02:14:20,579
controversial and a lot of autistic
 

6863
02:14:20,579 --> 02:14:22,069
controversial and a lot of autistic
people prefer to be referred to as

6864
02:14:22,069 --> 02:14:22,079
people prefer to be referred to as
 

6865
02:14:22,079 --> 02:14:24,050
people prefer to be referred to as
autistic people and a lot of parents of

6866
02:14:24,050 --> 02:14:24,060
autistic people and a lot of parents of
 

6867
02:14:24,060 --> 02:14:26,569
autistic people and a lot of parents of
autistic children prefer child with

6868
02:14:26,569 --> 02:14:26,579
autistic children prefer child with
 

6869
02:14:26,579 --> 02:14:29,689
autistic children prefer child with
autism and then there's they disagree so

6870
02:14:29,689 --> 02:14:29,699
autism and then there's they disagree so
 

6871
02:14:29,699 --> 02:14:32,450
autism and then there's they disagree so
so I've gotten yelled at from both sides

6872
02:14:32,450 --> 02:14:32,460
so I've gotten yelled at from both sides
 

6873
02:14:32,460 --> 02:14:34,970
so I've gotten yelled at from both sides
and I think I'm still resp I'm

6874
02:14:34,970 --> 02:14:34,980
and I think I'm still resp I'm
 

6875
02:14:34,980 --> 02:14:36,830
and I think I'm still resp I'm
responsible even if I can't get it right

6876
02:14:36,830 --> 02:14:36,840
responsible even if I can't get it right
 

6877
02:14:36,840 --> 02:14:38,510
responsible even if I can't get it right
I don't know if that makes sense like

6878
02:14:38,510 --> 02:14:38,520
I don't know if that makes sense like
 

6879
02:14:38,520 --> 02:14:42,169
I don't know if that makes sense like
it's a responsibility thing

6880
02:14:42,169 --> 02:14:42,179

 

6881
02:14:42,179 --> 02:14:44,569

and I'm I can be as well intentioned as

6882
02:14:44,569 --> 02:14:44,579
and I'm I can be as well intentioned as
 

6883
02:14:44,579 --> 02:14:45,890
and I'm I can be as well intentioned as
I want and I'm still going to make

6884
02:14:45,890 --> 02:14:45,900
I want and I'm still going to make
 

6885
02:14:45,900 --> 02:14:48,169
I want and I'm still going to make
mistakes and that is part of the

6886
02:14:48,169 --> 02:14:48,179
mistakes and that is part of the
 

6887
02:14:48,179 --> 02:14:50,030
mistakes and that is part of the
existing power structures that exist and

6888
02:14:50,030 --> 02:14:50,040
existing power structures that exist and
 

6889
02:14:50,040 --> 02:14:51,830
existing power structures that exist and
that's something that I accept and you

6890
02:14:51,830 --> 02:14:51,840
that's something that I accept and you
 

6891
02:14:51,840 --> 02:14:53,390
that's something that I accept and you
accept being attacked from both sides

6892
02:14:53,390 --> 02:14:53,400
accept being attacked from both sides
 

6893
02:14:53,400 --> 02:14:55,189
accept being attacked from both sides
and grow from it and learn from it yeah

6894
02:14:55,189 --> 02:14:55,199
and grow from it and learn from it yeah
 

6895
02:14:55,199 --> 02:14:58,010
and grow from it and learn from it yeah
but the the danger is that after being

6896
02:14:58,010 --> 02:14:58,020
but the the danger is that after being
 

6897
02:14:58,020 --> 02:15:00,589
but the the danger is that after being
attacked assume you don't get canceled

6898
02:15:00,589 --> 02:15:00,599
attacked assume you don't get canceled
 

6899
02:15:00,599 --> 02:15:03,709
attacked assume you don't get canceled
AKA completely removed from your ability

6900
02:15:03,709 --> 02:15:03,719
AKA completely removed from your ability
 

6901
02:15:03,719 --> 02:15:05,689
AKA completely removed from your ability
to to tweet

6902
02:15:05,689 --> 02:15:05,699
to to tweet
 

6903
02:15:05,699 --> 02:15:09,950
to to tweet
uh you might become jaded and not want

6904
02:15:09,950 --> 02:15:09,960
uh you might become jaded and not want
 

6905
02:15:09,960 --> 02:15:12,530
uh you might become jaded and not want
to talk about autism anymore I don't and

6906
02:15:12,530 --> 02:15:12,540
to talk about autism anymore I don't and
 

6907
02:15:12,540 --> 02:15:14,990
to talk about autism anymore I don't and
I didn't I mean it's happened to me and

6908
02:15:14,990 --> 02:15:15,000
I didn't I mean it's happened to me and
 

6909
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:16,850
I didn't I mean it's happened to me and
that's what I did was I listened to

6910
02:15:16,850 --> 02:15:16,860
that's what I did was I listened to
 

6911
02:15:16,860 --> 02:15:19,189
that's what I did was I listened to
those sides and I chose

6912
02:15:19,189 --> 02:15:19,199
those sides and I chose
 

6913
02:15:19,199 --> 02:15:21,530
those sides and I chose
I tried to get information

6914
02:15:21,530 --> 02:15:21,540
I tried to get information
 

6915
02:15:21,540 --> 02:15:25,310
I tried to get information
and then I I decided that I was going to

6916
02:15:25,310 --> 02:15:25,320
and then I I decided that I was going to
 

6917
02:15:25,320 --> 02:15:29,149
and then I I decided that I was going to
use autistic children

6918
02:15:29,149 --> 02:15:29,159

 

6919
02:15:29,159 --> 02:15:30,890

and now moving forward with that like I

6920
02:15:30,890 --> 02:15:30,900
and now moving forward with that like I
 

6921
02:15:30,900 --> 02:15:32,689
and now moving forward with that like I
don't know for now right for now yeah

6922
02:15:32,689 --> 02:15:32,699
don't know for now right for now yeah
 

6923
02:15:32,699 --> 02:15:34,189
don't know for now right for now yeah
until until I get updated information

this is ultimately a question about

02:16:55,190 --> 02:16:55,200
this is ultimately a question about

02:16:55,200 --> 02:16:57,469
this is ultimately a question about
leadership honestly like the way that I

the thing that bothers me about

6998
02:17:03,070 --> 02:17:03,080
the thing that bothers me about
 

6999
02:17:03,080 --> 02:17:05,270
the thing that bothers me about
institutions and a lot of people who run

7000
02:17:05,270 --> 02:17:05,280
institutions and a lot of people who run
 

7001
02:17:05,280 --> 02:17:07,429
institutions and a lot of people who run
current institutions

7002
02:17:07,429 --> 02:17:07,439
current institutions
 

7003
02:17:07,439 --> 02:17:10,250
current institutions
is that their main focus is protecting

7004
02:17:10,250 --> 02:17:10,260
is that their main focus is protecting
 

7005
02:17:10,260 --> 02:17:11,810
is that their main focus is protecting
the institution or protecting themselves

7006
02:17:11,810 --> 02:17:11,820
the institution or protecting themselves
 

7007
02:17:11,820 --> 02:17:13,849
the institution or protecting themselves
personally that is bad leadership

7008
02:17:13,849 --> 02:17:13,859
personally that is bad leadership
 

7009
02:17:13,859 --> 02:17:15,290
personally that is bad leadership
because it means you cannot have

7010
02:17:15,290 --> 02:17:15,300
because it means you cannot have
 

7011
02:17:15,300 --> 02:17:18,830
because it means you cannot have
integrity you cannot lead with integrity

7012
02:17:18,830 --> 02:17:18,840
integrity you cannot lead with integrity
 

7013
02:17:18,840 --> 02:17:20,570
integrity you cannot lead with integrity
and it makes sense because like

7014
02:17:20,570 --> 02:17:20,580
and it makes sense because like
 

7015
02:17:20,580 --> 02:17:22,490
and it makes sense because like
obviously if you're the type of leader

7016
02:17:22,490 --> 02:17:22,500
obviously if you're the type of leader
 

7017
02:17:22,500 --> 02:17:24,230
obviously if you're the type of leader
who immediately blows up the institution

7018
02:17:24,230 --> 02:17:24,240
who immediately blows up the institution
 

7019
02:17:24,240 --> 02:17:26,270
who immediately blows up the institution
you're leading then that doesn't exist

7020
02:17:26,270 --> 02:17:26,280
you're leading then that doesn't exist
 

7021
02:17:26,280 --> 02:17:27,950
you're leading then that doesn't exist
anymore and maybe that's why we don't

7022
02:17:27,950 --> 02:17:27,960
anymore and maybe that's why we don't
 

7023
02:17:27,960 --> 02:17:29,629
anymore and maybe that's why we don't
have any good leaders anymore because

7024
02:17:29,629 --> 02:17:29,639
have any good leaders anymore because
 

7025
02:17:29,639 --> 02:17:32,810
have any good leaders anymore because
they had integrity and they didn't put

7026
02:17:32,810 --> 02:17:32,820
they had integrity and they didn't put
 

7027
02:17:32,820 --> 02:17:35,810
they had integrity and they didn't put
you know the survival of the institution

running a company it's been I think
three years since the Jeffrey Epstein

7088
02:18:50,450 --> 02:18:50,460
three years since the Jeffrey Epstein
 

7089

the head of uh the media lab resigned
 

7093
02:18:58,019 --> 02:19:00,349
the head of uh the media lab resigned
and I think at that time you were an

7094
02:19:00,349 --> 02:19:00,359
and I think at that time you were an
 

7095
02:19:00,359 --> 02:19:02,570
and I think at that time you were an
opinion article about it

7096
02:19:02,570 --> 02:19:02,580
opinion article about it
 

7097
02:19:02,580 --> 02:19:04,969
opinion article about it
so just looking back a few years have

7098
02:19:04,969 --> 02:19:04,979
so just looking back a few years have
 

7099
02:19:04,979 --> 02:19:07,070
so just looking back a few years have
passed what

7100
02:19:07,070 --> 02:19:07,080
passed what
 

7101
02:19:07,080 --> 02:19:11,750
passed what
what have you learned about human nature

7102
02:19:11,750 --> 02:19:11,760
what have you learned about human nature
 

7103
02:19:11,760 --> 02:19:13,129
what have you learned about human nature
um

7104
02:19:13,129 --> 02:19:13,139
um
 

7105
02:19:13,139 --> 02:19:16,009
um
from the fact that somebody like Jeffrey

7106
02:19:16,009 --> 02:19:16,019
from the fact that somebody like Jeffrey
 

7107
02:19:16,019 --> 02:19:17,450
from the fact that somebody like Jeffrey
Epstein

7108
02:19:17,450 --> 02:19:17,460
Epstein
 

7109
02:19:17,460 --> 02:19:22,129
Epstein
found his way inside MIT

7110
02:19:22,129 --> 02:19:22,139

 

7111
02:19:22,139 --> 02:19:23,870

it's a really good question what have I

7112
02:19:23,870 --> 02:19:23,880
it's a really good question what have I
 

7113
02:19:23,880 --> 02:19:27,110
it's a really good question what have I
learned about human nature

7114
02:19:27,110 --> 02:19:27,120

 

7115
02:19:27,120 --> 02:19:30,290

I think

7116
02:19:30,290 --> 02:19:30,300

 

7117
02:19:30,300 --> 02:19:33,110

well there's

7118
02:19:33,110 --> 02:19:33,120
well there's
 

7119
02:19:33,120 --> 02:19:36,770
well there's
there's how did this problem come about

7120
02:19:36,770 --> 02:19:36,780
there's how did this problem come about
 

7121
02:19:36,780 --> 02:19:39,190
there's how did this problem come about
and then there's what was the reaction

7122
02:19:39,190 --> 02:19:39,200
and then there's what was the reaction
 

7123
02:19:39,200 --> 02:19:41,870
and then there's what was the reaction
to this problem and to it becoming

7124
02:19:41,870 --> 02:19:41,880
to this problem and to it becoming
 

7125
02:19:41,880 --> 02:19:43,070
to this problem and to it becoming
public

7126
02:19:43,070 --> 02:19:43,080
public
 

7127
02:19:43,080 --> 02:19:47,389
public
and in the reaction

7128
02:19:47,389 --> 02:19:47,399

 

7129
02:19:47,399 --> 02:19:53,990

the things I learned about human nature

7130
02:19:53,990 --> 02:19:54,000

 

7131
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:55,610

were that

7132
02:19:55,610 --> 02:19:55,620
were that
 

7133
02:19:55,620 --> 02:19:57,590
were that
sometimes cowards are worse than

7134
02:19:57,590 --> 02:19:57,600
sometimes cowards are worse than
 

7135
02:19:57,600 --> 02:20:00,490
sometimes cowards are worse than
[\h__\h]

7136
02:20:00,490 --> 02:20:00,500

 

7137
02:20:00,500 --> 02:20:03,469

02:20:06,050 --> 02:20:06,060
statement
 

7143
02:20:06,060 --> 02:20:09,349
statement
I think because the [\h__\h] at least

7144
02:20:09,349 --> 02:20:09,359
I think because the [\h__\h] at least

they have integrity in a way they're
 

7149
02:20:13,920 --> 02:20:15,530
they have integrity in a way they're
just living out their [\h__\h] values

7150
02:20:15,530 --> 02:20:15,540
just living out their [\h__\h] values
 

7151
02:20:15,540 --> 02:20:17,750
just living out their [\h__\h] values

back to

7156
02:20:20,870 --> 02:20:20,880
back to
 

7157
02:20:20,880 --> 02:20:23,690
back to
people protecting themselves over

02:20:23,690 --> 02:20:23,700
people protecting themselves over

02:21:13,250 --> 02:21:13,260
I was really disappointed that he
 

7199
02:21:13,260 --> 02:21:16,429

ignored that in favor of raising money

7200
02:21:16,429 --> 02:21:16,439

and I think that it was right for him to
 

7205
02:21:21,300 --> 02:21:22,969
and I think that it was right for him to
resign

7206

02:22:12,120 --> 02:22:13,309
there longer like why do they do this
why do the homeless people come in and

7246
02:22:13,309 --> 02:22:13,319
why do the homeless people come in and
 

7247
02:22:13,319 --> 02:22:15,889
why do the homeless people come in and
trash the bathroom and he was told it's

7248
02:22:15,889 --> 02:22:15,899

7249
02:22:15,899 --> 02:22:17,270
trash the bathroom and he was told it's
because it's the only thing in their

7250
02:22:17,270 --> 02:22:17,280
because it's the only thing in their
 

7251
02:22:17,280 --> 02:22:19,849
because it's the only thing in their
lives that they have control over

7252
02:22:19,849 --> 02:22:19,859
lives that they have control over
 

7253
02:22:19,859 --> 02:22:22,210
lives that they have control over
and I feel like

7254
02:22:22,210 --> 02:22:22,220
and I feel like
 

7255
02:22:22,220 --> 02:22:26,929
and I feel like
sometimes when it comes to

7256
02:22:26,929 --> 02:22:26,939

 

7257
02:22:26,939 --> 02:22:32,210

the response the

7258
02:22:32,210 --> 02:22:32,220

 

7259
02:22:32,220 --> 02:22:35,630

just the the mobbing response that

7260
02:22:35,630 --> 02:22:35,640
just the the mobbing response that
 

7261
02:22:35,640 --> 02:22:38,270
just the the mobbing response that
happens in the wake of

7262
02:22:38,270 --> 02:22:38,280
happens in the wake of
 

7263
02:22:38,280 --> 02:22:41,210
happens in the wake of
some harm that was caused

7264
02:22:41,210 --> 02:22:41,220
some harm that was caused
 

7265
02:22:41,220 --> 02:22:44,030
some harm that was caused
if you can't Target the person who

7266
02:22:44,030 --> 02:22:44,040
if you can't Target the person who
 

7267
02:22:44,040 --> 02:22:47,389
if you can't Target the person who
actually caused the harm who was Epstein

7268
02:22:47,389 --> 02:22:47,399
actually caused the harm who was Epstein
 

7269
02:22:47,399 --> 02:22:49,730
actually caused the harm who was Epstein
you will go as many circles out as you

7270
02:22:49,730 --> 02:22:49,740
you will go as many circles out as you
 

7271
02:22:49,740 --> 02:22:51,770
you will go as many circles out as you
can until you find the person that you

7272
02:22:51,770 --> 02:22:51,780
can until you find the person that you
 

7273
02:22:51,780 --> 02:22:53,210
can until you find the person that you
have power over and you have control

7274
02:22:53,210 --> 02:22:53,220
have power over and you have control
 

7275
02:22:53,220 --> 02:22:56,150
have power over and you have control
over and then you will trash that and it

7276
02:22:56,150 --> 02:22:56,160
over and then you will trash that and it
 

7277
02:22:56,160 --> 02:22:58,309
over and then you will trash that and it
makes sense that people do this it's

7278
02:22:58,309 --> 02:22:58,319
makes sense that people do this it's
 

7279

02:23:01,730 --> 02:23:01,740
course you're going to focus all your
 

7283
02:23:01,740 --> 02:23:03,950
course you're going to focus all your
energy because you feel helpless and

7284
02:23:03,950 --> 02:23:03,960
energy because you feel helpless and
 

7285

you're going to focus all of your energy
 

7291
02:23:10,080 --> 02:23:12,590
you're going to focus all of your energy
on someone who's so far removed from the

7292
02:23:12,590 --> 02:23:12,600
on someone who's so far removed from the
 

7293
02:23:12,600 --> 02:23:15,050
on someone who's so far removed from the
problem that that's not even an

7294
02:23:15,050 --> 02:23:15,060
problem that that's not even an
 

7295
02:23:15,060 --> 02:23:16,790
problem that that's not even an
efficient solution

7296
02:23:16,790 --> 02:23:16,800
efficient solution
 

7297
02:23:16,800 --> 02:23:20,150
efficient solution
and the problem is often the the first

7298
02:23:20,150 --> 02:23:20,160
and the problem is often the the first
 

7299
02:23:20,160 --> 02:23:21,650
and the problem is often the the first
person you find is the one that has

7405
02:25:29,580 --> 02:25:33,889
I think it's bad leadership do you
understand why Epstein was able to

7406
02:25:33,889 --> 02:25:33,899

 

7407
02:25:33,899 --> 02:25:34,730

um

7408
02:25:34,730 --> 02:25:34,740
um
 

7409
02:25:34,740 --> 02:25:37,250
um
outside of MIT he was able to make a lot

7410
02:25:37,250 --> 02:25:37,260
outside of MIT he was able to make a lot
 

7411
02:25:37,260 --> 02:25:38,690
outside of MIT he was able to make a lot
of friends

7412
02:25:38,690 --> 02:25:38,700
of friends
 

7413
02:25:38,700 --> 02:25:41,330
of friends
with a lot of powerful people does that

7414
02:25:41,330 --> 02:25:41,340
with a lot of powerful people does that
 

7415
02:25:41,340 --> 02:25:44,150
with a lot of powerful people does that
make sense to you why was he able to get

7416
02:25:44,150 --> 02:25:44,160
make sense to you why was he able to get
 

7417
02:25:44,160 --> 02:25:48,170
make sense to you why was he able to get
in these rooms befriend these people but

7423
02:25:53,340 --> 02:25:57,410
personally but I think a lot of them

02:25:57,410 --> 02:25:57,420
indirectly I know as being good people
 

7425

02:25:59,340 --> 02:26:01,610
smart people
why would they let Jeffrey Epstein into

7428
02:26:01,610 --> 02:26:01,620
why would they let Jeffrey Epstein into
 

7429
02:26:01,620 --> 02:26:03,889
why would they let Jeffrey Epstein into
the into their office have a discussion

7430
02:26:03,889 --> 02:26:03,899
the into their office have a discussion
 

7431
02:26:03,899 --> 02:26:05,870
the into their office have a discussion
with them what do you understand about

7432
02:26:05,870 --> 02:26:05,880
with them what do you understand about
 

7433
02:26:05,880 --> 02:26:09,050
with them what do you understand about
human nature from that well

7434
02:26:09,050 --> 02:26:09,060
human nature from that well
 

7435
02:26:09,060 --> 02:26:13,309
human nature from that well
so I never met Epstein or I mean

7436
02:26:13,309 --> 02:26:13,319
so I never met Epstein or I mean
 

7437
02:26:13,319 --> 02:26:14,870
so I never met Epstein or I mean
I've met some of the people who

7438
02:26:14,870 --> 02:26:14,880
I've met some of the people who
 

7439
02:26:14,880 --> 02:26:17,450
I've met some of the people who
interacted with him but I was never like

7440
02:26:17,450 --> 02:26:17,460
interacted with him but I was never like
 

7441
02:26:17,460 --> 02:26:20,750
interacted with him but I was never like
I never saw him in action I don't know

7442
02:26:20,750 --> 02:26:20,760
I never saw him in action I don't know
 

7443
02:26:20,760 --> 02:26:23,150
I never saw him in action I don't know
how charismatic he was or what that was

7444
02:26:23,150 --> 02:26:23,160
how charismatic he was or what that was
 

7445
02:26:23,160 --> 02:26:27,050
how charismatic he was or what that was
but I do think that sometimes the simple

7446
02:26:27,050 --> 02:26:27,060
but I do think that sometimes the simple
 

7447
02:26:27,060 --> 02:26:30,110
but I do think that sometimes the simple
answer is the more likely one and

7448
02:26:30,110 --> 02:26:30,120
answer is the more likely one and
 

7449
02:26:30,120 --> 02:26:32,330
answer is the more likely one and
from my understanding what he would do

7450
02:26:32,330 --> 02:26:32,340
from my understanding what he would do
 

7451
02:26:32,340 --> 02:26:33,770
from my understanding what he would do
is he was kind of a grift a social

7452
02:26:33,770 --> 02:26:33,780
is he was kind of a grift a social
 

7453
02:26:33,780 --> 02:26:35,330
is he was kind of a grift a social
grifter like

7454
02:26:35,330 --> 02:26:35,340
grifter like
 

7455
02:26:35,340 --> 02:26:37,849
grifter like

7467
02:26:50,280 --> 02:26:52,370
um
I think he just

7468
02:26:52,370 --> 02:26:52,380
I think he just
 

7469
02:26:52,380 --> 02:26:56,270
I think he just
convinced some people who were trusted

7470
02:26:56,270 --> 02:26:56,280
convinced some people who were trusted
 

7471
02:26:56,280 --> 02:27:00,290
convinced some people who were trusted
in a network that he was a great guy and

7472
02:27:00,290 --> 02:27:00,300
in a network that he was a great guy and
 

7473

that you know whatever I think at that
 

7475
02:27:02,280 --> 02:27:04,130
that you know whatever I think at that
point because at that point he had had

7476
02:27:04,130 --> 02:27:04,140
point because at that point he had had
 

7477
02:27:04,140 --> 02:27:07,550
point because at that point he had had
like a what a commission prior but it

if that's the case then they can surely
then a human being can use charisma

like the later thing and I think that

7566
02:28:48,349 --> 02:28:48,359
like the later thing and I think that
 

7567
02:28:48,359 --> 02:28:52,610
like the later thing and I think that
the story at that time was that

7568
02:28:52,610 --> 02:28:52,620
the story at that time was that
 

7569
02:28:52,620 --> 02:28:55,490
the story at that time was that
he didn't know she was underage and lava

7570

and or whatever it was mistaken Joey
always believed in Redemption for people

7574
02:28:59,030 --> 02:28:59,040

always believed in Redemption for people
and that people can change and that they

7576
02:29:00,950 --> 02:29:00,960

7587
02:29:11,640 --> 02:29:13,550
because of this thing
and because other people are vouching

7588
02:29:13,550 --> 02:29:13,560
and because other people are vouching
 

7589
02:29:13,560 --> 02:29:15,590

and
 

7593
02:29:16,920 --> 02:29:19,190
and
just to be clear we're now talking about

7594
02:29:19,190 --> 02:29:19,200
just to be clear we're now talking about
 

7595
02:29:19,200 --> 02:29:20,870
just to be clear we're now talking about
the set of people who I think Joey

7596
02:29:20,870 --> 02:29:20,880
the set of people who I think Joey
 

7597
02:29:20,880 --> 02:29:23,510
the set of people who I think Joey
belonged to who did not like go to the

7598
02:29:23,510 --> 02:29:23,520
belonged to who did not like go to the
 

7599
02:29:23,520 --> 02:29:25,309
belonged to who did not like go to the
island and have sex with underage girls

7600
02:29:25,309 --> 02:29:25,319
island and have sex with underage girls
 

7601
02:29:25,319 --> 02:29:26,870
island and have sex with underage girls
because that's a whole other set of

7602
02:29:26,870 --> 02:29:26,880
because that's a whole other set of
 

7603
02:29:26,880 --> 02:29:29,150
because that's a whole other set of
people who like

7604
02:29:29,150 --> 02:29:29,160
people who like
 

7605
02:29:29,160 --> 02:29:31,910
people who like
were powerful and like were part of that

7606
02:29:31,910 --> 02:29:31,920

7607
02:29:31,920 --> 02:29:34,010

Network and who knew and participated

7608
02:29:34,010 --> 02:29:34,020
Network and who knew and participated
 

7609
02:29:34,020 --> 02:29:36,290
Network and who knew and participated
and and so like I distinguish between

7610
02:29:36,290 --> 02:29:36,300
and and so like I distinguish between
 

7611
02:29:36,300 --> 02:29:39,110
and and so like I distinguish between
people who got taken in who didn't know

7612
02:29:39,110 --> 02:29:39,120
people who got taken in who didn't know
 

7613
02:29:39,120 --> 02:29:40,730
people who got taken in who didn't know
that that was happening and people who

7614
02:29:40,730 --> 02:29:40,740
that that was happening and people who
 

7615
02:29:40,740 --> 02:29:43,250
that that was happening and people who
knew I wonder what the different circles

7616
02:29:43,250 --> 02:29:43,260
knew I wonder what the different circles
 

7617
02:29:43,260 --> 02:29:45,770

of the things that I've learned about
 

7731
02:31:54,960 --> 02:31:57,130
of the things that I've learned about
neurodivergence is that

7732
02:31:57,130 --> 02:31:57,140
neurodivergence is that
 

7733
02:31:57,140 --> 02:32:02,090
neurodivergence is that
women are often

7734
02:32:02,090 --> 02:32:02,100

 

7735
02:32:02,100 --> 02:32:04,309

expected or taught to mask their

7736
02:32:04,309 --> 02:32:04,319
expected or taught to mask their
 

7737
02:32:04,319 --> 02:32:08,210
expected or taught to mask their
neurodivergence and kind of fit in and

7738
02:32:08,210 --> 02:32:08,220
neurodivergence and kind of fit in and
 

7739
02:32:08,220 --> 02:32:10,910
neurodivergence and kind of fit in and
men are accommodated and excused and I

7740
02:32:10,910 --> 02:32:10,920
men are accommodated and excused and I
 

7741
02:32:10,920 --> 02:32:13,790
men are accommodated and excused and I
don't think that

7742
02:32:13,790 --> 02:32:13,800
don't think that
 

7743
02:32:13,800 --> 02:32:15,950
don't think that
being neurodivergent gives you a license

7744
02:32:15,950 --> 02:32:15,960
being neurodivergent gives you a license
 

7745
02:32:15,960 --> 02:32:19,730
being neurodivergent gives you a license
to be an [\h__\h] like you can be a weird

7746
02:32:19,730 --> 02:32:19,740
to be an [\h__\h] like you can be a weird
 

7747
02:32:19,740 --> 02:32:22,309
to be an [\h__\h] like you can be a weird
person and you can still learn that it's

7748
02:32:22,309 --> 02:32:22,319
person and you can still learn that it's
 

7749
02:32:22,319 --> 02:32:24,590
person and you can still learn that it's
not okay to lick someone's arm

7750
02:32:24,590 --> 02:32:24,600
not okay to lick someone's arm

yeah there's it's a balance like women
 

7753
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:28,969
yeah there's it's a balance like women
should be allowed to be a little weirder

that harm others and I think we should

that harm others and I think we should
 

8127
02:39:42,240 --> 02:39:44,330
that harm others and I think we should
always hold people accountable for that

8128
02:39:44,330 --> 02:39:44,340
always hold people accountable for that
 

8129
02:39:44,340 --> 02:39:46,010
always hold people accountable for that
but holding someone accountable doesn't

8130
02:39:46,010 --> 02:39:46,020
but holding someone accountable doesn't
 

8131
02:39:46,020 --> 02:39:48,590
but holding someone accountable doesn't
mean saying that they're evil yeah

8132
02:39:48,590 --> 02:39:48,600
mean saying that they're evil yeah
 

8133
02:39:48,600 --> 02:39:50,870
mean saying that they're evil yeah
actually those those people usually

8134
02:39:50,870 --> 02:39:50,880
actually those those people usually
 

8135
02:39:50,880 --> 02:39:52,730
actually those those people usually
think they're doing good

8136
02:39:52,730 --> 02:39:52,740
think they're doing good
 

8137
02:39:52,740 --> 02:39:55,550
think they're doing good
yeah I mean aside from I don't know

8138
02:39:55,550 --> 02:39:55,560
yeah I mean aside from I don't know
 

8139
02:39:55,560 --> 02:39:58,429
yeah I mean aside from I don't know
maybe sociopaths like are specifically

8140
02:39:58,429 --> 02:39:58,439
maybe sociopaths like are specifically
 

8141
02:39:58,439 --> 02:40:00,590
maybe sociopaths like are specifically
trying to like harm people

8142
02:40:00,590 --> 02:40:00,600
trying to like harm people
 

8143
02:40:00,600 --> 02:40:03,950
trying to like harm people
but I think most people are trying to do

8144
02:40:03,950 --> 02:40:03,960
but I think most people are trying to do
 

8145
02:40:03,960 --> 02:40:06,349
but I think most people are trying to do
their best and if they're not

8146
02:40:06,349 --> 02:40:06,359
their best and if they're not
 

8147
02:40:06,359 --> 02:40:08,450
their best and if they're not
doing their best is because there's some

8148
02:40:08,450 --> 02:40:08,460
doing their best is because there's some
 

8149
02:40:08,460 --> 02:40:11,630
doing their best is because there's some
impediment or something in their past

8150
02:40:11,630 --> 02:40:11,640
impediment or something in their past
 

8151
02:40:11,640 --> 02:40:14,030
impediment or something in their past
so I I just I genuinely don't believe in

02:40:14,030 --> 02:40:14,040
so I I just I genuinely don't believe in
 

8153
02:40:14,040 --> 02:40:15,830
so I I just I genuinely don't believe in
good and evil people but I do believe in

8154
02:40:15,830 --> 02:40:15,840
good and evil people but I do believe in
 

8155
02:40:15,840 --> 02:40:18,650
good and evil people but I do believe in
like harmful and not harmful actions and

8156
02:40:18,650 --> 02:40:18,660
like harmful and not harmful actions and
 

8157
02:40:18,660 --> 02:40:20,150
like harmful and not harmful actions and
so I don't know

8158
02:40:20,150 --> 02:40:20,160
so I don't know
 

8159
02:40:20,160 --> 02:40:22,309
so I don't know
like I don't care I don't care yeah

8161
02:40:22,319 --> 02:40:24,469
like I don't care I don't care yeah
she's a good person but if she

8162
02:40:24,469 --> 02:40:24,479
she's a good person but if she
 

8163
02:40:24,479 --> 02:40:26,570
she's a good person but if she
contributed to harm then she needs to be

8164
02:40:26,570 --> 02:40:26,580
contributed to harm then she needs to be
 

8165
02:40:26,580 --> 02:40:28,309
contributed to harm then she needs to be
accountable for that like that's my

8166
02:40:28,309 --> 02:40:28,319
accountable for that like that's my
 

8167
02:40:28,319 --> 02:40:29,929
accountable for that like that's my
position I don't know what the facts of

8168
02:40:29,929 --> 02:40:29,939
position I don't know what the facts of
 

8169
02:40:29,939 --> 02:40:31,190
position I don't know what the facts of
the matter are it seems like she was

8170
02:40:31,190 --> 02:40:31,200
the matter are it seems like she was
 

8171
02:40:31,200 --> 02:40:33,290
the matter are it seems like she was
pretty close to the situation so it

8172
02:40:33,290 --> 02:40:33,300
pretty close to the situation so it
 

8173
02:40:33,300 --> 02:40:34,730
pretty close to the situation so it
doesn't seem very believable that she

8174
02:40:34,730 --> 02:40:34,740
doesn't seem very believable that she
 

8175
02:40:34,740 --> 02:40:37,250
doesn't seem very believable that she
was a victim but I don't know I wish I

8176
02:40:37,250 --> 02:40:37,260
was a victim but I don't know I wish I
 

8177
02:40:37,260 --> 02:40:38,809
was a victim but I don't know I wish I
have met Epstein

8178
02:40:38,809 --> 02:40:38,819
have met Epstein
 

8179
02:40:38,819 --> 02:40:40,490
have met Epstein
because something tells me he would just

8180
02:40:40,490 --> 02:40:40,500
because something tells me he would just
 

8181
02:40:40,500 --> 02:40:42,710
because something tells me he would just
be a regular person a charismatic person

8182
02:40:42,710 --> 02:40:42,720
be a regular person a charismatic person
 

8183
02:40:42,720 --> 02:40:46,250
be a regular person a charismatic person
like anybody else and that's a very dark

8184
02:40:46,250 --> 02:40:46,260
like anybody else and that's a very dark
 

8185
02:40:46,260 --> 02:40:48,590
like anybody else and that's a very dark
reality that we don't know which Among

8186
02:40:48,590 --> 02:40:48,600
reality that we don't know which Among
 

8187

yeah
which is a lot of people that interacted

8206
02:41:08,330 --> 02:41:08,340
which is a lot of people that interacted
 

8207
02:41:08,340 --> 02:41:10,070
which is a lot of people that interacted
with Epstein

8208
02:41:10,070 --> 02:41:10,080
with Epstein
 

8209
02:41:10,080 --> 02:41:12,349
with Epstein
then now have to

8210
02:41:12,349 --> 02:41:12,359
then now have to
 

8211
02:41:12,359 --> 02:41:15,110
then now have to
I mean if they're not destroyed by it

8212
02:41:15,110 --> 02:41:15,120
I mean if they're not destroyed by it
 

8213
02:41:15,120 --> 02:41:19,309

that experience was really interesting
 

8323
02:43:31,740 --> 02:43:34,190
that experience was really interesting
because I just

8324
02:43:34,190 --> 02:43:34,200
because I just
 

8325
02:43:34,200 --> 02:43:37,250

too era and I naively thought that when
 

8333
02:43:44,100 --> 02:43:45,889
too era and I naively thought that when
I reported that it would get taken care

8334
02:43:45,889 --> 02:43:45,899
I reported that it would get taken care
 

8335
02:43:45,899 --> 02:43:47,510
I reported that it would get taken care
of and then I had to go through the

8336
02:43:47,510 --> 02:43:47,520
of and then I had to go through the
 

8337
02:43:47,520 --> 02:43:49,550
of and then I had to go through the
whole reporting process at MIT and I

8338
02:43:49,550 --> 02:43:49,560
whole reporting process at MIT and I
 

8339
02:43:49,560 --> 02:43:52,849
whole reporting process at MIT and I
learned a lot about how institutions

8340
02:43:52,849 --> 02:43:52,859
learned a lot about how institutions
 

8341
02:43:52,859 --> 02:43:56,270
learned a lot about how institutions
really handle those things internally

8342
02:43:56,270 --> 02:43:56,280
really handle those things internally
 

8343
02:43:56,280 --> 02:43:58,429
really handle those things internally
um particularly situations where I

8344
02:43:58,429 --> 02:43:58,439
um particularly situations where I
 

8345
02:43:58,439 --> 02:43:59,750
um particularly situations where I
couldn't provide evidence that it

8346
02:43:59,750 --> 02:43:59,760
couldn't provide evidence that it
 

8347
02:43:59,760 --> 02:44:01,670
couldn't provide evidence that it
happened I had no reason to lie about it

8348
02:44:01,670 --> 02:44:01,680
happened I had no reason to lie about it
 

8349
02:44:01,680 --> 02:44:03,830
happened I had no reason to lie about it
but I had no evidence and so

8350
02:44:03,830 --> 02:44:03,840
but I had no evidence and so

8467
02:46:12,120 --> 02:46:13,730
my time but
I've heard from people who've been there

8468
02:46:13,730 --> 02:46:13,740
I've heard from people who've been there
 

8469
02:46:13,740 --> 02:46:15,889
I've heard from people who've been there
longer that it didn't know like MIT

8470
02:46:15,889 --> 02:46:15,899
longer that it didn't know like MIT
 

8471
02:46:15,899 --> 02:46:18,110
longer that it didn't know like MIT
didn't used to have a general counsel's

8472
02:46:18,110 --> 02:46:18,120
didn't used to have a general counsel's
 

8473
02:46:18,120 --> 02:46:19,969
didn't used to have a general counsel's
office they didn't used to have all this

8474
02:46:19,969 --> 02:46:19,979
office they didn't used to have all this
 

8475
02:46:19,979 --> 02:46:21,770
office they didn't used to have all this
corporate stuff and then they had to

8476
02:46:21,770 --> 02:46:21,780
corporate stuff and then they had to
 

8477
02:46:21,780 --> 02:46:24,950
corporate stuff and then they had to
create it as they got bigger and in the

8478
02:46:24,950 --> 02:46:24,960
create it as they got bigger and in the
 

8479
02:46:24,960 --> 02:46:27,889
create it as they got bigger and in the
era where such things are I guess deemed

8480
02:46:27,889 --> 02:46:27,899
era where such things are I guess deemed
 

8481
02:46:27,899 --> 02:46:30,050
era where such things are I guess deemed
necessary see I believe in the power of

8482
02:46:30,050 --> 02:46:30,060
necessary see I believe in the power of
 

8483
02:46:30,060 --> 02:46:32,750
necessary see I believe in the power of
individuals to like overthrow the thing

8484
02:46:32,750 --> 02:46:32,760
individuals to like overthrow the thing
 

8485

like these are the smartest people
they're way smarter than you yeah and

8512
02:47:06,290 --> 02:47:06,300
they're way smarter than you yeah and
 

8513
02:47:06,300 --> 02:47:07,790
they're way smarter than you yeah and
you're so dismissive but those

8514
02:47:07,790 --> 02:47:07,800
you're so dismissive but those
 

8515
02:47:07,800 --> 02:47:10,070
you're so dismissive but those
individuals I'm saying like the the

8516
02:47:10,070 --> 02:47:10,080
individuals I'm saying like the the
 

8517
02:47:10,080 --> 02:47:11,630
individuals I'm saying like the the
capacity

8518
02:47:11,630 --> 02:47:11,640
capacity
 

8519
02:47:11,640 --> 02:47:16,610
capacity
like the aura of the place still values

8520
02:47:16,610 --> 02:47:16,620
like the aura of the place still values
 

8521
02:47:16,620 --> 02:47:19,550
like the aura of the place still values
this the students and the faculty like I

8522
02:47:19,550 --> 02:47:19,560
this the students and the faculty like I
 

8523
02:47:19,560 --> 02:47:21,830
this the students and the faculty like I
I'm not I'm being awfully poetic about

8524
02:47:21,830 --> 02:47:21,840
I'm not I'm being awfully poetic about
 

8525
02:47:21,840 --> 02:47:24,349
I'm not I'm being awfully poetic about
it but what I mean is the administration

8526
02:47:24,349 --> 02:47:24,359
it but what I mean is the administration
 

8527
02:47:24,359 --> 02:47:26,809
it but what I mean is the administration
is the um

8528
02:47:26,809 --> 02:47:26,819
is the um
 

8529
02:47:26,819 --> 02:47:29,450
is the um
the froth at the top of the like the

8530
02:47:29,450 --> 02:47:29,460
the froth at the top of the like the
 

8531
02:47:29,460 --> 02:47:32,090
the froth at the top of the like the
waves the surface like they can be

8532
02:47:32,090 --> 02:47:32,100
waves the surface like they can be
 

8533
02:47:32,100 --> 02:47:35,590
waves the surface like they can be
removed and New Life can be brought in

8534
02:47:35,590 --> 02:47:35,600
removed and New Life can be brought in
 

8535
02:47:35,600 --> 02:47:38,090
removed and New Life can be brought in
that would keep to the spirit of the

8536
02:47:38,090 --> 02:47:38,100
that would keep to the spirit of the
 

8537
02:47:38,100 --> 02:47:40,250
that would keep to the spirit of the
place who decides on who to bring in

8538
02:47:40,250 --> 02:47:40,260
place who decides on who to bring in
 

8539
02:47:40,260 --> 02:47:43,510
place who decides on who to bring in
who's oh I see

8540
02:47:43,510 --> 02:47:43,520
who's oh I see
 

8541
02:47:43,520 --> 02:47:46,990
who's oh I see
uh I see but I I do think ultimately

8542
02:47:46,990 --> 02:47:47,000
uh I see but I I do think ultimately
 

8543
02:47:47,000 --> 02:47:50,150
uh I see but I I do think ultimately
especially in the era of social media

8544
02:47:50,150 --> 02:47:50,160
especially in the era of social media
 

8545
02:47:50,160 --> 02:47:52,790
especially in the era of social media
and so on

8546
02:47:52,790 --> 02:47:52,800

 

8547
02:47:52,800 --> 02:47:53,450

um

8548
02:47:53,450 --> 02:47:53,460
um
 

8549
02:47:53,460 --> 02:47:55,190
um
faculty and students have more and more

8550
02:47:55,190 --> 02:47:55,200
faculty and students have more and more
 

8551
02:47:55,200 --> 02:47:57,469
faculty and students have more and more
power there's more more of a voice I

8552
02:47:57,469 --> 02:47:57,479
power there's more more of a voice I
 

8553
02:47:57,479 --> 02:48:00,170
power there's more more of a voice I
suppose I hope so I really do

8554
02:48:00,170 --> 02:48:00,180
suppose I hope so I really do
 

8555
02:48:00,180 --> 02:48:02,570
suppose I hope so I really do
I don't see MIT going away anytime soon

8556
02:48:02,570 --> 02:48:02,580
I don't see MIT going away anytime soon
 

8557
02:48:02,580 --> 02:48:04,130
I don't see MIT going away anytime soon
and like I also don't think it's a

8558
02:48:04,130 --> 02:48:04,140
and like I also don't think it's a
 

8559
02:48:04,140 --> 02:48:05,870
and like I also don't think it's a
terrible place at all yeah it's an

8560
02:48:05,870 --> 02:48:05,880
terrible place at all yeah it's an
 

8561
02:48:05,880 --> 02:48:07,910
terrible place at all yeah it's an
amazing place and it's a but there's

8562
02:48:07,910 --> 02:48:07,920
amazing place and it's a but there's
 

8563
02:48:07,920 --> 02:48:10,790
amazing place and it's a but there's
different trajectories you can take yeah

8564
02:48:10,790 --> 02:48:10,800
different trajectories you can take yeah
 

8565
02:48:10,800 --> 02:48:13,550
different trajectories you can take yeah
and like and that has to do with a lot

8566
02:48:13,550 --> 02:48:13,560
and like and that has to do with a lot
 

8567
02:48:13,560 --> 02:48:16,130
and like and that has to do with a lot
of things including

8568
02:48:16,130 --> 02:48:16,140
of things including
 

8569
02:48:16,140 --> 02:48:18,050
of things including
um

8570
02:48:18,050 --> 02:48:18,060
um
 

8571
02:48:18,060 --> 02:48:21,170
um
does it is it stays even if we talk

8572
02:48:21,170 --> 02:48:21,180
does it is it stays even if we talk
 

8573
02:48:21,180 --> 02:48:23,090
does it is it stays even if we talk
about robotics it could be the capital

8574
02:48:23,090 --> 02:48:23,100
about robotics it could be the capital
 

8575
02:48:23,100 --> 02:48:25,010
about robotics it could be the capital
of the world in robotics

8576
02:48:25,010 --> 02:48:25,020
of the world in robotics
 

8577
02:48:25,020 --> 02:48:27,650
of the world in robotics
but currently if you want to be doing

8578
02:48:27,650 --> 02:48:27,660
but currently if you want to be doing
 

8579
02:48:27,660 --> 02:48:30,290
but currently if you want to be doing
the best AI work in the world you're

8580
02:48:30,290 --> 02:48:30,300
the best AI work in the world you're
 

8581
02:48:30,300 --> 02:48:34,370
the best AI work in the world you're
going to go to Google or Facebook

8582
02:48:34,370 --> 02:48:34,380
going to go to Google or Facebook
 

8583
02:48:34,380 --> 02:48:37,610
going to go to Google or Facebook
um or Tesla or apple or so on you're not

8584
02:48:37,610 --> 02:48:37,620
um or Tesla or apple or so on you're not
 

8585
02:48:37,620 --> 02:48:38,809
um or Tesla or apple or so on you're not
going to be you're not going to be in

8586
02:48:38,809 --> 02:48:38,819
going to be you're not going to be in
 

8587
02:48:38,819 --> 02:48:40,309
going to be you're not going to be in
MIT

8588
02:48:40,309 --> 02:48:40,319
MIT
 

8589
02:48:40,319 --> 02:48:43,130
MIT
and so that that has to do I think

8590
02:48:43,130 --> 02:48:43,140
and so that that has to do I think
 

8591
02:48:43,140 --> 02:48:46,969
and so that that has to do I think
that's basically has to do with

8592
02:48:46,969 --> 02:48:46,979
that's basically has to do with
 

8593
02:48:46,979 --> 02:48:47,750
that's basically has to do with
um

8594
02:48:47,750 --> 02:48:47,760
um
 

8595
02:48:47,760 --> 02:48:51,770
um
not allowing the the Brilliance of the

8596
02:48:51,770 --> 02:48:51,780
not allowing the the Brilliance of the
 

8597
02:48:51,780 --> 02:48:53,929
not allowing the the Brilliance of the
researchers to flourish

8598
02:48:53,929 --> 02:48:53,939
researchers to flourish
 

8599
02:48:53,939 --> 02:48:55,670
researchers to flourish
yeah people say it's about money but I

8600
02:48:55,670 --> 02:48:55,680
yeah people say it's about money but I
 

8601
02:48:55,680 --> 02:48:59,030
yeah people say it's about money but I
don't think it's about that at all like

8602
02:48:59,030 --> 02:48:59,040

 

8603
02:48:59,040 --> 02:49:00,889

sometimes you have more freedom and can

8604
02:49:00,889 --> 02:49:00,899
sometimes you have more freedom and can
 

8605
02:49:00,899 --> 02:49:02,150
sometimes you have more freedom and can
work on more interesting things in

8606
02:49:02,150 --> 02:49:02,160
work on more interesting things in
 

8607
02:49:02,160 --> 02:49:04,130
work on more interesting things in
companies that's what really where they

8608
02:49:04,130 --> 02:49:04,140
companies that's what really where they
 

8609
02:49:04,140 --> 02:49:05,870
companies that's what really where they
lose people yeah

8610
02:49:05,870 --> 02:49:05,880
lose people yeah
 

8611
02:49:05,880 --> 02:49:09,050
lose people yeah
and some the the freedom in all in in

8612
02:49:09,050 --> 02:49:09,060
and some the the freedom in all in in
 

8613
02:49:09,060 --> 02:49:10,849
and some the the freedom in all in in
all ways

8614
02:49:10,849 --> 02:49:10,859
all ways
 

8615
02:49:10,859 --> 02:49:12,770
all ways
which is why it's heartbreaking to get

8616
02:49:12,770 --> 02:49:12,780
which is why it's heartbreaking to get
 

8617
02:49:12,780 --> 02:49:14,270
which is why it's heartbreaking to get
like people like Richard stallman

8618
02:49:14,270 --> 02:49:14,280
like people like Richard stallman
 

8619
02:49:14,280 --> 02:49:16,190
like people like Richard stallman
there's such an interesting line because

8620
02:49:16,190 --> 02:49:16,200
there's such an interesting line because
 

8621
02:49:16,200 --> 02:49:19,330
there's such an interesting line because
like Christians Thomas a gigantic weirdo

8622
02:49:19,330 --> 02:49:19,340
like Christians Thomas a gigantic weirdo
 

8623
02:49:19,340 --> 02:49:21,950
like Christians Thomas a gigantic weirdo
that cross lines you shouldn't across

8624
02:49:21,950 --> 02:49:21,960
that cross lines you shouldn't across
 

8625
02:49:21,960 --> 02:49:24,710
that cross lines you shouldn't across
right but we don't want to draw too many

8626
02:49:24,710 --> 02:49:24,720
right but we don't want to draw too many
 

8627
02:49:24,720 --> 02:49:26,750
right but we don't want to draw too many
lines

8628
02:49:26,750 --> 02:49:26,760
lines
 

8629
02:49:26,760 --> 02:49:28,490
lines
this is the tricky thing there are

8630
02:49:28,490 --> 02:49:28,500
this is the tricky thing there are
 

8631
02:49:28,500 --> 02:49:30,710
this is the tricky thing there are
different types of lines in my opinion

8632
02:49:30,710 --> 02:49:30,720
different types of lines in my opinion
 

8633
02:49:30,720 --> 02:49:32,870
different types of lines in my opinion
but just your opinion because you have

8634
02:49:32,870 --> 02:49:32,880
but just your opinion because you have
 

8635
02:49:32,880 --> 02:49:35,030
but just your opinion because you have
strong lines you hold through but then

8636
02:49:35,030 --> 02:49:35,040
strong lines you hold through but then
 

8637
02:49:35,040 --> 02:49:38,090
strong lines you hold through but then
if Administration listens to every line

8638
02:49:38,090 --> 02:49:38,100
if Administration listens to every line
 

8639
02:49:38,100 --> 02:49:40,610
if Administration listens to every line
there's there's also power in drawing a

8640
02:49:40,610 --> 02:49:40,620
there's there's also power in drawing a
 

8641
02:49:40,620 --> 02:49:41,990
there's there's also power in drawing a
line

8642
02:49:41,990 --> 02:49:42,000
line
 

8643
02:49:42,000 --> 02:49:46,670
line
like and there's it becomes like a

8644
02:49:46,670 --> 02:49:46,680
like and there's it becomes like a
 

8645
02:49:46,680 --> 02:49:48,830
like and there's it becomes like a
little drug you have to find the right

8646
02:49:48,830 --> 02:49:48,840
little drug you have to find the right
 

8647
02:49:48,840 --> 02:49:51,410

balance licking somebody's arm is never

8648
02:49:51,410 --> 02:49:51,420
balance licking somebody's arm is never
 

8649
02:49:51,420 --> 02:49:54,230
balance licking somebody's arm is never
appropriate I think the biggest aspect

8650
02:49:54,230 --> 02:49:54,240
appropriate I think the biggest aspect
 

8651
02:49:54,240 --> 02:49:58,490
appropriate I think the biggest aspect
there is not uh owning it learning from

02:49:58,490 --> 02:49:58,500
there is not uh owning it learning from

8657
02:50:03,060 --> 02:50:04,969

when it happened like understanding

8658
02:50:04,969 --> 02:50:04,979
when it happened like understanding
 

8659
02:50:04,979 --> 02:50:07,610

the fact that this was like totally
 

8663
02:50:09,780 --> 02:50:13,790

different kinds of lines I think they're

8670
02:50:19,670 --> 02:50:19,680
different kinds of lines I think they're
 

8671
02:50:19,680 --> 02:50:21,950
different kinds of lines I think they're
a lot

8672
02:50:21,950 --> 02:50:21,960

 

8673
02:50:21,960 --> 02:50:24,770

so Stone and crossed lines that

8674
02:50:24,770 --> 02:50:24,780
so Stone and crossed lines that
 

8675
02:50:24,780 --> 02:50:27,170
so Stone and crossed lines that
essentially excluded a bunch of people

8676
02:50:27,170 --> 02:50:27,180
essentially excluded a bunch of people
 

8677
02:50:27,180 --> 02:50:29,870
essentially excluded a bunch of people
and created an environment where we

8678
02:50:29,870 --> 02:50:29,880
and created an environment where we
 

8679
02:50:29,880 --> 02:50:32,210
and created an environment where we

8680
02:50:32,210 --> 02:50:32,220

8682
02:50:34,130 --> 02:50:34,140
the benefit of because he made things
 

8683
02:50:34,140 --> 02:50:35,929
the benefit of because he made things
feel

8684
02:50:35,929 --> 02:50:35,939

8685
02:50:35,939 --> 02:50:38,990
feel
gross or even unsafe for people there

8686
02:50:38,990 --> 02:50:39,000
gross or even unsafe for people there
 

8687
02:50:39,000 --> 02:50:40,730
gross or even unsafe for people there
are lines that you can cross

8688
02:50:40,730 --> 02:50:40,740
are lines that you can cross
 

8689
02:50:40,740 --> 02:50:43,429
are lines that you can cross
where you're challenging an institution

8690
02:50:43,429 --> 02:50:43,439
where you're challenging an institution

02:50:48,469 --> 02:50:48,479
like I don't think he was intentionally
 

8695
02:50:48,479 --> 02:50:53,450
like I don't think he was intentionally
trying to cross a line or maybe maybe he

8696
02:50:53,450 --> 02:50:53,460
trying to cross a line or maybe maybe he
 

8697
02:50:53,460 --> 02:50:55,490
trying to cross a line or maybe maybe he
didn't care there are lines that you can

8698
02:50:55,490 --> 02:50:55,500
didn't care there are lines that you can
 

8699
02:50:55,500 --> 02:50:57,950
didn't care there are lines that you can
cross intentionally to move something

8700
02:50:57,950 --> 02:50:57,960
cross intentionally to move something
 

8701
02:50:57,960 --> 02:50:59,690
cross intentionally to move something
forward or to do the right thing like

8702
02:50:59,690 --> 02:50:59,700
forward or to do the right thing like
 

8703
02:50:59,700 --> 02:51:02,270
forward or to do the right thing like
when MIT was like you can't put an

02:51:02,270 --> 02:51:02,280
when MIT was like you can't put an
 

8705

when MIT was like you can't put an

8706
02:51:03,889 --> 02:51:03,899
all-gender restroom in the media lab
 

8707
02:51:03,899 --> 02:51:06,950
all-gender restroom in the media lab
because like something permits whatever

8708
02:51:06,950 --> 02:51:06,960
because like something permits whatever
 

8709
02:51:06,960 --> 02:51:09,770
because like something permits whatever
and Joey did it anyway that's a line you

8710
02:51:09,770 --> 02:51:09,780
and Joey did it anyway that's a line you
 

8711
02:51:09,780 --> 02:51:11,389
and Joey did it anyway that's a line you
can cross to make things actually better

8712
02:51:11,389 --> 02:51:11,399
can cross to make things actually better
 

8713
02:51:11,399 --> 02:51:13,130
can cross to make things actually better
for people and the line you're Crossing

8714
02:51:13,130 --> 02:51:13,140
for people and the line you're Crossing
 

8715
02:51:13,140 --> 02:51:15,770
for people and the line you're Crossing
is some arbitrary stupid rule that

8716
02:51:15,770 --> 02:51:15,780
is some arbitrary stupid rule that
 

8717
02:51:15,780 --> 02:51:17,929
is some arbitrary stupid rule that
people who don't want to take the risk

8718
02:51:17,929 --> 02:51:17,939
people who don't want to take the risk
 

8719
02:51:17,939 --> 02:51:19,630
people who don't want to take the risk
or like

8720
02:51:19,630 --> 02:51:19,640
or like
 

8721
02:51:19,640 --> 02:51:21,770
or like
yeah for sure you know what I mean no

8722
02:51:21,770 --> 02:51:21,780
yeah for sure you know what I mean no
 

8723

ultimately I think the thing you said is

8724
02:51:23,690 --> 02:51:23,700

8725
02:51:23,700 --> 02:51:27,110
ultimately I think the thing you said is
like cross lines in a way that doesn't

8726
02:51:27,110 --> 02:51:27,120
like cross lines in a way that doesn't
 

8727
02:51:27,120 --> 02:51:28,450
like cross lines in a way that doesn't
uh

uh
 

8729
02:51:28,460 --> 02:51:32,330
uh
uh alienate others so like for example

8730
02:51:32,330 --> 02:51:32,340
uh alienate others so like for example
 

8731
02:51:32,340 --> 02:51:35,330
uh alienate others so like for example

8734
02:51:37,730 --> 02:51:37,740
a suit often at MIT which sounds
 

8735
02:51:37,740 --> 02:51:40,790
a suit often at MIT which sounds
counter-intuitive but that's actually

8736
02:51:40,790 --> 02:51:40,800
counter-intuitive but that's actually
 

8737
02:51:40,800 --> 02:51:41,450
counter-intuitive but that's actually
um
