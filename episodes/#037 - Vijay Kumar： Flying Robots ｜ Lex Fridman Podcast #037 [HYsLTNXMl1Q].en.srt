00:03:48,409 --> 00:03:50,160
pick favorites or whatever but something
that just inspires you that you remember

164
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:50,170
that just inspires you that you remember
 

165
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:53,410
that just inspires you that you remember
well I think thing that I'm I'm most

166
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:53,420
well I think thing that I'm I'm most
 

167
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:55,210
well I think thing that I'm I'm most
proud of that my students have done is

168
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:55,220
proud of that my students have done is
 

169
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:58,420
proud of that my students have done is
really think about small UAVs that can

170
00:03:58,420 --> 00:03:58,430
really think about small UAVs that can
 

171
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:01,570
really think about small UAVs that can
maneuver and constrain spaces and in

172
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:01,580
maneuver and constrain spaces and in
 

173
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:03,280
maneuver and constrain spaces and in
particular their ability to coordinate

174
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:03,290
particular their ability to coordinate
 

175
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:05,020
particular their ability to coordinate
with each other and form

176
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:05,030
with each other and form
 

177
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:07,930
with each other and form
three-dimensional patterns so once you

178
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:07,940
three-dimensional patterns so once you
 

179
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:14,640
three-dimensional patterns so once you
can do that you can essentially create

180
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:14,650
can do that you can essentially create
 

181
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:17,740
can do that you can essentially create
3d objects in the sky and you can deform

182
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:17,750
3d objects in the sky and you can deform
 

183
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,240
3d objects in the sky and you can deform
these objects on the fly

184
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:19,250
these objects on the fly
 

185
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:22,779
these objects on the fly
so in some sense your toolbox of what

186
00:04:22,779 --> 00:04:22,789
so in some sense your toolbox of what
 

187
00:04:22,789 --> 00:04:25,350
so in some sense your toolbox of what
you can create has suddenly got enhanced

188
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:25,360
you can create has suddenly got enhanced
 

189
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,600
you can create has suddenly got enhanced
and before that we did the

190
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:28,610
and before that we did the
 

191
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:30,189
and before that we did the
two-dimensional version of this so we

192
00:04:30,189 --> 00:04:30,199
two-dimensional version of this so we
 

193
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:33,070
two-dimensional version of this so we
had ground robots forming patterns and

194
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:33,080
had ground robots forming patterns and
 

195
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,020
had ground robots forming patterns and
and so on so that that was not as

196
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:35,030
and so on so that that was not as
 

197
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:37,180
and so on so that that was not as
impressive it was not as beautiful but

198
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:37,190
impressive it was not as beautiful but
 

199
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:39,580
impressive it was not as beautiful but
if you do it in 3d suspended in midair

200
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:39,590
if you do it in 3d suspended in midair
 

201
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:42,490
if you do it in 3d suspended in midair
and you've got to go back to 2011 when

202
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:42,500
and you've got to go back to 2011 when
 

203
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,620
and you've got to go back to 2011 when
we did this now it's actually pretty

204
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:44,630
we did this now it's actually pretty
 

205
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:46,300
we did this now it's actually pretty
standard to do these things eight years

206
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:46,310
standard to do these things eight years
 

207
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:48,820
standard to do these things eight years
later but back then it was a big

208
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:48,830
later but back then it was a big
 

209
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,000
later but back then it was a big
accomplishment so the distributed

210
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,010
accomplishment so the distributed
 

211
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:53,950
accomplishment so the distributed
cooperation is where is what Beauty

212
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:53,960
cooperation is where is what Beauty
 

213
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,740
cooperation is where is what Beauty
emerges in your eyes I think beauty to

214
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:56,750
emerges in your eyes I think beauty to
 

215
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,600
emerges in your eyes I think beauty to
an engineer is very different from from

216
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:58,610
an engineer is very different from from
 

217
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:00,820
an engineer is very different from from
Beauty to you know someone who's looking

218
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:00,830
Beauty to you know someone who's looking
 

219
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:02,589
Beauty to you know someone who's looking
at robots from the outside if you will

220
00:05:02,589 --> 00:05:02,599
at robots from the outside if you will
 

221
00:05:02,599 --> 00:05:05,290
at robots from the outside if you will
yeah but what I meant there so before we

222
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:05,300
yeah but what I meant there so before we
 

223
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:09,070
yeah but what I meant there so before we
said that grand is associated with size

224
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:09,080
said that grand is associated with size
 

225
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:13,540
said that grand is associated with size
and another way of thinking about this

226
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:13,550
and another way of thinking about this
 

227
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:16,420
and another way of thinking about this
is just the physical shape and the idea

228
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:16,430
is just the physical shape and the idea
 

229
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:17,890
is just the physical shape and the idea
that you can get physical shapes in

230
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:17,900
that you can get physical shapes in
 

231
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,409
that you can get physical shapes in
midair and have them deform that's

232
00:05:20,409 --> 00:05:20,419
midair and have them deform that's
 

233
00:05:20,419 --> 00:05:22,900
midair and have them deform that's
beautiful but the individual components

234
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:22,910
beautiful but the individual components
 

235
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:25,020
beautiful but the individual components
the agility is beautiful too right

236
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:25,030
the agility is beautiful too right
 

237
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:27,550
the agility is beautiful too right
so then how quickly can you actually

238
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:27,560
so then how quickly can you actually
 

239
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,080
so then how quickly can you actually
manipulate these three-dimensional

240
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:29,090
manipulate these three-dimensional
 

241
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:31,360
manipulate these three-dimensional
shapes and the individual components yes

242
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:31,370
shapes and the individual components yes
 

243
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:34,990
shapes and the individual components yes
right oh by the way said UAV unmanned

244
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:35,000
right oh by the way said UAV unmanned
 

245
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,480
right oh by the way said UAV unmanned
aerial vehicle what was a good term for

246
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:37,490
aerial vehicle what was a good term for
 

247
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:42,460
aerial vehicle what was a good term for
drones UAVs quad copters is there a term

248
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:42,470
drones UAVs quad copters is there a term
 

249
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:44,890
drones UAVs quad copters is there a term
that's then being standardized I don't

250
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:44,900
that's then being standardized I don't
 

251
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,360
that's then being standardized I don't
know if that is everybody wants to use

252
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:46,370
know if that is everybody wants to use
 

253
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:49,000
know if that is everybody wants to use
the word drones and I often said there's

254
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,010
the word drones and I often said there's
 

255
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:51,159
the word drones and I often said there's
drones to me is a pejorative word it

256
00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:51,169
drones to me is a pejorative word it
 

257
00:05:51,169 --> 00:05:53,409
drones to me is a pejorative word it
signifies something that's that's dumb

258
00:05:53,409 --> 00:05:53,419
signifies something that's that's dumb
 

259
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:55,870
signifies something that's that's dumb
the pre program that does one little

260
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:55,880
the pre program that does one little
 

261
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,879
the pre program that does one little
thing and

262
00:05:56,879 --> 00:05:56,889
thing and
 

263
00:05:56,889 --> 00:05:59,459
thing and
to anything but drones so I actually

264
00:05:59,459 --> 00:05:59,469
to anything but drones so I actually
 

265
00:05:59,469 --> 00:06:01,170
to anything but drones so I actually
don't like that word but that's what

266
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:01,180
don't like that word but that's what
 

267
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:03,629
don't like that word but that's what
everybody uses you could call it

268
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:03,639
everybody uses you could call it
 

269
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:06,269
everybody uses you could call it
unpiloted and paladin ah but even

270
00:06:06,269 --> 00:06:06,279
unpiloted and paladin ah but even
 

271
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:08,159
unpiloted and paladin ah but even
unpiloted could be radio control could

272
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:08,169
unpiloted could be radio control could
 

273
00:06:08,169 --> 00:06:09,749
unpiloted could be radio control could
be remotely controls in many different

274
00:06:09,749 --> 00:06:09,759
be remotely controls in many different
 

275
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:12,749
be remotely controls in many different
ways and I think the right word is

276
00:06:12,749 --> 00:06:12,759
ways and I think the right word is
 

277
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:15,149
ways and I think the right word is
thinking about it is an aerial robot you

278
00:06:15,149 --> 00:06:15,159
thinking about it is an aerial robot you
 

279
00:06:15,159 --> 00:06:18,540
thinking about it is an aerial robot you
also say agile autonomous aerial robot

280
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:18,550
also say agile autonomous aerial robot
 

281
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:20,159
also say agile autonomous aerial robot
right yeah so agility is an attribute

282
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:20,169
right yeah so agility is an attribute
 

283
00:06:20,169 --> 00:06:23,429
right yeah so agility is an attribute
but they don't have to be so what

284
00:06:23,429 --> 00:06:23,439
but they don't have to be so what
 

285
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:25,499
but they don't have to be so what
biological system because you've also

286
00:06:25,499 --> 00:06:25,509
biological system because you've also
 

287
00:06:25,509 --> 00:06:27,269
biological system because you've also
drawn a lot of inspiration of those I've

288
00:06:27,269 --> 00:06:27,279
drawn a lot of inspiration of those I've
 

289
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:29,159
drawn a lot of inspiration of those I've
seen bees and ants that you've talked

290
00:06:29,159 --> 00:06:29,169
seen bees and ants that you've talked
 

291
00:06:29,169 --> 00:06:32,640
seen bees and ants that you've talked
about what living creatures have you

292
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:32,650
about what living creatures have you
 

293
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:35,519
about what living creatures have you
found to be most inspiring as an

294
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:35,529
found to be most inspiring as an
 

295
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:37,649
found to be most inspiring as an
engineer instructive in your work in

296
00:06:37,649 --> 00:06:37,659
engineer instructive in your work in
 

297
00:06:37,659 --> 00:06:41,969
engineer instructive in your work in
robotics to me so ants are really quite

298
00:06:41,969 --> 00:06:41,979
robotics to me so ants are really quite
 

299
00:06:41,979 --> 00:06:44,490
robotics to me so ants are really quite
incredible creatures right so you I mean

300
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:44,500
incredible creatures right so you I mean
 

301
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,820
incredible creatures right so you I mean
the individuals arguably are very simple

302
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:47,830
the individuals arguably are very simple
 

303
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:50,550
the individuals arguably are very simple
and how they're they're built and yet

304
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:50,560
and how they're they're built and yet
 

305
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,529
and how they're they're built and yet
they're incredibly resilient as a

306
00:06:52,529 --> 00:06:52,539
they're incredibly resilient as a
 

307
00:06:52,539 --> 00:06:55,140
they're incredibly resilient as a
population and as individuals they're

308
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:55,150
population and as individuals they're
 

309
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:58,260
population and as individuals they're
incredibly robust so you know if you

310
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:58,270
incredibly robust so you know if you
 

311
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:01,140
incredibly robust so you know if you
take an ant at six legs you remove one

312
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:01,150
take an ant at six legs you remove one
 

313
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:05,040
take an ant at six legs you remove one
like it still works just fine and it

314
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:05,050
like it still works just fine and it
 

315
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:07,230
like it still works just fine and it
moves along and I don't know that even

316
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:07,240
moves along and I don't know that even
 

317
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:10,409
moves along and I don't know that even
realizes it's lost alike so that's the

318
00:07:10,409 --> 00:07:10,419
realizes it's lost alike so that's the
 

319
00:07:10,419 --> 00:07:12,589
realizes it's lost alike so that's the
robustness at the individual ant level

320
00:07:12,589 --> 00:07:12,599
robustness at the individual ant level
 

321
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:14,879
robustness at the individual ant level
but then you you look about this

322
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:14,889
but then you you look about this
 

323
00:07:14,889 --> 00:07:17,040
but then you you look about this
instinct for self-preservation of the

324
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:17,050
instinct for self-preservation of the
 

325
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:19,019
instinct for self-preservation of the
colonies and they adapt in so many

326
00:07:19,019 --> 00:07:19,029
colonies and they adapt in so many
 

327
00:07:19,029 --> 00:07:22,649
colonies and they adapt in so many
amazing ways you know transcending

328
00:07:22,649 --> 00:07:22,659
amazing ways you know transcending
 

329
00:07:22,659 --> 00:07:26,700
amazing ways you know transcending
transcending gaps and and by just

330
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:26,710
transcending gaps and and by just
 

331
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:28,889
transcending gaps and and by just
chaining themselves together when you

332
00:07:28,889 --> 00:07:28,899
chaining themselves together when you
 

333
00:07:28,899 --> 00:07:32,369
chaining themselves together when you
have a flood being able to recruit other

334
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:32,379
have a flood being able to recruit other
 

335
00:07:32,379 --> 00:07:34,649
have a flood being able to recruit other
team mates to carry big morsels of food

336
00:07:34,649 --> 00:07:34,659
team mates to carry big morsels of food
 

337
00:07:34,659 --> 00:07:37,529
team mates to carry big morsels of food
and then going out in different

00:07:37,529 --> 00:07:37,539
and then going out in different
 

339
00:07:37,539 --> 00:07:39,240
and then going out in different
directions looking for food

340
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:39,250
directions looking for food
 

341
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,600
directions looking for food
and then being able to demonstrate

342
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:41,610
and then being able to demonstrate
 

343
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:45,059
and then being able to demonstrate
consensus even though they don't

344
00:07:45,059 --> 00:07:45,069
consensus even though they don't
 

345
00:07:45,069 --> 00:07:47,939
consensus even though they don't
communicate directly with each other the

346
00:07:47,939 --> 00:07:47,949
communicate directly with each other the
 

347
00:07:47,949 --> 00:07:50,879
communicate directly with each other the
way we communicate with each other in

348
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:50,889
way we communicate with each other in
 

349
00:07:50,889 --> 00:07:52,679
way we communicate with each other in
some sense they also know how to do

350
00:07:52,679 --> 00:07:52,689
some sense they also know how to do
 

351
00:07:52,689 --> 00:07:54,869
some sense they also know how to do
democracy probably better than what we

352
00:07:54,869 --> 00:07:54,879
democracy probably better than what we
 

353
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,719
democracy probably better than what we
do yeah somehow the even democracy is

354
00:07:57,719 --> 00:07:57,729
do yeah somehow the even democracy is
 

355
00:07:57,729 --> 00:08:00,540

357
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:02,760

00:08:04,699 --> 00:08:04,709
like there's no centralized communicator

00:08:04,709 --> 00:08:07,139
like there's no centralized communicator
there is so that I think a lot is made

362
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:07,149
there is so that I think a lot is made
 

363
00:08:07,149 --> 00:08:08,410
there is so that I think a lot is made
about that word

364
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:08,420
about that word
 

365
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:10,900
about that word
emergen and means lots of things of

366
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:10,910
emergen and means lots of things of
 

367
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:12,130
emergen and means lots of things of
different people but you're absolutely

368
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:12,140
different people but you're absolutely
 

369
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:14,440
different people but you're absolutely
right I think as an engineer you think

370
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:14,450
right I think as an engineer you think
 

371
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:18,970
right I think as an engineer you think
about what element elemental behaviors

372
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:18,980
about what element elemental behaviors
 

373
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:23,020
about what element elemental behaviors
were primitives you could synthesize so

374
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:23,030
were primitives you could synthesize so
 

375
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:26,440
were primitives you could synthesize so
that the whole looks incredibly powerful

376
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:26,450
that the whole looks incredibly powerful
 

377
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:28,240
that the whole looks incredibly powerful
incredibly synergistic the whole

378
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:28,250
incredibly synergistic the whole
 

379
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:29,800
incredibly synergistic the whole
definitely being greater than the sum of

380
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:29,810
definitely being greater than the sum of

00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:32,440
definitely being greater than the sum of
the parts and ants are living proof of

00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:32,450
the parts and ants are living proof of
 

383
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:32,940
the parts and ants are living proof of
that

384
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:32,950
that
 

385
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:36,160
that
so when you see these beautiful swarms

386
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:36,170
so when you see these beautiful swarms
 

387
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:37,900
so when you see these beautiful swarms
where there's biological systems of a

388
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:37,910
where there's biological systems of a
 

389
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:41,680
where there's biological systems of a
robots do you sometimes think of them as

390
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:41,690
robots do you sometimes think of them as
 

391
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:44,860
robots do you sometimes think of them as
a single individual living intelligent

392
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:44,870
a single individual living intelligent
 

393
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:47,230
a single individual living intelligent
organism so it's the same as thinking of

394
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:47,240
organism so it's the same as thinking of
 

395
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:50,260
organism so it's the same as thinking of
our human civilization as one organism

396
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:50,270
our human civilization as one organism
 

397
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:53,140
our human civilization as one organism
or do you still as an engineer think

398
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:53,150
or do you still as an engineer think
 

399
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:54,760
or do you still as an engineer think
about the individual components and all

400
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:54,770
about the individual components and all
 

401
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:55,960
about the individual components and all
the engineering that went into the

402
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:55,970
the engineering that went into the
 

403
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:57,760
the engineering that went into the
individual components oh that's very

404
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:57,770
individual components oh that's very
 

405
00:08:57,770 --> 00:08:58,450
individual components oh that's very
interesting

406
00:08:58,450 --> 00:08:58,460
interesting
 

407
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:00,660
interesting
so again philosophically as engineers

408
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:00,670
so again philosophically as engineers
 

409
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:05,440
so again philosophically as engineers
what we want to do is to go beyond the

410
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:05,450
what we want to do is to go beyond the
 

411
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:07,390
what we want to do is to go beyond the
individual components the individual

412
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:07,400
individual components the individual
 

413
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:10,390
individual components the individual
units and think about it as a unit as a

414
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:10,400
units and think about it as a unit as a
 

415
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,670
units and think about it as a unit as a
cohesive unit without worrying about the

416
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:12,680
cohesive unit without worrying about the
 

417
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:16,930
cohesive unit without worrying about the
individual components if you start

418
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:16,940
individual components if you start
 

419
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:18,760
individual components if you start
obsessing about the individual building

420
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:18,770
obsessing about the individual building
 

421
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:24,690
obsessing about the individual building
blocks and what they do you inevitably

422
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:24,700
blocks and what they do you inevitably
 

423
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:28,090
blocks and what they do you inevitably
will find it hard to scale up and just

424
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:28,100
will find it hard to scale up and just
 

425
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,530
will find it hard to scale up and just
mathematically just think about

426
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:29,540
mathematically just think about
 

427
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:31,300
mathematically just think about
individuals things you want a model and

428
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:31,310
individuals things you want a model and
 

429
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:34,090
individuals things you want a model and
if you want to have ten of those then

430
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:34,100
if you want to have ten of those then
 

431
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,920
if you want to have ten of those then
you essentially are taking cartesian

432
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:35,930
you essentially are taking cartesian
 

433
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:38,050
you essentially are taking cartesian
products of ten things that makes it

434
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:38,060
products of ten things that makes it
 

435
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:40,300
products of ten things that makes it
really complicated than to do any kind

436
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:40,310
really complicated than to do any kind
 

437
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:42,250
really complicated than to do any kind
of synthesis or design and that high

438
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:42,260
of synthesis or design and that high
 

439
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:44,800
of synthesis or design and that high
dimensional space is really hard so the

440
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:44,810
dimensional space is really hard so the
 

441
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:46,360
dimensional space is really hard so the
right way to do this is to think about

442
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:46,370
right way to do this is to think about
 

443
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:49,420
right way to do this is to think about
the individuals in a clever way so that

444
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:49,430
the individuals in a clever way so that
 

445
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:51,580
the individuals in a clever way so that
at the higher level when you look at

446
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:51,590
at the higher level when you look at
 

447
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:54,610
at the higher level when you look at
lots and lots of them abstractly you can

448
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:54,620
lots and lots of them abstractly you can
 

449
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:56,320
lots and lots of them abstractly you can
think of them in some low dimensional

450
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:56,330
think of them in some low dimensional
 

451
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:58,930
think of them in some low dimensional
space so what does that involve for the

452
00:09:58,930 --> 00:09:58,940
space so what does that involve for the
 

453
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:02,260
space so what does that involve for the
individual you have to try to make the

454
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:02,270
individual you have to try to make the
 

455
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:03,970
individual you have to try to make the
way they see the world as local as

456
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:03,980
way they see the world as local as
 

457
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:06,820
way they see the world as local as
possible and the other thing do you just

458
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:06,830
possible and the other thing do you just
 

459
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:08,740
possible and the other thing do you just
have to make them robust to collisions

460
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:08,750
have to make them robust to collisions
 

461
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:11,350
have to make them robust to collisions
like you said with the ants if something

462
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:11,360
like you said with the ants if something
 

463
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,710
like you said with the ants if something
fails that the whole swarm doesn't fail

464
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:14,720
fails that the whole swarm doesn't fail
 

465
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,800
fails that the whole swarm doesn't fail
right I think as engineers we do this I

466
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:17,810
right I think as engineers we do this I
 

467
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:19,210
right I think as engineers we do this I
mean you know think about we build

468
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:19,220
mean you know think about we build
 

469
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:21,940
mean you know think about we build
planes will rebuild iPhones

470
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:21,950
planes will rebuild iPhones
 

471
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:25,510
planes will rebuild iPhones
and we know that by taking individual

472
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:25,520
and we know that by taking individual
 

473
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,100
and we know that by taking individual
components well engineered components

474
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:27,110
components well engineered components
 

475
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:30,160
components well engineered components
with well specified interfaces that

476
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:30,170
with well specified interfaces that
 

477
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:31,930
with well specified interfaces that
behave in a predictable way you can

478
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:31,940
behave in a predictable way you can
 

479
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:34,750
behave in a predictable way you can
build complex systems so that's

480
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:34,760
build complex systems so that's
 

481
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,150
build complex systems so that's
ingrained I would I would claim and most

482
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:37,160
ingrained I would I would claim and most
 

483
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,850
ingrained I would I would claim and most
engineers thinking and it's true for

484
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:39,860
engineers thinking and it's true for
 

485
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,680
engineers thinking and it's true for
computer scientists as well I think

486
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:41,690
computer scientists as well I think
 

487
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:43,890
computer scientists as well I think
what's different here is that you want

488
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:43,900
what's different here is that you want
 

489
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:48,130
what's different here is that you want
the individuals to be robust in some

490
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:48,140
the individuals to be robust in some
 

491
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:51,640
the individuals to be robust in some
sense as we do in these other settings

492
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:51,650
sense as we do in these other settings
 

493
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:53,380
sense as we do in these other settings
but you also want some degree of

494
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:53,390
but you also want some degree of
 

495
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:56,650
but you also want some degree of
resiliency for the population and so you

496
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:56,660
resiliency for the population and so you
 

497
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:58,870
resiliency for the population and so you
really want them to be able to

498
00:10:58,870 --> 00:10:58,880
really want them to be able to
 

499
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:03,250
really want them to be able to
re-establish communication with their

500
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:03,260
re-establish communication with their
 

501
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:05,920
re-establish communication with their
neighbors you want them to rethink their

502
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:05,930
neighbors you want them to rethink their
 

503
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:09,310
neighbors you want them to rethink their
strategy for group behavior you want

504
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:09,320
strategy for group behavior you want
 

505
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:13,510
strategy for group behavior you want
them to reorganize and that's where I

506
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:13,520
them to reorganize and that's where I
 

507
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:16,240
them to reorganize and that's where I
think a lot of the challenges lie so

508
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:16,250
think a lot of the challenges lie so
 

509
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:19,090
think a lot of the challenges lie so
just at a high level what does it take

510
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:19,100
just at a high level what does it take
 

511
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:23,770
just at a high level what does it take
for a bunch of which we call them flying

512
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:23,780
for a bunch of which we call them flying
 

513
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:28,030
for a bunch of which we call them flying
robots to create a formation just for

514
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:28,040
robots to create a formation just for
 

515
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,460
robots to create a formation just for
people when I familiar with robotics in

516
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:30,470
people when I familiar with robotics in
 

517
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:32,470
people when I familiar with robotics in
general how much information is needed

518
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:32,480
general how much information is needed
 

519
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,080
general how much information is needed
how do you how do you even make it

520
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:35,090
how do you how do you even make it
 

521
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:38,850
how do you how do you even make it
happen without a centralized controller

522
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:38,860
happen without a centralized controller
 

523
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:40,840
happen without a centralized controller
so I mean there are a couple of

524
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:40,850
so I mean there are a couple of
 

525
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:43,810
so I mean there are a couple of
different ways of looking at this if you

526
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:43,820
different ways of looking at this if you
 

527
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:49,630
different ways of looking at this if you
are a purist you think of it as a as a

528
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:49,640
are a purist you think of it as a as a
 

529
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:53,560
are a purist you think of it as a as a
way of recreating what nature does

530
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:53,570
way of recreating what nature does
 

531
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:58,090
way of recreating what nature does
so nature forms groups for several

532
00:11:58,090 --> 00:11:58,100
so nature forms groups for several
 

533
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:01,269
so nature forms groups for several
reasons but mostly it's because of this

534
00:12:01,269 --> 00:12:01,279
reasons but mostly it's because of this
 

535
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:05,470
reasons but mostly it's because of this
instinct that organisms have of

536
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:05,480
instinct that organisms have of
 

537
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,420
instinct that organisms have of
preserving their colonies their

538
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:07,430
preserving their colonies their
 

539
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:11,530
preserving their colonies their
population which means what you need

540
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:11,540
population which means what you need
 

541
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:13,300
population which means what you need
shelter you need food you need to

542
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:13,310
shelter you need food you need to
 

543
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:16,780
shelter you need food you need to
procreate and that's basically it so the

544
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:16,790
procreate and that's basically it so the
 

545
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:18,939
procreate and that's basically it so the
kinds of interactions you see are all

546
00:12:18,939 --> 00:12:18,949
kinds of interactions you see are all
 

547
00:12:18,949 --> 00:12:23,470
kinds of interactions you see are all
organic they're all local and the only

548
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:23,480
organic they're all local and the only
 

549
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:26,199
organic they're all local and the only
information that they share and mostly

550
00:12:26,199 --> 00:12:26,209
information that they share and mostly
 

551
00:12:26,209 --> 00:12:29,829
information that they share and mostly
it's indirectly is to again preserve the

552
00:12:29,829 --> 00:12:29,839
it's indirectly is to again preserve the
 

553
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:35,470
it's indirectly is to again preserve the
herd of the flock or the swarm in and

554
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:35,480
herd of the flock or the swarm in and
 

555
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:38,980
herd of the flock or the swarm in and
either by looking for new sources of

00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:38,990
either by looking for new sources of
 

557
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:41,460
either by looking for new sources of
food are looking for new shelters right

558
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:41,470
food are looking for new shelters right
 

559
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:46,120
food are looking for new shelters right
as engineers when we build swarms we

560
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:46,130
as engineers when we build swarms we
 

561
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:49,930
as engineers when we build swarms we
have a mission and when you think of a

562
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:49,940
have a mission and when you think of a
 

563
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:54,610
have a mission and when you think of a
mission and it involves mobility most

564
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:54,620
mission and it involves mobility most
 

565
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:56,949
mission and it involves mobility most
often it's described in some kind of a

566
00:12:56,949 --> 00:12:56,959
often it's described in some kind of a
 

567
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:01,300
often it's described in some kind of a
global coordinate system as a human as

568
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:01,310
global coordinate system as a human as
 

569
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:04,090
global coordinate system as a human as
an operator as a commander or as a

570
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:04,100
an operator as a commander or as a
 

571
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:06,280
an operator as a commander or as a
collaborator I have my coordinate system

572
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:06,290
collaborator I have my coordinate system
 

573
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:09,460
collaborator I have my coordinate system
and I want the robots to be consistent

574
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:09,470
and I want the robots to be consistent
 

575
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:12,970
and I want the robots to be consistent
with that so I might think of it

576
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:12,980
with that so I might think of it
 

577
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:15,490
with that so I might think of it
slightly differently I might want the

578
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:15,500
slightly differently I might want the
 

579
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,379
slightly differently I might want the
robots to recognize that coordinate

580
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:17,389
robots to recognize that coordinate
 

581
00:13:17,389 --> 00:13:20,379
robots to recognize that coordinate
system which means not only do they have

582
00:13:20,379 --> 00:13:20,389
system which means not only do they have
 

583
00:13:20,389 --> 00:13:22,030
system which means not only do they have
to think locally in terms of who their

584
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:22,040
to think locally in terms of who their
 

585
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,590
to think locally in terms of who their
immediate neighbors are but they have to

586
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:23,600
immediate neighbors are but they have to
 

587
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,230
immediate neighbors are but they have to
be cognizant of of what the global

588
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:26,240
be cognizant of of what the global
 

589
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,530
be cognizant of of what the global
environment looks like so if I go if I

590
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:29,540
environment looks like so if I go if I
 

591
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:31,540
environment looks like so if I go if I
say surround this building and protect

592
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:31,550
say surround this building and protect
 

593
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:34,030
say surround this building and protect
this from intruders well they're

594
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:34,040
this from intruders well they're
 

595
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,530
this from intruders well they're
immediately in a building centered

596
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:35,540
immediately in a building centered
 

597
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:36,910
immediately in a building centered
coordinate system and I have to tell

598
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:36,920

599
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,920

that building there they're maintaining
 

605
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,679
that building there they're maintaining
some kind of global not just in the

606
00:13:44,679 --> 00:13:44,689
some kind of global not just in the
 

607
00:13:44,689 --> 00:13:46,660
some kind of global not just in the
frame of the building but there's

00:13:50,389 --> 00:13:54,699
built up explicitly as opposed to kind
of implicitly like nature might correct

00:13:54,699 --> 00:13:54,709
of implicitly like nature might correct
 

615
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:56,530
of implicitly like nature might correct
correct so in some sense nature is very

correct so in some sense nature is very
very sophisticated but the tasks that

probably a little bit more expensive to
do it the way nature does because nature

644
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:34,759
do it the way nature does because nature
 

645
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:38,349
do it the way nature does because nature
is less sensitive to the loss of the

646
00:14:38,349 --> 00:14:38,359
is less sensitive to the loss of the
 

647
00:14:38,359 --> 00:14:42,309
is less sensitive to the loss of the
individual and cost wise in robotics I

648
00:14:42,309 --> 00:14:42,319
individual and cost wise in robotics I
 

649
00:14:42,319 --> 00:14:44,289
individual and cost wise in robotics I
think you're more sensitive to losing

650
00:14:44,289 --> 00:14:44,299
think you're more sensitive to losing
 

651
00:14:44,299 --> 00:14:46,869
think you're more sensitive to losing
individuals I I think that's true

652
00:14:46,869 --> 00:14:46,879
individuals I I think that's true
 

653
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:49,090
individuals I I think that's true
although if you look at the price to

654
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:49,100
although if you look at the price to
 

655
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:51,460
although if you look at the price to
performance ratio of robotic components

656
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:51,470
performance ratio of robotic components
 

657
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:54,579
performance ratio of robotic components
it's it's coming down dramatically right

658
00:14:54,579 --> 00:14:54,589
it's it's coming down dramatically right
 

659
00:14:54,589 --> 00:14:56,319
it's it's coming down dramatically right
it continues to come down so I think

660
00:14:56,319 --> 00:14:56,329
it continues to come down so I think
 

661
00:14:56,329 --> 00:14:58,090
it continues to come down so I think
we're asymptotically approaching the

662
00:14:58,090 --> 00:14:58,100
we're asymptotically approaching the
 

663
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,249
we're asymptotically approaching the
major where we would get yeah the cost

664
00:15:00,249 --> 00:15:00,259
major where we would get yeah the cost
 

665
00:15:00,259 --> 00:15:02,939
major where we would get yeah the cost
of individuals will really become

666
00:15:02,939 --> 00:15:02,949
of individuals will really become
 

667
00:15:02,949 --> 00:15:06,579
of individuals will really become
insignificant yeah so let's step back at

668
00:15:06,579 --> 00:15:06,589
insignificant yeah so let's step back at
 

669
00:15:06,589 --> 00:15:08,340
insignificant yeah so let's step back at
a high low of you the impossible

670
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:08,350
a high low of you the impossible
 

671
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:12,400
a high low of you the impossible
question of what kind of as an overview

672
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:12,410
question of what kind of as an overview
 

673
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:14,350
question of what kind of as an overview
what kind of autonomous flying vehicles

674
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:14,360
what kind of autonomous flying vehicles
 

675
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,869
what kind of autonomous flying vehicles
are there in general I think the ones

676
00:15:16,869 --> 00:15:16,879
are there in general I think the ones
 

677
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:19,780
are there in general I think the ones
that receive a lot of notoriety are

678
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:19,790
that receive a lot of notoriety are
 

679
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:22,989
that receive a lot of notoriety are
obviously the military vehicles military

680
00:15:22,989 --> 00:15:22,999
obviously the military vehicles military
 

681
00:15:22,999 --> 00:15:25,600
obviously the military vehicles military
vehicles are controlled by a base

682
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:25,610
vehicles are controlled by a base
 

683
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:28,689
vehicles are controlled by a base
station but have a lot of human

684
00:15:28,689 --> 00:15:28,699
station but have a lot of human
 

685
00:15:28,699 --> 00:15:31,509
station but have a lot of human
supervision but I have limited autonomy

686
00:15:31,509 --> 00:15:31,519
supervision but I have limited autonomy
 

687
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:34,090
supervision but I have limited autonomy
which is the ability to go from point A

688
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:34,100
which is the ability to go from point A
 

689
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,379
which is the ability to go from point A
to point B and even the more

690
00:15:35,379 --> 00:15:35,389
to point B and even the more
 

691
00:15:35,389 --> 00:15:38,169
to point B and even the more
sophisticated now sophisticated vehicles

692
00:15:38,169 --> 00:15:38,179
sophisticated now sophisticated vehicles
 

693
00:15:38,179 --> 00:15:40,929
sophisticated now sophisticated vehicles
can do autonomous takeoff and landing

694
00:15:40,929 --> 00:15:40,939
can do autonomous takeoff and landing
 

695
00:15:40,939 --> 00:15:43,749
can do autonomous takeoff and landing
and those usually have wings and they're

696
00:15:43,749 --> 00:15:43,759
and those usually have wings and they're
 

697
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:45,609
and those usually have wings and they're
heavy usually their wings but then

698
00:15:45,609 --> 00:15:45,619
heavy usually their wings but then
 

699
00:15:45,619 --> 00:15:46,960
heavy usually their wings but then
there's nothing preventing us from doing

700
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:46,970
there's nothing preventing us from doing
 

701
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:50,499
there's nothing preventing us from doing
this for helicopters as well so I mean

702
00:15:50,499 --> 00:15:50,509
this for helicopters as well so I mean
 

703
00:15:50,509 --> 00:15:52,389
this for helicopters as well so I mean
there are many military organizations

704
00:15:52,389 --> 00:15:52,399
there are many military organizations
 

705
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:54,850
there are many military organizations
that have autonomous helicopters in the

706
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:54,860
that have autonomous helicopters in the
 

707
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:58,689
that have autonomous helicopters in the
same vein and by the way you look at

708
00:15:58,689 --> 00:15:58,699
same vein and by the way you look at
 

709
00:15:58,699 --> 00:16:00,850
same vein and by the way you look at
auto pilots and airplanes and it's it's

710
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:00,860
auto pilots and airplanes and it's it's
 

711
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:04,539
auto pilots and airplanes and it's it's
actually very similar in fact I can one

712
00:16:04,539 --> 00:16:04,549
actually very similar in fact I can one
 

713
00:16:04,549 --> 00:16:07,210
actually very similar in fact I can one
interesting question we can ask is if

714
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:07,220
interesting question we can ask is if
 

715
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:11,199
interesting question we can ask is if
you look at all the air safety

716
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:11,209
you look at all the air safety
 

717
00:16:11,209 --> 00:16:13,389
you look at all the air safety
violations all the crashes that occurred

718
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:13,399
violations all the crashes that occurred
 

719
00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:16,779
violations all the crashes that occurred
yeah would there happen if the plane

720
00:16:16,779 --> 00:16:16,789
yeah would there happen if the plane
 

721
00:16:16,789 --> 00:16:19,600
yeah would there happen if the plane
were truly autonomous and I think you'll

722
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:19,610
were truly autonomous and I think you'll
 

723
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:20,740
were truly autonomous and I think you'll
find that

724
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:20,750
find that
 

725
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,300
find that
any other cases you know because of

726
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:22,310
any other cases you know because of
 

727
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:24,700
any other cases you know because of
pilot error we made silly decisions and

728
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:24,710
pilot error we made silly decisions and
 

729
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:26,650
pilot error we made silly decisions and
so in some sense even an air-traffic

730
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:26,660
so in some sense even an air-traffic
 

731
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:28,510
so in some sense even an air-traffic
commercial air traffic there's a lot of

732
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:28,520
commercial air traffic there's a lot of
 

733
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,770
commercial air traffic there's a lot of
applications although we only see

734
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:31,780
applications although we only see
 

735
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:34,330
applications although we only see
autonomy being enabled at very high

736
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:34,340
autonomy being enabled at very high
 

737
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:39,730
autonomy being enabled at very high
altitudes when when the pilot to the the

738
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:39,740
altitudes when when the pilot to the the
 

739
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,560
altitudes when when the pilot to the the
plane is on autopilot there's still a

740
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:41,570
plane is on autopilot there's still a
 

741
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:44,160
plane is on autopilot there's still a
role for the human and that kind of

742
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:44,170
role for the human and that kind of
 

743
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:47,680
role for the human and that kind of
autonomy is you're kind of implying I

744
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:47,690
autonomy is you're kind of implying I
 

745
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:48,820
autonomy is you're kind of implying I
don't know what the right word is but

746
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:48,830
don't know what the right word is but
 

747
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:52,120
don't know what the right word is but
it's a little dumb dumber and it could

748
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:52,130
it's a little dumb dumber and it could
 

749
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:55,450
it's a little dumb dumber and it could
be right so so in the lab right course

750
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:55,460
be right so so in the lab right course
 

751
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:57,340
be right so so in the lab right course
we could we can we can afford to be a

752
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:57,350
we could we can we can afford to be a
 

753
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:01,800
we could we can we can afford to be a
lot more aggressive and the question we

754
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:01,810
lot more aggressive and the question we
 

755
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:06,240
lot more aggressive and the question we
try to ask is can we make robots that

756
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:06,250
try to ask is can we make robots that
 

757
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:10,569
try to ask is can we make robots that
will be able to make decisions without

758
00:17:10,569 --> 00:17:10,579
will be able to make decisions without
 

759
00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:12,939
will be able to make decisions without
any kind of external infrastructure

760
00:17:12,939 --> 00:17:12,949
any kind of external infrastructure
 

761
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:15,400
any kind of external infrastructure
right so what does that mean so the most

762
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:15,410
right so what does that mean so the most
 

763
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:17,050
right so what does that mean so the most
common piece of infrastructure that

764
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:17,060
common piece of infrastructure that
 

765
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:22,540
common piece of infrastructure that
airplanes use today is GPS GPS is also

766
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:22,550
airplanes use today is GPS GPS is also
 

767
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:26,679
airplanes use today is GPS GPS is also
the most brutal form of information if

768
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:26,689
the most brutal form of information if
 

769
00:17:26,689 --> 00:17:28,300
the most brutal form of information if
you have driven in a city tried to use

770
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:28,310
you have driven in a city tried to use
 

771
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:30,670
you have driven in a city tried to use
GPS navigation you know in tall

772
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:30,680
GPS navigation you know in tall
 

773
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:33,670
GPS navigation you know in tall
buildings you immediately lose GPS and

774
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:33,680
buildings you immediately lose GPS and
 

775
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,310
buildings you immediately lose GPS and
so that's not a very sophisticated way

776
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:36,320
so that's not a very sophisticated way
 

777
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,560
so that's not a very sophisticated way
of building autonomy I think the second

778
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:38,570
of building autonomy I think the second
 

779
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:40,300
of building autonomy I think the second
piece of infrastructure they rely on is

780
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:40,310
piece of infrastructure they rely on is
 

781
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:44,410
piece of infrastructure they rely on is
communications again it's very easy to

782
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:44,420
communications again it's very easy to
 

783
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:48,970
communications again it's very easy to
jam communications in fact if you use

784
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:48,980
jam communications in fact if you use
 

785
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:51,520
jam communications in fact if you use
Wi-Fi you know that Wi-Fi signals drop

786
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:51,530
Wi-Fi you know that Wi-Fi signals drop
 

787
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:54,220
Wi-Fi you know that Wi-Fi signals drop
out cell signals drop out so to rely on

788
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:54,230
out cell signals drop out so to rely on
 

789
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:57,750
out cell signals drop out so to rely on
something like that is not is not good

790
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:57,760
something like that is not is not good
 

791
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,790
something like that is not is not good
the third form of infrastructure we we

792
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:00,800
the third form of infrastructure we we
 

793
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,740
the third form of infrastructure we we
use and I hate to call it infrastructure

794
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:02,750
use and I hate to call it infrastructure
 

795
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,750
use and I hate to call it infrastructure
but but it is that in the sense of

796
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:04,760
but but it is that in the sense of
 

797
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:07,090
but but it is that in the sense of
robots it's people so you could rely on

798
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:07,100
robots it's people so you could rely on
 

799
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:10,360
robots it's people so you could rely on
somebody to pilot you right and so the

800
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:10,370
somebody to pilot you right and so the
 

801
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:11,920
somebody to pilot you right and so the
question you want to ask is if there are

802

question you want to ask is if there are
 

803
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:13,330
question you want to ask is if there are
no pilots

robots navigate so that is true autonomy
 

819
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:33,070
robots navigate so that is true autonomy
right so that's that's true autonomous

820
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:33,080
right so that's that's true autonomous
 

821
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,480
right so that's that's true autonomous
and we're talking about you may

and we're talking about you may
 

823
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:36,490

okay so what else is there you talk

826
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:38,630
okay so what else is there you talk
 

827
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:41,950
okay so what else is there you talk
about agile autonomous flying robots

828

its small so I used the word agility

834
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:49,640
its small so I used the word agility
 

835
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:52,300

mean you break records for the hundred

874
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:44,390
mean you break records for the hundred
 

875
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:46,990
mean you break records for the hundred
meters - what it really means is you see

00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:58,090
that gets you the most information about
the thing you're trying to do by the way

you may be the only person who in a TED

886
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:01,250
you may be the only person who in a TED
 

887
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:04,450
you may be the only person who in a TED
talk has used a math equation which is

888
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:04,460
talk has used a math equation which is
 

889
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:07,300
talk has used a math equation which is
amazing people should go see what

890
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:07,310
amazing people should go see what
 

891
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:08,920
amazing people should go see what
actually it's very interesting because

892
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:08,930
actually it's very interesting because
 

893
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:12,850
actually it's very interesting because
the Ted curator Chris Anderson told me

894
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:12,860
the Ted curator Chris Anderson told me
 

895
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:16,060
the Ted curator Chris Anderson told me
you can't show math and you know I

896
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:16,070
you can't show math and you know I
 

897
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:17,920
you can't show math and you know I
thought about it but but that's who I am

898
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:17,930
thought about it but but that's who I am
 

899
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:20,170
thought about it but but that's who I am
and that's that's what that's our work

900
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:20,180
and that's that's what that's our work
 

901
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:23,980
and that's that's what that's our work
and so I felt compelled to give the

902
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:23,990
and so I felt compelled to give the
 

903
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:27,280
and so I felt compelled to give the
audience a taste for at least some math

904
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:27,290
audience a taste for at least some math
 

905
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:31,930
audience a taste for at least some math
so on that point simply what does it

906
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:31,940
so on that point simply what does it
 

907
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:35,350
so on that point simply what does it
take to make a thing with four motors

908
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:35,360
take to make a thing with four motors
 

909
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,700
take to make a thing with four motors
fly a quadcopter one of these little

910
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:38,710
fly a quadcopter one of these little
 

911
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:42,520
fly a quadcopter one of these little
flying robots you know how hard is it to

912
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:42,530
flying robots you know how hard is it to
 

913
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:45,220
flying robots you know how hard is it to
make it fly how do you coordinate them

914
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:45,230
make it fly how do you coordinate them
 

915
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:48,610
make it fly how do you coordinate them
four motors what's how do you convert

916
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:48,620
four motors what's how do you convert
 

917
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:51,460
four motors what's how do you convert
there's those motors into actual

918
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:51,470
there's those motors into actual
 

919
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:53,560
there's those motors into actual
movement so this is an interesting

920
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:53,570
movement so this is an interesting
 

921
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:56,019
movement so this is an interesting
question we've been trying to do this

922
00:20:56,019 --> 00:20:56,029
question we've been trying to do this
 

923
00:20:56,029 --> 00:20:59,980
question we've been trying to do this
since 2000 it is a commentary on the

924
00:20:59,980 --> 00:20:59,990
since 2000 it is a commentary on the
 

925
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:01,630
since 2000 it is a commentary on the
sensors that were available back then

926
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:01,640
sensors that were available back then
 

927
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,610
sensors that were available back then
the computers that were available back

928
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:03,620
the computers that were available back
 

929
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:07,320
the computers that were available back
then and a number of things happened

930
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:07,330
then and a number of things happened
 

931
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:12,310
then and a number of things happened
between 2000 and 2007 one is the

932
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:12,320
between 2000 and 2007 one is the
 

933
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,850
between 2000 and 2007 one is the
advances in computing which is and so we

934
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:15,860
advances in computing which is and so we
 

935
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:17,789
advances in computing which is and so we
all know about Moore's law but I think

936
00:21:17,789 --> 00:21:17,799
all know about Moore's law but I think
 

937
00:21:17,799 --> 00:21:20,169
all know about Moore's law but I think
2007 was a tipping point the year of the

938
00:21:20,169 --> 00:21:20,179
2007 was a tipping point the year of the
 

939
00:21:20,179 --> 00:21:23,110
2007 was a tipping point the year of the
iPhone the year of the cloud lots of

940
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:23,120
iPhone the year of the cloud lots of
 

941
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,289
iPhone the year of the cloud lots of
things happen in 2007 but going back

942
00:21:26,289 --> 00:21:26,299
things happen in 2007 but going back
 

943
00:21:26,299 --> 00:21:28,810
things happen in 2007 but going back
even further inertial measurement units

944
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:28,820
even further inertial measurement units
 

945
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:32,080
even further inertial measurement units
as a sensor really matured again lots of

946
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:32,090
as a sensor really matured again lots of
 

947
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:34,539
as a sensor really matured again lots of
reasons for that certainly there's a lot

948
00:21:34,539 --> 00:21:34,549
reasons for that certainly there's a lot
 

949
00:21:34,549 --> 00:21:36,639
reasons for that certainly there's a lot
of federal funding particularly DARPA in

950
00:21:36,639 --> 00:21:36,649
of federal funding particularly DARPA in
 

951
00:21:36,649 --> 00:21:40,240
of federal funding particularly DARPA in
the US but they didn't anticipate this

952
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:40,250
the US but they didn't anticipate this
 

953
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:44,880
the US but they didn't anticipate this
boom in I amuse but if you look

954
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:44,890
boom in I amuse but if you look
 

955
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:47,080
boom in I amuse but if you look
subsequently what happened is it every

956
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:47,090
subsequently what happened is it every
 

957
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:49,360
subsequently what happened is it every
year every car manufacturer had to put

958
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:49,370
year every car manufacturer had to put
 

959
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:50,980
year every car manufacturer had to put
an airbag in which meant you had to have

960
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:50,990
an airbag in which meant you had to have
 

961
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:53,019
an airbag in which meant you had to have
an accelerometer onboard and so that

962
00:21:53,019 --> 00:21:53,029
an accelerometer onboard and so that
 

963
00:21:53,029 --> 00:21:54,279
an accelerometer onboard and so that
drove down the price to performance

964
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:54,289
drove down the price to performance
 

965
00:21:54,289 --> 00:21:56,830
drove down the price to performance
ratio oliver's so I should know this

966
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:56,840
ratio oliver's so I should know this
 

967
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,330
ratio oliver's so I should know this
that's very interesting yeah it's very

968
00:21:58,330 --> 00:21:58,340
that's very interesting yeah it's very
 

969
00:21:58,340 --> 00:21:59,529
that's very interesting yeah it's very
interesting the connection there and

970
00:21:59,529 --> 00:21:59,539
interesting the connection there and
 

971
00:21:59,539 --> 00:22:01,659
interesting the connection there and
that's why research is very it's very

972
00:22:01,659 --> 00:22:01,669
that's why research is very it's very
 

973
00:22:01,669 --> 00:22:05,529
that's why research is very it's very
hard to predict the outcomes and again

974
00:22:05,529 --> 00:22:05,539
hard to predict the outcomes and again
 

975
00:22:05,539 --> 00:22:07,029
hard to predict the outcomes and again
the federal government spent a ton of

976
00:22:07,029 --> 00:22:07,039
the federal government spent a ton of
 

977
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:09,549
the federal government spent a ton of
money on things that they thought were

978
00:22:09,549 --> 00:22:09,559
money on things that they thought were
 

979
00:22:09,559 --> 00:22:13,110
money on things that they thought were
useful for resonators but it ended up

980
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:13,120
useful for resonators but it ended up
 

981
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,480
useful for resonators but it ended up
enabling these small UAVs yeah which is

982
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:16,490
enabling these small UAVs yeah which is
 

983
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:17,799
enabling these small UAVs yeah which is
great because I could have never raised

984
00:22:17,799 --> 00:22:17,809
great because I could have never raised
 

985
00:22:17,809 --> 00:22:20,200
great because I could have never raised
that much money and told you no soul

986
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:20,210
that much money and told you no soul
 

987
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:21,430
that much money and told you no soul
this project hey we want to build these

988
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:21,440
this project hey we want to build these
 

989
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,289
this project hey we want to build these
small UAVs can you can you actually fund

990
00:22:23,289 --> 00:22:23,299
small UAVs can you can you actually fund
 

991
00:22:23,299 --> 00:22:25,570
small UAVs can you can you actually fund
the development of low-cost dire news so

992
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:25,580
the development of low-cost dire news so
 

993
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:29,169
the development of low-cost dire news so
why do you need an IMU and so so so I

994
00:22:29,169 --> 00:22:29,179
why do you need an IMU and so so so I
 

995
00:22:29,179 --> 00:22:31,299
why do you need an IMU and so so so I
was I'll come back to that but but so in

996
00:22:31,299 --> 00:22:31,309
was I'll come back to that but but so in
 

997
00:22:31,309 --> 00:22:33,220
was I'll come back to that but but so in
2007 2008 we were able to build these

998
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:33,230
2007 2008 we were able to build these
 

999
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:34,690
2007 2008 we were able to build these
and then the question you're asking was

1000
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:34,700
and then the question you're asking was
 

1001
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,039
and then the question you're asking was
a good one how do you coordinate the

1002
00:22:36,039 --> 00:22:36,049
a good one how do you coordinate the
 

1003
00:22:36,049 --> 00:22:41,470
a good one how do you coordinate the
motors to develop this but over the last

1004
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:41,480
motors to develop this but over the last
 

1005
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,750
motors to develop this but over the last
10 years everything is commoditized a

1006
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:43,760
10 years everything is commoditized a
 

1007
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,299
10 years everything is commoditized a
high school kid today can pick up a

1008
00:22:46,299 --> 00:22:46,309
high school kid today can pick up a
 

1009
00:22:46,309 --> 00:22:50,830
high school kid today can pick up a
Raspberry Pi kit and build us all the

1010
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:50,840
Raspberry Pi kit and build us all the
 

1011
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,299
Raspberry Pi kit and build us all the
low levels functionality is all

1012
00:22:52,299 --> 00:22:52,309
low levels functionality is all
 

1013
00:22:52,309 --> 00:22:55,510
low levels functionality is all
automated but basically at some level

1014
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:55,520
automated but basically at some level
 

1015
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,440
automated but basically at some level
you have to drive the motors at the

1016
00:22:59,440 --> 00:22:59,450
you have to drive the motors at the
 

1017
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:02,499
you have to drive the motors at the
right rpms the right

1018
00:23:02,499 --> 00:23:02,509
right rpms the right
 

1019
00:23:02,509 --> 00:23:05,739
right rpms the right

amount of thrust in order to position it

1022
00:23:09,009 --> 00:23:09,019
amount of thrust in order to position it
 

1023
00:23:09,019 --> 00:23:11,529
amount of thrust in order to position it
and orient it in a way that you need to

1024
00:23:11,529 --> 00:23:11,539
and orient it in a way that you need to
 

1025
00:23:11,539 --> 00:23:14,710
and orient it in a way that you need to
in order to fly the feedback that you

1026
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:14,720
in order to fly the feedback that you
 

1027
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,229
in order to fly the feedback that you
get is from onboard sensors and the IMU

1028
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:17,239
get is from onboard sensors and the IMU
 

1029
00:23:17,239 --> 00:23:19,749
get is from onboard sensors and the IMU
is an important part of it the IMU tells

1030
00:23:19,749 --> 00:23:19,759
is an important part of it the IMU tells
 

1031
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:24,310
is an important part of it the IMU tells
you what the acceleration is as well as

1032
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:24,320
you what the acceleration is as well as
 

1033
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,099
you what the acceleration is as well as
what the angular velocity is and those

1034
00:23:27,099 --> 00:23:27,109
what the angular velocity is and those
 

1035
00:23:27,109 --> 00:23:30,039
what the angular velocity is and those
are important pieces of information in

1036
00:23:30,039 --> 00:23:30,049
are important pieces of information in
 

1037
00:23:30,049 --> 00:23:32,560
are important pieces of information in
addition to that you need some kind of

1038
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:32,570
addition to that you need some kind of
 

1039
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:36,599
addition to that you need some kind of
local position or velocity information

1040
00:23:36,599 --> 00:23:36,609
local position or velocity information
 

1041
00:23:36,609 --> 00:23:40,090
local position or velocity information
for example when we walk we implicitly

1042
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:40,100
for example when we walk we implicitly
 

1043
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:42,340
for example when we walk we implicitly
have this information because we kind of

1044
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:42,350
have this information because we kind of
 

1045
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:45,810
have this information because we kind of
know how how would our stride length is

1046
00:23:45,810 --> 00:23:45,820
know how how would our stride length is
 

1047
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:50,649
know how how would our stride length is
we also are looking at images fly past

1048
00:23:50,649 --> 00:23:50,659
we also are looking at images fly past
 

1049
00:23:50,659 --> 00:23:52,840
we also are looking at images fly past
our retina if you will and so we can

1050
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:52,850
our retina if you will and so we can
 

1051
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:54,789
our retina if you will and so we can
estimate velocity we also have

1052
00:23:54,789 --> 00:23:54,799
estimate velocity we also have
 

1053
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:56,649
estimate velocity we also have
accelerometers in our head and we're

1054
00:23:56,649 --> 00:23:56,659
accelerometers in our head and we're
 

1055
00:23:56,659 --> 00:23:58,299
accelerometers in our head and we're
able to integrate all these pieces of

1056
00:23:58,299 --> 00:23:58,309
able to integrate all these pieces of
 

1057
00:23:58,309 --> 00:24:01,210
able to integrate all these pieces of
information to determine where we are as

1058
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:01,220
information to determine where we are as
 

1059
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:03,369
information to determine where we are as
we walk and so robots have to do

1060
00:24:03,369 --> 00:24:03,379
we walk and so robots have to do
 

1061
00:24:03,379 --> 00:24:04,960
we walk and so robots have to do
something very similar you need an IMU

1062
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:04,970
something very similar you need an IMU
 

1063
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:09,190
something very similar you need an IMU
you need some kind of a camera or other

1064
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:09,200
you need some kind of a camera or other
 

1065
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,489
you need some kind of a camera or other
sensor that's measuring velocity and

1066
00:24:12,489 --> 00:24:12,499
sensor that's measuring velocity and
 

1067
00:24:12,499 --> 00:24:14,440
sensor that's measuring velocity and
then you need some kind of a global

1068
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:14,450
then you need some kind of a global
 

1069
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:16,720
then you need some kind of a global
reference frame if you really want to

1070
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:16,730
reference frame if you really want to
 

1071
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:19,840
reference frame if you really want to
think about doing something in a world

1072
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:19,850
think about doing something in a world
 

1073
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:21,930
think about doing something in a world
coordinate system and so how do you

1074
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:21,940
coordinate system and so how do you
 

1075
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:24,099
coordinate system and so how do you
estimate your position with respect to

1076
00:24:24,099 --> 00:24:24,109
estimate your position with respect to
 

1077
00:24:24,109 --> 00:24:25,299
estimate your position with respect to
that global reference frame that's

1078
00:24:25,299 --> 00:24:25,309
that global reference frame that's
 

1079
00:24:25,309 --> 00:24:27,430
that global reference frame that's
important as well so coordinating the

1080
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:27,440
important as well so coordinating the
 

1081
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,979
important as well so coordinating the
RPMs of the four motors is what allows

1082
00:24:29,979 --> 00:24:29,989
RPMs of the four motors is what allows
 

1083
00:24:29,989 --> 00:24:32,440
RPMs of the four motors is what allows
you to first of all fly and hover and

1084
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:32,450
you to first of all fly and hover and
 

1085
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:35,680
you to first of all fly and hover and
then you can change the orientation and

1086
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:35,690
then you can change the orientation and
 

1087
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:38,049
then you can change the orientation and
the velocity of the and so on exactly

1088
00:24:38,049 --> 00:24:38,059
the velocity of the and so on exactly
 

1089
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:41,409
the velocity of the and so on exactly
exactly bunch of degrees of freedom six

1090
00:24:41,409 --> 00:24:41,419
exactly bunch of degrees of freedom six
 

1091
00:24:41,419 --> 00:24:42,639
exactly bunch of degrees of freedom six
degrees of freedom but you only have

1092
00:24:42,639 --> 00:24:42,649
degrees of freedom but you only have
 

1093
00:24:42,649 --> 00:24:46,210
degrees of freedom but you only have
four inputs the four motors and and it

1094
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:46,220
four inputs the four motors and and it
 

1095
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:49,799
four inputs the four motors and and it
turns out to be a remarkably versatile

1096
00:24:49,799 --> 00:24:49,809
turns out to be a remarkably versatile
 

1097
00:24:49,809 --> 00:24:52,029
turns out to be a remarkably versatile
configuration you think at first well I

1098
00:24:52,029 --> 00:24:52,039
configuration you think at first well I
 

1099
00:24:52,039 --> 00:24:53,560
configuration you think at first well I
only have four motors how do I go

1100
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:53,570
only have four motors how do I go
 

1101
00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:56,109
only have four motors how do I go
sideways but it's not too hard to say

1102
00:24:56,109 --> 00:24:56,119
sideways but it's not too hard to say
 

1103
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:58,109
sideways but it's not too hard to say
well if I tell myself I can go sideways

1104
00:24:58,109 --> 00:24:58,119
well if I tell myself I can go sideways
 

1105
00:24:58,119 --> 00:25:00,759
well if I tell myself I can go sideways
and then you have four motors pointing

1106
00:25:00,759 --> 00:25:00,769
and then you have four motors pointing
 

1107
00:25:00,769 --> 00:25:03,159
and then you have four motors pointing
up how do i how do I rotate in place

1108
00:25:03,159 --> 00:25:03,169
up how do i how do I rotate in place
 

1109
00:25:03,169 --> 00:25:04,590
up how do i how do I rotate in place
about a vertical axis

1110
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:04,600
about a vertical axis
 

1111
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:07,509
about a vertical axis
well you rotate them at different speeds

1112
00:25:07,509 --> 00:25:07,519
well you rotate them at different speeds
 

1113
00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:09,759
well you rotate them at different speeds
and that generation reaction moments in

1114
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:09,769
and that generation reaction moments in
 

1115
00:25:09,769 --> 00:25:11,979
and that generation reaction moments in
that allows you to turn so it's actually

1116
00:25:11,979 --> 00:25:11,989
that allows you to turn so it's actually
 

1117
00:25:11,989 --> 00:25:12,549
that allows you to turn so it's actually
a pretty

1118
00:25:12,549 --> 00:25:12,559
a pretty
 

1119
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:15,520
a pretty
it's an optimal configuration from

1120
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:15,530
it's an optimal configuration from
 

1121
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:18,910
it's an optimal configuration from
from engineer standpoint it's it's very

1122
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:18,920
from engineer standpoint it's it's very
 

1123
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:22,840
from engineer standpoint it's it's very
simple very cleverly done and and very

1124
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:22,850
simple very cleverly done and and very
 

1125
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:25,720
simple very cleverly done and and very
versatile so if you could step back to a

1126
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:25,730
versatile so if you could step back to a
 

1127
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:29,500
versatile so if you could step back to a
time so I've always known flying robots

1128
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:29,510
time so I've always known flying robots
 

1129
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:33,880
time so I've always known flying robots
as the to me it was natural that the

1130
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:33,890
as the to me it was natural that the
 

1131
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:36,640
as the to me it was natural that the
quadcopter should fly but when you first

1132
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:36,650
quadcopter should fly but when you first
 

1133
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:37,720
quadcopter should fly but when you first
started working with it

1134
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:37,730
started working with it
 

1135
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:41,140
started working with it
like how surprised are you that you can

1136
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:41,150
like how surprised are you that you can
 

1137
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:45,640
like how surprised are you that you can
make do so much with the four motors how

1138
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:45,650
make do so much with the four motors how
 

1139
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:48,010
make do so much with the four motors how
surprising is e this thing fly first of

1140
00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:48,020
surprising is e this thing fly first of
 

1141
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:50,170
surprising is e this thing fly first of
all you can make it hover then you can

1142
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:50,180
all you can make it hover then you can
 

1143
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:53,770
all you can make it hover then you can
add control to it firstly this is not

1144
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:53,780
add control to it firstly this is not
 

1145
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:56,460
add control to it firstly this is not
the four motor configuration is not ours

1146
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:56,470
the four motor configuration is not ours
 

1147
00:25:56,470 --> 00:25:59,260
the four motor configuration is not ours
you could it has at least a hundred year

1148
00:25:59,260 --> 00:25:59,270
you could it has at least a hundred year
 

1149
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:02,290
you could it has at least a hundred year
history and with various people various

1150
00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:02,300
history and with various people various
 

1151
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:05,430

people try to get quad rotors to fly

1152
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:05,440
people try to get quad rotors to fly
 

1153
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,850
people try to get quad rotors to fly
without much success as I said we've

1154
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:09,860
without much success as I said we've
 

1155
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,650
without much success as I said we've
been working on this since 2000 our

1156
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:11,660
been working on this since 2000 our
 

1157
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:14,230
been working on this since 2000 our
first designs were well this is way too

1158
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:14,240
first designs were well this is way too
 

1159
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,780
first designs were well this is way too
complicated why not we try to get an

1160
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:16,790
complicated why not we try to get an
 

1161
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:17,860
complicated why not we try to get an
omnidirectional

1162
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:17,870
omnidirectional
 

1163
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:21,250
omnidirectional
flying robots or so our early designs we

1164
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:21,260
flying robots or so our early designs we
 

1165
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:23,440
flying robots or so our early designs we
had eight folders and so these eight

1166
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:23,450
had eight folders and so these eight
 

1167
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:27,520
had eight folders and so these eight
rotors were arranged uniformly on a

1168
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:27,530
rotors were arranged uniformly on a
 

1169
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:29,590
rotors were arranged uniformly on a
sphere if you will so you can imagine a

1170
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:29,600
sphere if you will so you can imagine a
 

1171
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,750
sphere if you will so you can imagine a
symmetric configuration and so you

1172
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:31,760
symmetric configuration and so you
 

1173
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,450
symmetric configuration and so you
should be able to fly anywhere but the

1174
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:34,460
should be able to fly anywhere but the
 

1175
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:36,400
should be able to fly anywhere but the
real challenge we had is the strength to

1176
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:36,410
real challenge we had is the strength to
 

1177
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:38,290
real challenge we had is the strength to
weight ratio is not enough and of course

1178
00:26:38,290 --> 00:26:38,300
weight ratio is not enough and of course
 

1179
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:41,380
weight ratio is not enough and of course
we didn't have the sensors and so on so

1180
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:41,390
we didn't have the sensors and so on so
 

1181
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:43,630
we didn't have the sensors and so on so
everybody knew or at least the people

1182
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:43,640
everybody knew or at least the people
 

1183
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:46,000
everybody knew or at least the people
who work with rotor crafts knew four

1184
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:46,010
who work with rotor crafts knew four
 

1185
00:26:46,010 --> 00:26:48,970
who work with rotor crafts knew four
rotors we get it done so that was not

1186
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:48,980
rotors we get it done so that was not
 

1187
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:52,630
rotors we get it done so that was not
our idea but it took a while before we

1188
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:52,640
our idea but it took a while before we
 

1189
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,580
our idea but it took a while before we
could actually do the onboard sensing

1190
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:54,590
could actually do the onboard sensing
 

1191
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:57,910
could actually do the onboard sensing
and the computation that was needed for

1192
00:26:57,910 --> 00:26:57,920
and the computation that was needed for
 

1193
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:00,730
and the computation that was needed for
the kinds of agile maneuvering that we

1194
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:00,740
the kinds of agile maneuvering that we
 

1195
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:03,280
the kinds of agile maneuvering that we
wanted to do in our little aerial robots

1196
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:03,290
wanted to do in our little aerial robots
 

1197
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:06,580
wanted to do in our little aerial robots
and that only happened between 2007 and

1198
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:06,590
and that only happened between 2007 and
 

1199
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:09,340
and that only happened between 2007 and
2009 in our life yeah and you have to

1200
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:09,350
2009 in our life yeah and you have to
 

1201
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:12,190
2009 in our life yeah and you have to
send the signal may hundred times a

1202
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:12,200
send the signal may hundred times a
 

1203
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:15,010
send the signal may hundred times a
second so the compute there is

1204
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:15,020
second so the compute there is
 

1205
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:17,700
second so the compute there is
everything has to come down in price and

1206
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:17,710
everything has to come down in price and
 

1207
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:20,740
everything has to come down in price and
what are the steps of getting from point

1208
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:20,750
what are the steps of getting from point
 

1209
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:23,770
what are the steps of getting from point
A to point B so you just talked about

1210
00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:23,780
A to point B so you just talked about
 

1211
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:28,120
A to point B so you just talked about
like local control but if all the kind

1212
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:28,130
like local control but if all the kind
 

1213
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:29,830
like local control but if all the kind
of cool

1214
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:29,840
of cool
 

1215
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,690
of cool
dancing in the air that I've seen you

1216
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:32,700
dancing in the air that I've seen you
 

1217
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:35,810
dancing in the air that I've seen you
show how do you make it happen it would

1218
00:27:35,810 --> 00:27:35,820
show how do you make it happen it would
 

1219
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,730
show how do you make it happen it would
have trajector make a trajectory

1220
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:37,740
have trajector make a trajectory
 

1221
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:40,430
have trajector make a trajectory
first of all okay figure out a

1222
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:40,440
first of all okay figure out a
 

1223
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,560
first of all okay figure out a
trajectory so planet trajectory and then

1224
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:42,570
trajectory so planet trajectory and then
 

1225
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:44,480
trajectory so planet trajectory and then
how do you make that trajectory happen I

1226
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:44,490
how do you make that trajectory happen I
 

1227
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:46,970
how do you make that trajectory happen I
think planning is a very fundamental

1228
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:46,980
think planning is a very fundamental
 

1229
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:49,310
think planning is a very fundamental
problem in robotics I think you know 10

1230
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:49,320
problem in robotics I think you know 10
 

1231
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,930
problem in robotics I think you know 10
years ago it was an esoteric thing but

1232
00:27:50,930 --> 00:27:50,940
years ago it was an esoteric thing but
 

1233
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:52,940
years ago it was an esoteric thing but
today with self-driving cars you know

1234
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:52,950
today with self-driving cars you know
 

1235
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:55,430
today with self-driving cars you know
everybody can understand this basic idea

1236
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:55,440
everybody can understand this basic idea
 

1237
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,320
everybody can understand this basic idea
that a car sees a whole bunch of things

1238
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:57,330
that a car sees a whole bunch of things
 

1239
00:27:57,330 --> 00:27:59,750
that a car sees a whole bunch of things
and it has to keep a lane or maybe make

1240
00:27:59,750 --> 00:27:59,760
and it has to keep a lane or maybe make
 

1241
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,760
and it has to keep a lane or maybe make
a right turn or switch lanes it has to

1242
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:01,770
a right turn or switch lanes it has to
 

1243
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:03,620
a right turn or switch lanes it has to
plan a trajectory it has to be safe it

1244
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:03,630
plan a trajectory it has to be safe it
 

1245
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:05,330
plan a trajectory it has to be safe it
has to be efficient so everybody's

1246
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:05,340
has to be efficient so everybody's
 

1247
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:07,279
has to be efficient so everybody's
familiar with that that's kind of the

1248
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:07,289
familiar with that that's kind of the
 

1249
00:28:07,289 --> 00:28:09,889
familiar with that that's kind of the
first step that that you have to think

1250
00:28:09,889 --> 00:28:09,899
first step that that you have to think
 

1251
00:28:09,899 --> 00:28:12,350
first step that that you have to think
about when you when you when you when

1252
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:12,360
about when you when you when you when
 

1253
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:17,120
about when you when you when you when
you say autonomy and so for us it's

1254
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:17,130
you say autonomy and so for us it's
 

1255
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:19,490
you say autonomy and so for us it's
about finding smooth motions motions

1256
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:19,500
about finding smooth motions motions
 

1257
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:22,100
about finding smooth motions motions
that are safe so we think about these

1258
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:22,110
that are safe so we think about these
 

1259
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:24,110
that are safe so we think about these
two things one is optimality we want a

1260
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:24,120
two things one is optimality we want a
 

1261
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,789
two things one is optimality we want a
safety clearly you don't you cannot

1262
00:28:25,789 --> 00:28:25,799
safety clearly you don't you cannot
 

1263
00:28:25,799 --> 00:28:29,240
safety clearly you don't you cannot
compromise safety so you're looking for

1264
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:29,250
compromise safety so you're looking for
 

1265
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:32,180
compromise safety so you're looking for
safe optimal motions the other thing you

1266
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:32,190
safe optimal motions the other thing you
 

1267
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:35,149
safe optimal motions the other thing you
have to think about is can you actually

1268
00:28:35,149 --> 00:28:35,159
have to think about is can you actually
 

1269
00:28:35,159 --> 00:28:38,360
have to think about is can you actually
compute a reasonable trajectory in a

1270
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:38,370
compute a reasonable trajectory in a
 

1271
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:40,100
compute a reasonable trajectory in a
fast manner in a small amount of time

1272
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:40,110
fast manner in a small amount of time
 

1273
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:42,649
fast manner in a small amount of time
because you have a time budget so the

1274
00:28:42,649 --> 00:28:42,659
because you have a time budget so the
 

1275
00:28:42,659 --> 00:28:46,940
because you have a time budget so the
optimal becomes suboptimal but in our

1276
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:46,950
optimal becomes suboptimal but in our
 

1277
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:50,389
optimal becomes suboptimal but in our

and the reason is to get it perfectly
 

1345
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:15,600
and the reason is to get it perfectly
right you have to model everything in

1346
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:15,610
right you have to model everything in

00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:19,320
right you have to model everything in
the environment and flying is

00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:26,040
notoriously hard to model there are
aerodynamic effects that we constantly

1352
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:26,050
aerodynamic effects that we constantly
 

1353
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:30,720
aerodynamic effects that we constantly
discover even just before I was talking

1354
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:30,730
discover even just before I was talking
 

1355
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:33,660
discover even just before I was talking
to you I was starting to a student about

1356
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:33,670
to you I was starting to a student about
 

1357
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:37,470
to you I was starting to a student about
how blades flap when they fly well and

1358
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:37,480
how blades flap when they fly well and
 

1359
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:41,640
how blades flap when they fly well and
that ends up changing how a rotor craft

1360
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:41,650
that ends up changing how a rotor craft
 

1361
00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:45,840
that ends up changing how a rotor craft
is accelerated in the angular direction

1362
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:45,850
is accelerated in the angular direction
 

1363
00:30:45,850 --> 00:30:48,000
is accelerated in the angular direction
this is like micro flaps or something is

1364
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:48,010
this is like micro flaps or something is
 

1365
00:30:48,010 --> 00:30:49,800
this is like micro flaps or something is
smooth it's not microfiber you assume

1366
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:49,810
smooth it's not microfiber you assume
 

1367
00:30:49,810 --> 00:30:52,050
smooth it's not microfiber you assume
that each blade is is rigid but actually

1368
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:52,060
that each blade is is rigid but actually
 

1369
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:54,290
that each blade is is rigid but actually
it flaps a little bit oh it bends

1370
00:30:54,290 --> 00:30:54,300
it flaps a little bit oh it bends
 

1371
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:57,390
it flaps a little bit oh it bends
interesting yeah and so the models rely

1372
00:30:57,390 --> 00:30:57,400
interesting yeah and so the models rely
 

1373
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,310
interesting yeah and so the models rely
on the fact on the on an assumption that

1374
00:30:59,310 --> 00:30:59,320
on the fact on the on an assumption that
 

1375
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,690
on the fact on the on an assumption that
they're they're actually rigid but

1376
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:00,700
they're they're actually rigid but
 

1377
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:02,970
they're they're actually rigid but
that's not true if you're flying really

1378
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:02,980
that's not true if you're flying really
 

1379
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:06,360
that's not true if you're flying really
quickly these effects become significant

00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:06,370
quickly these effects become significant
 

1381
00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:09,390
quickly these effects become significant
if you're flying close to the ground you

1382
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:09,400
if you're flying close to the ground you
 

1383
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,940
if you're flying close to the ground you
get pushed off by the ground right

1384
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:11,950
get pushed off by the ground right
 

1385
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:13,800

00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:21,330
this is called a ground effect something
very few pilots think about is what

happens when you go close to a ceiling
 

1395
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:25,530
happens when you go close to a ceiling
well you get sucked into a ceiling there

1396
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:25,540
well you get sucked into a ceiling there

are very few aircrafts that fly close to
 

1399
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:30,240
are very few aircrafts that fly close to
any kind of ceiling likewise when you go

close to close to a wall there are these
 

1403
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:36,750
close to close to a wall there are these
wall effects and if you've gone on a

1404
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:36,760
wall effects and if you've gone on a
 

1405
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:39,180
wall effects and if you've gone on a
train and you pass another train that's

traveling in the opposite direction you
 

1409
00:31:40,930 --> 00:31:43,740
traveling in the opposite direction you
feel the buffeting and so these kinds of

00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:43,750
feel the buffeting and so these kinds of
 

1411
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:46,500

00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:03,700
tremendous plus to get everything right
would be awfully tedious so the way we

1426
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:03,710
would be awfully tedious so the way we
 

1427
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:06,970
would be awfully tedious so the way we
do this is over time we figure out how

1428
00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:06,980
do this is over time we figure out how
 

1429
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:09,910
do this is over time we figure out how
to adapt to these conditions

1430
00:32:09,910 --> 00:32:09,920
to adapt to these conditions
 

1431
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:12,730
to adapt to these conditions
so we've early on we use the form of

1432
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:12,740
so we've early on we use the form of
 

1433
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:15,370
so we've early on we use the form of
learning that we call iterative learning

1434
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:15,380
learning that we call iterative learning
 

1435
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:17,110
learning that we call iterative learning
so this idea if you want to perform a

1436
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:17,120
so this idea if you want to perform a
 

1437
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:20,110
so this idea if you want to perform a
task there are a few things that you

1438
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:20,120
task there are a few things that you
 

1439
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:24,670
task there are a few things that you
need to change and iterate over few

1440
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:24,680
need to change and iterate over few
 

1441
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:27,640
need to change and iterate over few
parameters that over time you can you

1442
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:27,650
parameters that over time you can you
 

1443
00:32:27,650 --> 00:32:31,390
parameters that over time you can you
can you can figure out so I could call

1444
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:31,400
can you can figure out so I could call
 

1445
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,340
can you can figure out so I could call
it policy gradient reinforcement

1446
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:33,350
it policy gradient reinforcement
 

1447
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:35,170
it policy gradient reinforcement
learning but actually this is iterative

1448
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:35,180
learning but actually this is iterative
 

1449
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:37,510
learning but actually this is iterative
learning learning and so this was their

1450
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:37,520
learning learning and so this was their
 

1451
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,550
learning learning and so this was their
way back I think what's interesting is

1452
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:39,560
way back I think what's interesting is
 

1453
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:43,200
way back I think what's interesting is
if you look at autonomous vehicles today

1454
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:43,210
if you look at autonomous vehicles today
 

1455
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:45,820
if you look at autonomous vehicles today
learning occurs could occur in two

1456
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:45,830
learning occurs could occur in two
 

1457
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:47,770
learning occurs could occur in two
pieces one is perception understanding

1458
00:32:47,770 --> 00:32:47,780
pieces one is perception understanding
 

1459
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:49,960
pieces one is perception understanding
the world second is action taking

1460
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:49,970
the world second is action taking
 

1461
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:53,710
the world second is action taking
actions everything that I've seen that

1462
00:32:53,710 --> 00:32:53,720
actions everything that I've seen that
 

1463
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,570
actions everything that I've seen that
is successful is on the perception side

1464
00:32:55,570 --> 00:32:55,580
is successful is on the perception side
 

1465
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:57,760
is successful is on the perception side
of things so in computer vision we've

1466
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:57,770
of things so in computer vision we've
 

1467
00:32:57,770 --> 00:32:59,770
of things so in computer vision we've
made amazing strides in the last ten

1468
00:32:59,770 --> 00:32:59,780
made amazing strides in the last ten
 

1469
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:02,410
made amazing strides in the last ten
years so recognizing objects actually

1470
00:33:02,410 --> 00:33:02,420
years so recognizing objects actually
 

1471
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:06,670
years so recognizing objects actually
detecting objects classifying them and

1472
00:33:06,670 --> 00:33:06,680
detecting objects classifying them and
 

1473
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,470
detecting objects classifying them and
and tagging them in some sense

1474
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:08,480
and tagging them in some sense
 

1475
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,420
and tagging them in some sense
annotating them this is all done through

1476
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:10,430
annotating them this is all done through
 

1477
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:13,030
annotating them this is all done through
machine learning on the action side on

1478
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:13,040
machine learning on the action side on
 

1479
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:15,040
machine learning on the action side on
the other hand I don't know if any

1480
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:15,050
the other hand I don't know if any
 

1481
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:17,380
the other hand I don't know if any
examples where there are fielded systems

1482
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:17,390
examples where there are fielded systems
 

1483
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:20,470
examples where there are fielded systems
where we actually learn the right

1484
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:20,480
where we actually learn the right
 

1485
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,870
where we actually learn the right
behavior outside a single demonstration

1486
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:22,880
behavior outside a single demonstration
 

1487
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,070
behavior outside a single demonstration
of successfully you know in the

1488
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:24,080
of successfully you know in the
 

1489
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,930
of successfully you know in the
laboratory this is the holy grail can

1490
00:33:25,930 --> 00:33:25,940
laboratory this is the holy grail can
 

1491
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:27,580
laboratory this is the holy grail can
you do end-to-end learning can you go

1492
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:27,590
you do end-to-end learning can you go
 

1493
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:29,440
you do end-to-end learning can you go
from pixels to motor block mode

1494
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:29,450
from pixels to motor block mode
 

1495
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:32,560
from pixels to motor block mode
occurrence this is really really hard

1496
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:32,570
occurrence this is really really hard
 

1497
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:36,310
occurrence this is really really hard
and I think if you look go forward the

1498
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:36,320
and I think if you look go forward the
 

1499
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,380
and I think if you look go forward the
right way to think about these things

1500
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:38,390
right way to think about these things
 

1501
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:42,490
right way to think about these things
is data driven approaches learning based

1502
00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:42,500
is data driven approaches learning based
 

1503
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:45,220
is data driven approaches learning based
approaches in concert with model-based

1504
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:45,230
approaches in concert with model-based
 

1505
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:47,440
approaches in concert with model-based
approaches which is the traditional way

1506
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:47,450
approaches which is the traditional way
 

1507
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:49,030
approaches which is the traditional way
of doing things by so I think there's a

1508
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:49,040
of doing things by so I think there's a
 

1509
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:51,070
of doing things by so I think there's a
piece there's a role for each of these

1510
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:51,080
piece there's a role for each of these
 

1511
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:53,620
piece there's a role for each of these
methodologies so what do you think just

1512
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:53,630
methodologies so what do you think just
 

1513
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:55,480
methodologies so what do you think just
jumping out in topic since you mention

1514
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:55,490
jumping out in topic since you mention
 

1515
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:57,550
jumping out in topic since you mention
autonomous vehicles what do you think

1516
00:33:57,550 --> 00:33:57,560
autonomous vehicles what do you think
 

1517
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,200
autonomous vehicles what do you think
are the limits and the perception sighs

1518
00:33:59,200 --> 00:33:59,210
are the limits and the perception sighs
 

1519
00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:02,560
are the limits and the perception sighs
so I've talked to Elon Musk and they're

1520
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:02,570
so I've talked to Elon Musk and they're
 

1521
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:04,720
so I've talked to Elon Musk and they're
on the perception side they're using

1522
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:04,730
on the perception side they're using
 

1523
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:07,130
on the perception side they're using
primarily computer vision to

1524
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:07,140
primarily computer vision to
 

1525
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:09,919
primarily computer vision to
see the environment in your work with

1526
00:34:09,919 --> 00:34:09,929
see the environment in your work with
 

1527
00:34:09,929 --> 00:34:12,590
see the environment in your work with
because you work with a real world a lot

1528
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:12,600
because you work with a real world a lot
 

1529
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,960
because you work with a real world a lot
in the physical world what are the

1530
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:14,970
in the physical world what are the
 

1531
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:17,090
in the physical world what are the
limits of computer vision do you think

1532
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:17,100
limits of computer vision do you think
 

1533
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:20,480
limits of computer vision do you think
you can solve autonomous vehicles focus

1534
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:20,490
you can solve autonomous vehicles focus
 

1535
00:34:20,490 --> 00:34:22,399
you can solve autonomous vehicles focus
on the perception side focusing on

1536
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:22,409
on the perception side focusing on
 

1537
00:34:22,409 --> 00:34:26,300
on the perception side focusing on
vision alone and machine learning so you

1538
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:26,310
vision alone and machine learning so you
 

1539
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:28,430
vision alone and machine learning so you
know we also have a spin-off company X

1540
00:34:28,430 --> 00:34:28,440
know we also have a spin-off company X
 

1541
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,649
know we also have a spin-off company X
and technologies that that works

1542
00:34:30,649 --> 00:34:30,659
and technologies that that works
 

1543
00:34:30,659 --> 00:34:33,560
and technologies that that works
underground in mines you go into mines

1544
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:33,570
underground in mines you go into mines
 

1545
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:37,790
underground in mines you go into mines
there they're dark they're dirty you fly

1546
00:34:37,790 --> 00:34:37,800
there they're dark they're dirty you fly
 

1547
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:40,550
there they're dark they're dirty you fly
in a dirty area there's stuff you kick

1548
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:40,560
in a dirty area there's stuff you kick
 

1549
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,350
in a dirty area there's stuff you kick
up from by the propellers the downwash

1550
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:42,360
up from by the propellers the downwash
 

1551
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:45,889
up from by the propellers the downwash
kicks up dust I challenge you to get a

1552
00:34:45,889 --> 00:34:45,899
kicks up dust I challenge you to get a
 

1553
00:34:45,899 --> 00:34:48,139
kicks up dust I challenge you to get a
computer vision algorithm to work there

1554
00:34:48,139 --> 00:34:48,149
computer vision algorithm to work there
 

1555
00:34:48,149 --> 00:34:52,720
computer vision algorithm to work there
yeah so we used lighters in that setting

1556
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:52,730
yeah so we used lighters in that setting
 

1557
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:56,450
yeah so we used lighters in that setting
indoors and even outdoors when we fly

1558
00:34:56,450 --> 00:34:56,460
indoors and even outdoors when we fly
 

1559
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:58,490
indoors and even outdoors when we fly
through fields I think there's a lot of

1560
00:34:58,490 --> 00:34:58,500
through fields I think there's a lot of
 

1561
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,500
through fields I think there's a lot of
potential for just solving the problem

1562
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:00,510
potential for just solving the problem
 

1563
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:03,740
potential for just solving the problem
using computer vision alone but I think

1564
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:03,750
using computer vision alone but I think
 

1565
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:06,950
using computer vision alone but I think
the bigger question is can you actually

1566
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:06,960
the bigger question is can you actually
 

1567
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,740
the bigger question is can you actually
solve or can you actually identify all

1568
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:09,750
solve or can you actually identify all
 

1569
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:12,950
solve or can you actually identify all
the corner cases using a sense single

1570
00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:12,960
the corner cases using a sense single
 

1571
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,840
the corner cases using a sense single
sensing modality and using learning

1572
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:14,850
sensing modality and using learning
 

1573
00:35:14,850 --> 00:35:17,360
sensing modality and using learning
alone so what's your intuition there so

1574
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:17,370
alone so what's your intuition there so
 

1575
00:35:17,370 --> 00:35:20,180
alone so what's your intuition there so
look if you have a corner case and your

1576
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:20,190
look if you have a corner case and your
 

1577
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:22,640
look if you have a corner case and your
algorithm doesn't work your instinct is

1578
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:22,650
algorithm doesn't work your instinct is
 

1579
00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:24,620
algorithm doesn't work your instinct is
to go get data about the corner case and

1580
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:24,630
to go get data about the corner case and
 

1581
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:27,620
to go get data about the corner case and
patch it up learn how to deal with that

1582
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:27,630
patch it up learn how to deal with that
 

1583
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:32,660
patch it up learn how to deal with that
corner case but at some point this is

1584
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:32,670
corner case but at some point this is
 

1585
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:34,730
corner case but at some point this is
going to saturate this approach is not

1586
00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:34,740
going to saturate this approach is not
 

1587
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:35,450
going to saturate this approach is not
viable

1588
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:35,460
viable
 

1589
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:39,350
viable
so today computer vision algorithms can

1590
00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:39,360
so today computer vision algorithms can
 

1591
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:41,660
so today computer vision algorithms can
detect 90% of the objects or can detect

1592
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:41,670
detect 90% of the objects or can detect
 

1593
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:43,520
detect 90% of the objects or can detect
objects 90% of the time classify them

1594
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:43,530
objects 90% of the time classify them
 

1595
00:35:43,530 --> 00:35:46,610
objects 90% of the time classify them
90% of the time cats on the Internet

1596
00:35:46,610 --> 00:35:46,620
90% of the time cats on the Internet
 

1597
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:49,640
90% of the time cats on the Internet
I probably can do 95 percent on here but

1598
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:49,650
I probably can do 95 percent on here but
 

1599
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:52,970
I probably can do 95 percent on here but
to get from 90% to 99% you need a lot

1600
00:35:52,970 --> 00:35:52,980
to get from 90% to 99% you need a lot
 

1601
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:55,070
to get from 90% to 99% you need a lot
more data and then I tell you well

1602
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:55,080
more data and then I tell you well
 

1603
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:57,020
more data and then I tell you well
that's not enough because I have a

1604
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:57,030
that's not enough because I have a
 

1605
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:58,580
that's not enough because I have a
safety critical application I want to go

1606
00:35:58,580 --> 00:35:58,590
safety critical application I want to go
 

1607
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:02,360
safety critical application I want to go
from 99% to 99.9 percent that's even

1608
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:02,370
from 99% to 99.9 percent that's even
 

1609
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:06,610
from 99% to 99.9 percent that's even
more data so I think if you look at

1610
00:36:06,610 --> 00:36:06,620
more data so I think if you look at
 

1611
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:12,710
more data so I think if you look at
wanting accuracy on the x-axis and look

1612
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:12,720
wanting accuracy on the x-axis and look
 

1613
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,230
wanting accuracy on the x-axis and look
at the amount of data on the y-axis I

1614
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:15,240
at the amount of data on the y-axis I
 

1615
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,360
at the amount of data on the y-axis I
believe that curve is an exponential

1616
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:17,370
believe that curve is an exponential
 

1617
00:36:17,370 --> 00:36:20,000
believe that curve is an exponential
curve Wow okay it's even hard if it's

1618
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:20,010
curve Wow okay it's even hard if it's
 

1619
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:21,049
curve Wow okay it's even hard if it's
linear

1620
00:36:21,049 --> 00:36:21,059
linear
 

1621
00:36:21,059 --> 00:36:22,549
linear
it's hard if it's linear totally but I

1622
00:36:22,549 --> 00:36:22,559
it's hard if it's linear totally but I
 

1623
00:36:22,559 --> 00:36:24,499
it's hard if it's linear totally but I
think it's exponential and the other

1624
00:36:24,499 --> 00:36:24,509
think it's exponential and the other
 

1625
00:36:24,509 --> 00:36:26,059
think it's exponential and the other
thing you have to think about is that

1626
00:36:26,059 --> 00:36:26,069
thing you have to think about is that
 

1627
00:36:26,069 --> 00:36:29,569
thing you have to think about is that
this process is a very very power hungry

1628
00:36:29,569 --> 00:36:29,579
this process is a very very power hungry
 

1629
00:36:29,579 --> 00:36:34,579
this process is a very very power hungry
process to run data farms or solar power

1630
00:36:34,579 --> 00:36:34,589
process to run data farms or solar power
 

1631
00:36:34,589 --> 00:36:36,799
process to run data farms or solar power
you mean literally power literally power

1632
00:36:36,799 --> 00:36:36,809
you mean literally power literally power
 

1633
00:36:36,809 --> 00:36:40,399
you mean literally power literally power
literally power so in 2014 five years

00:36:40,399 --> 00:36:40,409
literally power so in 2014 five years
 

1635

two percent of US electricity

1638
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:44,880
two percent of US electricity
 

1639
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:50,709
two percent of US electricity
consumption was from data forms so we

1640
00:36:50,709 --> 00:36:50,719
consumption was from data forms so we
 

1641
00:36:50,719 --> 00:36:53,120
consumption was from data forms so we
think about this as an information

1642
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:53,130
think about this as an information
 

1643

processing problem and so unless we
 

1649
00:37:00,209 --> 00:37:02,120
processing problem and so unless we
figured out better ways of doing this I

1650
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:02,130
figured out better ways of doing this I
 

1651
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:05,630
figured out better ways of doing this I
don't think this is viable so talking

1652
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:05,640
don't think this is viable so talking
 

1653
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,249
don't think this is viable so talking
about driving which is a safety critical

1654
00:37:07,249 --> 00:37:07,259
about driving which is a safety critical
 

1655
00:37:07,259 --> 00:37:09,289
about driving which is a safety critical

application and some aspect the flight
 

1657
00:37:09,299 --> 00:37:12,979

is safety critical maybe philosophical

1658
00:37:12,979 --> 00:37:12,989
is safety critical maybe philosophical
 

1659
00:37:12,989 --> 00:37:14,599
is safety critical maybe philosophical
question maybe an engineering one what

1660
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:14,609
question maybe an engineering one what
 

1661
00:37:14,609 --> 00:37:16,249
question maybe an engineering one what
problem do you think is harder to solve

autonomous driving or autonomous flight

1664
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:18,890
autonomous driving or autonomous flight
 

1665
00:37:18,890 --> 00:37:21,469
autonomous driving or autonomous flight
that's a really interesting question I

1666
00:37:21,469 --> 00:37:21,479
that's a really interesting question I
 

1667
00:37:21,479 --> 00:37:26,179
that's a really interesting question I
think autonomous flight has several

1668
00:37:26,179 --> 00:37:26,189
think autonomous flight has several
 

1669
00:37:26,189 --> 00:37:28,549
think autonomous flight has several
advantages that autonomous driving

1670
00:37:28,549 --> 00:37:28,559
advantages that autonomous driving
 

1671
00:37:28,559 --> 00:37:32,029
advantages that autonomous driving
doesn't have so look if I want to go

1672
00:37:32,029 --> 00:37:32,039
doesn't have so look if I want to go
 

1673
00:37:32,039 --> 00:37:34,669
doesn't have so look if I want to go
from point A to point B I have a very

1674
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:34,679
from point A to point B I have a very
 

1675
00:37:34,679 --> 00:37:37,219
from point A to point B I have a very
very safe trajectory go vertically up to

1676
00:37:37,219 --> 00:37:37,229
very safe trajectory go vertically up to
 

1677
00:37:37,229 --> 00:37:39,679
very safe trajectory go vertically up to
a maximum altitude fly horizontally to

1678
00:37:39,679 --> 00:37:39,689
a maximum altitude fly horizontally to
 

1679
00:37:39,689 --> 00:37:41,449
a maximum altitude fly horizontally to
just about the destination and then come

1680
00:37:41,449 --> 00:37:41,459
just about the destination and then come
 

1681
00:37:41,459 --> 00:37:46,120
just about the destination and then come
down vertically this is pre-programmed

1682
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:46,130
down vertically this is pre-programmed
 

1683
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:49,130
down vertically this is pre-programmed
the equivalent of that is very hard to

1684
00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:49,140
the equivalent of that is very hard to
 

1685
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:51,259
the equivalent of that is very hard to
find in a self-driving car car world

00:37:51,259 --> 00:37:51,269
find in a self-driving car car world
 

1687
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:53,509
find in a self-driving car car world
because you're on the ground you're in a

1688
00:37:53,509 --> 00:37:53,519
because you're on the ground you're in a
 

1689
00:37:53,519 --> 00:37:56,059
because you're on the ground you're in a
two-dimensional surface and the

1690
00:37:56,059 --> 00:37:56,069
two-dimensional surface and the
 

1691
00:37:56,069 --> 00:37:57,409
two-dimensional surface and the
trajectories in the two-dimensional

1692
00:37:57,409 --> 00:37:57,419
trajectories in the two-dimensional
 

1693
00:37:57,419 --> 00:37:59,779
trajectories in the two-dimensional
surface are more likely to encounter

1694
00:37:59,779 --> 00:37:59,789
surface are more likely to encounter
 

1695
00:37:59,789 --> 00:38:03,319
surface are more likely to encounter
obstacles I mean this in an intuitive

1696
00:38:03,319 --> 00:38:03,329
obstacles I mean this in an intuitive
 

1697
00:38:03,329 --> 00:38:05,349
obstacles I mean this in an intuitive
sense but mathematically true that's

1698
00:38:05,349 --> 00:38:05,359
sense but mathematically true that's
 

1699
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:07,269
sense but mathematically true that's
mathematically as well that's true

1700
00:38:07,269 --> 00:38:07,279
mathematically as well that's true
 

1701
00:38:07,279 --> 00:38:10,039
mathematically as well that's true
there's another option on the 2g space

1702
00:38:10,039 --> 00:38:10,049
there's another option on the 2g space
 

1703
00:38:10,049 --> 00:38:12,739
there's another option on the 2g space
of platooning or because there's so many

1704
00:38:12,739 --> 00:38:12,749
of platooning or because there's so many
 

1705
00:38:12,749 --> 00:38:14,329
of platooning or because there's so many
obstacles you can connect with those

1706
00:38:14,329 --> 00:38:14,339
obstacles you can connect with those
 

1707
00:38:14,339 --> 00:38:16,519
obstacles you can connect with those
obstacles and all these those exist in

1708
00:38:16,519 --> 00:38:16,529
obstacles and all these those exist in
 

1709
00:38:16,529 --> 00:38:18,319
obstacles and all these those exist in
the three-dimensional space is wrong so

1710
00:38:18,319 --> 00:38:18,329
the three-dimensional space is wrong so
 

1711
00:38:18,329 --> 00:38:21,799
the three-dimensional space is wrong so
they do so the question also implies how

1712
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:21,809
they do so the question also implies how
 

1713
00:38:21,809 --> 00:38:23,719
they do so the question also implies how
difficult are obstacles in the

1714
00:38:23,719 --> 00:38:23,729
difficult are obstacles in the
 

1715
00:38:23,729 --> 00:38:26,359
difficult are obstacles in the
three-dimensional space in flight so so

1716
00:38:26,359 --> 00:38:26,369
three-dimensional space in flight so so
 

1717
00:38:26,369 --> 00:38:27,679
three-dimensional space in flight so so
that's the downside I think in

1718
00:38:27,679 --> 00:38:27,689
that's the downside I think in
 

1719
00:38:27,689 --> 00:38:29,089
that's the downside I think in
three-dimensional space you're modeling

1720
00:38:29,089 --> 00:38:29,099
three-dimensional space you're modeling
 

1721
00:38:29,099 --> 00:38:31,579
three-dimensional space you're modeling
three-dimensional world not just just

1722
00:38:31,579 --> 00:38:31,589
three-dimensional world not just just
 

1723
00:38:31,589 --> 00:38:33,620
three-dimensional world not just just
because you want to avoid it but you

1724
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:33,630
because you want to avoid it but you
 

1725
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:34,870
because you want to avoid it but you
want a reason about it

1726
00:38:34,870 --> 00:38:34,880
want a reason about it
 

1727
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:35,650
want a reason about it
you want to work in the

1728
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:35,660
you want to work in the
 

1729
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:37,480
you want to work in the
three-dimensional environment and that's

1730
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:37,490
three-dimensional environment and that's
 

1731
00:38:37,490 --> 00:38:40,059
three-dimensional environment and that's
significantly harder so that's one

1732
00:38:40,059 --> 00:38:40,069
significantly harder so that's one
 

1733
00:38:40,069 --> 00:38:41,140
significantly harder so that's one
disadvantage I think the second

1734
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:41,150
disadvantage I think the second
 

1735
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:43,539
disadvantage I think the second
disadvantage is of course anytime you

1736
00:38:43,539 --> 00:38:43,549
disadvantage is of course anytime you
 

1737
00:38:43,549 --> 00:38:45,519
disadvantage is of course anytime you
fly you have to put up with the

1738
00:38:45,519 --> 00:38:45,529
fly you have to put up with the
 

1739
00:38:45,529 --> 00:38:48,269
fly you have to put up with the
peculiarities of aerodynamics and

1740
00:38:48,269 --> 00:38:48,279
peculiarities of aerodynamics and
 

1741
00:38:48,279 --> 00:38:50,680
peculiarities of aerodynamics and
they're complicated environments how do

1742
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:50,690
they're complicated environments how do
 

1743

they're complicated environments how do
you negotiate that so that's always a

1744
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:52,190
you negotiate that so that's always a
 

1745
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:55,660
you negotiate that so that's always a
problem if you see a time in the future

1746
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:55,670
problem if you see a time in the future
 

1747
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:58,049
problem if you see a time in the future
where there is you mentioned them

1748
00:38:58,049 --> 00:38:58,059
where there is you mentioned them
 

1749
00:38:58,059 --> 00:39:00,519
where there is you mentioned them
there's an agriculture application so

1750
00:39:00,519 --> 00:39:00,529
there's an agriculture application so
 

1751
00:39:00,529 --> 00:39:02,559
there's an agriculture application so
there's a lot of applications of flying

1752
00:39:02,559 --> 00:39:02,569
there's a lot of applications of flying
 

1753
00:39:02,569 --> 00:39:04,450
there's a lot of applications of flying
robots but do you see a time in the

1754
00:39:04,450 --> 00:39:04,460
robots but do you see a time in the
 

1755
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:06,819
robots but do you see a time in the
future where there is tens of thousands

1756
00:39:06,819 --> 00:39:06,829
future where there is tens of thousands
 

1757
00:39:06,829 --> 00:39:08,680
future where there is tens of thousands
or maybe hundreds of thousands of

1758
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:08,690
or maybe hundreds of thousands of
 

1759
00:39:08,690 --> 00:39:11,009
or maybe hundreds of thousands of
delivery drones they fill the sky a

1760

delivery flying robots I think there's a

1762
00:39:14,589 --> 00:39:14,599
delivery flying robots I think there's a
 

1763
00:39:14,599 --> 00:39:16,809
delivery flying robots I think there's a
lot of potential for the last mile

1764
00:39:16,809 --> 00:39:16,819
lot of potential for the last mile
 

1765
00:39:16,819 --> 00:39:20,940
lot of potential for the last mile
delivery and so in crowded cities I

1766
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:20,950
delivery and so in crowded cities I
 

1767
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:22,960
delivery and so in crowded cities I
don't know if you go if you go to a

00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:22,970
don't know if you go if you go to a
 

1769
00:39:22,970 --> 00:39:24,910
don't know if you go if you go to a
place like Hong Kong just crossing the

1770
00:39:24,910 --> 00:39:24,920
place like Hong Kong just crossing the
 

1771
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:28,089
place like Hong Kong just crossing the
river can take half an hour and while a

at most
 

1777
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:34,720
at most
I think you look at a delivery of

1778
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:34,730
I think you look at a delivery of
 

1779
00:39:34,730 --> 00:39:39,279
I think you look at a delivery of
supplies to remote villages I work with

so just delivering drugs retrieving

1794
00:40:00,249 --> 00:40:00,259
so just delivering drugs retrieving

I think there's huge potential here so I

1798
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:07,160
I think there's huge potential here so I
 

1799
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,950
I think there's huge potential here so I
think if the challenges are not

1800
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:08,960
think if the challenges are not
 

1801
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,809
think if the challenges are not
technological that the challenge is

1802
00:40:10,809 --> 00:40:10,819
technological that the challenge is
 

1803
00:40:10,819 --> 00:40:14,019
technological that the challenge is
economical the one thing I'll tell you

1804
00:40:14,019 --> 00:40:14,029
economical the one thing I'll tell you
 

1805
00:40:14,029 --> 00:40:17,620
economical the one thing I'll tell you
that nobody thinks about is the fact

1806
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:17,630
that nobody thinks about is the fact
 

1807
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:19,539
that nobody thinks about is the fact
that we've not made huge strides in

1808
00:40:19,539 --> 00:40:19,549
that we've not made huge strides in
 

1809
00:40:19,549 --> 00:40:22,329
that we've not made huge strides in
battery technology yes it's true

1810
00:40:22,329 --> 00:40:22,339
battery technology yes it's true
 

1811
00:40:22,339 --> 00:40:24,099
battery technology yes it's true
batteries are becoming less expensive

1812
00:40:24,099 --> 00:40:24,109
batteries are becoming less expensive
 

1813
00:40:24,109 --> 00:40:25,749
batteries are becoming less expensive
because we have these mega factories

1814
00:40:25,749 --> 00:40:25,759
because we have these mega factories
 

1815
00:40:25,759 --> 00:40:27,730
because we have these mega factories
that are coming up but they're all based

1816
00:40:27,730 --> 00:40:27,740
that are coming up but they're all based
 

1817
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:29,769
that are coming up but they're all based
on lithium based technologies and if you

1818
00:40:29,769 --> 00:40:29,779
on lithium based technologies and if you
 

1819
00:40:29,779 --> 00:40:32,920
on lithium based technologies and if you
look at the energy density and the power

1820
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:32,930
look at the energy density and the power
 

1821
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:35,470
look at the energy density and the power
density those are two fundamentally

1822
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:35,480
density those are two fundamentally
 

1823
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:39,880
density those are two fundamentally
limiting numbers so power density is

1824
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:39,890
limiting numbers so power density is
 

1825
00:40:39,890 --> 00:40:41,920
limiting numbers so power density is
important because for a UAV to take off

1826
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:41,930
important because for a UAV to take off
 

1827
00:40:41,930 --> 00:40:43,599
important because for a UAV to take off
vertically into the air which most

1828
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:43,609
vertically into the air which most
 

1829
00:40:43,609 --> 00:40:45,789
vertically into the air which most
drones do they're not they don't have a

1830
00:40:45,789 --> 00:40:45,799
drones do they're not they don't have a
 

1831
00:40:45,799 --> 00:40:48,420
drones do they're not they don't have a
runway you consume roughly two and

1832
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:48,430
runway you consume roughly two and
 

1833
00:40:48,430 --> 00:40:52,350
runway you consume roughly two and
watts per kilo at the small size that's

1834
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:52,360
watts per kilo at the small size that's
 

1835
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:55,920
watts per kilo at the small size that's
a lot right in contrast the human brain

1836
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:55,930
a lot right in contrast the human brain
 

1837
00:40:55,930 --> 00:40:58,560
a lot right in contrast the human brain
consumes less than 80 watts the whole of

1838
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:58,570
consumes less than 80 watts the whole of
 

1839
00:40:58,570 --> 00:41:01,890
consumes less than 80 watts the whole of
the human brain so just imagine just

1840
00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:01,900
the human brain so just imagine just
 

1841
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:04,590
the human brain so just imagine just
lifting yourself into the air is like

1842
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:04,600
lifting yourself into the air is like
 

1843
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:07,050
lifting yourself into the air is like
two or three lightbulbs which makes no

1844
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:07,060
two or three lightbulbs which makes no
 

1845
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:09,630
two or three lightbulbs which makes no
sense to me yes so you're going to have

1846
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:09,640
sense to me yes so you're going to have
 

1847
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:11,850
sense to me yes so you're going to have
to at scale solve the energy problem

1848
00:41:11,850 --> 00:41:11,860
to at scale solve the energy problem
 

1849
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:17,490
to at scale solve the energy problem
then charging the batteries storing the

1850
00:41:17,490 --> 00:41:17,500
then charging the batteries storing the
 

1851
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:19,710
then charging the batteries storing the
the energy and so on and then the

1852
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:19,720
the energy and so on and then the
 

1853
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:21,270
the energy and so on and then the
storage is the second problem but

1854
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:21,280
storage is the second problem but
 

1855
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:24,960
storage is the second problem but
storage limits the range but you know

1856
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:24,970
storage limits the range but you know
 

1857
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:26,850
storage limits the range but you know
you you you have to remember that you

1858
00:41:26,850 --> 00:41:26,860
you you you have to remember that you
 

1859
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:30,230
you you you have to remember that you
you have to you have to burn a lot of it

1860
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:30,240
you have to you have to burn a lot of it
 

1861
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:33,600
you have to you have to burn a lot of it
for a given time so the turning which is

1862
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:33,610
for a given time so the turning which is
 

1863
00:41:33,610 --> 00:41:35,340
for a given time so the turning which is
the pop which is a power question yes

1864
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:35,350
the pop which is a power question yes
 

1865
00:41:35,350 --> 00:41:38,550
the pop which is a power question yes
and do you think just your intuition

1866
00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:38,560
and do you think just your intuition
 

1867
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:42,600
and do you think just your intuition
there there are breakthroughs in

1868
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:42,610
there there are breakthroughs in
 

1869
00:41:42,610 --> 00:41:46,050
there there are breakthroughs in
batteries on the horizon how hard is

1870
00:41:46,050 --> 00:41:46,060
batteries on the horizon how hard is
 

1871
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:47,610
batteries on the horizon how hard is
that problem look there are a lot of

1872
00:41:47,610 --> 00:41:47,620
that problem look there are a lot of
 

1873
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:50,520
that problem look there are a lot of
companies that are promising flying cars

1874
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:50,530
companies that are promising flying cars
 

1875
00:41:50,530 --> 00:41:54,960
companies that are promising flying cars
but there are autonomous and that are

1876
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:54,970
but there are autonomous and that are
 

1877
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:59,830
but there are autonomous and that are
clean

1878
00:41:59,830 --> 00:41:59,840

 

1879
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:02,290

I think there over-promising the

1880
00:42:02,290 --> 00:42:02,300
I think there over-promising the
 

1881
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:05,770
I think there over-promising the
autonomy piece is durable the clean

1882
00:42:05,770 --> 00:42:05,780
autonomy piece is durable the clean
 

1883
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:07,800
autonomy piece is durable the clean
piece I don't think so

1884
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:07,810
piece I don't think so
 

1885
00:42:07,810 --> 00:42:10,060
piece I don't think so
there's another company that I work with

there's another company that I work with
called jet otra they make small jet

1888
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:13,970
called jet otra they make small jet
 

1889
00:42:13,970 --> 00:42:17,290

00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:22,420
miles an hour very easily and left 50
kilos but their jet engines they're

1894
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:22,430
kilos but their jet engines they're
 

1895
00:42:22,430 --> 00:42:25,570
kilos but their jet engines they're
efficient there are little louder than

1896
00:42:25,570 --> 00:42:25,580
efficient there are little louder than
 

1897
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:27,790
efficient there are little louder than
electric vehicles but they can bail

1898
00:42:27,790 --> 00:42:27,800
electric vehicles but they can bail
 

1899
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:30,910
electric vehicles but they can bail
flying cars so your sense is that

1900
00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:30,920
flying cars so your sense is that
 

1901
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:33,010
flying cars so your sense is that
there's a lot of pieces that have come

1902
00:42:33,010 --> 00:42:33,020
there's a lot of pieces that have come
 

1903
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:37,390
there's a lot of pieces that have come
together so on this crazy question if

1904
00:42:37,390 --> 00:42:37,400
together so on this crazy question if
 

1905
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,190
together so on this crazy question if
you look at companies like Kitty Hawk

1906
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:39,200
you look at companies like Kitty Hawk
 

1907
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:43,200
you look at companies like Kitty Hawk
working on electrics of clean I'm

1908
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:43,210
working on electrics of clean I'm
 

1909
00:42:43,210 --> 00:42:46,150
working on electrics of clean I'm
talking to Sebastian Thrun right it's a

1910
00:42:46,150 --> 00:42:46,160
talking to Sebastian Thrun right it's a
 

1911
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:50,830
talking to Sebastian Thrun right it's a
it's a crazy dream you know but you work

1912
00:42:50,830 --> 00:42:50,840
it's a crazy dream you know but you work
 

1913
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:51,970
it's a crazy dream you know but you work
with flight a lot

1914
00:42:51,970 --> 00:42:51,980
with flight a lot
 

1915
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:55,180
with flight a lot
you've mentioned before that manned

1916
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:55,190
you've mentioned before that manned
 

1917
00:42:55,190 --> 00:42:57,700
you've mentioned before that manned
flights are carrying of the human body

1918
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:57,710
flights are carrying of the human body
 

1919
00:42:57,710 --> 00:43:03,190
flights are carrying of the human body
is very difficult to do so how crazy is

1920
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:03,200
is very difficult to do so how crazy is
 

1921
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,900
is very difficult to do so how crazy is
flying cars do you think there will be a

1922
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:04,910
flying cars do you think there will be a
 

1923
00:43:04,910 --> 00:43:08,440
flying cars do you think there will be a
day when we have vertical takeoff and

1924
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:08,450
day when we have vertical takeoff and
 

1925
00:43:08,450 --> 00:43:12,790
day when we have vertical takeoff and
landing vehicles that are sufficiently

1926
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:12,800
landing vehicles that are sufficiently
 

1927
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:16,270
landing vehicles that are sufficiently
affordable that we're going to see a

1928
00:43:16,270 --> 00:43:16,280
affordable that we're going to see a
 

1929
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:18,040
affordable that we're going to see a
huge amount of them and they would look

1930
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:18,050
huge amount of them and they would look
 

1931
00:43:18,050 --> 00:43:19,870
huge amount of them and they would look
like something like we dream of when we

1932
00:43:19,870 --> 00:43:19,880
like something like we dream of when we
 

1933
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:21,430
like something like we dream of when we
think about flying cars yeah like the

1934
00:43:21,430 --> 00:43:21,440
think about flying cars yeah like the
 

1935
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,800
think about flying cars yeah like the
Jetsons The Jetsons yeah so look there

1936
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:23,810
Jetsons The Jetsons yeah so look there
 

1937
00:43:23,810 --> 00:43:25,180
Jetsons The Jetsons yeah so look there
are a lot of smart people working on

1938
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:25,190
are a lot of smart people working on
 

1939
00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:29,080
are a lot of smart people working on
this and you never say something is not

1940
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:29,090
this and you never say something is not
 

1941
00:43:29,090 --> 00:43:30,340
this and you never say something is not
possible when you're people like

1942
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:30,350
possible when you're people like
 

1943
00:43:30,350 --> 00:43:31,870
possible when you're people like
Sebastian Thrun working on it

1944
00:43:31,870 --> 00:43:31,880
Sebastian Thrun working on it
 

1945
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:35,140
Sebastian Thrun working on it
so I totally think it's viable I

1946
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:35,150
so I totally think it's viable I
 

1947
00:43:35,150 --> 00:43:38,350
so I totally think it's viable I
question again the electric piece they

1948
00:43:38,350 --> 00:43:38,360
question again the electric piece they
 

1949
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:40,360
question again the electric piece they
let you pee on it and again for short

1950
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:40,370
let you pee on it and again for short
 

1951
00:43:40,370 --> 00:43:42,760
let you pee on it and again for short
distances you can do it and there's no

1952
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:42,770
distances you can do it and there's no
 

1953
00:43:42,770 --> 00:43:44,080
distances you can do it and there's no
reason to suggest that these are all

1954
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:44,090
reason to suggest that these are all
 

1955
00:43:44,090 --> 00:43:46,300
reason to suggest that these are all
just have to be rotorcraft you take off

1956
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:46,310
just have to be rotorcraft you take off
 

1957
00:43:46,310 --> 00:43:48,460
just have to be rotorcraft you take off
vertically but the new morph into a

1958
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:48,470
vertically but the new morph into a
 

1959
00:43:48,470 --> 00:43:50,200
vertically but the new morph into a
forward flight I think there are a lot

1960
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:50,210
forward flight I think there are a lot
 

1961
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:52,840
forward flight I think there are a lot
of interesting designs the question to

1962
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:52,850
of interesting designs the question to
 

1963
00:43:52,850 --> 00:43:55,150
of interesting designs the question to
me is is are these economically viable

1964
00:43:55,150 --> 00:43:55,160
me is is are these economically viable
 

1965
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:58,600
me is is are these economically viable
and if you agree to do this with fossil

1966
00:43:58,600 --> 00:43:58,610
and if you agree to do this with fossil
 

1967
00:43:58,610 --> 00:44:00,550
and if you agree to do this with fossil
fuels that instinct immediately becomes

1968
00:44:00,550 --> 00:44:00,560
fuels that instinct immediately becomes
 

1969
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:03,820
fuels that instinct immediately becomes
viable that's a real challenge do you

1970
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:03,830
viable that's a real challenge do you
 

1971
00:44:03,830 --> 00:44:06,160
viable that's a real challenge do you
think it's possible for robots and

1972
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:06,170
think it's possible for robots and
 

1973
00:44:06,170 --> 00:44:07,960
think it's possible for robots and
humans to collaborate successfully on

1974
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:07,970
humans to collaborate successfully on
 

1975
00:44:07,970 --> 00:44:11,710
humans to collaborate successfully on
tasks so a lot of robotics folks that I

1976
00:44:11,710 --> 00:44:11,720
tasks so a lot of robotics folks that I
 

1977
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:13,390
tasks so a lot of robotics folks that I
talk to and work with

1978
00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:13,400
talk to and work with
 

1979
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:17,080
talk to and work with
I mean humans just add a giant mess to

1980
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:17,090
I mean humans just add a giant mess to
 

1981
00:44:17,090 --> 00:44:19,420
I mean humans just add a giant mess to
the picture so it's best to remove them

1982
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:19,430
the picture so it's best to remove them
 

1983
00:44:19,430 --> 00:44:21,310
the picture so it's best to remove them
from consideration when solving specific

1984
00:44:21,310 --> 00:44:21,320
from consideration when solving specific
 

1985
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:23,350
from consideration when solving specific
tasks it's very difficult to model

1986
00:44:23,350 --> 00:44:23,360
tasks it's very difficult to model
 

1987
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:25,900
tasks it's very difficult to model
there's just a source of uncertainty in

1988
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:25,910
there's just a source of uncertainty in
 

1989
00:44:25,910 --> 00:44:32,200
there's just a source of uncertainty in
your work with these agile flying robots

1990
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:32,210
your work with these agile flying robots
 

1991
00:44:32,210 --> 00:44:34,150
your work with these agile flying robots
do you think there's a role for

1992
00:44:34,150 --> 00:44:34,160
do you think there's a role for
 

1993
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:36,250
do you think there's a role for
collaboration with humans or is it best

1994
00:44:36,250 --> 00:44:36,260
collaboration with humans or is it best
 

1995
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:40,330
collaboration with humans or is it best
to model tasks in a way that that

1996
00:44:40,330 --> 00:44:40,340
to model tasks in a way that that
 

1997
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:43,540
to model tasks in a way that that
doesn't have a human in the picture well

1998
00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:43,550
doesn't have a human in the picture well
 

1999
00:44:43,550 --> 00:44:46,120
doesn't have a human in the picture well
I I don't think we should ever think

2000
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:46,130
I I don't think we should ever think
 

2001
00:44:46,130 --> 00:44:47,530
I I don't think we should ever think
about robots without human in the

2002
00:44:47,530 --> 00:44:47,540
about robots without human in the
 

2003
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:49,540
about robots without human in the
picture ultimately robots are there

2004
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:49,550
picture ultimately robots are there
 

2005
00:44:49,550 --> 00:44:52,000
picture ultimately robots are there
because we want them to solve problems

2006
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:52,010
because we want them to solve problems
 

2007
00:44:52,010 --> 00:44:56,320
because we want them to solve problems
for humans right but there is no general

2008
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:56,330
for humans right but there is no general
 

2009
00:44:56,330 --> 00:44:58,840
for humans right but there is no general
solution to this problem I think if you

2010
00:44:58,840 --> 00:44:58,850
solution to this problem I think if you
 

2011
00:44:58,850 --> 00:45:00,760
solution to this problem I think if you
look at human interaction and how humans

2012
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:00,770
look at human interaction and how humans
 

2013
00:45:00,770 --> 00:45:03,280
look at human interaction and how humans
interact with robots you know we think

2014
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:03,290
interact with robots you know we think
 

2015
00:45:03,290 --> 00:45:05,710
interact with robots you know we think
of these in three different ways one is

2016
00:45:05,710 --> 00:45:05,720
of these in three different ways one is
 

2017
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:09,100
of these in three different ways one is
the human commanding the robot the

2018
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:09,110
the human commanding the robot the
 

2019
00:45:09,110 --> 00:45:12,370
the human commanding the robot the
second is the human collaborating with

2020
00:45:12,370 --> 00:45:12,380
second is the human collaborating with
 

2021
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:14,230
second is the human collaborating with
the robot so for example we work on how

2022
00:45:14,230 --> 00:45:14,240
the robot so for example we work on how
 

2023
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:17,530
the robot so for example we work on how
a robot can actually pick up things with

2024
00:45:17,530 --> 00:45:17,540
a robot can actually pick up things with
 

2025
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:19,210
a robot can actually pick up things with
a human will carry things that's like

2026
00:45:19,210 --> 00:45:19,220
a human will carry things that's like
 

2027
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:22,780
a human will carry things that's like
true collaboration and third we think

2028
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:22,790
true collaboration and third we think
 

2029
00:45:22,790 --> 00:45:25,690
true collaboration and third we think
about humans as by standards so driving

2030
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:25,700
about humans as by standards so driving
 

2031
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:27,490
about humans as by standards so driving
cars what's the human's role and how

2032
00:45:27,490 --> 00:45:27,500
cars what's the human's role and how
 

2033
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:29,910
cars what's the human's role and how
does how do self-driving cars

2034
00:45:29,910 --> 00:45:29,920
does how do self-driving cars
 

2035
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:33,160
does how do self-driving cars
acknowledge the presence of humans so I

2036
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:33,170
acknowledge the presence of humans so I
 

2037
00:45:33,170 --> 00:45:34,960
acknowledge the presence of humans so I
think all of these things are different

2038
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:34,970
think all of these things are different
 

2039
00:45:34,970 --> 00:45:37,000
think all of these things are different
scenarios it depends on what kind of

2040
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:37,010
scenarios it depends on what kind of
 

2041
00:45:37,010 --> 00:45:40,120
scenarios it depends on what kind of
humans were kind of tasks and I think

2042
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:40,130
humans were kind of tasks and I think
 

2043
00:45:40,130 --> 00:45:42,820
humans were kind of tasks and I think
it's very difficult to say that there's

2044
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:42,830
it's very difficult to say that there's
 

2045
00:45:42,830 --> 00:45:44,800
it's very difficult to say that there's
a general theory that we all have for

2046
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:44,810
a general theory that we all have for
 

2047
00:45:44,810 --> 00:45:47,560
a general theory that we all have for
this but at the same time it's also

2048
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:47,570
this but at the same time it's also
 

2049
00:45:47,570 --> 00:45:49,570
this but at the same time it's also
silly to say that we we should think

2050
00:45:49,570 --> 00:45:49,580
silly to say that we we should think
 

2051
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:52,300
silly to say that we we should think
about robots independent of humans so to

2052
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:52,310
about robots independent of humans so to
 

2053
00:45:52,310 --> 00:45:57,070
about robots independent of humans so to
me human robot interaction is almost a

2054
00:45:57,070 --> 00:45:57,080
me human robot interaction is almost a
 

2055
00:45:57,080 --> 00:46:00,280
me human robot interaction is almost a
mandatory aspect of everything we do yes

2056
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:00,290
mandatory aspect of everything we do yes
 

2057
00:46:00,290 --> 00:46:01,990
mandatory aspect of everything we do yes
so but the Jewish to agree so with your

2058
00:46:01,990 --> 00:46:02,000
so but the Jewish to agree so with your
 

2059
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,610
so but the Jewish to agree so with your
thoughts if you jump to autonomous

2060
00:46:03,610 --> 00:46:03,620
thoughts if you jump to autonomous
 

2061
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:06,700
thoughts if you jump to autonomous
vehicles for example there's a there's a

2062
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:06,710
vehicles for example there's a there's a
 

2063
00:46:06,710 --> 00:46:09,220
vehicles for example there's a there's a
big debate between what's called level 2

2064
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:09,230
big debate between what's called level 2
 

2065
00:46:09,230 --> 00:46:12,010
big debate between what's called level 2
and level 4 so semi autonomous and

2066
00:46:12,010 --> 00:46:12,020
and level 4 so semi autonomous and
 

2067
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:14,500
and level 4 so semi autonomous and
autonomous vehicles instead of the Tesla

2068
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:14,510
autonomous vehicles instead of the Tesla
 

2069
00:46:14,510 --> 00:46:17,080
autonomous vehicles instead of the Tesla
approach currently at least has a lot of

2070
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:17,090
approach currently at least has a lot of
 

2071
00:46:17,090 --> 00:46:18,730
approach currently at least has a lot of
collaboration between human and machine

2072
00:46:18,730 --> 00:46:18,740
collaboration between human and machine
 

2073
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:21,190
collaboration between human and machine
so the human is supposed to actively

2074
00:46:21,190 --> 00:46:21,200
so the human is supposed to actively
 

2075
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:23,440
so the human is supposed to actively
supervise the operation of the robot the

2076
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:23,450
supervise the operation of the robot the
 

2077
00:46:23,450 --> 00:46:26,099
supervise the operation of the robot the
part of the safety

2078
00:46:26,099 --> 00:46:26,109
part of the safety
 

2079
00:46:26,109 --> 00:46:29,099
part of the safety
a definition of how safe a robot is in

2080
00:46:29,099 --> 00:46:29,109
a definition of how safe a robot is in
 

2081
00:46:29,109 --> 00:46:31,470
a definition of how safe a robot is in
that case is how effective is the human

2082
00:46:31,470 --> 00:46:31,480
that case is how effective is the human
 

2083
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:34,290
that case is how effective is the human
and monitoring it do you think that's

2084
00:46:34,290 --> 00:46:34,300
and monitoring it do you think that's
 

2085
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:40,620
and monitoring it do you think that's
ultimately not a good approach in sort

2086
00:46:40,620 --> 00:46:40,630
ultimately not a good approach in sort
 

2087
00:46:40,630 --> 00:46:43,920
ultimately not a good approach in sort
of having a human in the picture not as

00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:43,930
of having a human in the picture not as
 

2089
00:46:43,930 --> 00:46:46,290
of having a human in the picture not as
a bystander or part of the

2090
00:46:46,290 --> 00:46:46,300
a bystander or part of the
 

2091
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:48,660
a bystander or part of the
infrastructure but really as part of

2092
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:48,670
infrastructure but really as part of
 

2093
00:46:48,670 --> 00:46:50,970
infrastructure but really as part of
what's required to make the system safe

what's required to make the system safe
 

2095
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:53,820
what's required to make the system safe
this is harder than it sounds yes I

2096
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:53,830
this is harder than it sounds yes I
 

2097
00:46:53,830 --> 00:46:58,140
this is harder than it sounds yes I
think you know if you if you if I mean

2098
00:46:58,140 --> 00:46:58,150
think you know if you if you if I mean
 

2099
00:46:58,150 --> 00:46:59,970

I'm sure you've driven the driven before

2100
00:46:59,970 --> 00:46:59,980
I'm sure you've driven the driven before
 

2101
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:02,339
I'm sure you've driven the driven before
and highways and so on it's it's really

2102
00:47:02,339 --> 00:47:02,349
and highways and so on it's it's really
 

2103
00:47:02,349 --> 00:47:05,910
and highways and so on it's it's really
very hard to have to relinquish controls

2104
00:47:05,910 --> 00:47:05,920
very hard to have to relinquish controls
 

2105
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:09,210
very hard to have to relinquish controls
to a machine and then take over when

2106
00:47:09,210 --> 00:47:09,220
to a machine and then take over when
 

2107
00:47:09,220 --> 00:47:11,820
to a machine and then take over when
needed so I think Tesla's approach is

2108
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:11,830
needed so I think Tesla's approach is
 

2109
00:47:11,830 --> 00:47:13,200
needed so I think Tesla's approach is
interesting because it allows you to

2110
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:13,210
interesting because it allows you to
 

2111
00:47:13,210 --> 00:47:15,359
interesting because it allows you to
periodically establish some kind of

2112
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:15,369
periodically establish some kind of
 

2113
00:47:15,369 --> 00:47:19,770
periodically establish some kind of

2117
00:47:21,609 --> 00:47:23,400
hand is thinking about shared autonomy
as a collaborative autonomy as a

paradigm if I may argue these are very

2120
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:26,410
paradigm if I may argue these are very
 

2121
00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:28,109
paradigm if I may argue these are very
very simple ways of human-robot

2122
00:47:28,109 --> 00:47:28,119
very simple ways of human-robot
 

2123
00:47:28,119 --> 00:47:30,810
very simple ways of human-robot
collaboration because the task is pretty

00:47:30,810 --> 00:47:30,820
collaboration because the task is pretty
 

2125
00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:33,359

00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:33,369
boring you sit in a vehicle you go from
 

2127
00:47:33,369 --> 00:47:35,490
boring you sit in a vehicle you go from
point A to point B I think the more

00:47:35,490 --> 00:47:35,500
point A to point B I think the more
 

2129
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:37,700
point A to point B I think the more
interesting thing to me is for example

00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:37,710
interesting thing to me is for example
 

2131
00:47:37,710 --> 00:47:39,750
interesting thing to me is for example

to do something it's important I have to
 

2137
00:47:46,359 --> 00:47:48,359
to do something it's important I have to
do it in two minutes the building is

00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:53,410
collapsed how do I do it I think to me
 

2143
00:47:53,410 --> 00:47:54,870

those are the interesting things where

2144
00:47:54,870 --> 00:47:54,880
those are the interesting things where
 

2145
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:57,599
those are the interesting things where
it's very very unstructured and what's

clearly there's lots of interesting

2150
00:48:01,650 --> 00:48:01,660
clearly there's lots of interesting
 

2151
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:03,900
clearly there's lots of interesting
challenges and as a field I think we're

00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:03,910
challenges and as a field I think we're
 

2153
00:48:03,910 --> 00:48:05,280
challenges and as a field I think we're
gonna make a lot of progress in this

2154
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:05,290
gonna make a lot of progress in this
 

2155
00:48:05,290 --> 00:48:06,960
gonna make a lot of progress in this
area yeah it's an exciting form of

2156
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:06,970
area yeah it's an exciting form of
 

2157
00:48:06,970 --> 00:48:08,339
area yeah it's an exciting form of
collaboration you're right in the town

boredom of the human yes as opposed to

2162
00:48:14,250 --> 00:48:14,260
boredom of the human yes as opposed to
 

2163
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:15,390
boredom of the human yes as opposed to

2164
00:48:15,390 --> 00:48:15,400
in rescue operations
 

2165
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:19,339
in rescue operations
it's literally life and death and the

2166
00:48:19,339 --> 00:48:19,349
it's literally life and death and the
 

2167
00:48:19,349 --> 00:48:22,710
it's literally life and death and the

00:48:24,810 --> 00:48:24,820
completion of the mission so exciting in
 

2171
00:48:24,820 --> 00:48:27,089
completion of the mission so exciting in
some sense you know we're also doing

2172
00:48:27,089 --> 00:48:27,099
some sense you know we're also doing
 

2173
00:48:27,099 --> 00:48:30,060
some sense you know we're also doing
this you think about the human driving a

2174
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:30,070
this you think about the human driving a
 

2175
00:48:30,070 --> 00:48:33,480
this you think about the human driving a
car and almost invariably the humans

2176
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:33,490
car and almost invariably the humans
 

2177
00:48:33,490 --> 00:48:34,920
car and almost invariably the humans
trying to estimate the state of the cars

2178
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:34,930
trying to estimate the state of the cars
 

2179
00:48:34,930 --> 00:48:36,510
trying to estimate the state of the cars
estimate the state of the environment so

2180
00:48:36,510 --> 00:48:36,520
estimate the state of the environment so
 

2181
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:38,550
estimate the state of the environment so
on but what if the car were to estimate

2182
00:48:38,550 --> 00:48:38,560
on but what if the car were to estimate
 

2183
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:39,680
on but what if the car were to estimate
the state of the human

2184
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:39,690
the state of the human
 

2185
00:48:39,690 --> 00:48:41,359
the state of the human
so for example I'm sure you have a

2186
00:48:41,359 --> 00:48:41,369
so for example I'm sure you have a
 

2187
00:48:41,369 --> 00:48:43,640
so for example I'm sure you have a
smartphone the smartphone tries to

2188
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:43,650
smartphone the smartphone tries to
 

2189
00:48:43,650 --> 00:48:44,870
smartphone the smartphone tries to
figure out what you're doing and send

2190
00:48:44,870 --> 00:48:44,880
figure out what you're doing and send
 

2191
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:48,140
figure out what you're doing and send
you reminders and often times telling

2192
00:48:48,140 --> 00:48:48,150
you reminders and often times telling
 

2193
00:48:48,150 --> 00:48:49,640
you reminders and often times telling
you to drive to a certain place although

2194
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:49,650
you to drive to a certain place although
 

2195
00:48:49,650 --> 00:48:50,900
you to drive to a certain place although
you have no intention of going there

2196
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:50,910
you have no intention of going there
 

2197
00:48:50,910 --> 00:48:52,640
you have no intention of going there
because it thinks that that's why you

2198
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:52,650
because it thinks that that's why you
 

2199
00:48:52,650 --> 00:48:55,220
because it thinks that that's why you
should be a cause of some gmail calendar

00:48:55,220 --> 00:48:55,230
should be a cause of some gmail calendar
 

2201
00:48:55,230 --> 00:48:59,510
should be a cause of some gmail calendar
entry or something like that and and you

2203
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:00,950
entry or something like that and and you
know it's trying to constantly figure

2204
00:49:00,950 --> 00:49:00,960
know it's trying to constantly figure
 

2205
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:02,990
know it's trying to constantly figure
out who you are what you're doing if a

2206
00:49:02,990 --> 00:49:03,000
out who you are what you're doing if a
 

2207
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,940
out who you are what you're doing if a
car were to do that maybe that would

2208
00:49:04,940 --> 00:49:04,950
car were to do that maybe that would
 

2209
00:49:04,950 --> 00:49:07,339
car were to do that maybe that would
make the driver safer because the car's

2210
00:49:07,339 --> 00:49:07,349
make the driver safer because the car's
 

2211
00:49:07,349 --> 00:49:08,539
make the driver safer because the car's
trying to figure out is the driver

2212
00:49:08,539 --> 00:49:08,549
trying to figure out is the driver

2214
00:49:09,529 --> 00:49:09,539

00:49:12,859 --> 00:49:12,869
looking at his or her eyes looking at
 

2217
00:49:12,869 --> 00:49:15,200
looking at his or her eyes looking at
saccadic movements so I think the

2218
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:15,210
saccadic movements so I think the
 

2219
00:49:15,210 --> 00:49:17,720
saccadic movements so I think the
potential is there but from the reverse

2220
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:17,730
potential is there but from the reverse
 

2221
00:49:17,730 --> 00:49:20,720
potential is there but from the reverse
side it's not robot modeling but it's

2222
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:20,730
side it's not robot modeling but it's
 

2223
00:49:20,730 --> 00:49:22,549
side it's not robot modeling but it's
human modeling it's more in the human

2224
00:49:22,549 --> 00:49:22,559
human modeling it's more in the human
 

2225
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:24,140
human modeling it's more in the human
right and I think the robots can do a

2226
00:49:24,140 --> 00:49:24,150
right and I think the robots can do a
 

2227
00:49:24,150 --> 00:49:26,539
right and I think the robots can do a
very good job of modeling humans if you

2228
00:49:26,539 --> 00:49:26,549
very good job of modeling humans if you
 

2229
00:49:26,549 --> 00:49:28,359
very good job of modeling humans if you
if you really think about the framework

2230
00:49:28,359 --> 00:49:28,369
if you really think about the framework
 

2231
00:49:28,369 --> 00:49:31,789
if you really think about the framework
that you have a human sitting in a in a

2232
00:49:31,789 --> 00:49:31,799
that you have a human sitting in a in a
 

2233

talked about swarms one thing I worry a

2280
00:50:32,599 --> 00:50:32,609
talked about swarms one thing I worry a
 

2281
00:50:32,609 --> 00:50:35,120
talked about swarms one thing I worry a
lot about is so you know for us to get

2282
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:35,130
lot about is so you know for us to get
 

2283

00:50:36,809 --> 00:50:39,500
swamps to work and do something reliably
it's really hard but suppose I have

00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:39,510
it's really hard but suppose I have
 

2287
00:50:39,510 --> 00:50:42,440
it's really hard but suppose I have
there's this challenge of trying to

00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:42,450
there's this challenge of trying to
 

2289
00:50:42,450 --> 00:50:45,140
there's this challenge of trying to
destroy something and I have a swarm of

00:50:45,140 --> 00:50:45,150
destroy something and I have a swarm of
 

2291
00:50:45,150 --> 00:50:47,180
destroy something and I have a swarm of
robots well only one out of the swarm

00:50:47,180 --> 00:50:47,190
robots well only one out of the swarm

00:50:53,090 --> 00:50:55,810
suddenly becomes a lot more doable
worry about you know this gentle idea of

2298
00:50:55,810 --> 00:50:55,820
worry about you know this gentle idea of
 

2299
00:50:55,820 --> 00:50:57,760
worry about you know this gentle idea of
using autonomy with lots and lots of

I mean having said that looked a lot of

2304
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:01,610
I mean having said that looked a lot of
 

2305
00:51:01,610 --> 00:51:03,940
I mean having said that looked a lot of
this technology is not very mature my

2306
00:51:03,940 --> 00:51:03,950
this technology is not very mature my
 

2307
00:51:03,950 --> 00:51:08,020
this technology is not very mature my
favorite saying is that if somebody had

2308
00:51:08,020 --> 00:51:08,030
favorite saying is that if somebody had
 

2309
00:51:08,030 --> 00:51:10,090
favorite saying is that if somebody had
to develop this technology

2310
00:51:10,090 --> 00:51:10,100
to develop this technology
 

2311
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:12,250
to develop this technology
wouldn't you rather the good guys do it

2312
00:51:12,250 --> 00:51:12,260
wouldn't you rather the good guys do it
 

2313
00:51:12,260 --> 00:51:13,330
wouldn't you rather the good guys do it
so the good guys have a good

2314
00:51:13,330 --> 00:51:13,340
so the good guys have a good
 

2315
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:14,890
so the good guys have a good
understanding of the technology so they

2316
00:51:14,890 --> 00:51:14,900
understanding of the technology so they
 

2317
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:16,540
understanding of the technology so they
can figure out how this technology is

2318
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:16,550
can figure out how this technology is
 

2319
00:51:16,550 --> 00:51:18,910
can figure out how this technology is
being used in a bad way or could be used

2320
00:51:18,910 --> 00:51:18,920
being used in a bad way or could be used

in a bad way and try to defend against
 

2323
00:51:20,510 --> 00:51:23,710
in a bad way and try to defend against
it so we think a lot about that so we

2324
00:51:23,710 --> 00:51:23,720
it so we think a lot about that so we
 

2325
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:25,840
it so we think a lot about that so we
have a were doing research on how to

00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:25,850
have a were doing research on how to
 

2327
00:51:25,850 --> 00:51:28,360
have a were doing research on how to
defend against swarms for example that's

2328
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:28,370
defend against swarms for example that's
 

2329
00:51:28,370 --> 00:51:31,990
defend against swarms for example that's
a there's in fact a report by the

00:51:38,390 --> 00:51:39,640

we're also thinking about how to defend
 

2337
00:51:39,650 --> 00:51:41,980
we're also thinking about how to defend

work knowing how autonomy works is I

2340
00:51:45,730 --> 00:51:45,740
work knowing how autonomy works is I
 

2341
00:51:45,740 --> 00:51:47,920
work knowing how autonomy works is I
think very important so it's not just

00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:47,930
think very important so it's not just

role in this discussion absolutely I
 

2347
00:51:52,580 --> 00:51:55,510
role in this discussion absolutely I
think the days where politicians can be

2348
00:51:55,510 --> 00:51:55,520
think the days where politicians can be
 

2349
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:58,680
think the days where politicians can be
agnostic to technology are gone

2350
00:51:58,680 --> 00:51:58,690
agnostic to technology are gone

III think every tech politician needs to

00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:02,170
III think every tech politician needs to
 

2353
00:52:02,170 --> 00:52:06,390
III think every tech politician needs to
be literate in technology and I often

2354
00:52:06,390 --> 00:52:06,400
be literate in technology and I often
 

2355
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:09,499
be literate in technology and I often
say technology is the new liberal art

2356
00:52:09,499 --> 00:52:09,509
say technology is the new liberal art
 

2357
00:52:09,509 --> 00:52:11,549
say technology is the new liberal art
understanding how technology will change

2358

understanding how technology will change
 

2359
00:52:11,559 --> 00:52:15,269
understanding how technology will change
your life I think is important and every

2360
00:52:15,269 --> 00:52:15,279
your life I think is important and every
 

2361
00:52:15,279 --> 00:52:17,690
your life I think is important and every
human being needs to understand that and

2362
00:52:17,690 --> 00:52:17,700
human being needs to understand that and
 

2363
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:20,370
human being needs to understand that and
maybe we can elect some engineers to

2364
00:52:20,370 --> 00:52:20,380
maybe we can elect some engineers to
 

2365
00:52:20,380 --> 00:52:22,980
maybe we can elect some engineers to
office as well on the other side what

2366
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:22,990
office as well on the other side what
 

2367
00:52:22,990 --> 00:52:24,359
office as well on the other side what
are the biggest open problems in

2368
00:52:24,359 --> 00:52:24,369
are the biggest open problems in
 

2369
00:52:24,369 --> 00:52:26,279
are the biggest open problems in
robotics and you said we're in the early

2370
00:52:26,279 --> 00:52:26,289
robotics and you said we're in the early
 

2371
00:52:26,289 --> 00:52:28,529
robotics and you said we're in the early
days in some sense what are the problems

2372
00:52:28,529 --> 00:52:28,539
days in some sense what are the problems
 

2373
00:52:28,539 --> 00:52:30,390
days in some sense what are the problems
we would like to solve in robotics I

2374
00:52:30,390 --> 00:52:30,400
we would like to solve in robotics I
 

2375
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:32,490
we would like to solve in robotics I
think there are lots of problems right

2376
00:52:32,490 --> 00:52:32,500
think there are lots of problems right
 

2377
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:35,220
think there are lots of problems right
but I would phrase it in the following

2378
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:35,230
but I would phrase it in the following
 

2379
00:52:35,230 --> 00:52:38,460
but I would phrase it in the following
way if you look at the robots or a

2380
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:38,470
way if you look at the robots or a
 

2381
00:52:38,470 --> 00:52:41,940
way if you look at the robots or a
building they're still very much

2382
00:52:41,940 --> 00:52:41,950
building they're still very much
 

2383
00:52:41,950 --> 00:52:44,549
building they're still very much
tailored towards doing specific tasks

2384
00:52:44,549 --> 00:52:44,559
tailored towards doing specific tasks
 

2385
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:46,920
tailored towards doing specific tasks
and specific settings I think the

2386
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:46,930
and specific settings I think the
 

2387
00:52:46,930 --> 00:52:48,720
and specific settings I think the
question of how do you get them to

2388
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:48,730
question of how do you get them to
 

2389
00:52:48,730 --> 00:52:53,370
question of how do you get them to
operate in much broader settings with

2390
00:52:53,370 --> 00:52:53,380
operate in much broader settings with
 

2391
00:52:53,380 --> 00:52:56,220
operate in much broader settings with
where things can change you know

2392
00:52:56,220 --> 00:52:56,230
where things can change you know
 

2393
00:52:56,230 --> 00:52:58,620
where things can change you know
unstructured environments is up in the

2394
00:52:58,620 --> 00:52:58,630
unstructured environments is up in the
 

2395
00:52:58,630 --> 00:53:00,420
unstructured environments is up in the
air so you know think of a self-driving

2396
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:00,430
air so you know think of a self-driving
 

2397
00:53:00,430 --> 00:53:04,170

cars today we can build a self-driving

2398
00:53:04,170 --> 00:53:04,180
cars today we can build a self-driving

00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:06,430
car in a parking lot we can do level
 

2401
00:53:06,430 --> 00:53:11,130
car in a parking lot we can do level
fire autonomy in a parking lot but can

2402
00:53:11,130 --> 00:53:11,140
fire autonomy in a parking lot but can
 

2403
00:53:11,140 --> 00:53:13,559
fire autonomy in a parking lot but can
you do level five autonomy in the

2404
00:53:13,559 --> 00:53:13,569
you do level five autonomy in the
 

2405
00:53:13,569 --> 00:53:16,380
you do level five autonomy in the
streets of Napoli in Italy or Mumbai in

India no no so in some sense when we

2408
00:53:20,609 --> 00:53:20,619
India no no so in some sense when we
 

2409
00:53:20,619 --> 00:53:23,220
India no no so in some sense when we
think about robotics we have to think

2410
00:53:23,220 --> 00:53:23,230
think about robotics we have to think
 

2411
00:53:23,230 --> 00:53:25,349
think about robotics we have to think
about where they're functioning what

2412
00:53:25,349 --> 00:53:25,359
about where they're functioning what
 

2413
00:53:25,359 --> 00:53:26,999
about where they're functioning what
kind of environment what kind of a task

2414
00:53:26,999 --> 00:53:27,009
kind of environment what kind of a task
 

2415
00:53:27,009 --> 00:53:30,509
kind of environment what kind of a task
we have no understanding of how to put

2416
00:53:30,509 --> 00:53:30,519
we have no understanding of how to put
 

2417
00:53:30,519 --> 00:53:33,210
we have no understanding of how to put
both those things together so we're in

2418
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:33,220
both those things together so we're in
 

2419
00:53:33,220 --> 00:53:34,740
both those things together so we're in
the very early days of applying it to

2420
00:53:34,740 --> 00:53:34,750
the very early days of applying it to
 

2421
00:53:34,750 --> 00:53:37,230
the very early days of applying it to
the physical world and I was just

2422
00:53:37,230 --> 00:53:37,240
the physical world and I was just
 

2423
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:39,660
the physical world and I was just
enables actually and that's there's

2424
00:53:39,660 --> 00:53:39,670
enables actually and that's there's
 

2425
00:53:39,670 --> 00:53:41,509
enables actually and that's there's
levels of difficulty in complexity

2426
00:53:41,509 --> 00:53:41,519
levels of difficulty in complexity
 

2427
00:53:41,519 --> 00:53:44,609
levels of difficulty in complexity
depending on which area you're applying

2428
00:53:44,609 --> 00:53:44,619
depending on which area you're applying
 

2429
00:53:44,619 --> 00:53:46,980
depending on which area you're applying
it to I think so we don't have a

2430
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:46,990
it to I think so we don't have a
 

2431
00:53:46,990 --> 00:53:50,059
it to I think so we don't have a
systematic way of understanding that you

2432
00:53:50,059 --> 00:53:50,069
systematic way of understanding that you
 

2433
00:53:50,069 --> 00:53:52,819
systematic way of understanding that you
know everybody says just because

2434
00:53:52,819 --> 00:53:52,829
know everybody says just because
 

2435
00:53:52,829 --> 00:53:55,230
know everybody says just because
computer can now beat a human at any

computer board game is very very
 

2443
00:54:02,890 --> 00:54:05,759
computer board game is very very
structured it is the equivalent of

working in a Henry Ford factory where
 

2447
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:11,360
working in a Henry Ford factory where
things parts come you assemble move on

things parts come you assemble move on
 

2449
00:54:11,370 --> 00:54:13,880
things parts come you assemble move on
it's a very very very structured setting

2450
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:13,890
it's a very very very structured setting
 

2451
00:54:13,890 --> 00:54:16,340
it's a very very very structured setting
that's the easiest thing and we know how

2452
00:54:16,340 --> 00:54:16,350
that's the easiest thing and we know how
 

2453
00:54:16,350 --> 00:54:17,590
that's the easiest thing and we know how
to do that

2454
00:54:17,590 --> 00:54:17,600
to do that
 

2455
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:19,880
to do that
so you've done a lot of incredible work

2456
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:19,890
so you've done a lot of incredible work
 

2457

2465
00:54:31,950 --> 00:54:35,000
bright-eyed undergrad interested in
robotics or AI or engineering well I

00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:35,010
robotics or AI or engineering well I
 

2467
00:54:35,010 --> 00:54:36,890
robotics or AI or engineering well I
think there's really three things one is

2468
00:54:36,890 --> 00:54:36,900
think there's really three things one is
 

2469
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:40,220
think there's really three things one is
one is you have to get used to the idea

2470
00:54:40,220 --> 00:54:40,230
one is you have to get used to the idea
 

2471
00:54:40,230 --> 00:54:42,260
one is you have to get used to the idea
that the world will not be the same in

2472
00:54:42,260 --> 00:54:42,270
that the world will not be the same in
 

2473
00:54:42,270 --> 00:54:43,910
that the world will not be the same in
five years or four years whenever you

2474
00:54:43,910 --> 00:54:43,920
five years or four years whenever you
 

2475
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:45,950
five years or four years whenever you
graduate right which is really hard to

2476
00:54:45,950 --> 00:54:45,960
graduate right which is really hard to
 

2477
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:48,320
graduate right which is really hard to
do so this this thing about predicting

2478
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:48,330
do so this this thing about predicting
 

2479
00:54:48,330 --> 00:54:50,300
do so this this thing about predicting
the future every one of us needs to be

2480
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:50,310
the future every one of us needs to be
 

2481
00:54:50,310 --> 00:54:53,480
the future every one of us needs to be
trying to predict the future always not

2482
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:53,490
trying to predict the future always not
 

2483
00:54:53,490 --> 00:54:55,340
trying to predict the future always not
because you'll be any good at it but by

2484
00:54:55,340 --> 00:54:55,350
because you'll be any good at it but by
 

2485
00:54:55,350 --> 00:54:57,740
because you'll be any good at it but by
thinking about it I think you sharpen

2486
00:54:57,740 --> 00:54:57,750
thinking about it I think you sharpen
 

2487
00:54:57,750 --> 00:55:01,040
thinking about it I think you sharpen
your senses and you become smarter so

2488
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:01,050
your senses and you become smarter so
 

2489
00:55:01,050 --> 00:55:04,460
your senses and you become smarter so
that's number one number two it's a

2490
00:55:04,460 --> 00:55:04,470
that's number one number two it's a
 

2491
00:55:04,470 --> 00:55:05,960
that's number one number two it's a
corollary of the first piece which is

2492
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:05,970
corollary of the first piece which is
 

2493
00:55:05,970 --> 00:55:07,970
corollary of the first piece which is
you really don't know what's going to be

2494
00:55:07,970 --> 00:55:07,980
you really don't know what's going to be
 

2495
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:10,550
you really don't know what's going to be
important so this idea that I'm going to

2496
00:55:10,550 --> 00:55:10,560
important so this idea that I'm going to
 

2497
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:12,590
important so this idea that I'm going to
specialize in something which will allow

2498
00:55:12,590 --> 00:55:12,600
specialize in something which will allow
 

2499
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:15,410
specialize in something which will allow
me to go in a particular direction it

2500
00:55:15,410 --> 00:55:15,420
me to go in a particular direction it
 

2501
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:17,300
me to go in a particular direction it
may be interesting but it's important

2502
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:17,310
may be interesting but it's important
 

2503
00:55:17,310 --> 00:55:18,890
may be interesting but it's important
also to have this breadth so you have

2504
00:55:18,890 --> 00:55:18,900
also to have this breadth so you have
 

2505
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:22,670
also to have this breadth so you have
this jumping-off point I think the third

2506
00:55:22,670 --> 00:55:22,680
this jumping-off point I think the third
 

2507
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:24,470
this jumping-off point I think the third
thing and this is where I think Penn

2508
00:55:24,470 --> 00:55:24,480
thing and this is where I think Penn
 

2509
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:27,380
thing and this is where I think Penn
excels I mean we teach engineering but

2510
00:55:27,380 --> 00:55:27,390
excels I mean we teach engineering but
 

2511
00:55:27,390 --> 00:55:28,760
excels I mean we teach engineering but
it's always in the context of the

00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:28,770
it's always in the context of the
