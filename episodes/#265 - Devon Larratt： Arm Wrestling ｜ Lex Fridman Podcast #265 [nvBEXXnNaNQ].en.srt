strength
 

723
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:54,790
strength
gained

724
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:54,800
gained
 

725
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,230
gained
while fighting

726
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:56,240

from armrest like in jiu jitsu and
grappling you can get good by

736
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:07,120
grappling you can get good by
 

737
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,110
grappling you can get good by
training with people

738
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:09,120
training with people
 

739
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,030
training with people
much uh technically worse than you so

740
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:11,040
much uh technically worse than you so
 

741
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,790
much uh technically worse than you so
with white belts and blue belts yeah

742
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:12,800
with white belts and blue belts yeah
 

743
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,470
with white belts and blue belts yeah
it's actually beneficial degree because

744
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:14,480
it's actually beneficial degree because
 

745
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,710
it's actually beneficial degree because
you get to work stuff out right

746
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:16,720
you get to work stuff out right
 

747
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,069
you get to work stuff out right
but

748
00:13:18,069 --> 00:13:18,079
but
 

749
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:21,350
but
i wouldn't say it develops like

750
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:21,360
i wouldn't say it develops like
 

751
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,550
i wouldn't say it develops like
that intensity and power required to go

752
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:24,560
that intensity and power required to go
 

753
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,829
that intensity and power required to go
against um people at your level

754
00:13:27,829 --> 00:13:27,839
against um people at your level
 

755
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:29,910
against um people at your level
so what how do you balance that do you

756
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:29,920
so what how do you balance that do you
 

757
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,430
so what how do you balance that do you
is it okay to go against people that are

758
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:31,440
is it okay to go against people that are
 

759
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,110
is it okay to go against people that are
much weaker than you

760
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:33,120
much weaker than you
 

761
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,910
much weaker than you
or that you really have to go against

762
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:35,920
or that you really have to go against
 

763
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,829
or that you really have to go against
people at the same level

764
00:13:37,829 --> 00:13:37,839
people at the same level
 

765
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:41,030
people at the same level
i think that a blended

766
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:41,040
i think that a blended
 

767
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,910
i think that a blended
strategy is probably the best

768
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:43,920
strategy is probably the best
 

769
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,430
strategy is probably the best
um i i'd say kind of a rule

770
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:47,440
um i i'd say kind of a rule
 

771
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,350
um i i'd say kind of a rule
is whatever you do you get better at

772
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:49,360
is whatever you do you get better at
 

773
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,870
is whatever you do you get better at
right so

774
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:50,880
right so
 

775
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,870
right so
you want to be kind of as precise as

776
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:52,880
you want to be kind of as precise as
 

777
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:53,990
you want to be kind of as precise as
possible

778
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:54,000
possible
 

779
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,710
possible
you don't want to get hurt

780
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:56,720
you don't want to get hurt
 

781
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,550
you don't want to get hurt
and it's just about investment

782
00:13:58,550 --> 00:13:58,560
and it's just about investment
 

783
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,230
and it's just about investment
and

784
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:00,240
and
 

785
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,310
and
the answer is not always the same things

786
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:02,320
the answer is not always the same things
 

787
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,069
the answer is not always the same things
are going to change

788
00:14:04,069 --> 00:14:04,079
are going to change
 

789
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:08,069
are going to change
i am currently a big believer in what i

790
00:14:08,069 --> 00:14:08,079
i am currently a big believer in what i
 

791
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:11,750
i am currently a big believer in what i
call tower building right so

792
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:11,760
call tower building right so
 

793
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,069
call tower building right so
you have to do a lot of volume

794
00:14:14,069 --> 00:14:14,079
you have to do a lot of volume
 

795
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:15,670
you have to do a lot of volume
to build a great tower

796
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:15,680
to build a great tower
 

797
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,629
to build a great tower
you you need to have a ton

798
00:14:18,629 --> 00:14:18,639
you you need to have a ton
 

799
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:20,710
you you need to have a ton
a ton of volume so so when you look at

800
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:20,720
a ton of volume so so when you look at
 

801
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,030
a ton of volume so so when you look at
how to best build volume

802
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:23,040
how to best build volume
 

803
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,949
how to best build volume
you want to do

804
00:14:24,949 --> 00:14:24,959
you want to do
 

805
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:26,550
you want to do
workouts that aren't particularly

806
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:26,560
workouts that aren't particularly
 

807
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,269
workouts that aren't particularly
challenging to make you feel good

808
00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:29,279
challenging to make you feel good
 

809
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,269
challenging to make you feel good
and do them so that when you add them

810
00:14:31,269 --> 00:14:31,279
and do them so that when you add them
 

811
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:32,870
and do them so that when you add them
all together

812
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:32,880
all together
 

813
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,030
all together
you you get the biggest number

814
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:35,040
you you get the biggest number
 

815
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:35,910
you you get the biggest number
so

816
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:35,920
so
 

817
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:36,790
so
many

818
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:36,800
many
 

819
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,870
many
easy workouts a day

820
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:38,880
easy workouts a day
 

821
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,590
easy workouts a day
that are specific as possible in my

822
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:41,600
that are specific as possible in my
 

823
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,550
that are specific as possible in my
opinion is the best way to lay the

824
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:44,560
opinion is the best way to lay the
 

825
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,990
opinion is the best way to lay the
foundation for an extreme peak and

826
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:48,000
foundation for an extreme peak and
 

827
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,550
foundation for an extreme peak and
precision right like

828
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:50,560
precision right like
 

829
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,790
precision right like
there's no more precise way to get

830
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:52,800
there's no more precise way to get
 

831
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:57,350
there's no more precise way to get
strong at arm wrestling than arm wrestle

832
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:57,360

 

833
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,710

so

834
00:14:58,710 --> 00:14:58,720
so
 

835
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,790
so
how often can you arm wrestle what's

836
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:00,800
how often can you arm wrestle what's
 

837
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,629
how often can you arm wrestle what's
your training regimen

838
00:15:02,629 --> 00:15:02,639
your training regimen
 

839
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:05,269
your training regimen
you're talk you've talked about this

840
00:15:05,269 --> 00:15:05,279
you're talk you've talked about this
 

841
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:05,990
you're talk you've talked about this
as

842
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:06,000
as
 

843
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,750
as
the climb right

844
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:07,760
the climb right
 

845
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,150
the climb right
what is the training process

846
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:10,160
what is the training process
 

847
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,590
what is the training process
to get great at arm wrestling well

848
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:13,600
to get great at arm wrestling well
 

849
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,590
to get great at arm wrestling well
again it's going to depend on what level

850
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:15,600
again it's going to depend on what level
 

851
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,790
again it's going to depend on what level
you're at

852

you're at
 

853
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,629
you're at
um the answer

854
00:15:18,629 --> 00:15:18,639
um the answer
 

855
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:20,230
um the answer
at the beginning

and then the days in between
 

943
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,790
and then the days in between
i will just do blood flow

944
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:56,800
i will just do blood flow
 

945
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,509
i will just do blood flow
rehab blood flow rehab i will never hit

946
00:16:59,509 --> 00:16:59,519
rehab blood flow rehab i will never hit
 

947

lot of ways to do it

954
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:08,640
lot of ways to do it
 

955
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,390
lot of ways to do it
this is currently a system that's

956
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:10,400
this is currently a system that's
 

957
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,390
this is currently a system that's
working very well for me

958

but
 

1059
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:11,029
but
it's absolutely possible it's absolutely

1060
00:19:11,029 --> 00:19:11,039
it's absolutely possible it's absolutely
 

1061
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:12,710
it's absolutely possible it's absolutely
possible the one thing that i'm

1062
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:12,720
possible the one thing that i'm
 

1063
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,710
possible the one thing that i'm
confident about well i'd say there's two

1064
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:14,720
confident about well i'd say there's two
 

1065
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,909
confident about well i'd say there's two
things

1066
00:19:15,909 --> 00:19:15,919
things
 

1067
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:18,070
things
the two things i'm confident about

1068
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:18,080
the two things i'm confident about
 

1069
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,590
the two things i'm confident about
is that i have more experience than he

1070
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:19,600
is that i have more experience than he
 

1071
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,029
is that i have more experience than he
does

1072
00:19:21,029 --> 00:19:21,039
does
 

1073
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:22,230
does
and

1074
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:22,240
and
 

1075
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,190
and
experience counts for a lot

1076
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:25,200
experience counts for a lot
 

1077
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,230
experience counts for a lot
the other thing is

1078
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:28,240
the other thing is
 

1079
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,669
the other thing is
my ability to

1080
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:29,679
my ability to
 

1081
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:31,830
my ability to
breathe and recover

1082
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:31,840
breathe and recover
 

1083
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:32,870
breathe and recover
so

1084
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:32,880
so
 

1085
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,230
so
if ever

1086
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:34,240
if ever
 

1087
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,070
if ever
there's an opportunity for the tide to

1088
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:36,080
there's an opportunity for the tide to
 

1089
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,350
there's an opportunity for the tide to
turn

1090
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:37,360
turn
 

1091
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,510
turn
that's i think where he'll never get it

1092
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:39,520
that's i think where he'll never get it
 

1093
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,870
that's i think where he'll never get it
back so i think if i can somehow find a

1094
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:42,880
back so i think if i can somehow find a
 

1095
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,029
back so i think if i can somehow find a
hole in his game

1096
00:19:45,029 --> 00:19:45,039
hole in his game
 

1097
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:46,710
hole in his game
then uh yeah

1098
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:46,720
then uh yeah
 

1099
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,270
then uh yeah
so you you want to hold off the initial

1100
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:49,280
so you you want to hold off the initial
 

1101
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,270
so you you want to hold off the initial
like assault of power

1102
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:51,280
like assault of power
 

1103
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,870
like assault of power
and that and then

1104
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:52,880
and that and then
 

1105
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,870
and that and then
wear them out

1106
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:54,880
wear them out
 

1107
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,830
wear them out
and to find the hole and then

1108
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:57,840
and to find the hole and then
 

1109
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,390
and to find the hole and then
so it's how much of that is mental how

1110
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:00,400
so it's how much of that is mental how
 

1111
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,990
so it's how much of that is mental how
much of it is just the physical ability

1112
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:02,000
much of it is just the physical ability
 

1113
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,270
much of it is just the physical ability
to do

1114
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:03,280
to do
 

1115
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,190
to do
for your muscles to have the endurance

1116
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:05,200
for your muscles to have the endurance
 

1117
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,909
for your muscles to have the endurance
to hold off

1118
00:20:07,909 --> 00:20:07,919

 

1119
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:09,909

i like to

1120
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:09,919
i like to
 

1121
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:12,630
i like to
make the sport bigger

1122
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:12,640
make the sport bigger
 

1123
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,710
make the sport bigger
and a lot of things that

1124
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:14,720
and a lot of things that
 

1125
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,270
and a lot of things that
most arm wrestlers

1126
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:17,280
most arm wrestlers
 

1127
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,950
most arm wrestlers
believe the sport is

1128
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:18,960
believe the sport is
 

1129
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,070
believe the sport is
i always try and push those boundaries

1130
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:22,080
i always try and push those boundaries
 

1131
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,590
i always try and push those boundaries
so

1132
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:23,600
so
 

1133
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,669
so
there is definitely a mental aspect to

1134
00:20:25,669 --> 00:20:25,679
there is definitely a mental aspect to
 

1135
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:26,390
there is definitely a mental aspect to
it

1136
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:26,400
it
 

1137
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,669
it
when you're faced with something that

1138
00:20:27,669 --> 00:20:27,679
when you're faced with something that
 

1139
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:29,990
when you're faced with something that
you've never seen before

1140
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:30,000
you've never seen before
 

1141
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,190
you've never seen before
that's when

1142
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:31,200
that's when
 

1143
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,270
that's when
things like experience

1144
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:33,280
things like experience
 

1145
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,310
things like experience
comes in he can become surprised

1146
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:36,320
comes in he can become surprised
 

1147
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,110
comes in he can become surprised
where

1148
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:37,120
where
 

1149
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,510
where
what's a surprise for him is routine for

1150
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:39,520
what's a surprise for him is routine for
 

1151
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,390
what's a surprise for him is routine for

00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:11,029
um it can be used it's it's a technical
attack it's also an attack that can be

1796
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:11,039
attack it's also an attack that can be
 

1797
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:12,789
attack it's also an attack that can be
built with with training just the

1798
00:32:12,789 --> 00:32:12,799
built with with training just the
 

1799
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:15,190
built with with training just the
ability to just drive upwards

1800
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:15,200
ability to just drive upwards
 

1801
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,669
ability to just drive upwards
uh there's a chain where you cup right

1802
00:32:17,669 --> 00:32:17,679
uh there's a chain where you cup right
 

1803
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:19,990
uh there's a chain where you cup right
cup your wrist and cup your wrist in and

1804
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:20,000
cup your wrist and cup your wrist in and
 

1805
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,909
cup your wrist and cup your wrist in and
the anchor and the chain

1806
00:32:21,909 --> 00:32:21,919
the anchor and the chain
 

1807
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:23,750
the anchor and the chain
brings you right to your heart right to

1808
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:23,760
brings you right to your heart right to
 

1809
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,830
brings you right to your heart right to
your center right this chain and this

1810
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:25,840
your center right this chain and this
 

1811
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,750
your center right this chain and this
can be done at any time

1812
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:27,760
can be done at any time
 

1813
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,350
can be done at any time
there's a pronation chain and that's

1814
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:29,360
there's a pronation chain and that's
 

1815
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:32,230
there's a pronation chain and that's
that's to turn your thumb over right

1816
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:32,240
that's to turn your thumb over right
 

1817
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,070
that's to turn your thumb over right
turn your thumb over and you attack the

1818
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:34,080
turn your thumb over and you attack the
 

1819
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,149
turn your thumb over and you attack the
person's cupping chain

1820
00:32:36,149 --> 00:32:36,159
person's cupping chain
 

1821
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:37,750
person's cupping chain
and there's a huge number of muscles

1822
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:37,760
and there's a huge number of muscles
 

1823
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,509
and there's a huge number of muscles
involved in each chain and that's why i

1824
00:32:39,509 --> 00:32:39,519
involved in each chain and that's why i
 

1825
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:41,669
involved in each chain and that's why i
say it's a chain right but they're

1826
00:32:41,669 --> 00:32:41,679
say it's a chain right but they're
 

1827
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:43,190
say it's a chain right but they're
movements

1828
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:43,200
movements
 

1829
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,950
movements
and these movements

1830
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:44,960
and these movements
 

1831
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,509
and these movements
you can develop in the gym or through

1832
00:32:47,509 --> 00:32:47,519
you can develop in the gym or through
 

1833
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:50,470
you can develop in the gym or through
practice so you don't mean so it's easy

1834
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:50,480
practice so you don't mean so it's easy
 

1835
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,549
practice so you don't mean so it's easy
to sort of interpret strength to mean

1836
00:32:52,549 --> 00:32:52,559
to sort of interpret strength to mean
 

1837
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:54,870
to sort of interpret strength to mean
the the how much you curl essentially

1838
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:54,880
the the how much you curl essentially
 

1839
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:57,110
the the how much you curl essentially
yeah but you mean the chain it's all

1840
00:32:57,110 --> 00:32:57,120
yeah but you mean the chain it's all
 

1841
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,789
yeah but you mean the chain it's all
right and that's like i mean people talk

1842
00:32:58,789 --> 00:32:58,799
right and that's like i mean people talk
 

1843
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:01,110
right and that's like i mean people talk
as a bicep i mean yes there's bicep for

1844
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:01,120
as a bicep i mean yes there's bicep for
 

1845
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,430
as a bicep i mean yes there's bicep for
sure involved but i i'll always be

1846
00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:03,440
sure involved but i i'll always be
 

1847
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,509
sure involved but i i'll always be
inaccurate if i try and tell you like

1848
00:33:05,509 --> 00:33:05,519
inaccurate if i try and tell you like
 

1849
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:07,990
inaccurate if i try and tell you like
what muscles are the so i prefer to

1850
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:08,000
what muscles are the so i prefer to
 

1851
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,669
what muscles are the so i prefer to
explain it in a movement

1852
00:33:09,669 --> 00:33:09,679
explain it in a movement
 

1853
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:11,269
explain it in a movement
and then everything that's involved to

1854
00:33:11,269 --> 00:33:11,279
and then everything that's involved to
 

1855
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:12,630
and then everything that's involved to
do that movement

1856
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:12,640
do that movement
 

1857
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,590
do that movement
right

1858
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:13,600
right
 

1859
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,230
right
yeah and levon's movements for arm

1860
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:16,240
yeah and levon's movements for arm
 

1861
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,269
yeah and levon's movements for arm
wrestling

1862
00:33:17,269 --> 00:33:17,279
wrestling
 

1863
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:19,190
wrestling
are incredibly impressive

1864
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:19,200
are incredibly impressive
 

1865
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,190
are incredibly impressive
what do you attribute to how much of

1866
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:21,200
what do you attribute to how much of
 

1867
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:25,590
what do you attribute to how much of
that is genetics how much of it is some

1868
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:25,600
that is genetics how much of it is some
 

1869
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,149
that is genetics how much of it is some
training thing he's doing

1870
00:33:28,149 --> 00:33:28,159
training thing he's doing
 

1871
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:30,710
training thing he's doing
i think that

1872
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:30,720
i think that
 

1873
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,029
i think that
lavon is very special in terms of

1874
00:33:33,029 --> 00:33:33,039
lavon is very special in terms of
 

1875
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:35,430
lavon is very special in terms of
his genetics like not everybody can be

1876
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:35,440
his genetics like not everybody can be
 

1877
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,630
his genetics like not everybody can be
levon

1878
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:36,640
levon
 

1879
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,149
levon
you know yeah there's there's not many

1880
00:33:38,149 --> 00:33:38,159
you know yeah there's there's not many
 

1881
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:39,830
you know yeah there's there's not many
lavons out there

1882
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:39,840
lavons out there
 

1883
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,110
lavons out there
um

1884
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:41,120
um
 

1885
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,230
um
but

1886
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:42,240
but
 

1887
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,149
but
what i've encountered in the bias that i

1888
00:33:44,149 --> 00:33:44,159
what i've encountered in the bias that i
 

1889
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:46,230
what i've encountered in the bias that i
always see like when people talk about

1890
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:46,240
always see like when people talk about
 

1891
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,070
always see like when people talk about
people like lavonne

1892
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:48,080
people like lavonne
 

1893
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,389
people like lavonne
they discount the other side so very

1894
00:33:50,389 --> 00:33:50,399
they discount the other side so very
 

1895
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:51,350
they discount the other side so very
quickly

1896
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:51,360
quickly
 

1897
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,269
quickly
and the thing is lavon rarely has to

1898
00:33:53,269 --> 00:33:53,279
and the thing is lavon rarely has to
 

1899
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:55,029
and the thing is lavon rarely has to
show it on the other side because he's

1900
00:33:55,029 --> 00:33:55,039
show it on the other side because he's
 

1901
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:57,029
show it on the other side because he's
so far ahead you talk about the

1902
00:33:57,029 --> 00:33:57,039
so far ahead you talk about the
 

1903
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:59,190
so far ahead you talk about the
technical application of the sport

1904
00:33:59,190 --> 00:33:59,200
technical application of the sport
 

1905
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,350
technical application of the sport
he so rarely needs to show it

1906
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:01,360
he so rarely needs to show it
 

1907
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:04,389
he so rarely needs to show it
but he's clearly incredible if you watch

1908
00:34:04,389 --> 00:34:04,399
but he's clearly incredible if you watch
 

1909
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:07,750
but he's clearly incredible if you watch
his progression he came up

1910
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:07,760
his progression he came up
 

1911
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,750
his progression he came up
having very difficult technical

1912
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:09,760
having very difficult technical
 

1913
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,990
having very difficult technical
struggles to overcome georgia is a great

1914
00:34:11,990 --> 00:34:12,000
struggles to overcome georgia is a great
 

1915
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,990
struggles to overcome georgia is a great
country for arm wrestling like there's

1916
00:34:13,990 --> 00:34:14,000
country for arm wrestling like there's
 

1917
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,990
country for arm wrestling like there's
this guy gennady click vina who no one

1918
00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:16,000
this guy gennady click vina who no one
 

1919
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,869
this guy gennady click vina who no one
would ever say is not technical

1920
00:34:18,869 --> 00:34:18,879
would ever say is not technical
 

1921
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:19,669
would ever say is not technical
and

1922
00:34:19,669 --> 00:34:19,679
and
 

1923
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:20,629
and
you know

1924
00:34:20,629 --> 00:34:20,639
you know
 

1925
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:23,510
you know
it took him years to defeat him

1926
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:23,520
it took him years to defeat him
 

1927
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,109
it took him years to defeat him
to a point where now it's not it's not

1928
00:34:25,109 --> 00:34:25,119
to a point where now it's not it's not
 

1929
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:26,790
to a point where now it's not it's not
even a discussion

1930
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:26,800
even a discussion
 

1931
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,149
even a discussion
yeah you talk about the progression they

1932
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:28,159
yeah you talk about the progression they
 

1933
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:29,750
yeah you talk about the progression they
had a lot of battles together over the

1934
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:29,760
had a lot of battles together over the
 

1935
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,829
had a lot of battles together over the
years yeah it's fascinating to see the

1936
00:34:31,829 --> 00:34:31,839
years yeah it's fascinating to see the
 

1937
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:34,230
years yeah it's fascinating to see the
tides turn oh yeah and once they've

1938
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:34,240
tides turn oh yeah and once they've
 

1939
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:35,829
tides turn oh yeah and once they've
turned it's like

1940
00:34:35,829 --> 00:34:35,839
turned it's like
 

1941
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:38,790
turned it's like
completely completely different level

1942
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:38,800
completely completely different level
 

1943
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,430
completely completely different level
yeah i mean he's got he's got strength

1944
00:34:41,430 --> 00:34:41,440
yeah i mean he's got he's got strength
 

1945
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,750
yeah i mean he's got he's got strength
he's got technique

1946
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:43,760
he's got technique
 

1947
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,669
he's got technique
some people

1948
00:34:45,669 --> 00:34:45,679
some people
 

1949
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:48,550
some people
will argue that his technique is flawed

1950
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:48,560
will argue that his technique is flawed
 

1951
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:51,829
will argue that his technique is flawed
at times they've shown matches where he

1952
00:34:51,829 --> 00:34:51,839
at times they've shown matches where he
 

1953
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:53,430
at times they've shown matches where he

but
 

2785
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:16,150
but
and then you talk to the russians and

2786
00:49:16,150 --> 00:49:16,160
and then you talk to the russians and
 

2787
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:18,470
and then you talk to the russians and
they're like yeah never fail you never

2788
00:49:18,470 --> 00:49:18,480
they're like yeah never fail you never
 

2789
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:21,670
they're like yeah never fail you never
fail never never go to failure uh always

2790
00:49:21,670 --> 00:49:21,680
fail never never go to failure uh always
 

2791
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:23,030
fail never never go to failure uh always
feel good

2792
00:49:23,030 --> 00:49:23,040
feel good
 

2793
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:24,390
feel good
always feel good it should always feel

2794
00:49:24,390 --> 00:49:24,400
always feel good it should always feel
 

2795
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:25,589
always feel good it should always feel
good don't

2796
00:49:25,589 --> 00:49:25,599
good don't
 

2797
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:26,470
good don't
um

2798
00:49:26,470 --> 00:49:26,480
um
 

2799
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:28,950
um
and those two philosophies express

2800
00:49:28,950 --> 00:49:28,960
and those two philosophies express
 

2801
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:31,670
and those two philosophies express
themselves very differently um

2802
00:49:31,670 --> 00:49:31,680
themselves very differently um
 

2803
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:34,710
themselves very differently um
and if you want to get strong

2804
00:49:34,710 --> 00:49:34,720
and if you want to get strong
 

2805
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:36,230
and if you want to get strong
yeah don't fail

2806
00:49:36,230 --> 00:49:36,240
yeah don't fail
 

2807
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:37,430
yeah don't fail
don't fail

2808
00:49:37,430 --> 00:49:37,440
don't fail
 

2809
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:38,150
don't fail
so

2810
00:49:38,150 --> 00:49:38,160
so
 

2811
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:40,069
so
that's how you they also are believers

2812
00:49:40,069 --> 00:49:40,079
that's how you they also are believers
 

2813
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:41,589
that's how you they also are believers
of volume

2814
00:49:41,589 --> 00:49:41,599
of volume
 

2815
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:45,030
of volume
yeah uh there's a lot of strategies but

2816
00:49:45,030 --> 00:49:45,040
yeah uh there's a lot of strategies but
 

2817
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:47,510
yeah uh there's a lot of strategies but
yeah volume is a massive principle and

2818
00:49:47,510 --> 00:49:47,520
yeah volume is a massive principle and
 

2819
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:50,630
yeah volume is a massive principle and
volume is very hard to achieve when

2820
00:49:50,630 --> 00:49:50,640
volume is very hard to achieve when
 

2821
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:52,790
volume is very hard to achieve when
you're believing in no pain no gain

2822
00:49:52,790 --> 00:49:52,800
you're believing in no pain no gain
 

2823
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,390
you're believing in no pain no gain
right right they don't really go

2824
00:49:54,390 --> 00:49:54,400
right right they don't really go
 

2825
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:58,710
right right they don't really go
together no pain no gain more injuries

2826
00:49:58,710 --> 00:49:58,720
together no pain no gain more injuries
 

2827
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:01,030
together no pain no gain more injuries
so the is there parallels because in in

2828
00:50:01,030 --> 00:50:01,040
so the is there parallels because in in
 

2829
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:02,870
so the is there parallels because in in
wrestling some of the greatest wrestlers

2830
00:50:02,870 --> 00:50:02,880
wrestling some of the greatest wrestlers
 

2831
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:05,109
wrestling some of the greatest wrestlers
of all time are russian and they they

2832
00:50:05,109 --> 00:50:05,119
of all time are russian and they they
 

2833
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:07,270
of all time are russian and they they
were big um dan gable talks about it

2834
00:50:07,270 --> 00:50:07,280
were big um dan gable talks about it
 

2835
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:08,710
were big um dan gable talks about it
they were big on

2836
00:50:08,710 --> 00:50:08,720
they were big on
 

2837
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:12,150
they were big on
play right like lighter wrestling right

2838
00:50:12,150 --> 00:50:12,160
play right like lighter wrestling right
 

2839
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:14,549
play right like lighter wrestling right
probably ultimately actually

2840
00:50:14,549 --> 00:50:14,559
probably ultimately actually
 

2841
00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:16,470
probably ultimately actually
it boils down to that's how you achieve

2842
00:50:16,470 --> 00:50:16,480
it boils down to that's how you achieve
 

2843
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,549
it boils down to that's how you achieve
higher volume right like over the

2844
00:50:18,549 --> 00:50:18,559
higher volume right like over the
 

2845
00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:20,069
higher volume right like over the
stretch of years

2846
00:50:20,069 --> 00:50:20,079
stretch of years
 

2847
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:23,190
stretch of years
the way to reduce injury

2848
00:50:23,190 --> 00:50:23,200
the way to reduce injury
 

2849
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:27,589
the way to reduce injury
um i mean in wrestling also technique

2850
00:50:27,589 --> 00:50:27,599
um i mean in wrestling also technique
 

2851
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:29,670
um i mean in wrestling also technique
might um

2852
00:50:29,670 --> 00:50:29,680
might um
 

2853
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:31,670
might um
have greater value than it does in arm

2854
00:50:31,670 --> 00:50:31,680
have greater value than it does in arm
 

2855
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:32,950
have greater value than it does in arm
wrestling obviously technique is

2856
00:50:32,950 --> 00:50:32,960
wrestling obviously technique is
 

2857
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:34,870
wrestling obviously technique is
extremely important in arm wrestling but

2858
00:50:34,870 --> 00:50:34,880
extremely important in arm wrestling but
 

2859
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:36,870
extremely important in arm wrestling but
power is

2860
00:50:36,870 --> 00:50:36,880
power is
 

2861
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:39,270
power is
like can defeat technique

2862
00:50:39,270 --> 00:50:39,280
like can defeat technique
 

2863
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:41,190
like can defeat technique
it seems like yeah in wrestling you can

2864
00:50:41,190 --> 00:50:41,200
it seems like yeah in wrestling you can
 

2865
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:42,390
it seems like yeah in wrestling you can
get away

2866
00:50:42,390 --> 00:50:42,400
get away
 

2867
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:44,870
get away
there's a lot of ways you can really uh

2868
00:50:44,870 --> 00:50:44,880
there's a lot of ways you can really uh
 

2869
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:47,510
there's a lot of ways you can really uh
uh do sneak attacks sort of use leverage

2870
00:50:47,510 --> 00:50:47,520
uh do sneak attacks sort of use leverage
 

2871
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:49,270
uh do sneak attacks sort of use leverage
all those kinds of things so there's

2872
00:50:49,270 --> 00:50:49,280
all those kinds of things so there's
 

2873
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:52,069
all those kinds of things so there's
even more incentive to do play and all

2874
00:50:52,069 --> 00:50:52,079
even more incentive to do play and all
 

2875
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:54,549
even more incentive to do play and all
that kind of stuff yeah but uh

2876
00:50:54,549 --> 00:50:54,559
that kind of stuff yeah but uh
 

2877
00:50:54,559 --> 00:50:56,069
that kind of stuff yeah but uh
do you do you see the parallels between

2878
00:50:56,069 --> 00:50:56,079
do you do you see the parallels between
 

2879
00:50:56,079 --> 00:50:57,589
do you do you see the parallels between
the two worlds oh yeah wrestling and arm

2880
00:50:57,589 --> 00:50:57,599
the two worlds oh yeah wrestling and arm
 

2881
00:50:57,599 --> 00:50:58,950
the two worlds oh yeah wrestling and arm

i don't know two hours a year yeah
so the first this first run of the video

3044
00:53:47,190 --> 00:53:47,200
so the first this first run of the video
 

3045
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:49,030
so the first this first run of the video
i think was a little over an hour and

3046
00:53:49,030 --> 00:53:49,040
i think was a little over an hour and
 

3047
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:50,710
i think was a little over an hour and
then i took a break and i probably did

3048
00:53:50,710 --> 00:53:50,720
then i took a break and i probably did
 

3049
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:53,270
then i took a break and i probably did
another 45 minutes or so but

3050
00:53:53,270 --> 00:53:53,280
another 45 minutes or so but
 

3051
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:54,950
another 45 minutes or so but
i mean do you

3052
00:53:54,950 --> 00:53:54,960

how can are you okay
 

3055
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:59,270
how can are you okay
with the endurance aspect of this yeah

3056
00:53:59,270 --> 00:53:59,280
with the endurance aspect of this yeah
 

3057
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:00,710
with the endurance aspect of this yeah
that's probably like when you talk to

3058
00:54:00,710 --> 00:54:00,720
that's probably like when you talk to
 

3059
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:02,069
that's probably like when you talk to
the arm wrestling world that's probably

3060
00:54:02,069 --> 00:54:02,079
the arm wrestling world that's probably
 

3061
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:04,870
the arm wrestling world that's probably
what i'm best known for is my endurance

3062
00:54:04,870 --> 00:54:04,880
what i'm best known for is my endurance
 

3063
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:06,950
what i'm best known for is my endurance
so this helps build that

3064
00:54:06,950 --> 00:54:06,960
so this helps build that
 

3065
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:08,710
so this helps build that
it does but that's not why i'm doing it

3066
00:54:08,710 --> 00:54:08,720
it does but that's not why i'm doing it
 

3067
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:10,950
it does but that's not why i'm doing it
i'm doing it to get strong

3068
00:54:10,950 --> 00:54:10,960
i'm doing it to get strong
 

3069
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:13,109
i'm doing it to get strong
in my opinion this is this is one of the

3070
00:54:13,109 --> 00:54:13,119
in my opinion this is this is one of the
 

3071
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:15,670
in my opinion this is this is one of the
best ways to get strong especially far

3072
00:54:15,670 --> 00:54:15,680
best ways to get strong especially far
 

3073
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:18,230
best ways to get strong especially far
away from the from a tournament uh or or

every single thing i like to try and be
more and more aggressive and if someone

3648
01:04:20,870 --> 01:04:20,880
more and more aggressive and if someone
 

3649
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:22,230
more and more aggressive and if someone
matches me

what it sounds like yeah your wrist is
flopped so yeah but you're like you're

4386
01:17:11,590 --> 01:17:11,600
flopped so yeah but you're like you're
 

4387
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:14,630
flopped so yeah but you're like you're
losing pushing so he is pushing from a

4388
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:14,640
losing pushing so he is pushing from a
 

4389
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:17,910
losing pushing so he is pushing from a
losing position no he will be offensive

losing position no he will be offensive
 

4391
01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:20,229
losing position no he will be offensive
so he will be in a press so offensively

so he will be in a press so offensively
 

4393
01:17:20,239 --> 01:17:22,790
so he will be in a press so offensively
so he'll give his hand away so that he

4394
01:17:22,790 --> 01:17:22,800
so he'll give his hand away so that he
 

4395
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:24,550
so he'll give his hand away so that he
can get his shoulder behind it properly

can get his shoulder behind it properly
 

4397
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:26,390
can get his shoulder behind it properly
so he doesn't

4398
01:17:26,390 --> 01:17:26,400
so he doesn't
 

4399
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:29,830
so he doesn't
wow right so you can press press means

01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:38,950
without having that hook position right
which is what most people are always

4406
01:17:38,950 --> 01:17:38,960
which is what most people are always
 

4407
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:40,149
which is what most people are always
looking for

4408
01:17:40,149 --> 01:17:40,159
looking for
 

4409
01:17:40,159 --> 01:17:41,750
looking for
and jerry's looking for it as well and

4410
01:17:41,750 --> 01:17:41,760
and jerry's looking for it as well and
 

4411
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:43,590
and jerry's looking for it as well and
then so example there's another one

4412
01:17:43,590 --> 01:17:43,600
then so example there's another one

yeah he's a top roller
 

4417
01:17:47,199 --> 01:17:49,910
yeah he's a top roller
right uh he basically that's his that's

4418
01:17:49,910 --> 01:17:49,920
right uh he basically that's his that's
 

4419
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:52,149
right uh he basically that's his that's
his great moves it's top roll and his

4420
01:17:52,149 --> 01:17:52,159
his great moves it's top roll and his
 

4421
01:17:52,159 --> 01:17:55,590
his great moves it's top roll and his
other weapons aren't nearly as powerful

4422
01:17:55,590 --> 01:17:55,600
other weapons aren't nearly as powerful
 

4423
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:56,470
other weapons aren't nearly as powerful
this

4424
01:17:56,470 --> 01:17:56,480
this
 

4425
01:17:56,480 --> 01:17:58,310
this
incredible top roll and then you have a

4426
01:17:58,310 --> 01:17:58,320
incredible top roll and then you have a
 

4427
01:17:58,320 --> 01:18:00,310
incredible top roll and then you have a
lot of athletes that are more blended

4428
01:18:00,310 --> 01:18:00,320
lot of athletes that are more blended
 

4429
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:02,709
lot of athletes that are more blended
okay they have a lot of good options

4430
01:18:02,709 --> 01:18:02,719
okay they have a lot of good options
 

4431
01:18:02,719 --> 01:18:05,110
okay they have a lot of good options
um i think that i probably fall more

4432
01:18:05,110 --> 01:18:05,120
um i think that i probably fall more
 

4433
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:07,030
um i think that i probably fall more
into that category

4434
01:18:07,030 --> 01:18:07,040
into that category
 

4435
01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:10,310
into that category
you have people who are more speed guys

4436
01:18:10,310 --> 01:18:10,320
you have people who are more speed guys
 

4437
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:12,550
you have people who are more speed guys
okay so they

4438
01:18:12,550 --> 01:18:12,560
okay so they
 

4439
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:15,350
okay so they
try and do very little uh i'd call it

4440
01:18:15,350 --> 01:18:15,360
try and do very little uh i'd call it
 

4441
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:16,630
try and do very little uh i'd call it
attrition

4442
01:18:16,630 --> 01:18:16,640
attrition
 

4443
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:17,990
attrition
right so

4444
01:18:17,990 --> 01:18:18,000

a lot of people are very willing to
 

4447
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:21,189
a lot of people are very willing to
trade energy

4448
01:18:21,189 --> 01:18:21,199
trade energy
 

4449
01:18:21,199 --> 01:18:23,910
trade energy
because they have faith that their their

4450
01:18:23,910 --> 01:18:23,920
because they have faith that their their
 

4451
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:26,229
because they have faith that their their
gas tank or their pool eventually will

4452
01:18:26,229 --> 01:18:26,239
gas tank or their pool eventually will
 

4453
01:18:26,239 --> 01:18:27,590
gas tank or their pool eventually will
tire the other person out so anytime

4454

way they they train
um

4532
01:19:43,189 --> 01:19:43,199
um
 

4533
01:19:43,199 --> 01:19:45,990
um
yeah most guys at a higher level it all

4534
01:19:45,990 --> 01:19:46,000
yeah most guys at a higher level it all
 

4535
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,070

starts to kind of it starts to get more
 

4537
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:50,149
starts to kind of it starts to get more
and more difficult to be a specialist at

4538
01:19:50,149 --> 01:19:50,159
and more difficult to be a specialist at
 

4539
01:19:50,159 --> 01:19:51,750
and more difficult to be a specialist at
the high level now

4540
01:19:51,750 --> 01:19:51,760
the high level now
 

4541
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:53,270
the high level now
some people just have little holes in

4542
01:19:53,270 --> 01:19:53,280
some people just have little holes in
 

4543
01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:56,149
some people just have little holes in
their games

4544
01:19:56,149 --> 01:19:56,159

 

4545
01:19:56,159 --> 01:19:58,790

it's rare to get someone who can really

4546
01:19:58,790 --> 01:19:58,800
it's rare to get someone who can really
 

4547
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:02,550
it's rare to get someone who can really
do all the moves it's very rare

4548
01:20:02,550 --> 01:20:02,560
do all the moves it's very rare
 

4549
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:06,070
do all the moves it's very rare
what uh where would you put lavon

4550
01:20:06,070 --> 01:20:06,080
what uh where would you put lavon
 

4551
01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:08,870
what uh where would you put lavon
uh i would not say he's a specialist i'd

4552
01:20:08,870 --> 01:20:08,880
uh i would not say he's a specialist i'd
 

4553
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:12,229
uh i would not say he's a specialist i'd
say his top role is his strongest move

4554
01:20:12,229 --> 01:20:12,239
say his top role is his strongest move
 

4555
01:20:12,239 --> 01:20:14,390
say his top role is his strongest move
top roll is his strongest move yeah

4556
01:20:14,390 --> 01:20:14,400
top roll is his strongest move yeah
 

4557
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:17,990
top roll is his strongest move yeah
uh and the interesting thing about the

4558
01:20:17,990 --> 01:20:18,000
uh and the interesting thing about the
 

4559
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:21,510
uh and the interesting thing about the
specialist versus the blender

4560
01:20:21,510 --> 01:20:21,520

 

4561
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:23,350

there's a counter

4562
01:20:23,350 --> 01:20:23,360
there's a counter
 

4563
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:26,550
there's a counter
right every move has a move that

4564
01:20:26,550 --> 01:20:26,560
right every move has a move that
 

4565
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:29,350
right every move has a move that
theoretically should be the right choice

4566
01:20:29,350 --> 01:20:29,360
theoretically should be the right choice
 

4567
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:33,110
theoretically should be the right choice
so if you're a single move guy uh

4568
01:20:33,110 --> 01:20:33,120
so if you're a single move guy uh
 

4569
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:34,310
so if you're a single move guy uh
there's gonna be a guy out there who'll

4570
01:20:34,310 --> 01:20:34,320
there's gonna be a guy out there who'll
 

4571
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:35,510
there's gonna be a guy out there who'll
get you

4572
01:20:35,510 --> 01:20:35,520
get you
 

4573
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:37,030
get you
yeah it'll be very difficult for you to

4574
01:20:37,030 --> 01:20:37,040
yeah it'll be very difficult for you to
 

4575
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:39,430
yeah it'll be very difficult for you to
beat that guy um

4576
01:20:39,430 --> 01:20:39,440
beat that guy um
 

4577
01:20:39,440 --> 01:20:40,229
beat that guy um
but

4578
01:20:40,229 --> 01:20:40,239
but
 

4579
01:20:40,239 --> 01:20:43,110
but
like when you come to like a tournament

4580
01:20:43,110 --> 01:20:43,120
like when you come to like a tournament
 

4581
01:20:43,120 --> 01:20:45,750
like when you come to like a tournament
typically specialists do much better in

4582
01:20:45,750 --> 01:20:45,760
typically specialists do much better in
 

4583
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:47,669
typically specialists do much better in
tournament scenarios

4584
01:20:47,669 --> 01:20:47,679
tournament scenarios
 

4585
01:20:47,679 --> 01:20:49,990
tournament scenarios
because their singular move can get them

4586
01:20:49,990 --> 01:20:50,000
because their singular move can get them
 

4587
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:51,669
because their singular move can get them
through a tournament very quickly and

4588
01:20:51,669 --> 01:20:51,679
through a tournament very quickly and
 

4589
01:20:51,679 --> 01:20:52,870
through a tournament very quickly and
efficiently

4590
01:20:52,870 --> 01:20:52,880
efficiently
 

4591
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:54,229
efficiently
whereas you get a blender in a

4592
01:20:54,229 --> 01:20:54,239
whereas you get a blender in a
 

4593
01:20:54,239 --> 01:20:55,270
whereas you get a blender in a
tournament

4594
01:20:55,270 --> 01:20:55,280
tournament
 

4595
01:20:55,280 --> 01:20:57,510
tournament
they typically will have longer and more

4596
01:20:57,510 --> 01:20:57,520
they typically will have longer and more
 

4597
01:20:57,520 --> 01:21:00,470
they typically will have longer and more
difficult matches and you out right yeah

4598
01:21:00,470 --> 01:21:00,480
difficult matches and you out right yeah
 

4599
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:03,270
difficult matches and you out right yeah
yeah but in in super match format

4600
01:21:03,270 --> 01:21:03,280
yeah but in in super match format
 

4601
01:21:03,280 --> 01:21:04,950
yeah but in in super match format
typically blenders

4602
01:21:04,950 --> 01:21:04,960
typically blenders
 

4603
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:06,550
typically blenders
do better

4604
01:21:06,550 --> 01:21:06,560
do better
 

4605
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:09,110
do better
so we uh offline also talked about arm

4606
01:21:09,110 --> 01:21:09,120
so we uh offline also talked about arm
 

4607
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:11,510
so we uh offline also talked about arm
sumo or uh freedom arm wrestling i don't

4608
01:21:11,510 --> 01:21:11,520
sumo or uh freedom arm wrestling i don't

4611
01:21:13,040 --> 01:21:17,350
know how you want to call it i love
freedom

4612
01:21:17,350 --> 01:21:17,360

 

4613
01:21:17,360 --> 01:21:20,470

exactly north american way uh

4614
01:21:20,470 --> 01:21:20,480
exactly north american way uh
 

4615
01:21:20,480 --> 01:21:23,590
exactly north american way uh
so what so this is this is this idea and

4616
01:21:23,590 --> 01:21:23,600
so what so this is this is this idea and
 

4617
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:26,790
so what so this is this is this idea and
i watched a few videos and it looks fun

4618
01:21:26,790 --> 01:21:26,800
i watched a few videos and it looks fun
 

4619
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:28,870
i watched a few videos and it looks fun
it's basically removing the restriction

4620
01:21:28,870 --> 01:21:28,880
it's basically removing the restriction
 

4621
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:32,070
it's basically removing the restriction
of having to keep your elbow on the pad

4622
01:21:32,070 --> 01:21:32,080
of having to keep your elbow on the pad
 

4623
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:33,990
of having to keep your elbow on the pad
and just being able to arm wrestle over

4624
01:21:33,990 --> 01:21:34,000
and just being able to arm wrestle over
 

4625
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,149
and just being able to arm wrestle over
the whole table i i think you've

4626
01:21:36,149 --> 01:21:36,159
the whole table i i think you've
 

4627
01:21:36,159 --> 01:21:37,910
the whole table i i think you've
mentioned that the criticism that gets

4628
01:21:37,910 --> 01:21:37,920
mentioned that the criticism that gets
 

4629
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:39,910
mentioned that the criticism that gets
is it might be injury prone or something

4630
01:21:39,910 --> 01:21:39,920
is it might be injury prone or something
 

4631
01:21:39,920 --> 01:21:42,070
is it might be injury prone or something
like that yeah so can you describe this

4632
01:21:42,070 --> 01:21:42,080
like that yeah so can you describe this
 

4633
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:45,030
like that yeah so can you describe this
arm sumo freedom arm wrestling idea

4634
01:21:45,030 --> 01:21:45,040
arm sumo freedom arm wrestling idea
 

4635
01:21:45,040 --> 01:21:46,950
arm sumo freedom arm wrestling idea
right when you come to freedom arm

4636
01:21:46,950 --> 01:21:46,960
right when you come to freedom arm
 

4637
01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:48,709
right when you come to freedom arm
wrestling basically

4638
01:21:48,709 --> 01:21:48,719
wrestling basically
 

4639
01:21:48,719 --> 01:21:51,110
wrestling basically
it removes the limitation of a standard

4640
01:21:51,110 --> 01:21:51,120
it removes the limitation of a standard
 

4641
01:21:51,120 --> 01:21:52,950
it removes the limitation of a standard
arm wrestling table yeah right so

4642
01:21:52,950 --> 01:21:52,960
arm wrestling table yeah right so
 

4643
01:21:52,960 --> 01:21:54,470
arm wrestling table yeah right so
basically every single thing is a

4644
01:21:54,470 --> 01:21:54,480
basically every single thing is a
 

4645
01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:56,229
basically every single thing is a
freedom arm wrestling table some are

4646
01:21:56,229 --> 01:21:56,239
freedom arm wrestling table some are
 

4647
01:21:56,239 --> 01:21:58,629
freedom arm wrestling table some are
better than others all right so looking

4648
01:21:58,629 --> 01:21:58,639
better than others all right so looking
 

4649
01:21:58,639 --> 01:22:00,550
better than others all right so looking
for that nice table where we can kind of

4650
01:22:00,550 --> 01:22:00,560
for that nice table where we can kind of
 

4651
01:22:00,560 --> 01:22:02,709
for that nice table where we can kind of
stand apart from each other and we're

4652
01:22:02,709 --> 01:22:02,719
stand apart from each other and we're
 

4653
01:22:02,719 --> 01:22:05,590
stand apart from each other and we're
anatomically you know in a fairly safe

4654
01:22:05,590 --> 01:22:05,600
anatomically you know in a fairly safe
 

4655
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:06,950
anatomically you know in a fairly safe
position

4656
01:22:06,950 --> 01:22:06,960
position
 

4657
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:09,189
position
and the rules and freedom the way you

4658
01:22:09,189 --> 01:22:09,199
and the rules and freedom the way you
 

4659
01:22:09,199 --> 01:22:11,669
and the rules and freedom the way you
win is like the knuckles

4660
01:22:11,669 --> 01:22:11,679
win is like the knuckles
 

4661
01:22:11,679 --> 01:22:13,990
win is like the knuckles
must either touch the tabletop

4662
01:22:13,990 --> 01:22:14,000
must either touch the tabletop
 

4663
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,550
must either touch the tabletop
or you hold it off the edge

4664
01:22:16,550 --> 01:22:16,560
or you hold it off the edge
 

4665
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:18,470
or you hold it off the edge
for for a three count

4666
01:22:18,470 --> 01:22:18,480
for for a three count
 

4667
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:20,310
for for a three count
right so this is the main way to win yes

4668
01:22:20,310 --> 01:22:20,320
right so this is the main way to win yes
 

4669
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:21,430
right so this is the main way to win yes
you can foul like if you lift the

4670
01:22:21,430 --> 01:22:21,440
you can foul like if you lift the
 

4671
01:22:21,440 --> 01:22:23,189
you can foul like if you lift the
eyeball up still a foul

4672
01:22:23,189 --> 01:22:23,199
eyeball up still a foul
 

4673
01:22:23,199 --> 01:22:25,030
eyeball up still a foul
but you have the entire playing surface

4674
01:22:25,030 --> 01:22:25,040
but you have the entire playing surface
 

4675
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:26,870
but you have the entire playing surface
so your elbow is no longer limited to

4676
01:22:26,870 --> 01:22:26,880
so your elbow is no longer limited to
 

4677
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:29,350
so your elbow is no longer limited to
your seven by seven or seven by nine pad

4678
01:22:29,350 --> 01:22:29,360
your seven by seven or seven by nine pad
 

4679
01:22:29,360 --> 01:22:30,870
your seven by seven or seven by nine pad
so you can move it all over the table

4680
01:22:30,870 --> 01:22:30,880
so you can move it all over the table
 

4681
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:33,350
so you can move it all over the table
you can move your body around the table

4682
01:22:33,350 --> 01:22:33,360
you can move your body around the table
 

4683
01:22:33,360 --> 01:22:35,430
you can move your body around the table
a bit too and if it's a big table your

4684
01:22:35,430 --> 01:22:35,440
a bit too and if it's a big table your
 

4685
01:22:35,440 --> 01:22:38,390
a bit too and if it's a big table your
body could largely be on the table yeah

4686
01:22:38,390 --> 01:22:38,400
body could largely be on the table yeah
 

4687
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:40,229
body could largely be on the table yeah
so it basically it's like adjusting your

4688
01:22:40,229 --> 01:22:40,239
so it basically it's like adjusting your
 

4689
01:22:40,239 --> 01:22:42,550
so it basically it's like adjusting your
ring size so arm wrestling you're

4690
01:22:42,550 --> 01:22:42,560
ring size so arm wrestling you're
 

4691
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:44,709
ring size so arm wrestling you're
fighting in a phone booth yeah right so

4692
01:22:44,709 --> 01:22:44,719
fighting in a phone booth yeah right so
 

4693
01:22:44,719 --> 01:22:46,149
fighting in a phone booth yeah right so
you get you're fighting in a field

4694
01:22:46,149 --> 01:22:46,159
you get you're fighting in a field
 

4695
01:22:46,159 --> 01:22:47,910
you get you're fighting in a field
you're fighting you know just bigger so

stronger that way but i mean do this do
 

4801
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:36,390
stronger that way but i mean do this do
the lifts

4802
01:24:36,390 --> 01:24:36,400
the lifts
 

4803
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:38,149
the lifts
if you go to the gym just start doing

4804
01:24:38,149 --> 01:24:38,159
if you go to the gym just start doing
 

4805
01:24:38,159 --> 01:24:41,350
if you go to the gym just start doing
the lifts uh and right away those will

4806
01:24:41,350 --> 01:24:41,360
the lifts uh and right away those will
 

4807
01:24:41,360 --> 01:24:43,590
the lifts uh and right away those will
technically prepare you what are what

4808
01:24:43,590 --> 01:24:43,600
technically prepare you what are what
 

4809
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:46,229
technically prepare you what are what
are the lists can we describe yeah so

4810
01:24:46,229 --> 01:24:46,239
are the lists can we describe yeah so
 

4811
01:24:46,239 --> 01:24:48,470
are the lists can we describe yeah so
i'd say if you want to just keep it very

4812
01:24:48,470 --> 01:24:48,480
i'd say if you want to just keep it very
 

4813
01:24:48,480 --> 01:24:50,709
i'd say if you want to just keep it very
very simple let's just talk about three

4814
01:24:50,709 --> 01:24:50,719
very simple let's just talk about three
 

4815
01:24:50,719 --> 01:24:51,990
very simple let's just talk about three
there's more there's much more than

4816
01:24:51,990 --> 01:24:52,000
there's more there's much more than
 

4817
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,229
there's more there's much more than
three but like when you talk about

4818
01:24:54,229 --> 01:24:54,239
three but like when you talk about
 

4819
01:24:54,239 --> 01:24:56,070
three but like when you talk about
energy allocation

4820
01:24:56,070 --> 01:24:56,080
energy allocation
 

4821
01:24:56,080 --> 01:24:58,709
energy allocation
these three lifts in my opinion

4822
01:24:58,709 --> 01:24:58,719
these three lifts in my opinion
 

4823
01:24:58,719 --> 01:25:00,709
these three lifts in my opinion
should be like

4824
01:25:00,709 --> 01:25:00,719
should be like
 

4825
01:25:00,719 --> 01:25:02,950
should be like
ninety percent of your investment

4826
01:25:02,950 --> 01:25:02,960
ninety percent of your investment
 

4827
01:25:02,960 --> 01:25:05,270
ninety percent of your investment
is it's very big these three lifts

4828
01:25:05,270 --> 01:25:05,280
is it's very big these three lifts
 

4829
01:25:05,280 --> 01:25:06,790
is it's very big these three lifts
uh

4830
01:25:06,790 --> 01:25:06,800
uh
 

4831
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:07,590
uh
and

4832
01:25:07,590 --> 01:25:07,600
and
 

4833
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:09,990
and
the exact percentages can you can argue

4834
01:25:09,990 --> 01:25:10,000
the exact percentages can you can argue
 

4835
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,229
the exact percentages can you can argue
about it but we'll we'll start off with

4836
01:25:12,229 --> 01:25:12,239
about it but we'll we'll start off with
 

4837
01:25:12,239 --> 01:25:14,070
about it but we'll we'll start off with
the cupping of the wrist

4838
01:25:14,070 --> 01:25:14,080
the cupping of the wrist
 

4839
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:16,070
the cupping of the wrist
just this this is a simple thing

4840
01:25:16,070 --> 01:25:16,080
just this this is a simple thing
 

4841
01:25:16,080 --> 01:25:17,990
just this this is a simple thing
and do it with a cable

4842
01:25:17,990 --> 01:25:18,000
and do it with a cable
 

4843
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,310
and do it with a cable
uh you know you can get a thicker

4844
01:25:20,310 --> 01:25:20,320
uh you know you can get a thicker
 

4845
01:25:20,320 --> 01:25:22,790
uh you know you can get a thicker
diameter so it kind of you know is is

4846
01:25:22,790 --> 01:25:22,800
diameter so it kind of you know is is
 

4847
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:24,470
diameter so it kind of you know is is
more out on your fingers where an

4848
01:25:24,470 --> 01:25:24,480
more out on your fingers where an
 

4849
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:26,229
more out on your fingers where an
armrest is going to attack you right

4850
01:25:26,229 --> 01:25:26,239
armrest is going to attack you right
 

4851
01:25:26,239 --> 01:25:27,510
armrest is going to attack you right
because any good armrest is going to

4852
01:25:27,510 --> 01:25:27,520
because any good armrest is going to
 

4853
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:29,990
because any good armrest is going to
attack your fingers so like open hands

4854
01:25:29,990 --> 01:25:30,000

vector is always pulling straight
towards me yeah

4888
01:26:06,229 --> 01:26:06,239
towards me yeah
 

4889
01:26:06,239 --> 01:26:08,870
towards me yeah
yeah so just uh you know cupping

yeah so so that cupping
 

4903
01:26:20,480 --> 01:26:23,189
yeah so so that cupping
yeah that's a massive part of the sport

4904
01:26:23,189 --> 01:26:23,199
yeah that's a massive part of the sport
 

4905
01:26:23,199 --> 01:26:24,709

uh so
 

4907
01:26:24,719 --> 01:26:26,790
uh so
now when you think what does the cup do

4908
01:26:26,790 --> 01:26:26,800
now when you think what does the cup do
 

4909
01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:28,310
now when you think what does the cup do
to the other person

4910
01:26:28,310 --> 01:26:28,320
to the other person
 

4911
01:26:28,320 --> 01:26:29,910
to the other person
if i cup

4912
01:26:29,910 --> 01:26:29,920
if i cup
 

4913
01:26:29,920 --> 01:26:32,229
if i cup
they get turned over

4914
01:26:32,229 --> 01:26:32,239
they get turned over
 

4915
01:26:32,239 --> 01:26:33,030
they get turned over
right

4916
01:26:33,030 --> 01:26:33,040
right
 

4917
01:26:33,040 --> 01:26:36,550
right
so this has to get really strong

got it yeah
those two things those two things

4938
01:26:56,629 --> 01:26:56,639
those two things those two things
 

4939
01:26:56,639 --> 01:26:59,189
those two things those two things
together this cupping and rolling

4940
01:26:59,189 --> 01:26:59,199
together this cupping and rolling
 

4941
01:26:59,199 --> 01:27:00,310
together this cupping and rolling
this is what's going to make the

4942
01:27:00,310 --> 01:27:00,320
this is what's going to make the
 

4943
01:27:00,320 --> 01:27:02,070

to pieces
they have very little good options it's

4952
01:27:09,910 --> 01:27:09,920
they have very little good options it's
 

4953
01:27:09,920 --> 01:27:11,990
they have very little good options it's
all like nasty stuff

4954

bands would be good for this bands are

4974
01:27:35,990 --> 01:27:36,000
bands would be good for this bands are
 

4975
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:37,910
bands would be good for this bands are
great because they're easy to transport

4976
01:27:37,910 --> 01:27:37,920
great because they're easy to transport
 

4977
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:40,629
great because they're easy to transport
the only problem i have with bands is

4978
01:27:40,629 --> 01:27:40,639
the only problem i have with bands is
 

4979
01:27:40,639 --> 01:27:42,790
the only problem i have with bands is
like if you like to measure you know if

4980
01:27:42,790 --> 01:27:42,800
like if you like to measure you know if
 

4981
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:44,229
like if you like to measure you know if
you like to be precise bands just aren't

4982
01:27:44,229 --> 01:27:44,239
you like to be precise bands just aren't
 

4983
01:27:44,239 --> 01:27:46,629
you like to be precise bands just aren't
that precise right so to have growth

4984
01:27:46,629 --> 01:27:46,639
that precise right so to have growth
 

4985
01:27:46,639 --> 01:27:48,550
that precise right so to have growth
yeah yeah just i mean it's just like you

4986

prescription is kind of a band is kind

4990
01:27:52,950 --> 01:27:52,960
prescription is kind of a band is kind
 

4991
01:27:52,960 --> 01:27:54,629
prescription is kind of a band is kind
of like and a lot of people myself

4992
01:27:54,629 --> 01:27:54,639
of like and a lot of people myself
 

4993
01:27:54,639 --> 01:27:57,669
of like and a lot of people myself
included i like to uh i like to know

4994
01:27:57,669 --> 01:27:57,679
included i like to uh i like to know
 

4995
01:27:57,679 --> 01:28:02,070
included i like to uh i like to know
exactly my outputs so so weights

4996
01:28:02,070 --> 01:28:02,080
exactly my outputs so so weights
 

4997
01:28:02,080 --> 01:28:05,030
exactly my outputs so so weights
so it would be like cables yep

4998
01:28:05,030 --> 01:28:05,040
so it would be like cables yep
 

4999
01:28:05,040 --> 01:28:07,750
so it would be like cables yep
cables are nice bands are great too i i

5000
01:28:07,750 --> 01:28:07,760
cables are nice bands are great too i i
 

5001
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:09,830
cables are nice bands are great too i i
mix the two bands are

5002
01:28:09,830 --> 01:28:09,840
mix the two bands are
 

5003
01:28:09,840 --> 01:28:13,350
mix the two bands are
uh when i kind of don't need to

5004
01:28:13,350 --> 01:28:13,360
uh when i kind of don't need to
 

5005
01:28:13,360 --> 01:28:15,910
uh when i kind of don't need to
they're more like easy for me i when i

5006
01:28:15,910 --> 01:28:15,920
they're more like easy for me i when i
 

5007
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:17,350

train bands
bands are dangerous because the

5010
01:28:18,470 --> 01:28:18,480
bands are dangerous because the
 

5011
01:28:18,480 --> 01:28:20,149
bands are dangerous because the
acceleration is so high on them like

5012
01:28:20,149 --> 01:28:20,159
acceleration is so high on them like
 

5013
01:28:20,159 --> 01:28:21,990
acceleration is so high on them like
when you screw up with band training the

5014
01:28:21,990 --> 01:28:22,000
when you screw up with band training the
 

5015
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,950
when you screw up with band training the
acceleration is way faster than gravity

5016
01:28:24,950 --> 01:28:24,960
acceleration is way faster than gravity
 

5017
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:27,430
acceleration is way faster than gravity
right so if you do something bad it can

5018
01:28:27,430 --> 01:28:27,440
right so if you do something bad it can
 

5019
01:28:27,440 --> 01:28:30,310
right so if you do something bad it can
can make it go really much worse yeah

5020
01:28:30,310 --> 01:28:30,320
can make it go really much worse yeah
 

5021
01:28:30,320 --> 01:28:32,629
can make it go really much worse yeah
it's funny that you didn't mention

5022
01:28:32,629 --> 01:28:32,639
it's funny that you didn't mention
 

5023
01:28:32,639 --> 01:28:36,550
it's funny that you didn't mention
bicep curls or uh well it's a chain

bicep curls or uh well it's a chain
it's a chain and so you're i mean the

5026
01:28:38,709 --> 01:28:38,719
it's a chain and so you're i mean the
 

5027
01:28:38,719 --> 01:28:40,550
it's a chain and so you're i mean the
idea if you focus on these three the

5028
01:28:40,550 --> 01:28:40,560
idea if you focus on these three the
 

5029
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:42,310
idea if you focus on these three the
other stuff catches up like it's all

5030
01:28:42,310 --> 01:28:42,320
other stuff catches up like it's all
 

5031
01:28:42,320 --> 01:28:44,390
other stuff catches up like it's all
involved this whole this whole thing is

5032
01:28:44,390 --> 01:28:44,400
involved this whole this whole thing is

often work
it um explicitly yeah so many of the

5078
01:29:33,189 --> 01:29:33,199
it um explicitly yeah so many of the
 

5079
01:29:33,199 --> 01:29:35,430
it um explicitly yeah so many of the
chokes require yeah ability to it's

5080

and so you just getting the muscle
 

5091
01:29:47,679 --> 01:29:50,229
and so you just getting the muscle
whatever that's involved the muscle the

5092
01:29:50,229 --> 01:29:50,239
whatever that's involved the muscle the
 

5093
01:29:50,239 --> 01:29:51,830
whatever that's involved the muscle the
turning the pressure because that's

the very specific exact motion yeah so

5112
01:30:12,310 --> 01:30:12,320
the very specific exact motion yeah so
 

5113
01:30:12,320 --> 01:30:13,830

if i was going to do jiu jitsu i'd be

5114
01:30:13,830 --> 01:30:13,840
if i was going to do jiu jitsu i'd be
 

5115

like working out with the ghee yeah the

5116
01:30:15,830 --> 01:30:15,840
like working out with the ghee yeah the
 

5117
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:17,350
like working out with the ghee yeah the
problem is

5118
01:30:17,350 --> 01:30:17,360
problem is
 

5119
01:30:17,360 --> 01:30:21,270
problem is
you know uh it's difficult to construct

5120
01:30:21,270 --> 01:30:21,280
you know uh it's difficult to construct
 

5121
01:30:21,280 --> 01:30:23,910
you know uh it's difficult to construct
the um the exact

5122
01:30:23,910 --> 01:30:23,920
the um the exact
 

5123
01:30:23,920 --> 01:30:25,510
the um the exact
so you have to actually go with people

5124
01:30:25,510 --> 01:30:25,520
so you have to actually go with people
 

5125
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:28,390
so you have to actually go with people
and then they don't like being choked up

5126
01:30:28,390 --> 01:30:28,400
and then they don't like being choked up
 

5127
01:30:28,400 --> 01:30:30,709
and then they don't like being choked up
right so like it's hard to i'm actually

5128
01:30:30,709 --> 01:30:30,719
right so like it's hard to i'm actually
 

5129
01:30:30,719 --> 01:30:33,270
right so like it's hard to i'm actually

the risk of destroying yourself
 

6557
01:55:43,040 --> 01:55:45,109
the risk of destroying yourself

later there's always time
 

6621
01:56:53,599 --> 01:56:54,830
later there's always time
that's like a long period of

that's like a long period of
 

6623
01:56:54,840 --> 01:56:57,589
that's like a long period of
contemplation yeah

6624
01:56:57,589 --> 01:56:57,599
contemplation yeah
 

6625
01:56:57,599 --> 01:56:59,750
contemplation yeah
so for the first thousand years it'll be

6626
01:56:59,750 --> 01:56:59,760
so for the first thousand years it'll be
 

6627
01:56:59,760 --> 01:57:02,310
so for the first thousand years it'll be
the dorito period of the lex life and

6628
01:57:02,310 --> 01:57:02,320
the dorito period of the lex life and
 

6629
01:57:02,320 --> 01:57:03,430
the dorito period of the lex life and
then yeah

6630
01:57:03,430 --> 01:57:03,440
then yeah
 

6631
01:57:03,440 --> 01:57:04,950
then yeah
if you could you could be like jabba the

if you could you could be like jabba the
 

6633
01:57:04,960 --> 01:57:07,270
if you could you could be like jabba the
hutt for a thousand years you mentioned

6634
01:57:07,270 --> 01:57:07,280
hutt for a thousand years you mentioned
 

6635
01:57:07,280 --> 01:57:09,189
hutt for a thousand years you mentioned
aliens very important topic do you

6636
01:57:09,189 --> 01:57:09,199
aliens very important topic do you
 

6637
01:57:09,199 --> 01:57:10,550
aliens very important topic do you
actually think about

6638
01:57:10,550 --> 01:57:10,560
actually think about
 

6639
01:57:10,560 --> 01:57:12,629
actually think about
about this has been an increased

6640
01:57:12,629 --> 01:57:12,639
about this has been an increased
 

6641
01:57:12,639 --> 01:57:13,669
about this has been an increased
interest

6642
01:57:13,669 --> 01:57:13,679
interest
 

6643
01:57:13,679 --> 01:57:17,270
interest
and there's been increased ufo sightings

6644
01:57:17,270 --> 01:57:17,280
and there's been increased ufo sightings
 

6645
01:57:17,280 --> 01:57:19,109
and there's been increased ufo sightings
and encounters all that kind of stuff

6646
01:57:19,109 --> 01:57:19,119
and encounters all that kind of stuff
 

6647
01:57:19,119 --> 01:57:21,189
and encounters all that kind of stuff
the u.s government at least releasing

6648
01:57:21,189 --> 01:57:21,199
the u.s government at least releasing
 

6649
01:57:21,199 --> 01:57:22,229
the u.s government at least releasing
data

uh pilot observations and from airplanes
 

6657
01:57:29,119 --> 01:57:31,030
uh pilot observations and from airplanes
of ufos do you think about this kind of

6658
01:57:31,030 --> 01:57:31,040
of ufos do you think about this kind of
 

6659
01:57:31,040 --> 01:57:32,870
of ufos do you think about this kind of
stuff because you met you mentioned in

6660
01:57:32,870 --> 01:57:32,880
stuff because you met you mentioned in
 

6661
01:57:32,880 --> 01:57:34,790
stuff because you met you mentioned in
the following context you mentioned like

6662
01:57:34,790 --> 01:57:34,800
the following context you mentioned like
 

6663
01:57:34,800 --> 01:57:37,430
the following context you mentioned like
our simas will get our [\h__\h] together

6664
01:57:37,430 --> 01:57:37,440
our simas will get our [\h__\h] together
 

6665
01:57:37,440 --> 01:57:39,669
our simas will get our [\h__\h] together
when the aliens eventually come

6666
01:57:39,669 --> 01:57:39,679
when the aliens eventually come
 

6667
01:57:39,679 --> 01:57:41,990
when the aliens eventually come
yeah um

6668
01:57:41,990 --> 01:57:42,000
yeah um
 

6669
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:43,830
yeah um
what do you make of all the sightings is

6670
01:57:43,830 --> 01:57:43,840
what do you make of all the sightings is
 

6671
01:57:43,840 --> 01:57:45,669
what do you make of all the sightings is
that something you think about

6672
01:57:45,669 --> 01:57:45,679
that something you think about
 

6673
01:57:45,679 --> 01:57:47,189
that something you think about
i thought about it a lot when i was

6674
01:57:47,189 --> 01:57:47,199
i thought about it a lot when i was
 

6675
01:57:47,199 --> 01:57:49,990
i thought about it a lot when i was
younger um and i've just i made my

6676
01:57:49,990 --> 01:57:50,000
younger um and i've just i made my
 

6677
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:51,589
younger um and i've just i made my
conclusions and

6678
01:57:51,589 --> 01:57:51,599
conclusions and
 

6679
01:57:51,599 --> 01:57:53,430
conclusions and
yeah i i don't think that there's a

6680
01:57:53,430 --> 01:57:53,440
yeah i i don't think that there's a
 

6681
01:57:53,440 --> 01:57:55,430
yeah i i don't think that there's a
possibility that there aren't aliens i

6682
01:57:55,430 --> 01:57:55,440
possibility that there aren't aliens i
 

6683
01:57:55,440 --> 01:57:57,109
possibility that there aren't aliens i
would think it would be impossible for

6684
01:57:57,109 --> 01:57:57,119
would think it would be impossible for
 

6685
01:57:57,119 --> 01:57:59,669
would think it would be impossible for
them not to be aliens uh they're you

6686
01:57:59,669 --> 01:57:59,679
them not to be aliens uh they're you
 

6687
01:57:59,679 --> 01:58:00,629
them not to be aliens uh they're you
know

6688
01:58:00,629 --> 01:58:00,639
know
 

6689
01:58:00,639 --> 01:58:02,629
know
um you know i feel like this is pretty

6690
01:58:02,629 --> 01:58:02,639
um you know i feel like this is pretty
 

6691
01:58:02,639 --> 01:58:04,870
um you know i feel like this is pretty
good real estate so

6692
01:58:04,870 --> 01:58:04,880
good real estate so
 

6693
01:58:04,880 --> 01:58:07,510
good real estate so
you know yeah you'd probably want it but

6694
01:58:07,510 --> 01:58:07,520
you know yeah you'd probably want it but
 

6695
01:58:07,520 --> 01:58:08,870
you know yeah you'd probably want it but
we already might be

6696
01:58:08,870 --> 01:58:08,880
we already might be
 

6697
01:58:08,880 --> 01:58:10,310
we already might be
well i don't even think might i mean

6698
01:58:10,310 --> 01:58:10,320
well i don't even think might i mean
 

6699
01:58:10,320 --> 01:58:12,470
well i don't even think might i mean
it's probably quite likely that we are

6700
01:58:12,470 --> 01:58:12,480
it's probably quite likely that we are
 

6701
01:58:12,480 --> 01:58:14,790
it's probably quite likely that we are
to some degree aliens i mean all life is

6702
01:58:14,790 --> 01:58:14,800
to some degree aliens i mean all life is
 

6703
01:58:14,800 --> 01:58:17,510
to some degree aliens i mean all life is
probably to some degree alien i like the

6704
01:58:17,510 --> 01:58:17,520
probably to some degree alien i like the
 

6705
01:58:17,520 --> 01:58:19,109
probably to some degree alien i like the
real estate so the resources but we're

6706
01:58:19,109 --> 01:58:19,119
real estate so the resources but we're
 

6707
01:58:19,119 --> 01:58:20,870
real estate so the resources but we're
also kind of interesting

6708
01:58:20,870 --> 01:58:20,880
also kind of interesting
 

6709
01:58:20,880 --> 01:58:23,030
also kind of interesting
yeah whatever this ant colony

6710
01:58:23,030 --> 01:58:23,040
yeah whatever this ant colony
 

6711
01:58:23,040 --> 01:58:24,790
yeah whatever this ant colony
of living organisms that we've created

6712
01:58:24,790 --> 01:58:24,800
of living organisms that we've created
 

6713
01:58:24,800 --> 01:58:27,030
of living organisms that we've created
it's kind of interesting to study

6714
01:58:27,030 --> 01:58:27,040
it's kind of interesting to study
 

6715
01:58:27,040 --> 01:58:28,629
it's kind of interesting to study
i i tend to believe that the alien

6716
01:58:28,629 --> 01:58:28,639
i i tend to believe that the alien
 

6717
01:58:28,639 --> 01:58:30,629
i i tend to believe that the alien
civilizations that are

6718
01:58:30,629 --> 01:58:30,639
civilizations that are
 

6719
01:58:30,639 --> 01:58:33,589
civilizations that are
going to reach us or have reached us

6720
01:58:33,589 --> 01:58:33,599
going to reach us or have reached us
 

6721
01:58:33,599 --> 01:58:36,310
going to reach us or have reached us
are far more intelligent

6722
01:58:36,310 --> 01:58:36,320
are far more intelligent
 

6723
01:58:36,320 --> 01:58:37,830
are far more intelligent
just orders of magnitude more

6724
01:58:37,830 --> 01:58:37,840
just orders of magnitude more
 

6725
01:58:37,840 --> 01:58:39,750
just orders of magnitude more
intelligent than us and so it's going to

6726
01:58:39,750 --> 01:58:39,760
intelligent than us and so it's going to
 

6727
01:58:39,760 --> 01:58:41,910
intelligent than us and so it's going to
be very difficult both ways actually for

6728
01:58:41,910 --> 01:58:41,920
be very difficult both ways actually for
 

6729
01:58:41,920 --> 01:58:44,550
be very difficult both ways actually for
us to understand them and for them

6730
01:58:44,550 --> 01:58:44,560
us to understand them and for them
 

6731
01:58:44,560 --> 01:58:46,310
us to understand them and for them
to dumb themselves down enough to

6732
01:58:46,310 --> 01:58:46,320
to dumb themselves down enough to
 

6733
01:58:46,320 --> 01:58:49,109
to dumb themselves down enough to
understand us yeah probably so

6734
01:58:49,109 --> 01:58:49,119
understand us yeah probably so
 

6735
01:58:49,119 --> 01:58:51,030
understand us yeah probably so
they might even just

6736
01:58:51,030 --> 01:58:51,040
they might even just
 

6737
01:58:51,040 --> 01:58:53,589
they might even just
miss our existence all together just

6738
01:58:53,589 --> 01:58:53,599
miss our existence all together just
 

6739
01:58:53,599 --> 01:58:54,950
miss our existence all together just
because it because

6740
01:58:54,950 --> 01:58:54,960
because it because
 

6741
01:58:54,960 --> 01:58:56,629
because it because
i tend to believe i don't know what you

6742
01:58:56,629 --> 01:58:56,639
i tend to believe i don't know what you
 

6743
01:58:56,639 --> 01:58:59,189
i tend to believe i don't know what you
think that we're not that special

6744
01:58:59,189 --> 01:58:59,199
think that we're not that special
 

6745
01:58:59,199 --> 01:59:01,750
think that we're not that special
in terms of all the life forms in the

6746
01:59:01,750 --> 01:59:01,760
in terms of all the life forms in the
 

6747
01:59:01,760 --> 01:59:03,990
in terms of all the life forms in the
universe there's a lot of cool stuff out

6748
01:59:03,990 --> 01:59:04,000
universe there's a lot of cool stuff out
 

6749
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,149
universe there's a lot of cool stuff out
there and has to be

6750
01:59:06,149 --> 01:59:06,159
there and has to be
 

6751
01:59:06,159 --> 01:59:08,629
there and has to be
has to be but to us we're special yeah

6752
01:59:08,629 --> 01:59:08,639
has to be but to us we're special yeah
 

6753
01:59:08,639 --> 01:59:11,189
has to be but to us we're special yeah
well that's all that matters right yeah

6754
01:59:11,189 --> 01:59:11,199
well that's all that matters right yeah
 

6755
01:59:11,199 --> 01:59:13,109
well that's all that matters right yeah
even the human species is the most

6756
01:59:13,109 --> 01:59:13,119
even the human species is the most
 

6757
01:59:13,119 --> 01:59:15,830
even the human species is the most
special to us humans that could be much

6758
01:59:15,830 --> 01:59:15,840
special to us humans that could be much
 

6759
01:59:15,840 --> 01:59:18,390
special to us humans that could be much
more special species here on earth they

6760
01:59:18,390 --> 01:59:18,400
more special species here on earth they
 

6761
01:59:18,400 --> 01:59:20,310
more special species here on earth they
were just totally oblivious to like

6762
01:59:20,310 --> 01:59:20,320
were just totally oblivious to like
 

6763
01:59:20,320 --> 01:59:21,510
were just totally oblivious to like
trees

6764
01:59:21,510 --> 01:59:21,520
trees
 

6765
01:59:21,520 --> 01:59:23,270
trees
on a scale of thousands of years maybe

6766
01:59:23,270 --> 01:59:23,280
on a scale of thousands of years maybe
 

6767

on a scale of thousands of years maybe
they're like they're on to something

6768
01:59:26,550 --> 01:59:26,560
they're like they're on to something
 

6769

lex you know um
 

6771
01:59:30,080 --> 01:59:31,750
lex you know um
i think that

6772
01:59:31,750 --> 01:59:31,760
i think that
 

6773
01:59:31,760 --> 01:59:34,790
i think that
so much of what makes a person special

6774
01:59:34,790 --> 01:59:34,800
so much of what makes a person special
 

6775
01:59:34,800 --> 01:59:37,910
so much of what makes a person special
is what they pass on your kids but but i

6776
01:59:37,910 --> 01:59:37,920
is what they pass on your kids but but i
 

6777
01:59:37,920 --> 01:59:39,750
is what they pass on your kids but but i
think that you are quite special

6778
01:59:39,750 --> 01:59:39,760
think that you are quite special
 

6779
01:59:39,760 --> 01:59:41,030
think that you are quite special
because

6780
01:59:41,030 --> 01:59:41,040
because
 

6781
01:59:41,040 --> 01:59:42,550
because
you're part of this thing that's

6782
01:59:42,550 --> 01:59:42,560
you're part of this thing that's
 

6783
01:59:42,560 --> 01:59:45,189
you're part of this thing that's
potentially giving birth to the next

6784
01:59:45,189 --> 01:59:45,199
potentially giving birth to the next
 

6785
01:59:45,199 --> 01:59:47,510
potentially giving birth to the next
thing

6786
01:59:47,510 --> 01:59:47,520

 

6787
01:59:47,520 --> 01:59:49,830

the robots the robots i should say the

6788
01:59:49,830 --> 01:59:49,840
the robots the robots i should say the
 

6789
01:59:49,840 --> 01:59:52,229
the robots the robots i should say the
funny thing is while talking to devon

6790
01:59:52,229 --> 01:59:52,239
funny thing is while talking to devon
 

6791
01:59:52,239 --> 01:59:55,510
funny thing is while talking to devon
during this podcast i i would a doorbell

6792
01:59:55,510 --> 01:59:55,520
during this podcast i i would a doorbell
 

6793
01:59:55,520 --> 01:59:57,990
during this podcast i i would a doorbell
ring had to go downstairs and there was

6794
01:59:57,990 --> 01:59:58,000
ring had to go downstairs and there was
 

6795
01:59:58,000 --> 01:59:58,950
ring had to go downstairs and there was
a big

6796
01:59:58,950 --> 01:59:58,960
a big
 

6797
01:59:58,960 --> 02:00:01,510
a big
box

6798
02:00:01,510 --> 02:00:01,520

 

6799
02:00:01,520 --> 02:00:04,310

menacing box with a new legged robot

6800
02:00:04,310 --> 02:00:04,320
menacing box with a new legged robot
 

6801
02:00:04,320 --> 02:00:05,750
menacing box with a new legged robot
so um

6802
02:00:05,750 --> 02:00:05,760
so um
 

6803
02:00:05,760 --> 02:00:07,430
so um
the hilarity of you saying that is

6804
02:00:07,430 --> 02:00:07,440
the hilarity of you saying that is
 

6805
02:00:07,440 --> 02:00:09,350
the hilarity of you saying that is
because that that that robot

6806
02:00:09,350 --> 02:00:09,360
because that that that robot
 

6807
02:00:09,360 --> 02:00:11,430
because that that that robot
is actually going to likely be the main

6808
02:00:11,430 --> 02:00:11,440
is actually going to likely be the main
 

6809
02:00:11,440 --> 02:00:14,149
is actually going to likely be the main
robot that i show to the to the world

6810
02:00:14,149 --> 02:00:14,159
robot that i show to the to the world
 

6811
02:00:14,159 --> 02:00:16,310
robot that i show to the to the world
in the coming months because that has

6812
02:00:16,310 --> 02:00:16,320
in the coming months because that has
 

6813
02:00:16,320 --> 02:00:17,430
in the coming months because that has
the

6814
02:00:17,430 --> 02:00:17,440
the
 

6815
02:00:17,440 --> 02:00:19,430
the
that's the highest compute level in that

6816
02:00:19,430 --> 02:00:19,440
that's the highest compute level in that
 

6817
02:00:19,440 --> 02:00:21,669
that's the highest compute level in that
robot so i've been playing a lot with

6818
02:00:21,669 --> 02:00:21,679
robot so i've been playing a lot with
 

6819
02:00:21,679 --> 02:00:24,310
robot so i've been playing a lot with
legged robots the um

6820
02:00:24,310 --> 02:00:24,320
legged robots the um
 

6821
02:00:24,320 --> 02:00:26,950
legged robots the um
four legs so like a like a dog

6822
02:00:26,950 --> 02:00:26,960
four legs so like a like a dog
 

6823
02:00:26,960 --> 02:00:28,470
four legs so like a like a dog
um

6824
02:00:28,470 --> 02:00:28,480
um
 

6825
02:00:28,480 --> 02:00:30,390
um
i like all of robots

6826
02:00:30,390 --> 02:00:30,400
i like all of robots
 

6827
02:00:30,400 --> 02:00:32,550
i like all of robots
but there's something about when a robot

6828
02:00:32,550 --> 02:00:32,560
but there's something about when a robot
 

6829
02:00:32,560 --> 02:00:35,750
but there's something about when a robot
has legs it's able to communicate

6830
02:00:35,750 --> 02:00:35,760
has legs it's able to communicate
 

6831
02:00:35,760 --> 02:00:37,350
has legs it's able to communicate
it's able to connect with humans in some

6832
02:00:37,350 --> 02:00:37,360
it's able to connect with humans in some
 

6833
02:00:37,360 --> 02:00:39,830
it's able to connect with humans in some
kind of deep way in the way a dog can

6834
02:00:39,830 --> 02:00:39,840
kind of deep way in the way a dog can
 

6835
02:00:39,840 --> 02:00:41,830
kind of deep way in the way a dog can
just show affection something about like

6836
02:00:41,830 --> 02:00:41,840
just show affection something about like
 

6837
02:00:41,840 --> 02:00:43,589
just show affection something about like
step step step step

6838
02:00:43,589 --> 02:00:43,599
step step step step
 

6839
02:00:43,599 --> 02:00:45,589
step step step step
and then and then the robot realizes

6840
02:00:45,589 --> 02:00:45,599
and then and then the robot realizes
 

6841
02:00:45,599 --> 02:00:47,750
and then and then the robot realizes
you're here and then it steps and then

6842
02:00:47,750 --> 02:00:47,760
you're here and then it steps and then
 

6843
02:00:47,760 --> 02:00:49,990
you're here and then it steps and then
notices you and the way the dog does and

6844
02:00:49,990 --> 02:00:50,000
notices you and the way the dog does and
 

6845
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:52,149
notices you and the way the dog does and
raises its head

6846
02:00:52,149 --> 02:00:52,159
raises its head
 

6847
02:00:52,159 --> 02:00:55,350
raises its head
um it makes me feel

6848
02:00:55,350 --> 02:00:55,360
um it makes me feel
 

6849
02:00:55,360 --> 02:00:57,589
um it makes me feel
noticed and hurt in the same way i do

6850
02:00:57,589 --> 02:00:57,599
noticed and hurt in the same way i do
 

6851
02:00:57,599 --> 02:01:00,390
noticed and hurt in the same way i do
when a dog notices me that excitement

6852
02:01:00,390 --> 02:01:00,400
when a dog notices me that excitement
 

6853
02:01:00,400 --> 02:01:03,510
when a dog notices me that excitement
that stupid excitement of like yes

6854
02:01:03,510 --> 02:01:03,520
that stupid excitement of like yes
 

6855
02:01:03,520 --> 02:01:06,870
that stupid excitement of like yes
uh fellow living organism and

6856
02:01:06,870 --> 02:01:06,880
uh fellow living organism and
 

6857
02:01:06,880 --> 02:01:09,430
uh fellow living organism and
what excites me about legged robots is

6858
02:01:09,430 --> 02:01:09,440
what excites me about legged robots is
 

6859
02:01:09,440 --> 02:01:10,709
what excites me about legged robots is
that

6860
02:01:10,709 --> 02:01:10,719
that
 

6861
02:01:10,719 --> 02:01:13,109
that
holy [\h__\h] is possible to engineer this

6862
02:01:13,109 --> 02:01:13,119
holy [\h__\h] is possible to engineer this
 

6863
02:01:13,119 --> 02:01:15,510
holy [\h__\h] is possible to engineer this
it's possible to create that feeling and

6864
02:01:15,510 --> 02:01:15,520
it's possible to create that feeling and
 

6865
02:01:15,520 --> 02:01:17,510
it's possible to create that feeling and
i wonder where that can go there's a lot

6866
02:01:17,510 --> 02:01:17,520
i wonder where that can go there's a lot
 

6867
02:01:17,520 --> 02:01:20,149
i wonder where that can go there's a lot
of negative possible trajectories

6868
02:01:20,149 --> 02:01:20,159
of negative possible trajectories
 

6869
02:01:20,159 --> 02:01:22,310
of negative possible trajectories
but i have a sense that there's positive

6870
02:01:22,310 --> 02:01:22,320
but i have a sense that there's positive
 

6871
02:01:22,320 --> 02:01:24,390
but i have a sense that there's positive
ones too you you have more love they'll

6872
02:01:24,390 --> 02:01:24,400
ones too you you have more love they'll
 

6873
02:01:24,400 --> 02:01:27,350
ones too you you have more love they'll
take us with them

6874
02:01:27,350 --> 02:01:27,360

 

6875
02:01:27,360 --> 02:01:30,709

yeah i think so because i i so

6876
02:01:30,709 --> 02:01:30,719
yeah i think so because i i so
 

6877
02:01:30,719 --> 02:01:32,870
yeah i think so because i i so
there's this fear of robots

6878
02:01:32,870 --> 02:01:32,880
there's this fear of robots
 

6879
02:01:32,880 --> 02:01:34,870
there's this fear of robots
that they become super intelligent and

6880
02:01:34,870 --> 02:01:34,880
that they become super intelligent and
 

6881
02:01:34,880 --> 02:01:37,510
that they become super intelligent and
run away from us humans and basically

6882
02:01:37,510 --> 02:01:37,520
run away from us humans and basically
 

6883
02:01:37,520 --> 02:01:39,750
run away from us humans and basically
become so intelligent and then they

6884
02:01:39,750 --> 02:01:39,760
become so intelligent and then they
 

6885
02:01:39,760 --> 02:01:40,790
become so intelligent and then they
almost

6886
02:01:40,790 --> 02:01:40,800
almost
 

6887
02:01:40,800 --> 02:01:44,550
almost
just not giving a damn will destroy us

6888
02:01:44,550 --> 02:01:44,560
just not giving a damn will destroy us
 

6889
02:01:44,560 --> 02:01:47,109
just not giving a damn will destroy us
but i think in order for for robots to

6890
02:01:47,109 --> 02:01:47,119
but i think in order for for robots to
 

6891
02:01:47,119 --> 02:01:48,470
but i think in order for for robots to
become intelligence they have to

6892
02:01:48,470 --> 02:01:48,480
become intelligence they have to
 

6893
02:01:48,480 --> 02:01:51,270
become intelligence they have to
integrate themselves with society

6894
02:01:51,270 --> 02:01:51,280
integrate themselves with society
 

6895
02:01:51,280 --> 02:01:52,550
integrate themselves with society
so

6896
02:01:52,550 --> 02:01:52,560
so
 

6897
02:01:52,560 --> 02:01:55,510
so
they they by the very nature of of how

6898
02:01:55,510 --> 02:01:55,520
they they by the very nature of of how
 

6899
02:01:55,520 --> 02:01:57,750
they they by the very nature of of how
they become intelligent have to bring us

6900
02:01:57,750 --> 02:01:57,760
they become intelligent have to bring us
 

6901
02:01:57,760 --> 02:01:58,790
they become intelligent have to bring us
along

6902
02:01:58,790 --> 02:01:58,800
along
 

6903
02:01:58,800 --> 02:02:00,470
along
so

6904
02:02:00,470 --> 02:02:00,480
so
 

6905
02:02:00,480 --> 02:02:01,750
so
it's not that there will be this

6906
02:02:01,750 --> 02:02:01,760
it's not that there will be this
 

6907
02:02:01,760 --> 02:02:03,669
it's not that there will be this
separate thing they have to

6908
02:02:03,669 --> 02:02:03,679
separate thing they have to
 

6909
02:02:03,679 --> 02:02:05,910
separate thing they have to
like we'll have robots in the home

6910
02:02:05,910 --> 02:02:05,920
like we'll have robots in the home
 

6911
02:02:05,920 --> 02:02:08,070
like we'll have robots in the home
they'll be interacting with us you have

6912
02:02:08,070 --> 02:02:08,080
they'll be interacting with us you have
 

6913
02:02:08,080 --> 02:02:10,070
they'll be interacting with us you have
human kids and you have a bunch of

6914
02:02:10,070 --> 02:02:10,080
human kids and you have a bunch of
 

6915
02:02:10,080 --> 02:02:11,830
human kids and you have a bunch of
robots you have robot friends you have

6916
02:02:11,830 --> 02:02:11,840
robots you have robot friends you have
 

6917
02:02:11,840 --> 02:02:14,149
robots you have robot friends you have
human friends and they the robots make

6918
02:02:14,149 --> 02:02:14,159
human friends and they the robots make
 

6919
02:02:14,159 --> 02:02:16,470
human friends and they the robots make
your human-to-human relationships much

6920
02:02:16,470 --> 02:02:16,480
your human-to-human relationships much
 

6921
02:02:16,480 --> 02:02:18,390
your human-to-human relationships much
more meaningful and richer they bring

6922
02:02:18,390 --> 02:02:18,400
more meaningful and richer they bring
 

6923
02:02:18,400 --> 02:02:19,990
more meaningful and richer they bring
more love to the world but they it's

6924
02:02:19,990 --> 02:02:20,000
more love to the world but they it's
 

6925
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:22,470
more love to the world but they it's
integrated it's not like they'll

6926
02:02:22,470 --> 02:02:22,480
integrated it's not like they'll
 

6927
02:02:22,480 --> 02:02:24,950
integrated it's not like they'll
be developing smarter and smarter

6928
02:02:24,950 --> 02:02:24,960
be developing smarter and smarter
 

6929
02:02:24,960 --> 02:02:26,229
be developing smarter and smarter
um

6930
02:02:26,229 --> 02:02:26,239
um
 

6931
02:02:26,239 --> 02:02:28,149
um
as like um

6932
02:02:28,149 --> 02:02:28,159
as like um
 

6933
02:02:28,159 --> 02:02:30,550
as like um
sentient beings by themselves i think

6934
02:02:30,550 --> 02:02:30,560
sentient beings by themselves i think
 

6935
02:02:30,560 --> 02:02:32,790
sentient beings by themselves i think
that's very difficult to do you have to

6936
02:02:32,790 --> 02:02:32,800
that's very difficult to do you have to
 

6937
02:02:32,800 --> 02:02:34,470
that's very difficult to do you have to
be doing that together with humans and

6938
02:02:34,470 --> 02:02:34,480
be doing that together with humans and
 

6939
02:02:34,480 --> 02:02:35,990
be doing that together with humans and
so we'll come for the ride there's

6940
02:02:35,990 --> 02:02:36,000
so we'll come for the ride there's
 

6941
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:37,589
so we'll come for the ride there's
technical things

6942
02:02:37,589 --> 02:02:37,599
technical things
 

6943
02:02:37,599 --> 02:02:40,790
technical things
like we might merge like cyborgs

6944
02:02:40,790 --> 02:02:40,800
like we might merge like cyborgs
 

6945
02:02:40,800 --> 02:02:42,310
like we might merge like cyborgs
more and more well we already saw our

6946
02:02:42,310 --> 02:02:42,320
more and more well we already saw our
 

6947
02:02:42,320 --> 02:02:44,870
more and more well we already saw our
cyborgs right with the phones and so on

6948
02:02:44,870 --> 02:02:44,880
cyborgs right with the phones and so on
 

6949
02:02:44,880 --> 02:02:47,109
cyborgs right with the phones and so on
but more and more so with elon and

6950
02:02:47,109 --> 02:02:47,119
but more and more so with elon and
 

6951
02:02:47,119 --> 02:02:48,390
but more and more so with elon and
neuralink

6952
02:02:48,390 --> 02:02:48,400
neuralink
 

6953
02:02:48,400 --> 02:02:50,149
neuralink
deeper integration of

6954
02:02:50,149 --> 02:02:50,159
deeper integration of
 

6955
02:02:50,159 --> 02:02:52,390
deeper integration of
robots and ai into

6956
02:02:52,390 --> 02:02:52,400
robots and ai into
 

6957
02:02:52,400 --> 02:02:53,750
robots and ai into
like

6958
02:02:53,750 --> 02:02:53,760
like
 

6959
02:02:53,760 --> 02:02:55,750
like
increasing the bandwidth at which they

6960
02:02:55,750 --> 02:02:55,760
increasing the bandwidth at which they
 

6961
02:02:55,760 --> 02:02:57,350
increasing the bandwidth at which they
can communicate right so if we do

6962
02:02:57,350 --> 02:02:57,360
can communicate right so if we do
 

6963
02:02:57,360 --> 02:03:00,709
can communicate right so if we do
implants in the brain

6964
02:03:00,709 --> 02:03:00,719
implants in the brain
 

6965
02:03:00,719 --> 02:03:02,709
implants in the brain
i think

6966
02:03:02,709 --> 02:03:02,719
i think
 

6967
02:03:02,719 --> 02:03:04,470
i think
again a lot of people are really nervous

6968
02:03:04,470 --> 02:03:04,480
again a lot of people are really nervous
 

6969
02:03:04,480 --> 02:03:05,910
again a lot of people are really nervous
about this

6970
02:03:05,910 --> 02:03:05,920
about this
 

6971
02:03:05,920 --> 02:03:07,589
about this
as am i but i think there's a lot of

6972
02:03:07,589 --> 02:03:07,599
as am i but i think there's a lot of
 

6973
02:03:07,599 --> 02:03:10,149
as am i but i think there's a lot of
trajectories that are positive there

6974
02:03:10,149 --> 02:03:10,159
trajectories that are positive there
 

6975
02:03:10,159 --> 02:03:12,470
trajectories that are positive there
and that to me is excited and also i

6976
02:03:12,470 --> 02:03:12,480
and that to me is excited and also i
 

6977
02:03:12,480 --> 02:03:13,990
and that to me is excited and also i
just don't think it's possible to stop

6978
02:03:13,990 --> 02:03:14,000
just don't think it's possible to stop
 

6979
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:17,589
just don't think it's possible to stop
this development so we should uh steer

6980
02:03:17,589 --> 02:03:17,599
this development so we should uh steer
 

6981
02:03:17,599 --> 02:03:18,950
this development so we should uh steer
it yeah

6982
02:03:18,950 --> 02:03:18,960
it yeah
 

6983
02:03:18,960 --> 02:03:19,830
it yeah
yeah

6984
02:03:19,830 --> 02:03:19,840
yeah
 

6985
02:03:19,840 --> 02:03:21,990
yeah
oh good did you i mean you must have

6986
02:03:21,990 --> 02:03:22,000
oh good did you i mean you must have
 

6987
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:23,750
oh good did you i mean you must have
watched the movie terminator right yeah

6988
02:03:23,750 --> 02:03:23,760
watched the movie terminator right yeah
 

6989
02:03:23,760 --> 02:03:25,910
watched the movie terminator right yeah
of course i love turbinator yeah

6990
02:03:25,910 --> 02:03:25,920
of course i love turbinator yeah
 

6991
02:03:25,920 --> 02:03:27,589
of course i love turbinator yeah
much worse than my favorite movie of all

6992
02:03:27,589 --> 02:03:27,599
much worse than my favorite movie of all
 

6993
02:03:27,599 --> 02:03:28,550
much worse than my favorite movie of all
time

6994
02:03:28,550 --> 02:03:28,560
time
 

6995
02:03:28,560 --> 02:03:29,430
time
yeah

6996
02:03:29,430 --> 02:03:29,440
yeah
 

6997
02:03:29,440 --> 02:03:31,589
yeah
yeah i mean that's that's the big fear

6998
02:03:31,589 --> 02:03:31,599
yeah i mean that's that's the big fear
 

6999
02:03:31,599 --> 02:03:35,109
yeah i mean that's that's the big fear
right

7000
02:03:35,109 --> 02:03:35,119

 

7001
02:03:35,119 --> 02:03:36,310

yeah what's the conclusion with

7002
02:03:36,310 --> 02:03:36,320
yeah what's the conclusion with
 

7003
02:03:36,320 --> 02:03:38,229
yeah what's the conclusion with
terminator isn't ultimately humanity

7004
02:03:38,229 --> 02:03:38,239
terminator isn't ultimately humanity
 

7005
02:03:38,239 --> 02:03:39,109
terminator isn't ultimately humanity
wins

7006
02:03:39,109 --> 02:03:39,119
wins
 

7007
02:03:39,119 --> 02:03:41,109
wins
i think they're at like terminator 8 now

7008
02:03:41,109 --> 02:03:41,119
i think they're at like terminator 8 now
 

7009
02:03:41,119 --> 02:03:43,109
i think they're at like terminator 8 now
yeah you know i don't know

7010
02:03:43,109 --> 02:03:43,119
yeah you know i don't know
 

7011
02:03:43,119 --> 02:03:44,550
yeah you know i don't know
uh

7012
02:03:44,550 --> 02:03:44,560

yeah the
 

7015
02:03:46,239 --> 02:03:48,229
yeah the
so there and it's interesting actually i

7016

so there and it's interesting actually i
 

7017
02:03:48,239 --> 02:03:49,350
so there and it's interesting actually i
was going to bring this up as you were

7018
02:03:49,350 --> 02:03:49,360
was going to bring this up as you were
 

7019
02:03:49,360 --> 02:03:50,870
was going to bring this up as you were
talking about it but

7020
02:03:50,870 --> 02:03:50,880
talking about it but
 

7021
02:03:50,880 --> 02:03:51,669
talking about it but
uh

7022
02:03:51,669 --> 02:03:51,679
uh
 

7023
02:03:51,679 --> 02:03:53,990
uh
but china and the united states actually

7024
02:03:53,990 --> 02:03:54,000
but china and the united states actually
 

7025
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:56,629
but china and the united states actually
don't know where canada is on this but

7026
02:03:56,629 --> 02:03:56,639
don't know where canada is on this but
 

7027
02:03:56,639 --> 02:03:59,109
don't know where canada is on this but
they both have agreed

7028
02:03:59,109 --> 02:03:59,119
they both have agreed
 

7029
02:03:59,119 --> 02:04:00,790
they both have agreed
that they're not going to put limits on

7030
02:04:00,790 --> 02:04:00,800
that they're not going to put limits on
 

7031
02:04:00,800 --> 02:04:02,950
that they're not going to put limits on
autonomous weapon

7032
02:04:02,950 --> 02:04:02,960
autonomous weapon
 

7033
02:04:02,960 --> 02:04:05,189
autonomous weapon
uh system development so not going to

7034
02:04:05,189 --> 02:04:05,199
uh system development so not going to
 

7035
02:04:05,199 --> 02:04:07,350
uh system development so not going to
they're not going to so because china

7036
02:04:07,350 --> 02:04:07,360
they're not going to so because china
 

7037
02:04:07,360 --> 02:04:09,030
they're not going to so because china
said we're not going to now us

7038
02:04:09,030 --> 02:04:09,040
said we're not going to now us
 

7039
02:04:09,040 --> 02:04:11,189
said we're not going to now us
officially announced that

7040
02:04:11,189 --> 02:04:11,199
officially announced that
 

7041
02:04:11,199 --> 02:04:14,149
officially announced that
we're not we can't well you can't it's

7042
02:04:14,149 --> 02:04:14,159
we're not we can't well you can't it's
 

7043
02:04:14,159 --> 02:04:15,750
we're not we can't well you can't it's
like it's

7044
02:04:15,750 --> 02:04:15,760
like it's
 

7045
02:04:15,760 --> 02:04:17,430
like it's
you never could right as soon as it

7046
02:04:17,430 --> 02:04:17,440
you never could right as soon as it
 

7047
02:04:17,440 --> 02:04:19,430
you never could right as soon as it
exists and it's better

7048
02:04:19,430 --> 02:04:19,440
exists and it's better
 

7049
02:04:19,440 --> 02:04:22,950
exists and it's better
people will use it well but you um

7050
02:04:22,950 --> 02:04:22,960
people will use it well but you um
 

7051
02:04:22,960 --> 02:04:26,470
people will use it well but you um
there's been a global ban on bio weapons

7052
02:04:26,470 --> 02:04:26,480
there's been a global ban on bio weapons
 

7053
02:04:26,480 --> 02:04:28,470
there's been a global ban on bio weapons
so you were able to come to an agreement

7054
02:04:28,470 --> 02:04:28,480
so you were able to come to an agreement
 

7055
02:04:28,480 --> 02:04:29,750
so you were able to come to an agreement
there that we're not going to use

7056
02:04:29,750 --> 02:04:29,760
there that we're not going to use
 

7057
02:04:29,760 --> 02:04:32,229
there that we're not going to use
biological weapons in war

7058
02:04:32,229 --> 02:04:32,239
biological weapons in war
 

7059
02:04:32,239 --> 02:04:33,990
biological weapons in war
so it was it's a lot of people are

7060
02:04:33,990 --> 02:04:34,000
so it was it's a lot of people are
 

7061
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:36,950
so it was it's a lot of people are
really upset that in the case of

7062
02:04:36,950 --> 02:04:36,960
really upset that in the case of
 

7063
02:04:36,960 --> 02:04:39,430
really upset that in the case of
ai driven weapons

7064
02:04:39,430 --> 02:04:39,440
ai driven weapons
 

7065
02:04:39,440 --> 02:04:42,149
ai driven weapons
the world said nope that's okay

7066
02:04:42,149 --> 02:04:42,159
the world said nope that's okay
 

7067
02:04:42,159 --> 02:04:44,310
the world said nope that's okay
and so now you have this

7068
02:04:44,310 --> 02:04:44,320
and so now you have this
 

7069
02:04:44,320 --> 02:04:45,910
and so now you have this
potential for

7070
02:04:45,910 --> 02:04:45,920
potential for
 

7071
02:04:45,920 --> 02:04:47,990
potential for
greater and greater automation in drones

7072
02:04:47,990 --> 02:04:48,000
greater and greater automation in drones
 

7073
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:49,830
greater and greater automation in drones
for example in picking uh bombing

7074
02:04:49,830 --> 02:04:49,840
for example in picking uh bombing
 

7075
02:04:49,840 --> 02:04:51,270
for example in picking uh bombing
locations

7076
02:04:51,270 --> 02:04:51,280
locations
 

7077
02:04:51,280 --> 02:04:52,390
locations
and

7078
02:04:52,390 --> 02:04:52,400
and
 

7079
02:04:52,400 --> 02:04:55,189
and
so the area at which they attack and so

7080
02:04:55,189 --> 02:04:55,199
so the area at which they attack and so
 

7081
02:04:55,199 --> 02:04:56,069
so the area at which they attack and so
you get

7082
02:04:56,069 --> 02:04:56,079
you get
 

7083
02:04:56,079 --> 02:04:57,430
you get
some of that stuff that you mentioned

7084
02:04:57,430 --> 02:04:57,440
some of that stuff that you mentioned
 

7085
02:04:57,440 --> 02:04:58,310
some of that stuff that you mentioned
that

7086
02:04:58,310 --> 02:04:58,320
that
 

7087
02:04:58,320 --> 02:05:00,229
that
that drew you

7088
02:05:00,229 --> 02:05:00,239
that drew you
 

7089
02:05:00,239 --> 02:05:02,390
that drew you
to the military

7090
02:05:02,390 --> 02:05:02,400
to the military
 

7091
02:05:02,400 --> 02:05:04,790
to the military
is that teamwork between humans that

7092
02:05:04,790 --> 02:05:04,800
is that teamwork between humans that
 

7093
02:05:04,800 --> 02:05:07,669
is that teamwork between humans that
decision making so their strategy but

7094
02:05:07,669 --> 02:05:07,679
decision making so their strategy but
 

7095
02:05:07,679 --> 02:05:10,149
decision making so their strategy but
built into that team

7096
02:05:10,149 --> 02:05:10,159
built into that team
 

7097
02:05:10,159 --> 02:05:11,109
built into that team
is a

7098
02:05:11,109 --> 02:05:11,119
is a
 

7099
02:05:11,119 --> 02:05:12,629
is a
deep humanity

7100
02:05:12,629 --> 02:05:12,639
deep humanity
 

7101
02:05:12,639 --> 02:05:13,669
deep humanity
like

7102
02:05:13,669 --> 02:05:13,679
like
 

7103
02:05:13,679 --> 02:05:16,390
like
yeah even when there's an enemy there's

7104
02:05:16,390 --> 02:05:16,400
yeah even when there's an enemy there's
 

7105
02:05:16,400 --> 02:05:17,510
yeah even when there's an enemy there's
lines

7106
02:05:17,510 --> 02:05:17,520
lines
 

7107
02:05:17,520 --> 02:05:19,990
lines
that you are aware of of what is ethical

7108
02:05:19,990 --> 02:05:20,000
that you are aware of of what is ethical
 

7109
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:22,950
that you are aware of of what is ethical
what is not what is just and what is not

7111
02:05:22,960 --> 02:05:26,629
what is not what is just and what is not
and it's so easy for a machine

7112
02:05:26,629 --> 02:05:26,639
and it's so easy for a machine
 

7113
02:05:26,639 --> 02:05:28,790
and it's so easy for a machine
uh to uh

7114
02:05:28,790 --> 02:05:28,800
uh to uh
 

7115
02:05:28,800 --> 02:05:31,189
uh to uh
to miss all of that plow through it and

7116
02:05:31,189 --> 02:05:31,199
to miss all of that plow through it and
 

7117
02:05:31,199 --> 02:05:31,990
to miss all of that plow through it and
do

7118
02:05:31,990 --> 02:05:32,000
do
 

7119
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:34,149
do
deeply inhumane acts commit atrocities

7120
02:05:34,149 --> 02:05:34,159
deeply inhumane acts commit atrocities
 

7121
02:05:34,159 --> 02:05:36,870
deeply inhumane acts commit atrocities
that that's something that

7122
02:05:36,870 --> 02:05:36,880
that that's something that
 

7123
02:05:36,880 --> 02:05:41,109
that that's something that
worries a lot of people yeah

7124
02:05:41,109 --> 02:05:41,119

 

7125
02:05:41,119 --> 02:05:43,910

because uh yeah an ai based war is just

7126
02:05:43,910 --> 02:05:43,920
because uh yeah an ai based war is just
 

7127
02:05:43,920 --> 02:05:46,390
because uh yeah an ai based war is just
is it it's terrifying especially with

7128
02:05:46,390 --> 02:05:46,400
is it it's terrifying especially with
 

7129
02:05:46,400 --> 02:05:48,470
is it it's terrifying especially with
cyber security which is becoming more

7130
02:05:48,470 --> 02:05:48,480
cyber security which is becoming more
 

7131
02:05:48,480 --> 02:05:50,870
cyber security which is becoming more
and more of an issue which is hacking

7132
02:05:50,870 --> 02:05:50,880
and more of an issue which is hacking
 

7133
02:05:50,880 --> 02:05:51,830
and more of an issue which is hacking
yeah

7134
02:05:51,830 --> 02:05:51,840
yeah
 

7135
02:05:51,840 --> 02:05:53,830
yeah
sort of uh

7136
02:05:53,830 --> 02:05:53,840
sort of uh
 

7137
02:05:53,840 --> 02:05:57,510
sort of uh
people that look a lot like me

7138
02:05:57,510 --> 02:05:57,520
people that look a lot like me
 

7139
02:05:57,520 --> 02:05:59,830
people that look a lot like me
being the warriors of the future yeah

7140
02:05:59,830 --> 02:05:59,840
being the warriors of the future yeah
 

7141
02:05:59,840 --> 02:06:02,550
being the warriors of the future yeah
which is meaning people behind a

7142
02:06:02,550 --> 02:06:02,560
which is meaning people behind a
 

7143
02:06:02,560 --> 02:06:05,430
which is meaning people behind a
a keyboard versus uh right

7144
02:06:05,430 --> 02:06:05,440
a keyboard versus uh right
 

7145
02:06:05,440 --> 02:06:08,229
a keyboard versus uh right
versus the traditional warriors

7146
02:06:08,229 --> 02:06:08,239
versus the traditional warriors
 

7147
02:06:08,239 --> 02:06:11,030
versus the traditional warriors
probably inevitable

7148
02:06:11,030 --> 02:06:11,040
probably inevitable
 

7149
02:06:11,040 --> 02:06:11,910
probably inevitable
yeah

7150
02:06:11,910 --> 02:06:11,920
yeah
 

7151
02:06:11,920 --> 02:06:15,589
yeah
and terrifying it is it is but i think

7152
02:06:15,589 --> 02:06:15,599
and terrifying it is it is but i think
 

7153
02:06:15,599 --> 02:06:18,149
and terrifying it is it is but i think
if you believe that it's possible it's

7154
02:06:18,149 --> 02:06:18,159
if you believe that it's possible it's
 

7155
02:06:18,159 --> 02:06:20,310
if you believe that it's possible it's
certainly going to happen like at some

7156
02:06:20,310 --> 02:06:20,320
certainly going to happen like at some
 

7157
02:06:20,320 --> 02:06:21,990
certainly going to happen like at some
point it's just when

7158
02:06:21,990 --> 02:06:22,000
point it's just when
 

7159
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:24,870
point it's just when
right when does it happen anyway so that

7160
02:06:24,870 --> 02:06:24,880
right when does it happen anyway so that
 

7161
02:06:24,880 --> 02:06:27,189
right when does it happen anyway so that
i mean to me i'm optimally

7162
02:06:27,189 --> 02:06:27,199
i mean to me i'm optimally
 

7163
02:06:27,199 --> 02:06:28,950
i mean to me i'm optimally
ultimately optimistic about the future

7164
02:06:28,950 --> 02:06:28,960
ultimately optimistic about the future
 

7165
02:06:28,960 --> 02:06:30,629
ultimately optimistic about the future
and to me i'm excited about the world

7166
02:06:30,629 --> 02:06:30,639
and to me i'm excited about the world
 

7167
02:06:30,639 --> 02:06:33,990
and to me i'm excited about the world
with ai i'm even excited about uh

7168
02:06:33,990 --> 02:06:34,000
with ai i'm even excited about uh
 

7169
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:35,510
with ai i'm even excited about uh
the metaverse and all these kinds of

7170
02:06:35,510 --> 02:06:35,520
the metaverse and all these kinds of
 

7171
02:06:35,520 --> 02:06:36,470
the metaverse and all these kinds of
things

7172
02:06:36,470 --> 02:06:36,480
things
 

7173
02:06:36,480 --> 02:06:38,069
things
living more and more in the digital

7174
02:06:38,069 --> 02:06:38,079
living more and more in the digital
 

7175
02:06:38,079 --> 02:06:40,870
living more and more in the digital
space in the virtual reality

7176
02:06:40,870 --> 02:06:40,880
space in the virtual reality
 

7177
02:06:40,880 --> 02:06:41,830
space in the virtual reality
i think

7178
02:06:41,830 --> 02:06:41,840
i think
 

7179
02:06:41,840 --> 02:06:43,350
i think
so it's a part of me that grew up in the

7180
02:06:43,350 --> 02:06:43,360
so it's a part of me that grew up in the
 

7181
02:06:43,360 --> 02:06:46,310
so it's a part of me that grew up in the
non-internet world non-computer world

7182
02:06:46,310 --> 02:06:46,320
non-internet world non-computer world
 

7183
02:06:46,320 --> 02:06:47,990
non-internet world non-computer world
you know it says all kids these days

7184
02:06:47,990 --> 02:06:48,000
you know it says all kids these days
 

7185
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:49,830
you know it says all kids these days
with their video games you know there's

7186
02:06:49,830 --> 02:06:49,840
with their video games you know there's
 

7187
02:06:49,840 --> 02:06:51,589
with their video games you know there's
part of me that's like that

7188
02:06:51,589 --> 02:06:51,599
part of me that's like that
 

7189
02:06:51,599 --> 02:06:53,589
part of me that's like that
um but

7190
02:06:53,589 --> 02:06:53,599
um but
 

7191
02:06:53,599 --> 02:06:55,189
um but
i think what's it

7192
02:06:55,189 --> 02:06:55,199
i think what's it
 

7193
02:06:55,199 --> 02:06:57,189
i think what's it
when technology at his best can bring

7194
02:06:57,189 --> 02:06:57,199
when technology at his best can bring
 

7195
02:06:57,199 --> 02:06:58,390
when technology at his best can bring
out the best

7196
02:06:58,390 --> 02:06:58,400
out the best
 

7197
02:06:58,400 --> 02:06:59,750
out the best
of humanity

7198
02:06:59,750 --> 02:06:59,760
of humanity
 

7199
02:06:59,760 --> 02:07:01,910
of humanity
and so i think virtual reality

7200
02:07:01,910 --> 02:07:01,920
and so i think virtual reality
 

7201
02:07:01,920 --> 02:07:04,229
and so i think virtual reality
all of these things over time will

7202
02:07:04,229 --> 02:07:04,239
all of these things over time will
 

7203
02:07:04,239 --> 02:07:05,830
all of these things over time will
figure out how to

7204
02:07:05,830 --> 02:07:05,840
figure out how to
 

7205
02:07:05,840 --> 02:07:08,310
figure out how to
how to fix it to bring out the humanity

7206
02:07:08,310 --> 02:07:08,320
how to fix it to bring out the humanity
 

7207
02:07:08,320 --> 02:07:10,709
how to fix it to bring out the humanity
social networks the the first generation

7208
02:07:10,709 --> 02:07:10,719
social networks the the first generation
 

7209
02:07:10,719 --> 02:07:13,030
social networks the the first generation
social networks now facebook twitter and

7210
02:07:13,030 --> 02:07:13,040
social networks now facebook twitter and
 

7211
02:07:13,040 --> 02:07:14,950
social networks now facebook twitter and
so on they have so many problems they're

7212
02:07:14,950 --> 02:07:14,960
so on they have so many problems they're
 

7213
02:07:14,960 --> 02:07:17,030
so on they have so many problems they're
bringing out the worst in people

7214
02:07:17,030 --> 02:07:17,040
bringing out the worst in people
 

7215
02:07:17,040 --> 02:07:18,629
bringing out the worst in people
but i think we're learning from that and

7216
02:07:18,629 --> 02:07:18,639
but i think we're learning from that and
 

7217
02:07:18,639 --> 02:07:20,069
but i think we're learning from that and
i think the next generation of social

7218
02:07:20,069 --> 02:07:20,079
i think the next generation of social
 

7219
02:07:20,079 --> 02:07:21,430
i think the next generation of social
networks will be better and better and

7220
02:07:21,430 --> 02:07:21,440
networks will be better and better and
 

7221
02:07:21,440 --> 02:07:22,310
networks will be better and better and
better

7222
02:07:22,310 --> 02:07:22,320
better
 

7223
02:07:22,320 --> 02:07:24,149
better
and

7224
02:07:24,149 --> 02:07:24,159
and
 

7225
02:07:24,159 --> 02:07:27,990
and
so i'm optimistic but of course you know

7226
02:07:27,990 --> 02:07:28,000
so i'm optimistic but of course you know
 

7227
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:30,310
so i'm optimistic but of course you know
one reason we may have not seen aliens

7228
02:07:30,310 --> 02:07:30,320
one reason we may have not seen aliens
 

7229
02:07:30,320 --> 02:07:33,030
one reason we may have not seen aliens
yet obviously like in a way that's

7230
02:07:33,030 --> 02:07:33,040
yet obviously like in a way that's
 

7231
02:07:33,040 --> 02:07:34,069
yet obviously like in a way that's
obvious

7232
02:07:34,069 --> 02:07:34,079
obvious
 

7233
02:07:34,079 --> 02:07:36,870
obvious
is because once you get clever and smart

7234
02:07:36,870 --> 02:07:36,880
is because once you get clever and smart
 

7235
02:07:36,880 --> 02:07:38,470
is because once you get clever and smart
and have all this cool technology you

7236
02:07:38,470 --> 02:07:38,480
and have all this cool technology you
 

7237
02:07:38,480 --> 02:07:41,430
and have all this cool technology you
destroy yourself and we sure as humans

7238
02:07:41,430 --> 02:07:41,440
destroy yourself and we sure as humans
 

7239
02:07:41,440 --> 02:07:42,950
destroy yourself and we sure as humans
are pretty close to that

7240
02:07:42,950 --> 02:07:42,960
are pretty close to that
 

7241
02:07:42,960 --> 02:07:45,270
are pretty close to that
yeah yeah there might be that limit that

7242
02:07:45,270 --> 02:07:45,280
yeah yeah there might be that limit that
 

7243
02:07:45,280 --> 02:07:47,669
yeah yeah there might be that limit that
is hard to get right i'm hoping we get

7244
02:07:47,669 --> 02:07:47,679
is hard to get right i'm hoping we get
 

7245
02:07:47,679 --> 02:07:49,750
is hard to get right i'm hoping we get
all our aggression between nations out

7246
02:07:49,750 --> 02:07:49,760
all our aggression between nations out
 

7247
02:07:49,760 --> 02:07:51,589
all our aggression between nations out
through arm wrestling

7248
02:07:51,589 --> 02:07:51,599
through arm wrestling
 

7249
02:07:51,599 --> 02:07:55,510
through arm wrestling
competition right

7250
02:07:55,510 --> 02:07:55,520

 

7251
02:07:55,520 --> 02:07:57,189

wouldn't that be great if that was if it

7252
02:07:57,189 --> 02:07:57,199
wouldn't that be great if that was if it
 

7253
02:07:57,199 --> 02:07:58,629
wouldn't that be great if that was if it
was that simple

7254
02:07:58,629 --> 02:07:58,639
