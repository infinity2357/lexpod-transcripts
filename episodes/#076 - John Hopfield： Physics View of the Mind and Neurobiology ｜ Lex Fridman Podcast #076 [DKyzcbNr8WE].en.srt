00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:23,280
it into a useful feature rather than a
glitch and so you expect in neurobiology

152

suppressed in artificial neural networks
 

163
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,569

so the glitches become features in them

the evolutionary process looks a little

332
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:33,040
the evolutionary process looks a little
 

333
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,850
the evolutionary process looks a little
different yeah oh similar timescale

334
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:35,860
different yeah oh similar timescale
 

335
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:39,120
different yeah oh similar timescale
perhaps well or shorter in times to kill

336
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:39,130
perhaps well or shorter in times to kill

companies close yeah go bankrupt and are

338
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:41,830
companies close yeah go bankrupt and are
 

339
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:45,210
companies close yeah go bankrupt and are
born yeah shorter but not much shorter

340
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:45,220

some some company lasts the century a

342
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:48,130
some some company lasts the century a
 

343
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:51,390
some some company lasts the century a
couple but yeah you're right I mean if

344
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:51,400
couple but yeah you're right I mean if
 

345
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,950
couple but yeah you're right I mean if
you think of companies a single organism

346
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:52,960
you think of companies a single organism
 

347

IBM's history they didn't insist that
 

367
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:27,780
IBM's history they didn't insist that
you build it out of IBM components but

368
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:27,790
you build it out of IBM components but
 

369
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:29,310
you build it out of IBM components but
they understood that they could get into

00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:08,389
as you've described there's there some
other little quirk that you particularly

other little quirk that you particularly
 

393
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:14,629
other little quirk that you particularly
like adaptation is everything when you

like adaptation is everything when you
 

395
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:18,290
like adaptation is everything when you
get down to it but the difference there

396
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:18,300
get down to it but the difference there
 

397
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:21,889
get down to it but the difference there
are differences between adaptation where

so and biology does makes some things

462
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:12,720
so and biology does makes some things
 

463
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,590
so and biology does makes some things
easy that are very difficult to

the other hand you can't do simple

468
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:20,040
the other hand you can't do simple
 

469
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,829
the other hand you can't do simple
floating-point arithmetic because though

470
00:11:21,829 --> 00:11:21,839
floating-point arithmetic because though
 

471
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:23,540
floating-point arithmetic because though
it's awfully stupid yeah

472
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:23,550
it's awfully stupid yeah
 

473
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:25,069
it's awfully stupid yeah
and you're saying this kind of three

474
00:11:25,069 --> 00:11:25,079
and you're saying this kind of three
 

475
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:28,730
and you're saying this kind of three
dimensional complicated structure makes

476
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:28,740
dimensional complicated structure makes
 

477
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:32,480
dimensional complicated structure makes
it's still math it still doing math the

478
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:32,490
it's still math it still doing math the
 

479
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:34,430
it's still math it still doing math the
kind of math is doing enables you to

480
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:34,440
kind of math is doing enables you to
 

481
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:37,569
kind of math is doing enables you to
solve problems of a very different kind

482
00:11:37,569 --> 00:11:37,579
solve problems of a very different kind
 

483
00:11:37,579 --> 00:11:39,790
solve problems of a very different kind
that's right that's right

484
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:39,800
that's right that's right
 

485
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:43,370
that's right that's right
so you mentioned two kinds of adaptation

486
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:43,380
so you mentioned two kinds of adaptation
 

487
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:46,009
so you mentioned two kinds of adaptation
the evolutionary adaptation at the end

I know I can unlaid this and do it a
 

689
00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:02,889
I know I can unlaid this and do it a
part of it but but I have an exponential

690
00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:02,899
part of it but but I have an exponential

that way so feedback is essential so we

696
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:10,220
that way so feedback is essential so we
 

697
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:14,279
that way so feedback is essential so we

going to have to be before you say I've

808
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:10,540
going to have to be before you say I've
 

809
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:13,950
going to have to be before you say I've
made something I've made a human I don't

810
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:13,960
made something I've made a human I don't
 

811
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,680
made something I've made a human I don't
know but your sense is it might be a

00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:16,690
know but your sense is it might be a
 

813
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:19,200

00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:25,270
yeah and going back to my brain waves of
 

817
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:29,940
yeah and going back to my brain waves of
the word yes

from the AI point of view if they would
 

821
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:35,610
from the AI point of view if they would
say ah maybe these are heavy phenomena

822
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:35,620

00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:10,210
miles an hour you just capture that and
 

841
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:11,549
miles an hour you just capture that and
you wouldn't worry about where it came

neurobiology what is the time scale

1124
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:40,190
neurobiology what is the time scale

neurobiology what is the time scale
there's a dynamical system in which you

1126
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:43,369
there's a dynamical system in which you
 

1127
00:28:43,369 --> 00:28:46,629
there's a dynamical system in which you
have a fairly fast timescale in which

1128

1131
00:28:48,619 --> 00:28:50,769
you goes eight the synopsis don't change
much during this computation so I'll

1132
00:28:50,769 --> 00:28:50,779
much during this computation so I'll
 

1133
00:28:50,779 --> 00:28:53,349
much during this computation so I'll
think of the synapses fixed and just do

think of the synapses fixed and just do
 

1135
00:28:53,359 --> 00:28:56,560
think of the synapses fixed and just do
the dynamics of the activity or you can

1136
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:56,570
the dynamics of the activity or you can
 

1137
00:28:56,570 --> 00:29:00,339
the dynamics of the activity or you can
say the synapses are changing fast

1138
00:29:00,339 --> 00:29:00,349
say the synapses are changing fast
 

1139

and Sadowski to understand how to do

1438
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:25,710
and Sadowski to understand how to do
 

1439
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:29,180
and Sadowski to understand how to do
learning in that and it's still a useful

1440
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:29,190
learning in that and it's still a useful
 

1441
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:30,920
learning in that and it's still a useful
way to understand learning and

1442
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:30,930
way to understand learning and
 

1443
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:34,039
way to understand learning and
understand and the learning that you

1444
00:36:34,039 --> 00:36:34,049
understand and the learning that you
 

1445
00:36:34,049 --> 00:36:35,779
understand and the learning that you
understand and that has something to do

1446
00:36:35,779 --> 00:36:35,789
understand and that has something to do
 

1447
00:36:35,789 --> 00:36:37,819
understand and that has something to do
with the way that feed-forward systems

1448
00:36:37,819 --> 00:36:37,829
with the way that feed-forward systems
 

1449
00:36:37,829 --> 00:36:41,569
with the way that feed-forward systems
work but it's not always exactly simple

1450
00:36:41,569 --> 00:36:41,579
work but it's not always exactly simple
 

1451
00:36:41,579 --> 00:36:47,269
work but it's not always exactly simple
to express that intuition but it always

1452
00:36:47,269 --> 00:36:47,279
to express that intuition but it always
 

1453
00:36:47,279 --> 00:36:49,910
to express that intuition but it always
amuses me as he Hinton going back to the

1505
00:38:13,769 --> 00:38:17,920
brain I don't think the brain is as deep
as the deepest networks go the deepest

1506
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:17,930
as the deepest networks go the deepest

00:38:17,930 --> 00:38:22,430
as the deepest networks go the deepest
computer science networks and I do

1508
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:22,440
computer science networks and I do
 

1509
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:24,049
computer science networks and I do
wonder where they're part of that depth

1510
00:38:24,049 --> 00:38:24,059
wonder where they're part of that depth
 

1511
00:38:24,059 --> 00:38:26,509
wonder where they're part of that depth
of the computer science networks is

1512
00:38:26,509 --> 00:38:26,519
of the computer science networks is
 

1513
00:38:26,519 --> 00:38:29,329
of the computer science networks is
necessitated by the fact that the only

1514
00:38:29,329 --> 00:38:29,339
necessitated by the fact that the only

learning is easily done on a machine is

1516
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:33,640
learning is easily done on a machine is
 

1517
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:36,900
learning is easily done on a machine is
his feed-forward and so there's the

1518
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:36,910
his feed-forward and so there's the
 

1519
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:39,720
his feed-forward and so there's the
question of to what extent as the

1520
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:39,730
question of to what extent as the
 

1521
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:42,930
question of to what extent as the
biology which has some feed-forward some

1522
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:42,940
biology which has some feed-forward some

feedback been captured by something

1524
00:38:47,099 --> 00:38:47,109
feedback been captured by something
 

1525
00:38:47,109 --> 00:38:51,750
feedback been captured by something
which is it got many more neurons but

1526
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:51,760
which is it got many more neurons but
 

1527
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,720
which is it got many more neurons but
much more depth to the neurons

1528
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:53,730
much more depth to the neurons
 

1529
00:38:53,730 --> 00:38:58,769
much more depth to the neurons
you know so party you wonders if the

1530
00:38:58,769 --> 00:38:58,779
you know so party you wonders if the
 

1531
00:38:58,779 --> 00:39:01,049
you know so party you wonders if the
feedback is actually more essential than

1532
00:39:01,049 --> 00:39:01,059
feedback is actually more essential than
 

1533
00:39:01,059 --> 00:39:03,779
feedback is actually more essential than
the number of neurons or the depth the

1534
00:39:03,779 --> 00:39:03,789
the number of neurons or the depth the
 

1535
00:39:03,789 --> 00:39:06,720
the number of neurons or the depth the
the dynamics of the feedback doesn't

1536
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:06,730
the dynamics of the feedback doesn't
 

1537
00:39:06,730 --> 00:39:09,240
the dynamics of the feedback doesn't
ever have the feedback look if you don't

1538
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:09,250
ever have the feedback look if you don't
 

1539
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:11,940
ever have the feedback look if you don't
have if you don't have feedback it's a

1540
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:11,950
have if you don't have feedback it's a
 

1541
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:13,319
have if you don't have feedback it's a
little bit like a building a big

1542
00:39:13,319 --> 00:39:13,329
little bit like a building a big
 

1543
00:39:13,329 --> 00:39:15,870
little bit like a building a big
computer and having running up through

1544
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:15,880
computer and having running up through
 

1545
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:18,690
computer and having running up through
one clock cycle and then you can't do

1546
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:18,700
one clock cycle and then you can't do
 

1547
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:22,140
one clock cycle and then you can't do
anything do you put you reload something

1548
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:22,150
anything do you put you reload something
 

1549
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:25,950
anything do you put you reload something
coming in how do you use the fact that

1550
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:25,960
coming in how do you use the fact that
 

1551
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:28,470
coming in how do you use the fact that
there are multiple clocks like how do I

00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:28,480
there are multiple clocks like how do I
 

1553
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,880
there are multiple clocks like how do I
use the fact that you can close your

1557
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:34,589
eyes stop listening to me and think
about a chessboard for two minutes

1558
00:39:34,589 --> 00:39:34,599
about a chessboard for two minutes
 

1559

feedback kind of mechanism you're going
 

1565
00:39:46,329 --> 00:39:50,670
feedback kind of mechanism you're going
back to something yes it's hard it's

that a little own consciousness yes
 

1573
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,549
that a little own consciousness yes
because that's tied up in there too you

because that's tied up in there too you
 

1575
00:40:02,559 --> 00:40:05,990
because that's tied up in there too you
can't just put that on another shelf

1576
00:40:05,990 --> 00:40:06,000
can't just put that on another shelf
 

1577
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,609
can't just put that on another shelf
every once in a while like I interested

00:40:08,609 --> 00:40:08,619
every once in a while like I interested
 

1579
00:40:08,619 --> 00:40:11,400
every once in a while like I interested
in consciousness and then I go and I've

then so much of what we do for our

there's some traumatic event you witness
 

1669
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:37,320
there's some traumatic event you witness
you will have a few facts about it

you will have a few facts about it

00:42:37,330 --> 00:42:40,349
you will have a few facts about it
correctly done if somebody asks you

correctly done if somebody asks you
 

1673
00:42:40,359 --> 00:42:42,690
correctly done if somebody asks you
about it you will weave a narrative

1674
00:42:42,690 --> 00:42:42,700
about it you will weave a narrative
 

1675
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:45,150
about it you will weave a narrative
which is actually much more rich in

1676
00:42:45,150 --> 00:42:45,160
which is actually much more rich in
 

1677
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:48,180
which is actually much more rich in
detail than that based on some anchor

and so John Dean was involved in the
 

1707
00:43:28,099 --> 00:43:31,689
and so John Dean was involved in the
cover-up and John Dean ultimately

importance of consciousness in our whole
big mess of cognition is it just a

big mess of cognition is it just a
 

1753
00:44:42,859 --> 00:44:46,929
big mess of cognition is it just a
little narrative maker or is it actually

00:44:46,929 --> 00:44:46,939
little narrative maker or is it actually
 

1755
00:44:46,939 --> 00:44:51,669

that's a very hard one but I asked

1758
00:44:56,620 --> 00:44:56,630
that's a very hard one but I asked
 

1759
00:44:56,630 --> 00:45:00,699
that's a very hard one but I asked
Francis Crick about consciousness he

1760
00:45:00,699 --> 00:45:00,709
Francis Crick about consciousness he
 

1761
00:45:00,709 --> 00:45:03,489
Francis Crick about consciousness he
launched forward a long monologue about

1762
00:45:03,489 --> 00:45:03,499
launched forward a long monologue about
 

1763
00:45:03,499 --> 00:45:04,749
launched forward a long monologue about

yeah and how Mendel knew that there was

1766
00:45:07,959 --> 00:45:07,969
yeah and how Mendel knew that there was
 

1767
00:45:07,969 --> 00:45:10,569
yeah and how Mendel knew that there was
something and how biologists understood

1768
00:45:10,569 --> 00:45:10,579
something and how biologists understood
 

1769
00:45:10,579 --> 00:45:12,599
something and how biologists understood
there was something in inherit

1770
00:45:12,599 --> 00:45:12,609
there was something in inherit
 

1771
00:45:12,609 --> 00:45:16,349
there was something in inherit
which was just very very different and

1772
00:45:16,349 --> 00:45:16,359
which was just very very different and
 

1773
00:45:16,359 --> 00:45:19,349
which was just very very different and
he is the effect that inherited traits

00:45:19,349 --> 00:45:19,359
he is the effect that inherited traits
 

1775
00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:22,589
he is the effect that inherited traits
didn't just wash out into a grey but

didn't just wash out into a grey but
 

1777
00:45:22,599 --> 00:45:28,079
didn't just wash out into a grey but
it's this or this and propagated that

it's this or this and propagated that
 

1779
00:45:28,089 --> 00:45:29,849
it's this or this and propagated that
that was absolutely fundamentals of

shortly after Mendel thinking biologists
 

1793
00:45:47,289 --> 00:45:48,750
shortly after Mendel thinking biologists
did realize that there was a deep

the same nominal species in fact the

the same nominal species in fact the
whole notion of what as the species gets

01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:29,010
whole notion of what as the species gets
 

2705
01:09:29,010 --> 01:09:32,720
whole notion of what as the species gets
a little bit fuzzy and do species exists

up with with the biology which the whole
thing is living but whether there's

01:09:55,700 --> 01:09:55,710
becomes a little bit vague in my mind so
 

2721
01:09:55,710 --> 01:09:58,250
becomes a little bit vague in my mind so
in a sense the idea of meaning is

01:09:58,250 --> 01:09:58,260
in a sense the idea of meaning is
 

2723
01:09:58,260 --> 01:09:59,780
in a sense the idea of meaning is
something that's possessed by an

something that's possessed by an
 

2725
01:09:59,790 --> 01:10:03,200
something that's possessed by an
individual like a conscious creature and

individual like a conscious creature and
 

2727
01:10:03,210 --> 01:10:06,380
individual like a conscious creature and
you're saying that it's all

2728
01:10:06,380 --> 01:10:06,390
you're saying that it's all
 

2729
01:10:06,390 --> 01:10:08,240
you're saying that it's all
interconnected in some kind of way that

01:10:08,250 --> 01:10:10,430
interconnected in some kind of way that
there might not even be an individual

01:10:10,430 --> 01:10:10,440
there might not even be an individual
 

2733
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:13,940
there might not even be an individual
we're all kind of this complicated mess

2734
01:10:13,940 --> 01:10:13,950
we're all kind of this complicated mess
 

2735
01:10:13,950 --> 01:10:15,740
we're all kind of this complicated mess
of biological systems at all different

of biological systems at all different

01:10:18,980 --> 01:10:18,990
levels where the human starts and when
 

2739
01:10:18,990 --> 01:10:21,980
levels where the human starts and when
the human ends is unclear you know yeah

2740
01:10:21,980 --> 01:10:21,990
the human ends is unclear you know yeah
 

2741
01:10:21,990 --> 01:10:25,280
the human ends is unclear you know yeah
and we're the neurobiology where the oh

2742
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:25,290
and we're the neurobiology where the oh
 

2743
01:10:25,290 --> 01:10:27,470
and we're the neurobiology where the oh
you say that the your cortex does the

2744
01:10:27,470 --> 01:10:27,480
you say that the your cortex does the
 

2745
01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:29,030
you say that the your cortex does the
thinking but there's lots of things that

2746
01:10:29,030 --> 01:10:29,040
thinking but there's lots of things that
 

2747
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:32,060
thinking but there's lots of things that
are done in the spinal cord and so we

2748
01:10:32,060 --> 01:10:32,070
are done in the spinal cord and so we
 

2749
01:10:32,070 --> 01:10:35,960
are done in the spinal cord and so we
say where's the essence of thought it's

2750
01:10:35,960 --> 01:10:35,970
say where's the essence of thought it's
 

2751
01:10:35,970 --> 01:10:37,640
say where's the essence of thought it's
