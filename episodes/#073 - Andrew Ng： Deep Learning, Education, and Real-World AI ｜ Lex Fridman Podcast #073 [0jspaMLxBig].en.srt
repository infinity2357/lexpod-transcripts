165
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:23,159
computer to then play these cool of
video games another moment for me was

166
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:23,169
video games another moment for me was
 

167
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:26,250

when I was a teenager and my father

168
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:26,260
when I was a teenager and my father
 

169
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,539
when I was a teenager and my father
because his doctor was reading about

170
00:03:28,539 --> 00:03:28,549
because his doctor was reading about
 

171
00:03:28,549 --> 00:03:31,180
because his doctor was reading about
expert systems and about neural networks

172
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:31,190
expert systems and about neural networks
 

173
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:32,500
expert systems and about neural networks
so he got me read some of these books

174
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:32,510
so he got me read some of these books
 

175
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:35,020
so he got me read some of these books
and I thought was really cool you could

176
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:35,030
and I thought was really cool you could
 

177
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:37,479
and I thought was really cool you could
write a computer that started to exhibit

178
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:37,489
write a computer that started to exhibit
 

179
00:03:37,489 --> 00:03:40,900
write a computer that started to exhibit
intelligence then I remember doing an

180
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:40,910
intelligence then I remember doing an
 

181
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:43,569
intelligence then I remember doing an
internship was in high school this isn't

so the teenager me remote thinking boy

192
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:56,150
so the teenager me remote thinking boy
 

193
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:58,240
so the teenager me remote thinking boy
this is a lot of photocopying if only we

194
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:58,250
this is a lot of photocopying if only we
 

195
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:59,650
this is a lot of photocopying if only we
could write software build a robot

196
00:03:59,650 --> 00:03:59,660
could write software build a robot
 

197
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:01,689
could write software build a robot
something to automate this maybe I could

198
00:04:01,689 --> 00:04:01,699
something to automate this maybe I could
 

199
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:03,909
something to automate this maybe I could
do something else so I think a lot of my

200
00:04:03,909 --> 00:04:03,919
do something else so I think a lot of my
 

201
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:06,369
do something else so I think a lot of my
work since then has centered on the

202
00:04:06,369 --> 00:04:06,379
work since then has centered on the
 

203
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:08,319
work since then has centered on the
theme of automation even the way I think

204
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:08,329
theme of automation even the way I think
 

205
00:04:08,329 --> 00:04:10,449
theme of automation even the way I think
about machine learning today were very

206
00:04:10,449 --> 00:04:10,459
about machine learning today were very
 

207
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:12,129
about machine learning today were very
good at writing learning algorithms they

208
00:04:12,129 --> 00:04:12,139
good at writing learning algorithms they
 

209
00:04:12,139 --> 00:04:14,289
good at writing learning algorithms they
can automate things that people can do

210
00:04:14,289 --> 00:04:14,299
can automate things that people can do
 

211
00:04:14,299 --> 00:04:16,899
can automate things that people can do
or even launching the first MOOCs

led to Coursera I was trying to also
 

217
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:23,740
led to Coursera I was trying to also
meet what could be automatable in how I

00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:30,280
of times we were watching the first
 

271
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,040

signed up we just started to write the
 

277
00:05:35,949 --> 00:05:38,610
signed up we just started to write the
code and we had not yet actually filmed

doesn't show that it was recorded that

314
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:19,690
doesn't show that it was recorded that
 

315
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:21,899
doesn't show that it was recorded that
late at night but it was really

316
00:06:21,899 --> 00:06:21,909
late at night but it was really
 

317
00:06:21,909 --> 00:06:24,480
late at night but it was really
inspiring the the thought that we could

318
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:24,490
inspiring the the thought that we could
 

319
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:26,610
inspiring the the thought that we could
create content to help so many people

320
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:26,620
create content to help so many people
 

321
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,200
create content to help so many people

my first foray into this type of
education was when we were filming my

00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:38,790
education was when we were filming my
Stanford class and sticking the videos

490
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:38,800
Stanford class and sticking the videos
 

491
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,260
Stanford class and sticking the videos
on YouTube and then some other things

492
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:40,270
on YouTube and then some other things
 

493
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:42,300
on YouTube and then some other things
with uploading the holes and so on but

494
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:42,310
with uploading the holes and so on but
 

495
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:44,700
with uploading the holes and so on but
you know basically the one hour fifteen

496
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:44,710
you know basically the one hour fifteen
 

497
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:47,370
you know basically the one hour fifteen
minute video that we put on YouTube and

minute video that we put on YouTube and
 

499
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:49,769
minute video that we put on YouTube and
then we had four or five other versions

500
00:09:49,769 --> 00:09:49,779
then we had four or five other versions
 

501
00:09:49,779 --> 00:09:52,710
then we had four or five other versions
of websites that had built most of what

allowed me to iterate allow my team and
 

509
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:00,060
allowed me to iterate allow my team and
me to innovate to learn what the ideas

00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:04,660
one of the features I was really excited
 

515
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:06,870
one of the features I was really excited
about and really proud of was build this

516
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:06,880
about and really proud of was build this

521
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:13,320
logged into the website at the same time
so today if you go to a website you know

522
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:13,330
so today if you go to a website you know
 

523
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:15,600
so today if you go to a website you know
if you're logged in and then I want to

if you're logged in and then I want to
log in you need to log out it was the

log in you need to log out it was the
 

527
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,140

00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:23,350
and me were watching a video together in
 

533
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:25,320
and me were watching a video together in
front of the computer what if a website

534
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:25,330
front of the computer what if a website
 

535
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:27,210
front of the computer what if a website
could have you type your name and

536
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:27,220
could have you type your name and
 

537
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:28,380
could have you type your name and
password hit me type in their password

password hit me type in their password
and then now the computer knows both of

540
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:30,430
and then now the computer knows both of
 

541
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:32,130
and then now the computer knows both of
us are watching together and it gives

542
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:32,140
us are watching together and it gives
 

543
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:34,110
us are watching together and it gives
both of us credit for anything we do as

544
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:34,120
both of us credit for anything we do as

many that allows us to hone in to the
 

569
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:05,579
many that allows us to hone in to the

set of features and it sounds like a
 

571
00:11:05,589 --> 00:11:07,920
set of features and it sounds like a
brilliant feature so I guess the lesson

572
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:07,930
brilliant feature so I guess the lesson
 

573
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:10,950
brilliant feature so I guess the lesson
to take from that is you

engineer has some understanding of the
clouds no oh you know but maybe this is

640
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:22,570
clouds no oh you know but maybe this is
 

641
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:24,300
clouds no oh you know but maybe this is
my microcontroller developer doesn't

642
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:24,310
my microcontroller developer doesn't
 

643
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:26,310
my microcontroller developer doesn't
need to do the cloud but I feel like the

644
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:26,320
need to do the cloud but I feel like the
 

645
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,440
need to do the cloud but I feel like the
vast majority of software in Jesus today

646
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:28,450
vast majority of software in Jesus today
 

647
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:31,110
vast majority of software in Jesus today
are sort of having appreciated the cloud

648
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:31,120
are sort of having appreciated the cloud
 

649
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,390
are sort of having appreciated the cloud
I think in the future maybe we'll

650
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:33,400
I think in the future maybe we'll
 

651
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,280
I think in the future maybe we'll
approach nearly a hundred percent of all

652
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:35,290
approach nearly a hundred percent of all
 

653
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:38,010
approach nearly a hundred percent of all
developers being you know in some way an

654
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:38,020
developers being you know in some way an
 

655
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,660
developers being you know in some way an
AI developer or at least having an

656
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:39,670
AI developer or at least having an
 

657
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:42,240
AI developer or at least having an
appreciation of machine learning and my

658
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:42,250
appreciation of machine learning and my
 

659
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:44,940
appreciation of machine learning and my
hope is that there's this kind of effect

660
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:44,950
hope is that there's this kind of effect
 

661
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:46,710
hope is that there's this kind of effect
that there's people who are not really

662
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:46,720
that there's people who are not really
 

663
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,960
that there's people who are not really
interested in soft being a programmer or

664
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:48,970
interested in soft being a programmer or
 

665
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:51,150
interested in soft being a programmer or
being into software engineering like

666
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:51,160
being into software engineering like
 

667
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:54,720
being into software engineering like
biologists chemists and physicists even

668
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:54,730
biologists chemists and physicists even
 

669
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:56,160
biologists chemists and physicists even
mechanical engineers and all these

670
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:56,170
mechanical engineers and all these
 

671
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:59,010
mechanical engineers and all these
disciplines that are now more and more

672
00:12:59,010 --> 00:12:59,020
disciplines that are now more and more
 

673
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:02,730
disciplines that are now more and more
sitting on large data sets and here they

674
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:02,740
sitting on large data sets and here they
 

675
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,750
sitting on large data sets and here they
didn't think they're interested in

676
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:03,760
didn't think they're interested in
 

677
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,370
didn't think they're interested in
programming until they have this data

678
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:05,380
programming until they have this data
 

679
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:06,840
programming until they have this data
set and they realized there's the set of

680
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:06,850
set and they realized there's the set of
 

681
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:08,340
set and they realized there's the set of
machine learning tools that allow you to

682
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:08,350
machine learning tools that allow you to
 

683
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:10,410
machine learning tools that allow you to
use the data set so they actually become

684
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:10,420
use the data set so they actually become
 

685
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:12,750
use the data set so they actually become
they learn to program and they become

686
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:12,760
they learn to program and they become
 

687
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:15,210
they learn to program and they become
new programmer so like the not just

688
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:15,220
new programmer so like the not just
 

689
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:16,620
new programmer so like the not just
because you've mentioned a larger

690
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:16,630
because you've mentioned a larger
 

691
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:18,750
because you've mentioned a larger
percentage of developers become machine

692
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:18,760
percentage of developers become machine
 

693
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:21,210
percentage of developers become machine
learning people the it seems like more

694
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:21,220
learning people the it seems like more
 

695
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:24,240
learning people the it seems like more
and more the the kinds of people who are

696
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:24,250
and more the the kinds of people who are
 

697
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:24,630
and more the the kinds of people who are
becoming

698
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:24,640
becoming
 

699
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,580
becoming
developers is also growing significantly

700
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:26,590
developers is also growing significantly
 

701
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:28,950
developers is also growing significantly
yeah yeah I think I think once upon a

702
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:28,960
yeah yeah I think I think once upon a
 

703
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,860
yeah yeah I think I think once upon a
time only a small part of humanity was

704
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:31,870
time only a small part of humanity was
 

705
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:33,900
time only a small part of humanity was
literate you could read and write and

706
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:33,910
literate you could read and write and
 

707
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:35,940
literate you could read and write and
and and maybe you thought maybe not

708
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:35,950
and and maybe you thought maybe not
 

709
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:37,350
and and maybe you thought maybe not
everyone needs to learn to read and

710
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:37,360
everyone needs to learn to read and
 

711
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,560
everyone needs to learn to read and
write you know you just go listen to a

712
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:40,570
write you know you just go listen to a
 

713
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:43,830
write you know you just go listen to a
few monks write me to you and maybe that

714
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:43,840
few monks write me to you and maybe that
 

715
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,000
few monks write me to you and maybe that
was enough or maybe we just need a few

716
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,010
was enough or maybe we just need a few
 

717
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:46,800
was enough or maybe we just need a few
handful of authors to write the

718
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:46,810
handful of authors to write the
 

719
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:48,720
handful of authors to write the
bestsellers and then no one else needs

720
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:48,730
bestsellers and then no one else needs
 

721
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:51,450
bestsellers and then no one else needs
to write but what we found was that by

722
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:51,460
to write but what we found was that by
 

723
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:53,880
to write but what we found was that by
giving as many people you know in some

724
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:53,890
giving as many people you know in some
 

725
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:55,590
giving as many people you know in some
countries almost everyone basically

726
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:55,600
countries almost everyone basically
 

727
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,200
countries almost everyone basically
literacy it dramatically enhanced human

728
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:58,210
literacy it dramatically enhanced human
 

729
00:13:58,210 --> 00:13:59,910
literacy it dramatically enhanced human
to human communications and we can now

730
00:13:59,910 --> 00:13:59,920
to human communications and we can now
 

731
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,800
to human communications and we can now
write for an audience of one such as if

732
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:01,810
write for an audience of one such as if
 

733
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:03,240
write for an audience of one such as if
I send you an email you send me an email

734
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:03,250
I send you an email you send me an email
 

735
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:06,780
I send you an email you send me an email
I think in computing we're still in that

736
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:06,790
I think in computing we're still in that
 

737
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:09,090
I think in computing we're still in that
phase where so few people know how the

738
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:09,100
phase where so few people know how the
 

739
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:11,820
phase where so few people know how the
codes that the code is mostly have to

740
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:11,830
codes that the code is mostly have to
 

741
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:14,580
codes that the code is mostly have to
code for relatively large audiences but

742
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:14,590
code for relatively large audiences but
 

743
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:18,830
code for relatively large audiences but
if everyone well most people became

744
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:18,840
if everyone well most people became
 

745
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,090
if everyone well most people became
developers at some level similar to how

746
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:21,100
developers at some level similar to how
 

747
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:23,040
developers at some level similar to how
most people and develop economies are

748
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:23,050
most people and develop economies are
 

749
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:25,320
most people and develop economies are
somewhat literate I would love to see

750
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:25,330
somewhat literate I would love to see
 

751
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:28,050
somewhat literate I would love to see
the owners of a mom-and-pop store be

752
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:28,060
the owners of a mom-and-pop store be
 

753
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:29,940
the owners of a mom-and-pop store be
with a very little code to customize the

754
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:29,950
with a very little code to customize the
 

755
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:32,100
with a very little code to customize the
TV display for their special this week

756
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:32,110
TV display for their special this week
 

757
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:34,380
TV display for their special this week
and I think of it enhance human to

758
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:34,390
and I think of it enhance human to
 

759
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:36,660
and I think of it enhance human to
computer communications which is

760
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:36,670
computer communications which is
 

761
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:38,310
computer communications which is
becoming more more important today as

762
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:38,320
becoming more more important today as
 

763
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,350
becoming more more important today as
well so you think you think it's

764
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:40,360
well so you think you think it's
 

765
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,200
well so you think you think it's
possible that machine learning becomes

766
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:42,210
possible that machine learning becomes
 

767
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:46,830
possible that machine learning becomes
kind of similar to literacy where we're

768
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:46,840
kind of similar to literacy where we're
 

769
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,780
kind of similar to literacy where we're
yeah like you said the owners of a

770
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:48,790
yeah like you said the owners of a
 

771
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:51,150
yeah like you said the owners of a
mom-and-pop shop is basically everybody

772
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:51,160
mom-and-pop shop is basically everybody
 

773
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,770
mom-and-pop shop is basically everybody
in all walks of life would have some

774
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:52,780
in all walks of life would have some
 

775
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:54,930
in all walks of life would have some
degree of programming capability

776
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:54,940
degree of programming capability
 

777
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:57,990
degree of programming capability
I could see society getting there um

778
00:14:57,990 --> 00:14:58,000
I could see society getting there um
 

779
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I could see society getting there um
there's one other interesting thing you

780
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,010
there's one other interesting thing you
 

781
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:02,490
there's one other interesting thing you
know if I go talk to the mom and pop

782
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:02,500
know if I go talk to the mom and pop
 

783
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,080
know if I go talk to the mom and pop
store if I toss a lot of people in their

784
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:04,090
store if I toss a lot of people in their
 

785
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:06,450
store if I toss a lot of people in their
daily professions I previously didn't

786
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:06,460
daily professions I previously didn't
 

787
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:07,860
daily professions I previously didn't
have a good story for why they should

788
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:07,870
have a good story for why they should
 

789
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:10,320
have a good story for why they should
learn to code yeah we give them some

790
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:10,330
learn to code yeah we give them some
 

791
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:12,360
learn to code yeah we give them some
reasons but what I found with the rise

792
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:12,370
reasons but what I found with the rise
 

793
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:14,040
reasons but what I found with the rise
of machine learning and data science is

794
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:14,050
of machine learning and data science is
 

795
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:16,140
of machine learning and data science is
that I think the number of people with a

796
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:16,150
that I think the number of people with a
 

797
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:18,720
that I think the number of people with a
concrete use for data science in their

798
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:18,730

809
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:30,690

your customers I think there's actually
 

813
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:35,070
your customers I think there's actually
real value there maybe even more than

00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,449
more and more these days I feel if they
were data scientists at some level they

were data scientists at some level they
 

829

so I think that data science and machine

00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,990
various versions of the helicopter and a
lot of things did not work for example

1002
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:28,000
lot of things did not work for example
 

1003
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,580

turns out one of the hardest problems we

1004
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:29,590
turns out one of the hardest problems we
 

1005
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:31,170
turns out one of the hardest problems we
had was when the helicopters flying

1006
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:31,180
had was when the helicopters flying
 

1007
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:33,600
had was when the helicopters flying
around upside down doing stunts how do

1008
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:33,610
around upside down doing stunts how do
 

1009
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:35,220
around upside down doing stunts how do
you figure out the position how do you

1010
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:35,230
you figure out the position how do you

upside down the GPS units facing down so
 

1019
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:45,420
upside down the GPS units facing down so
you can't see the satellites so we tried

saying you know Don it like what now
 

1053
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,890
saying you know Don it like what now
because because we tried so many things

1054
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:24,900
because because we tried so many things
 

1055
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:28,340
because because we tried so many things
in it and it just didn't work in the end

00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:31,290
what we did when Adam Cole's was was
 

1059
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:33,500
what we did when Adam Cole's was was
crucial to this was put cameras on the

crucial to this was put cameras on the
 

1061
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:35,630
crucial to this was put cameras on the
ground and used cameras on the ground to

00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:35,640
ground and used cameras on the ground to
 

1063
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,600
ground and used cameras on the ground to
localize a helicopter and that soft a

localize a helicopter and that soft a
 

1065
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:40,490
localize a helicopter and that soft a
localization problem so that we couldn't

when when was doing um this work at

1076
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:51,390
when when was doing um this work at
 

1077
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:53,300
when when was doing um this work at
Stanford around that time there was a

1078

Stanford around that time there was a
 

1079
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:54,980
Stanford around that time there was a
lot of reinforcement learning

1080
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:54,990
lot of reinforcement learning
 

1081
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:57,590
lot of reinforcement learning
theoretical papers but not a lot of

00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:57,600
theoretical papers but not a lot of
 

1083
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,010
theoretical papers but not a lot of
practical applications so the autonomous

1084
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:01,020
practical applications so the autonomous
 

1085
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:03,590

helicopter work for fine helicopters was
 

1087
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,810
helicopter work for fine helicopters was
this one of the few you know practical

1088
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:05,820
this one of the few you know practical
 

1089

this one of the few you know practical
applications of reinforcer learning at

the time which which caused it to become
 

1093
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:12,950
the time which which caused it to become
pretty well known I I feel like we might

1094
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:12,960
pretty well known I I feel like we might
 

1095
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,720
pretty well known I I feel like we might
have almost come full circle with today

1096
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:14,730
have almost come full circle with today
 

1097
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:16,550
have almost come full circle with today
there's so much but so much hype so much

1098
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:16,560
there's so much but so much hype so much
 

1099
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,260
there's so much but so much hype so much
excitement yeah about reinforcement

1100
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:18,270
excitement yeah about reinforcement
 

1101
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:20,120
excitement yeah about reinforcement
learning but again we're hunting for

1102
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:20,130
learning but again we're hunting for
 

1103
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:22,610
learning but again we're hunting for
more applications and all of these great

1104
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:22,620
more applications and all of these great
 

1105
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:25,190
more applications and all of these great
ideas that delica he's come up with what

1106

ideas that delica he's come up with what
 

1107
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,040
ideas that delica he's come up with what
was the drive sort of in the face of the

1108
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:28,050
was the drive sort of in the face of the
 

1109
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:29,270
was the drive sort of in the face of the
fact that most people doing theoretical

1110
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:29,280
fact that most people doing theoretical
 

1111
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,670
fact that most people doing theoretical
work what motivate you in the

1112
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:31,680
work what motivate you in the
 

1113
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,410
work what motivate you in the
uncertainty and the challenges to get

widespread acceptance what did you see

1202
00:23:24,049 --> 00:23:24,059
widespread acceptance what did you see
 

1203
00:23:24,059 --> 00:23:25,610
widespread acceptance what did you see
in this field that gave you confidence

1204
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:25,620
in this field that gave you confidence
 

1205
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:27,799
in this field that gave you confidence
what was your thinking process like in

1206
00:23:27,799 --> 00:23:27,809
what was your thinking process like in
 

1207
00:23:27,809 --> 00:23:29,960
what was your thinking process like in
that first decade of the I don't know

1208
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:29,970
that first decade of the I don't know
 

1209
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:34,399
that first decade of the I don't know
that's called 2000s the odds yeah I can

1210
00:23:34,399 --> 00:23:34,409
that's called 2000s the odds yeah I can
 

1211
00:23:34,409 --> 00:23:35,810
that's called 2000s the odds yeah I can
tell you the thing we got wrong with the

1212
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:35,820
tell you the thing we got wrong with the
 

1213
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:37,610
tell you the thing we got wrong with the
thing we got right the thing we really

1214
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:37,620
thing we got right the thing we really
 

1215
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:40,730
thing we got right the thing we really
got wrong was the importance of the

1216
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:40,740
got wrong was the importance of the
 

1217
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:42,440
got wrong was the importance of the
early importance of unsupervised

1218
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:42,450
early importance of unsupervised
 

1219
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:46,399
early importance of unsupervised
learning so early days of Google brain

1220
00:23:46,399 --> 00:23:46,409
learning so early days of Google brain
 

1221
00:23:46,409 --> 00:23:48,380
learning so early days of Google brain
we put a lot of effort into unsupervised

1222
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:48,390
we put a lot of effort into unsupervised
 

1223
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:49,430
we put a lot of effort into unsupervised
learning rather than supervised learning

1224
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:49,440
learning rather than supervised learning
 

1225
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,159
learning rather than supervised learning
and those as argument I think was around

1226
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:52,169
and those as argument I think was around
 

1227
00:23:52,169 --> 00:23:56,389

know the conference we had lunch was

1236
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:04,080
know the conference we had lunch was
 

1237
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,990
know the conference we had lunch was
chatting and Geoff pulled up this napkin

1238
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:06,000
chatting and Geoff pulled up this napkin
 

1239
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,760
chatting and Geoff pulled up this napkin
he started sketching this argument on

00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:07,770
he started sketching this argument on

00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:08,600
he started sketching this argument on
her on a napkin

human brain has about a hundred trillion

1246
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:14,010
human brain has about a hundred trillion
 

1247
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:16,190
human brain has about a hundred trillion
so there's 10 to the 14 synaptic

1248
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:16,200
so there's 10 to the 14 synaptic
 

1249
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:19,610
so there's 10 to the 14 synaptic
connections you will live about 10 10

1250
00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:19,620
connections you will live about 10 10
 

1251
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:22,159
connections you will live about 10 10
and 9 seconds that's 30 years you

1252
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:22,169
and 9 seconds that's 30 years you
 

1253
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:24,260
and 9 seconds that's 30 years you
actually live for two to two by ten to

1254
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:24,270
actually live for two to two by ten to
 

1255
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:25,190
actually live for two to two by ten to
nine maybe three right

1256
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:25,200
nine maybe three right
 

1257
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,840
nine maybe three right
nine seconds so just let's say ten to

1258
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:26,850
nine seconds so just let's say ten to
 

1259
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:30,740
nine seconds so just let's say ten to
nine so if each synaptic connection each

1260
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:30,750
nine so if each synaptic connection each
 

1261
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:32,930
nine so if each synaptic connection each

simple argument which is a lot of

1270
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:44,220
simple argument which is a lot of
 

1271
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:46,549
simple argument which is a lot of
problems it's very simplified that's 10

1272
00:24:46,549 --> 00:24:46,559
problems it's very simplified that's 10
 

1273
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:47,990
problems it's very simplified that's 10
to the 5 bits per second you need to

1274
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:48,000
to the 5 bits per second you need to
 

1275
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,779
to the 5 bits per second you need to
learn in your life and I have a

1276
00:24:50,779 --> 00:24:50,789
learn in your life and I have a
 

1277
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:53,960
learn in your life and I have a
one-year-old daughter I am NOT pointing

1278
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:53,970
one-year-old daughter I am NOT pointing
 

1279
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:57,470
one-year-old daughter I am NOT pointing
out 10 to 5 bits per second of labels to

1280
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:57,480
out 10 to 5 bits per second of labels to
 

1281
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:01,789
out 10 to 5 bits per second of labels to
her so and and I think I'm a very loving

1282
00:25:01,789 --> 00:25:01,799
her so and and I think I'm a very loving
 

1283
00:25:01,799 --> 00:25:04,180
her so and and I think I'm a very loving
parent but I'm just not gonna do that

1284
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:04,190
parent but I'm just not gonna do that
 

1285
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:06,759
parent but I'm just not gonna do that
so from this you know very crude

1286
00:25:06,759 --> 00:25:06,769
so from this you know very crude
 

1287
00:25:06,769 --> 00:25:09,049
so from this you know very crude
definitely problematic argument there's

1288
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:09,059
definitely problematic argument there's
 

1289
00:25:09,059 --> 00:25:11,299
definitely problematic argument there's
just no way that most of what we know is

1290
00:25:11,299 --> 00:25:11,309
just no way that most of what we know is
 

1291
00:25:11,309 --> 00:25:13,940
just no way that most of what we know is
through supervised learning the wife you

1292
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:13,950
through supervised learning the wife you
 

1293
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:15,560
through supervised learning the wife you
get so many visit information is from

1294
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:15,570
get so many visit information is from

1300
00:25:22,669 --> 00:25:22,679
arguments and a lot of known forces
 

1301
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:25,370
arguments and a lot of known forces
argument you go going to really convince

1302
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:25,380
argument you go going to really convince
 

1303
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:26,990
argument you go going to really convince
me that there's a lot of power to

1304
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:27,000
me that there's a lot of power to
 

1305
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,049
me that there's a lot of power to
unsupervised learning so that was the

1306
00:25:30,049 --> 00:25:30,059
unsupervised learning so that was the
 

1307
00:25:30,059 --> 00:25:31,940
unsupervised learning so that was the
part that we actually maybe maybe gone

1308
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:31,950
part that we actually maybe maybe gone
 

1309
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:33,919
part that we actually maybe maybe gone
wrong I still think I was learning is

00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:33,929
wrong I still think I was learning is
 

1311
00:25:33,929 --> 00:25:37,159
wrong I still think I was learning is
really important but we but but in the

00:25:37,159 --> 00:25:37,169
really important but we but but in the
 

1313
00:25:37,169 --> 00:25:39,019
really important but we but but in the
early days you know 10 15 years ago and

1314
00:25:39,019 --> 00:25:39,029
early days you know 10 15 years ago and
 

1315
00:25:39,029 --> 00:25:40,370
early days you know 10 15 years ago and
all of us thought that was the path

00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:40,380
all of us thought that was the path
 

1317
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:42,590
all of us thought that was the path
forward oh so you're saying that that

1318
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:42,600
forward oh so you're saying that that
 

1319
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,990
forward oh so you're saying that that
that perhaps was the wrong intuition for

the time for the time that that was the
 

1323
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:49,580
the time for the time that that was the
part we got wrong the part we got right

1324
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:49,590
part we got wrong the part we got right

00:25:59,060 --> 00:25:59,070
said worth of him he was in my group of
 

1331
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:00,860
said worth of him he was in my group of
Stanford at the time and Adam had run

1332
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:00,870
Stanford at the time and Adam had run
 

1333
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:02,750
Stanford at the time and Adam had run
these experiments at Stanford showing

1334
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:02,760
these experiments at Stanford showing
 

1335
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:05,539
these experiments at Stanford showing
that the bigger we train a learning

1336
00:26:05,539 --> 00:26:05,549
that the bigger we train a learning
 

1337
00:26:05,549 --> 00:26:08,509
that the bigger we train a learning
algorithm the better performance and it

1338
00:26:08,509 --> 00:26:08,519
algorithm the better performance and it
 

1339
00:26:08,519 --> 00:26:10,700
algorithm the better performance and it
was based on that it was a graph that

1340
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:10,710
was based on that it was a graph that
 

1341
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:13,370
was based on that it was a graph that
hadn't generated you know where the

right so bigger paint make this thing

1346
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:17,190
right so bigger paint make this thing
 

1347
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:19,009
right so bigger paint make this thing
the better his performance accuracy is

1348
00:26:19,009 --> 00:26:19,019
the better his performance accuracy is
 

1349
00:26:19,019 --> 00:26:21,049
the better his performance accuracy is
the vertical axis so it's really based

1350
00:26:21,049 --> 00:26:21,059
the vertical axis so it's really based
 

1351
00:26:21,059 --> 00:26:22,909
the vertical axis so it's really based
on that chart that Adam generated that

1352
00:26:22,909 --> 00:26:22,919
on that chart that Adam generated that
 

1353
00:26:22,919 --> 00:26:24,470
on that chart that Adam generated that
he gave me the conviction that you could

1354
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:24,480
he gave me the conviction that you could
 

1355
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,600
he gave me the conviction that you could
scale these models way bigger than what

1356
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:26,610
scale these models way bigger than what
 

1357
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:28,159
scale these models way bigger than what
we could on the few CPUs we should

1358
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:28,169
we could on the few CPUs we should
 

1359
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:30,200
we could on the few CPUs we should
understand that then we could get even

1360
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:30,210
understand that then we could get even
 

1361
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:32,299
understand that then we could get even
better results and it was really based

1362
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:32,309
better results and it was really based
 

1363
00:26:32,309 --> 00:26:34,669
better results and it was really based
on that one figure that Adam generated

1364
00:26:34,669 --> 00:26:34,679
on that one figure that Adam generated
 

1365
00:26:34,679 --> 00:26:37,639
on that one figure that Adam generated
that gave me the conviction to go of

1366
00:26:37,639 --> 00:26:37,649
that gave me the conviction to go of

00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:50,450
intuition was scale will bring
 

1379
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:52,820
intuition was scale will bring
performance for the system so we should

1380

performance for the system so we should
 

1381
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:53,389
performance for the system so we should

chase
larger and larger scale and I think

1384
00:26:55,909 --> 00:26:55,919
larger and larger scale and I think
 

1385
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:59,060
larger and larger scale and I think
people don't don't realize how how

00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:35,369
if I find it if you want to make a
 

1425
00:27:35,369 --> 00:27:38,299
if I find it if you want to make a
breakthrough you sometimes have to have

1426
00:27:38,299 --> 00:27:38,309
breakthrough you sometimes have to have
 

1427
00:27:38,309 --> 00:27:40,369
breakthrough you sometimes have to have
conviction and do something before it's

1428
00:27:40,369 --> 00:27:40,379
conviction and do something before it's
 

1429
00:27:40,379 --> 00:27:41,899
conviction and do something before it's
popular since that lets you have a

1430
00:27:41,899 --> 00:27:41,909
popular since that lets you have a
 

1431
00:27:41,909 --> 00:27:43,879
popular since that lets you have a
bigger impact let me ask you just a

1432
00:27:43,879 --> 00:27:43,889
bigger impact let me ask you just a
 

1433
00:27:43,889 --> 00:27:46,489
bigger impact let me ask you just a
small tangent on that topic I find

1434
00:27:46,489 --> 00:27:46,499
small tangent on that topic I find
 

1435
00:27:46,499 --> 00:27:49,419
small tangent on that topic I find
myself arguing with people saying that

1436
00:27:49,419 --> 00:27:49,429
myself arguing with people saying that
 

1437
00:27:49,429 --> 00:27:52,460
myself arguing with people saying that
greater scale especially in the context

1438
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:52,470
greater scale especially in the context
 

1439
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:54,379
greater scale especially in the context
of active learning so it's very

1440
00:27:54,379 --> 00:27:54,389
of active learning so it's very
 

1441
00:27:54,389 --> 00:27:57,049
of active learning so it's very
carefully selecting the data set but

1442
00:27:57,049 --> 00:27:57,059
carefully selecting the data set but
 

1443
00:27:57,059 --> 00:27:58,970
carefully selecting the data set but
growing the scale of the data set is

1444
00:27:58,970 --> 00:27:58,980
growing the scale of the data set is
 

1445
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:00,680
growing the scale of the data set is
going to lead to even further

1446
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:00,690
going to lead to even further
 

1447
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:02,600
going to lead to even further
breakthroughs in deep learning and

1448
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:02,610
breakthroughs in deep learning and
 

1449
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:05,480
breakthroughs in deep learning and
there's currently pushback at that idea

1450
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:05,490
there's currently pushback at that idea
 

1451
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:08,989
there's currently pushback at that idea
that larger datasets are no longer that

1452
00:28:08,989 --> 00:28:08,999
that larger datasets are no longer that
 

1453
00:28:08,999 --> 00:28:10,909
that larger datasets are no longer that
so you want to increase the efficiency

1454
00:28:10,909 --> 00:28:10,919

learning mechanisms and I personally

1458
00:28:15,049 --> 00:28:15,059
learning mechanisms and I personally
 

1459
00:28:15,059 --> 00:28:17,269
learning mechanisms and I personally
believe that bigger data sets will still

talked about is the scale of the data
 

1523
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:31,820
talked about is the scale of the data
set it was trained on and the quality of

1525
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:35,360

00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:46,549
plastic cards and show to one inspector
and the inspector sometimes very

1582
00:30:46,549 --> 00:30:46,559
and the inspector sometimes very
 

1583
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:48,260
and the inspector sometimes very
opinionated there go clearly that's the

1584
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:48,270
opinionated there go clearly that's the
 

1585
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:50,120
opinionated there go clearly that's the
defector scratch understand so gonna

1586
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:50,130
defector scratch understand so gonna
 

1587
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:52,220
defector scratch understand so gonna
check this part take the same parts of

1588
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:52,230
check this part take the same parts of
 

1589
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:54,290
check this part take the same parts of
different inspector different very

1590
00:30:54,290 --> 00:30:54,300
different inspector different very
 

1591
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:56,210
different inspector different very
opinionated clearly the scratch is small

1592
00:30:56,210 --> 00:30:56,220
opinionated clearly the scratch is small
 

1593
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:56,930
opinionated clearly the scratch is small
is fine

1594
00:30:56,930 --> 00:30:56,940
is fine
 

1595
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:58,220
is fine
don't throw it away you're gonna make us

1596
00:30:58,220 --> 00:30:58,230
don't throw it away you're gonna make us
 

1597
00:30:58,230 --> 00:31:00,530
don't throw it away you're gonna make us
yours and then sometimes you take the

1598
00:31:00,530 --> 00:31:00,540
yours and then sometimes you take the
 

1599
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:02,630
yours and then sometimes you take the
same plastic part show it to the same

1600
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:02,640
same plastic part show it to the same
 

1601
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,610
same plastic part show it to the same
inspector in the afternoon and I suppose

1602
00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:04,620
inspector in the afternoon and I suppose
 

1603
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:05,390
inspector in the afternoon and I suppose
in the morning

1604
00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:05,400
in the morning
 

1605
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,700
in the morning
and very affinity go in the morning to

1606
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:07,710
and very affinity go in the morning to
 

1607
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:09,470
and very affinity go in the morning to
say clearly is okay in the afternoon

1608
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:09,480
say clearly is okay in the afternoon
 

1609
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,420
say clearly is okay in the afternoon
equally confident clearly this is a

1610
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:11,430
equally confident clearly this is a
 

1611
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:13,910
equally confident clearly this is a
defect and so what does the i-team

1612
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:13,920
defect and so what does the i-team
 

1613
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:16,460
defect and so what does the i-team
supposed to do if if sometimes even one

1614
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:16,470
supposed to do if if sometimes even one
 

1615
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:18,050
supposed to do if if sometimes even one
person doesn't agree of himself or

1616
00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:18,060
person doesn't agree of himself or
 

1617
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:20,690
person doesn't agree of himself or
herself in the span of a day so I think

1618
00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:20,700
herself in the span of a day so I think
 

1619
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:23,660
herself in the span of a day so I think
these are the types of um very practical

1620
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:23,670
these are the types of um very practical
 

1621
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:26,600
these are the types of um very practical
very messy data problems that that you

1622
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:26,610
very messy data problems that that you
 

1623
00:31:26,610 --> 00:31:30,680
very messy data problems that that you
know that my teams wrestle with in the

1624
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:30,690
know that my teams wrestle with in the
 

1625
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:32,510
know that my teams wrestle with in the
case of large consumer Internet

1626
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:32,520
case of large consumer Internet
 

1627
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:33,920

companies where you have a billion users

1628
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:33,930
companies where you have a billion users
 

1629
00:31:33,930 --> 00:31:36,110
companies where you have a billion users
you have a lot of data you don't worry

1630
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:36,120
you have a lot of data you don't worry
 

1631
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,520
you have a lot of data you don't worry
about they just take the average it kind

1632
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:37,530
about they just take the average it kind
 

1633
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:40,370
about they just take the average it kind
of works but in a case of other industry

00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:40,380
of works but in a case of other industry
 

1635
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:42,770

settings we don't have big data if just

1636
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:42,780
settings we don't have big data if just
 

1637
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:44,750
settings we don't have big data if just
a small data very small the users maybe

1638
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:44,760
a small data very small the users maybe
 

1639
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:49,040

100 defective parts or 100 examples of a
 

1641
00:31:49,050 --> 00:31:51,020
100 defective parts or 100 examples of a

these little labeling errors you know if

1644
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:53,490
these little labeling errors you know if
 

1645
00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:55,340
these little labeling errors you know if
10 of your hundred labels aren't wrong

1646
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:55,350
10 of your hundred labels aren't wrong
 

1647
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:57,710
10 of your hundred labels aren't wrong
that actually is 10% it is that has a

1648
00:31:57,710 --> 00:31:57,720
that actually is 10% it is that has a
 

1649
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,540
that actually is 10% it is that has a
big impact so how do you clean this up

1650
00:31:59,540 --> 00:31:59,550
big impact so how do you clean this up
 

1651
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:01,700
big impact so how do you clean this up
what you're supposed to do this is an

1652
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:01,710
what you're supposed to do this is an
 

1653
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:03,440
what you're supposed to do this is an
example of the of the types of things

00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:03,450
example of the of the types of things
 

1655
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:05,930

that my team's did this is a landing AI

1656
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:05,940
that my team's did this is a landing AI
 

1657
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:08,210
that my team's did this is a landing AI
example are wrestling with to deal with

1658
00:32:08,210 --> 00:32:08,220
example are wrestling with to deal with
 

1659
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:10,130

small data which comes up all the time

1660
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:10,140
small data which comes up all the time
 

1661
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:11,870
small data which comes up all the time
once you're outside consumer internet

1662
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:11,880
once you're outside consumer internet
 

1663
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,610
once you're outside consumer internet
yeah that's fascinating so then you

1664
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:13,620
yeah that's fascinating so then you
 

1665
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:15,800
yeah that's fascinating so then you
invest more effort in time in thinking

1666
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:15,810
invest more effort in time in thinking
 

1667
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:18,350
invest more effort in time in thinking
about the actual labeling process what

1668
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:18,360
about the actual labeling process what
 

1669
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:21,440
about the actual labeling process what
are the labels what are the how our

1670
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:21,450
are the labels what are the how our
 

1671
00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:22,940
are the labels what are the how our
disagreements resolved in all those

00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:25,170
kinds of like pragmatic real world
 

1675
00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:27,500
kinds of like pragmatic real world
problems that's a fascinating space yeah

1676
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:27,510
problems that's a fascinating space yeah
 

1677
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:29,060
problems that's a fascinating space yeah
I find it actually when I'm teaching at

1678
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:29,070
I find it actually when I'm teaching at
 

1679
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:31,070
I find it actually when I'm teaching at
Stanford I increasingly encourage

1680
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:31,080
Stanford I increasingly encourage
 

1681
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:34,790
Stanford I increasingly encourage
students at Stanford to try to find

1682
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:34,800
students at Stanford to try to find
 

1683
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,370
students at Stanford to try to find
their own project

1684
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:36,380
their own project
 

1685
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:38,690
their own project
for the end of term project rather than

00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:38,700
for the end of term project rather than
 

1687
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:40,820
for the end of term project rather than
just downloading someone else's nicely

1688
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:40,830
just downloading someone else's nicely
 

1689
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:42,710
just downloading someone else's nicely
clean data set it's actually much harder

1690
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:42,720
clean data set it's actually much harder
 

1691
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,180
clean data set it's actually much harder
if you need to go and define your own

if you need to go and define your own
 

1693
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:45,800
if you need to go and define your own
problem and find your own dataset rather

problem and find your own dataset rather
 

1695
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:48,230

00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,920
into AI so my machine learning course
that I taught through Stanford is one of

1738
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:42,930
that I taught through Stanford is one of
 

1739
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:45,680
that I taught through Stanford is one of
the most popular causes on Coursera to

1740
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:45,690
the most popular causes on Coursera to
 

1741
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,210
the most popular causes on Coursera to
this day it's probably one of the

1742
00:33:47,210 --> 00:33:47,220
this day it's probably one of the
 

1743
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:50,000
this day it's probably one of the
courses sort of if I ask somebody how

1744
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:50,010
courses sort of if I ask somebody how
 

1745
00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:52,550
courses sort of if I ask somebody how
did you get into machine learning or how

1746
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:52,560
did you get into machine learning or how
 

1747
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,750
did you get into machine learning or how
did you fall in love with machine

1748
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:53,760
did you fall in love with machine
 

1749
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,790
did you fall in love with machine
learning or will get you interested they

1750
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:55,800
learning or will get you interested they
 

1751
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:58,580
learning or will get you interested they
it always goes back to rain and Drang at

1752
00:33:58,580 --> 00:33:58,590
it always goes back to rain and Drang at
 

1753
00:33:58,590 --> 00:34:01,730
it always goes back to rain and Drang at
some point you won't find the amount of

1754
00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:01,740
some point you won't find the amount of
 

1755
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:03,410
some point you won't find the amount of
people you influence is ridiculous so

1756
00:34:03,410 --> 00:34:03,420
people you influence is ridiculous so
 

1757
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:05,540
people you influence is ridiculous so
for that I'm sure I speak for a lot of

1758
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:05,550
for that I'm sure I speak for a lot of
 

1759
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:07,760
for that I'm sure I speak for a lot of
people say big thank you no yeah thank

1760
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:07,770
people say big thank you no yeah thank
 

1761
00:34:07,770 --> 00:34:11,090
people say big thank you no yeah thank
you you know I was once reading a news

1762
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:11,100
you you know I was once reading a news
 

1763
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:15,200
you you know I was once reading a news
article I think it was tech review and

1764
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:15,210
article I think it was tech review and
 

1765
00:34:15,210 --> 00:34:17,870
article I think it was tech review and
I'm gonna mess up the statistic but I

1766
00:34:17,870 --> 00:34:17,880
I'm gonna mess up the statistic but I
 

1767
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,550
I'm gonna mess up the statistic but I
remember reading article that said um

1768
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:19,560
remember reading article that said um
 

1769
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,740
remember reading article that said um
something like one-third of all

1770
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:21,750
something like one-third of all
 

1771
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:24,110
something like one-third of all
programmers are self-taught I may have

1772
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:24,120
programmers are self-taught I may have
 

1773
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,280
programmers are self-taught I may have
the number one third Romney was

1774
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:25,290
the number one third Romney was
 

1775
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:26,720
the number one third Romney was
two-thirds but I rent an article I

1776
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:26,730
two-thirds but I rent an article I
 

1777
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:28,130
two-thirds but I rent an article I
thought this doesn't make sense

1778
00:34:28,130 --> 00:34:28,140
thought this doesn't make sense
 

1779
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:30,620
thought this doesn't make sense
everyone is self-taught because you

1780
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:30,630
everyone is self-taught because you
 

1781
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:32,570
everyone is self-taught because you
teach yourself I don't teach people and

1782
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:32,580
teach yourself I don't teach people and
 

1783
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:35,930
teach yourself I don't teach people and
it's no good haha oh yeah so how does

1784
00:34:35,930 --> 00:34:35,940
it's no good haha oh yeah so how does
 

1785
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:38,180
it's no good haha oh yeah so how does
one get started in deep learning and

1786
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:38,190
one get started in deep learning and
 

1787
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:39,770
one get started in deep learning and
where does deep learning that AI fit

1788
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:39,780
where does deep learning that AI fit
 

1789
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:40,280
where does deep learning that AI fit
into that

1790
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:40,290
into that
 

1791
00:34:40,290 --> 00:34:42,950
into that
so the define specialization offered by

1792
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:42,960
so the define specialization offered by
 

1793
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:47,870
so the define specialization offered by
today is is this I think one it was

1794
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:47,880
today is is this I think one it was
 

1795
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:50,330
today is is this I think one it was
called service specialization it might

1796
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:50,340
called service specialization it might
 

1797
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:51,860
called service specialization it might
still be so it's very popular way for

1798
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:51,870
still be so it's very popular way for
 

1799
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:54,710
still be so it's very popular way for
people to take that specialization to

1800
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:54,720
people to take that specialization to
 

1801
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:57,560
people to take that specialization to
learn about everything from new networks

1802
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:57,570
learn about everything from new networks
 

1803
00:34:57,570 --> 00:35:00,530
learn about everything from new networks
to how to tune in your network so what

1804
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:00,540
to how to tune in your network so what
 

1805
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:03,140
to how to tune in your network so what
is it confident to what is a RNA nor

1806
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:03,150
is it confident to what is a RNA nor
 

1807
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:05,210
is it confident to what is a RNA nor
sequence model or what is an attention

1808
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:05,220
sequence model or what is an attention
 

1809
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:07,910
sequence model or what is an attention
model and so the design specialization

1810
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:07,920
model and so the design specialization
 

1811
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,370
model and so the design specialization
um steps everyone's through those

1812
00:35:10,370 --> 00:35:10,380
um steps everyone's through those
 

1813
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:12,260
um steps everyone's through those
algorithms so you deeply understand it

1814
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:12,270
algorithms so you deeply understand it
 

1815
00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:14,210
algorithms so you deeply understand it
and can implement it and use it you know

1816
00:35:14,210 --> 00:35:14,220
and can implement it and use it you know
 

1817
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:16,190
and can implement it and use it you know
for whatever a from the very beginning

1818
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:16,200
for whatever a from the very beginning
 

1819
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:19,520
for whatever a from the very beginning
so what would you say the prerequisites

1820
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:19,530
so what would you say the prerequisites
 

1821
00:35:19,530 --> 00:35:21,040
so what would you say the prerequisites
for somebody to take the deep learning

1822
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:21,050
for somebody to take the deep learning
 

1823
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:24,110
for somebody to take the deep learning
specialization in terms of maybe math or

1824
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:24,120
specialization in terms of maybe math or
 

1825
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:26,630
specialization in terms of maybe math or
programming background you know need to

1826
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:26,640
programming background you know need to
 

1827
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,460
programming background you know need to
understand basic programming since there

1828
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:28,470
understand basic programming since there
 

1829
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:30,370
understand basic programming since there
are Pro exercises in Python

1830
00:35:30,370 --> 00:35:30,380
are Pro exercises in Python
 

1831
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:34,280
are Pro exercises in Python
and the map prereq is quite basic

1832
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:34,290
and the map prereq is quite basic
 

1833
00:35:34,290 --> 00:35:36,320
and the map prereq is quite basic
so no calculus is needed if you know

1834
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:36,330
so no calculus is needed if you know
 

1835
00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:37,609
so no calculus is needed if you know
calculus is great you get better

1836
00:35:37,609 --> 00:35:37,619
calculus is great you get better
 

1837
00:35:37,619 --> 00:35:40,190
calculus is great you get better
intuitions but deliberately try to teach

1838
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:40,200
intuitions but deliberately try to teach
 

1839
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,140
intuitions but deliberately try to teach
that specialization without requirement

1840
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:42,150
that specialization without requirement
 

1841
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:45,560
that specialization without requirement
calculus so I think high school math

1842
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:45,570
calculus so I think high school math
 

1843
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:47,810
calculus so I think high school math
would be sufficient if you know how to

1844
00:35:47,810 --> 00:35:47,820
would be sufficient if you know how to
 

1845
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:49,670
would be sufficient if you know how to
Mouse by two matrices I think I think

1846
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:49,680
Mouse by two matrices I think I think
 

1847
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,620
Mouse by two matrices I think I think
that that deaths that desperates

1848
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:51,630
that that deaths that desperates
 

1849
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:54,290
that that deaths that desperates
so little basically in your algebra it's

1850
00:35:54,290 --> 00:35:54,300
so little basically in your algebra it's
 

1851
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:54,650
so little basically in your algebra it's
great

1852
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:54,660
great
 

1853
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:57,200
great
basically the algebra even very very

1854
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:57,210
basically the algebra even very very
 

1855
00:35:57,210 --> 00:35:58,730
basically the algebra even very very
basically the algebra and some

1856
00:35:58,730 --> 00:35:58,740
basically the algebra and some
 

1857
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:01,040
basically the algebra and some
programming I think that people that

1858
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:01,050
programming I think that people that
 

1859
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:02,690
programming I think that people that
done the machine learning also find a

1860
00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:02,700
done the machine learning also find a
 

1861
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:04,220
done the machine learning also find a
deep learning specialization a bit

1862
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:04,230
deep learning specialization a bit
 

1863
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:06,620
deep learning specialization a bit
easier but is also possible to jump into

1864
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:06,630
easier but is also possible to jump into
 

1865
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:08,570
easier but is also possible to jump into
the divine specialization directly but

1866
00:36:08,570 --> 00:36:08,580
the divine specialization directly but
 

1867
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:10,370
the divine specialization directly but
it'll be a little bit harder since we

1868
00:36:10,370 --> 00:36:10,380
it'll be a little bit harder since we
 

1869
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:14,510
it'll be a little bit harder since we
tend to you know go over faster concepts

1870
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:14,520
tend to you know go over faster concepts
 

1871
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,370
tend to you know go over faster concepts
like how does gradient descent work and

1872
00:36:16,370 --> 00:36:16,380
like how does gradient descent work and
 

1873
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:17,660
like how does gradient descent work and
what is an objective function which

1874
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:17,670
what is an objective function which
 

1875
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:19,430
what is an objective function which
which is covered mostly in the machine

1876
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:19,440
which is covered mostly in the machine
 

1877
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,900
which is covered mostly in the machine
learning course could you briefly

1878
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:20,910
learning course could you briefly
 

1879
00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:23,210
learning course could you briefly
mention some of the key concepts in deep

1880
00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:23,220
mention some of the key concepts in deep
 

1881
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:25,100
mention some of the key concepts in deep

we go through a lot of practical

1904
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:49,410
we go through a lot of practical
 

1905
00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:51,470
we go through a lot of practical
know-how of how to actually make these

things work so what the differences

1908
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:53,340
things work so what the differences
 

1909
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:54,800
things work so what the differences
between different optimization

1910

between different optimization
 

1911
00:36:54,810 --> 00:36:56,480
between different optimization
algorithms so what do you do of the

1912
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:56,490
algorithms so what do you do of the
 

1913
00:36:56,490 --> 00:36:57,980
algorithms so what do you do of the
algorithm over things so how do you tell

1914
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:57,990
algorithm over things so how do you tell
 

1915
00:36:57,990 --> 00:36:59,390

00:36:59,390 --> 00:36:59,400
the algorithm is overfitting when you
 

1917
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,890
the algorithm is overfitting when you
collect more data when should you not

1918
00:37:00,890 --> 00:37:00,900
collect more data when should you not
 

1919
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:02,780
collect more data when should you not
bother to collect more data

1920
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:02,790
bother to collect more data
 

1921
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:06,230

there are your engineers that will spend

1924
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:09,450
there are your engineers that will spend
 

1925
00:37:09,450 --> 00:37:11,150
there are your engineers that will spend
six months trying to pursue a particular

00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:11,160
six months trying to pursue a particular
 

1927
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:13,580
six months trying to pursue a particular
direction such as collect more data

1928
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:13,590
direction such as collect more data
 

1929
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:15,380
direction such as collect more data
because we heard more data is valuable

1930
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:15,390
because we heard more data is valuable
 

1931
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:18,050
because we heard more data is valuable
but sometimes you could run some tests

1932
00:37:18,050 --> 00:37:18,060
but sometimes you could run some tests
 

1933
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:19,790
but sometimes you could run some tests
and could have figured out six months

1934
00:37:19,790 --> 00:37:19,800
and could have figured out six months
 

1935
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,590
and could have figured out six months
earlier therefore this problem

1936
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:21,600
earlier therefore this problem
 

1937
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,810
earlier therefore this problem
collecting more data isn't going to cut

1938
00:37:23,810 --> 00:37:23,820
collecting more data isn't going to cut
 

1939
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:25,130
collecting more data isn't going to cut
it so just don't spend seconds

1940
00:37:25,130 --> 00:37:25,140
it so just don't spend seconds
 

1941
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:27,790
it so just don't spend seconds
collecting more data spend your time

1942
00:37:27,790 --> 00:37:27,800
collecting more data spend your time
 

1943
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,720
collecting more data spend your time

lines of code into coherent things so

1998

lines of code into coherent things so
 

1999
00:38:29,069 --> 00:38:31,190

you know when should you put something
 

2001
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,329
you know when should you put something
in the function call and when should you

Mellon um one of my friends with debug

2014
00:38:46,339 --> 00:38:46,349
Mellon um one of my friends with debug
 

2015
00:38:46,349 --> 00:38:48,740
Mellon um one of my friends with debug
their codes by first trying to compile

2016
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:48,750
their codes by first trying to compile
 

2017
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:50,839
their codes by first trying to compile
it and then it was T plus s code and

2018
00:38:50,839 --> 00:38:50,849
it and then it was T plus s code and
 

2019
00:38:50,849 --> 00:38:53,539
it and then it was T plus s code and
then every line did a syntax error they

2020
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:53,549
then every line did a syntax error they
 

2021
00:38:53,549 --> 00:38:54,859
then every line did a syntax error they
want to care for the syntax errors as

2022
00:38:54,859 --> 00:38:54,869
want to care for the syntax errors as
 

2023
00:38:54,869 --> 00:38:56,420
want to care for the syntax errors as
quickly as possible so how do you do

2024
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:56,430
quickly as possible so how do you do
 

2025
00:38:56,430 --> 00:38:57,950
quickly as possible so how do you do
that well they would delete every single

2026
00:38:57,950 --> 00:38:57,960
that well they would delete every single
 

2027
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,420
that well they would delete every single
line of code with a syntax error so

2028
00:38:59,420 --> 00:38:59,430
line of code with a syntax error so
 

2029
00:38:59,430 --> 00:39:01,309
line of code with a syntax error so
really efficient for general syntax

2030
00:39:01,309 --> 00:39:01,319
really efficient for general syntax
 

2031
00:39:01,319 --> 00:39:03,200
really efficient for general syntax
errors were horrible service I

2032

think in machine learning the way you

2036
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:07,410
think in machine learning the way you
 

2037
00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:09,559
think in machine learning the way you
debug the machine learning program is

2038
00:39:09,559 --> 00:39:09,569
debug the machine learning program is
 

2039
00:39:09,569 --> 00:39:11,450
debug the machine learning program is
very different than the way you you know

2040
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:11,460
very different than the way you you know
 

2041
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:13,490
very different than the way you you know
like do binary search or whatever use

2055
00:39:24,299 --> 00:39:26,690
are easily 10x
maybe 100x faster at getting something

00:39:29,210 --> 00:39:29,220
to work so and the basic process of
 

2059
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:32,539
to work so and the basic process of
debugging is so the the bug in this case

2060
00:39:32,539 --> 00:39:32,549
debugging is so the the bug in this case
 

2061
00:39:32,549 --> 00:39:35,240
debugging is so the the bug in this case
why is in this thing learning learning

00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:38,190
improving sort of going into the
 

2065
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:39,769
improving sort of going into the
questions of overfitting and all those

2066
00:39:39,769 --> 00:39:39,779
questions of overfitting and all those
 

2067
00:39:39,779 --> 00:39:41,960
questions of overfitting and all those
kinds of things that's that's the

2068
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:41,970
kinds of things that's that's the
 

2069
00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:44,690
kinds of things that's that's the
logical space that the debugging is

2070
00:39:44,690 --> 00:39:44,700
logical space that the debugging is
 

2071
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:46,400
logical space that the debugging is
happening in would in your network

reinforcement learning it's been great
but not in the applied impact on the

but not in the applied impact on the
 

2331
00:44:51,620 --> 00:44:53,680
but not in the applied impact on the
real-world setting so it's a it's a

00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:53,690
real-world setting so it's a it's a
 

2333
00:44:53,690 --> 00:44:55,240

also
even within machine learning I feel like

00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:03,050
even within machine learning I feel like
 

2345
00:45:03,050 --> 00:45:06,700
even within machine learning I feel like
deep learning is so exciting but the AI

2346
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:06,710
deep learning is so exciting but the AI
 

2347
00:45:06,710 --> 00:45:08,470
deep learning is so exciting but the AI
team shouldn't just use deep learning

academia has really thin compared to the
 

2377
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,600
academia has really thin compared to the
actual rower impact so so I think

2378
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:40,610
actual rower impact so so I think
 

2379
00:45:40,610 --> 00:45:42,040
actual rower impact so so I think
reinforcement learning should be in that

2522
00:48:27,210 --> 00:48:27,220
exciting work and I think this is a way
 

2523
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:30,930
exciting work and I think this is a way
to generate infinitely both data and and

2524
00:48:30,930 --> 00:48:30,940
to generate infinitely both data and and
 

2525
00:48:30,940 --> 00:48:33,570
to generate infinitely both data and and
I find this a very exciting piece of an

2526
00:48:33,570 --> 00:48:33,580
I find this a very exciting piece of an
 

2527
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:34,980
I find this a very exciting piece of an
supervisor and he's a long-term you

2528
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:34,990
supervisor and he's a long-term you
 

2529
00:48:34,990 --> 00:48:37,590
supervisor and he's a long-term you
think that's going to unlock a lot of

2530
00:48:37,590 --> 00:48:37,600
think that's going to unlock a lot of
 

2531
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:40,140
think that's going to unlock a lot of
power and in machine learning systems is

2532
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:40,150
power and in machine learning systems is
 

2533
00:48:40,150 --> 00:48:42,060
power and in machine learning systems is
this kind of unsupervised learning I

2534
00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:42,070
this kind of unsupervised learning I
 

2535
00:48:42,070 --> 00:48:43,980
this kind of unsupervised learning I
don't think there's the whole enchilada

2536
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:43,990
don't think there's the whole enchilada
 

2537
00:48:43,990 --> 00:48:45,359
don't think there's the whole enchilada
I think that's just a piece of it and I

2538
00:48:45,359 --> 00:48:45,369
I think that's just a piece of it and I
 

2539
00:48:45,369 --> 00:48:47,640
I think that's just a piece of it and I
think this one piece unsuited is self

2540
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:47,650
think this one piece unsuited is self
 

2541
00:48:47,650 --> 00:48:49,770
think this one piece unsuited is self
supervised learning it's starting to get

2542
00:48:49,770 --> 00:48:49,780
supervised learning it's starting to get
 

2543
00:48:49,780 --> 00:48:51,960
supervised learning it's starting to get
traction we're very close to it being

2544
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:51,970
traction we're very close to it being
 

2545
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:54,390
traction we're very close to it being
useful well what embedding is really

2546
00:48:54,390 --> 00:48:54,400
useful well what embedding is really
 

2547
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:56,340
useful well what embedding is really
really useful I think we're getting

2548
00:48:56,340 --> 00:48:56,350
really useful I think we're getting
 

2549
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:58,280
really useful I think we're getting
closer and closer to just having a

2550
00:48:58,280 --> 00:48:58,290
closer and closer to just having a
 

2551
00:48:58,290 --> 00:49:00,930
closer and closer to just having a
significant real world impact maybe in

2552
00:49:00,930 --> 00:49:00,940
significant real world impact maybe in
 

2553
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:03,660
significant real world impact maybe in
computer vision and video but I think

2554
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:03,670
computer vision and video but I think
 

2555
00:49:03,670 --> 00:49:05,849
computer vision and video but I think
this concept and then I think there'll

2556
00:49:05,849 --> 00:49:05,859
this concept and then I think there'll
 

2557
00:49:05,859 --> 00:49:07,340
this concept and then I think there'll
be other concepts around it you know

2558
00:49:07,340 --> 00:49:07,350
be other concepts around it you know
 

2559
00:49:07,350 --> 00:49:09,810
be other concepts around it you know
other unsupervised learning things that

2560
00:49:09,810 --> 00:49:09,820
other unsupervised learning things that
 

2561
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:11,580
other unsupervised learning things that
I worked on I've been excited about I

2562
00:49:11,580 --> 00:49:11,590
I worked on I've been excited about I
 

2563
00:49:11,590 --> 00:49:13,790
I worked on I've been excited about I
was really excited about sparse coding

2564
00:49:13,790 --> 00:49:13,800
was really excited about sparse coding
 

2565
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:17,670
was really excited about sparse coding
and I see a slow feature analysis I

2566
00:49:17,670 --> 00:49:17,680
and I see a slow feature analysis I
 

2567
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:18,890
and I see a slow feature analysis I
think all of these are ideas that

2568
00:49:18,890 --> 00:49:18,900
think all of these are ideas that
 

2569
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:21,030
think all of these are ideas that
various of us were working on about a

2570
00:49:21,030 --> 00:49:21,040
various of us were working on about a
 

2571
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:22,950
various of us were working on about a
decade ago before we all got distracted

2572
00:49:22,950 --> 00:49:22,960
decade ago before we all got distracted
 

2573
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,170
decade ago before we all got distracted
by how well supervised learning was

2574
00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:25,180
by how well supervised learning was
 

2575
00:49:25,180 --> 00:49:26,970
by how well supervised learning was
wearing work yeah it was a we would

that that really started this movement

2582
00:49:32,670 --> 00:49:32,680
that that really started this movement
 

2583
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:34,530
that that really started this movement
of deep learning I think there's a lot

2584
00:49:34,530 --> 00:49:34,540
of deep learning I think there's a lot
 

2585
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:36,210
of deep learning I think there's a lot
more work that one could explore around

2586
00:49:36,210 --> 00:49:36,220
more work that one could explore around
 

2587
00:49:36,220 --> 00:49:38,520
more work that one could explore around
the steam of ideas and other ideas to

00:49:38,530 --> 00:49:41,220
the steam of ideas and other ideas to
come or better algorithms so if we could

00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:49,750
deep learning specialization perhaps how

long does it take to complete the course

2598
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:51,310
long does it take to complete the course
 

2599
00:49:51,310 --> 00:49:54,240
long does it take to complete the course
would you say the official length of the

00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:54,250
would you say the official length of the
 

2601
00:49:54,250 --> 00:49:56,460
would you say the official length of the
divine specialization is I think 16

2602
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:56,470
divine specialization is I think 16
 

2603
00:49:56,470 --> 00:50:00,000
divine specialization is I think 16
weeks so about 4 months but is go at

2604
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:00,010
weeks so about 4 months but is go at
 

2605
00:50:00,010 --> 00:50:02,340
weeks so about 4 months but is go at
your own pace so if you subscribe to the

00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:02,350
your own pace so if you subscribe to the
 

2607
00:50:02,350 --> 00:50:04,170
your own pace so if you subscribe to the
divine socialization there are people

2608
00:50:04,170 --> 00:50:04,180
divine socialization there are people
 

2609
00:50:04,180 --> 00:50:06,000
divine socialization there are people
that finish that in less than a month by

that finish that in less than a month by
 

2611
00:50:06,010 --> 00:50:07,620
that finish that in less than a month by
working more intensely and study more

working more intensely and study more
 

2613
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:09,630
working more intensely and study more
intensely so it really depends on on the

do I feel like reading or studying today

2678
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:29,630
do I feel like reading or studying today
 

2679
00:51:29,630 --> 00:51:31,870
do I feel like reading or studying today
or not it's just it's just what I do and

2680
00:51:31,870 --> 00:51:31,880
or not it's just it's just what I do and
 

2681
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:34,480
or not it's just it's just what I do and
the fact is a habit makes it easier so I

2682
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:34,490
the fact is a habit makes it easier so I
 

2683
00:51:34,490 --> 00:51:37,180
the fact is a habit makes it easier so I
think if someone can get in that habit

2684
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:37,190
think if someone can get in that habit
 

2685
00:51:37,190 --> 00:51:39,790
think if someone can get in that habit
it's like you know just like we brush

2686
00:51:39,790 --> 00:51:39,800
it's like you know just like we brush
 

2687
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:41,710
it's like you know just like we brush
our teeth every morning I don't think

2688
00:51:41,710 --> 00:51:41,720
our teeth every morning I don't think
 

2689
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:42,970
our teeth every morning I don't think
about it if I thought about this a

2690
00:51:42,970 --> 00:51:42,980
about it if I thought about this a
 

2691
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:44,320
about it if I thought about this a
little bit annoying to have to spend two

2692
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:44,330
little bit annoying to have to spend two
 

2693
00:51:44,330 --> 00:51:47,260
little bit annoying to have to spend two
minutes doing that but it's a habit that

2694
00:51:47,260 --> 00:51:47,270
minutes doing that but it's a habit that
 

2695
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:49,510
minutes doing that but it's a habit that
it takes no cognitive loads but this

2696
00:51:49,510 --> 00:51:49,520
it takes no cognitive loads but this
 

2697
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:50,800
it takes no cognitive loads but this
would be so much harder if we have to

2698
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:50,810
would be so much harder if we have to
 

2699
00:51:50,810 --> 00:51:53,860
would be so much harder if we have to
make a decision every morning so and

2700
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:53,870
make a decision every morning so and
 

2701
00:51:53,870 --> 00:51:55,210
make a decision every morning so and
actually that's the reason why we're the

2702
00:51:55,210 --> 00:51:55,220
actually that's the reason why we're the
 

2703
00:51:55,220 --> 00:51:56,320
actually that's the reason why we're the
same thing every day as well it's just

2704
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:56,330
same thing every day as well it's just
 

2705
00:51:56,330 --> 00:51:58,030
same thing every day as well it's just
one less decision I just get out in

2706
00:51:58,030 --> 00:51:58,040
one less decision I just get out in
 

2707
00:51:58,040 --> 00:52:00,430
one less decision I just get out in
there where I'm sure so I think you can

2708
00:52:00,430 --> 00:52:00,440
there where I'm sure so I think you can
 

2709
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:02,200
there where I'm sure so I think you can
get that habit that consistency of

2710
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:02,210
get that habit that consistency of
 

2711
00:52:02,210 --> 00:52:04,210
get that habit that consistency of
studying then then it actually feels

2712
00:52:04,210 --> 00:52:04,220
studying then then it actually feels
 

2713
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:08,170
studying then then it actually feels
easier so yeah it's kind of amazing in

2714
00:52:08,170 --> 00:52:08,180
easier so yeah it's kind of amazing in
 

2715
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:11,380
easier so yeah it's kind of amazing in
my own life like I play guitar every day

2716
00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:11,390
my own life like I play guitar every day
 

2717
00:52:11,390 --> 00:52:14,290
my own life like I play guitar every day
for life forced myself to at least for

2718
00:52:14,290 --> 00:52:14,300
for life forced myself to at least for
 

2719
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:16,210
for life forced myself to at least for
five minutes play guitar it's just it's

2720
00:52:16,210 --> 00:52:16,220
five minutes play guitar it's just it's
 

2721
00:52:16,220 --> 00:52:18,370
five minutes play guitar it's just it's
a ridiculously short period of time but

2722
00:52:18,370 --> 00:52:18,380
a ridiculously short period of time but
 

2723
00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:20,320
a ridiculously short period of time but
because I've gotten into that habit it's

2724
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:20,330
because I've gotten into that habit it's
 

2725
00:52:20,330 --> 00:52:22,030
because I've gotten into that habit it's
incredible what you can accomplish in a

2726
00:52:22,030 --> 00:52:22,040
incredible what you can accomplish in a
 

2727
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:24,760
incredible what you can accomplish in a
period of a year or two years you could

2728
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:24,770
period of a year or two years you could
 

2729
00:52:24,770 --> 00:52:27,180
period of a year or two years you could
become you know

2730
00:52:27,180 --> 00:52:27,190
become you know
 

2731
00:52:27,190 --> 00:52:29,290
become you know
exceptionally good at certain aspects of

2732
00:52:29,290 --> 00:52:29,300
exceptionally good at certain aspects of
 

2733
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:31,210
exceptionally good at certain aspects of
a thing by just doing it every day for a

2734
00:52:31,210 --> 00:52:31,220
a thing by just doing it every day for a
 

2735
00:52:31,220 --> 00:52:32,560
a thing by just doing it every day for a
very short period of time it's kind of a

2736
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:32,570
very short period of time it's kind of a
 

2737
00:52:32,570 --> 00:52:34,270
very short period of time it's kind of a
miracle that that is how it works

2738
00:52:34,270 --> 00:52:34,280
miracle that that is how it works
 

2739
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:37,000
miracle that that is how it works
it's adds up over time yeah and I think

2740
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:37,010
it's adds up over time yeah and I think
 

2741
00:52:37,010 --> 00:52:39,220
it's adds up over time yeah and I think
is this something is often not about the

2742
00:52:39,220 --> 00:52:39,230
is this something is often not about the
 

2743
00:52:39,230 --> 00:52:41,440
is this something is often not about the
bursts of sustained effort and all-night

2744
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:41,450
bursts of sustained effort and all-night
 

2745
00:52:41,450 --> 00:52:43,240
bursts of sustained effort and all-night
is because you can only do that in a

2746
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:43,250
is because you can only do that in a
 

2747
00:52:43,250 --> 00:52:43,730
is because you can only do that in a
limited

2748
00:52:43,730 --> 00:52:43,740
limited
 

2749
00:52:43,740 --> 00:52:46,010
limited
of times it's the sustained effort over

2750
00:52:46,010 --> 00:52:46,020
of times it's the sustained effort over
 

2751
00:52:46,020 --> 00:52:48,710
of times it's the sustained effort over
a long time I think you know reading two

2752
00:52:48,710 --> 00:52:48,720
a long time I think you know reading two
 

2753
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:51,290
a long time I think you know reading two
research papers there's a nice thing to

2754
00:52:51,290 --> 00:52:51,300
research papers there's a nice thing to
 

2755
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:53,510
research papers there's a nice thing to
do but the power is not reading through

2756
00:52:53,510 --> 00:52:53,520
do but the power is not reading through
 

2757
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:54,980
do but the power is not reading through
research papers this reading through

2758
00:52:54,980 --> 00:52:54,990
research papers this reading through
 

2759
00:52:54,990 --> 00:52:57,770
research papers this reading through
research papers a week for a year then

2760
00:52:57,770 --> 00:52:57,780
research papers a week for a year then
 

2761
00:52:57,780 --> 00:52:59,510
research papers a week for a year then
you've read a hundred papers and and you

2762
00:52:59,510 --> 00:52:59,520
you've read a hundred papers and and you
 

2763
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:00,680
you've read a hundred papers and and you
actually learn a lot when you read a

2764
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:00,690
actually learn a lot when you read a
 

2765
00:53:00,690 --> 00:53:04,040
actually learn a lot when you read a
hundred papers so regularity and making

2766
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:04,050
hundred papers so regularity and making
 

2767
00:53:04,050 --> 00:53:08,570
hundred papers so regularity and making
learning a habit do you have do you have

2768
00:53:08,570 --> 00:53:08,580
learning a habit do you have do you have
 

2769
00:53:08,580 --> 00:53:10,550
learning a habit do you have do you have
general other study tips for

2770
00:53:10,550 --> 00:53:10,560
general other study tips for
 

2771
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:13,010
general other study tips for
particularly deep learning that people

2772
00:53:13,010 --> 00:53:13,020
particularly deep learning that people
 

2773
00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:15,530
particularly deep learning that people
should in in their process of learning

2774
00:53:15,530 --> 00:53:15,540
should in in their process of learning
 

2775
00:53:15,540 --> 00:53:17,450
should in in their process of learning
is there some kind of recommendations or

2776
00:53:17,450 --> 00:53:17,460
is there some kind of recommendations or
 

2777
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:21,200
is there some kind of recommendations or
tips you have as they learn one thing I

2778
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:21,210
tips you have as they learn one thing I
 

2779
00:53:21,210 --> 00:53:22,970
tips you have as they learn one thing I
still do when I'm trying to study

2780
00:53:22,970 --> 00:53:22,980
still do when I'm trying to study
 

2781
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:24,680
still do when I'm trying to study
something really deeply is take

2782
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:24,690
something really deeply is take
 

2783
00:53:24,690 --> 00:53:27,290
something really deeply is take
handwritten notes in theories I know

2784
00:53:27,290 --> 00:53:27,300
handwritten notes in theories I know
 

2785
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:28,940
handwritten notes in theories I know
there are a lot of people that take the

2786
00:53:28,940 --> 00:53:28,950
there are a lot of people that take the
 

2787
00:53:28,950 --> 00:53:30,470
there are a lot of people that take the
deep learning courses during the

2788
00:53:30,470 --> 00:53:30,480
deep learning courses during the
 

2789
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:33,680
deep learning courses during the
commutes or something where maybe mobile

2790
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:33,690
commutes or something where maybe mobile
 

2791
00:53:33,690 --> 00:53:35,690
commutes or something where maybe mobile
quit to take notes so I know it's may

2792
00:53:35,690 --> 00:53:35,700
quit to take notes so I know it's may
 

2793
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:38,270
quit to take notes so I know it's may
not work for everyone but when I'm

2794
00:53:38,270 --> 00:53:38,280
not work for everyone but when I'm
 

2795
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:40,550
not work for everyone but when I'm
taking courses on Coursera you know and

2796
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:40,560
taking courses on Coursera you know and
 

2797
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:42,200
taking courses on Coursera you know and
that still takes on my every now and

2798
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:42,210
that still takes on my every now and
 

2799
00:53:42,210 --> 00:53:43,790
that still takes on my every now and
then the most recent I took was a was a

2800
00:53:43,790 --> 00:53:43,800
then the most recent I took was a was a
 

2801
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:45,350
then the most recent I took was a was a
course on clinical trials because those

2802
00:53:45,350 --> 00:53:45,360
course on clinical trials because those
 

2803
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:47,510
course on clinical trials because those
engines of all that I got my little

2804
00:53:47,510 --> 00:53:47,520
engines of all that I got my little
 

2805
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:49,220
engines of all that I got my little
moleskin notebook and I was sitting in

2806
00:53:49,220 --> 00:53:49,230
moleskin notebook and I was sitting in
 

2807
00:53:49,230 --> 00:53:51,200
moleskin notebook and I was sitting in
my desk is just taking down notes so

2808
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:51,210
my desk is just taking down notes so
 

2809
00:53:51,210 --> 00:53:52,580
my desk is just taking down notes so
what the instructor was saying and that

2810
00:53:52,580 --> 00:53:52,590
what the instructor was saying and that
 

2811
00:53:52,590 --> 00:53:54,950
what the instructor was saying and that
Act we know that that act of taking

2812
00:53:54,950 --> 00:53:54,960
Act we know that that act of taking
 

2813
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:57,609
Act we know that that act of taking
notes preferably handwritten notes

2814
00:53:57,609 --> 00:53:57,619
notes preferably handwritten notes
 

2815
00:53:57,619 --> 00:54:01,250
notes preferably handwritten notes
increases retention so as you're sort of

2816
00:54:01,250 --> 00:54:01,260
increases retention so as you're sort of
 

2817
00:54:01,260 --> 00:54:03,590
increases retention so as you're sort of
watching the video just kind of pausing

2818
00:54:03,590 --> 00:54:03,600
watching the video just kind of pausing
 

2819
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:06,470
watching the video just kind of pausing
maybe and then taking the basic insights

2820
00:54:06,470 --> 00:54:06,480
maybe and then taking the basic insights
 

2821
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:09,230
maybe and then taking the basic insights
down on paper yeah so I should have been

2822
00:54:09,230 --> 00:54:09,240
down on paper yeah so I should have been
 

2823
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:11,030
down on paper yeah so I should have been
a few studies if you know search online

2824
00:54:11,030 --> 00:54:11,040
a few studies if you know search online
 

2825
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:13,030
a few studies if you know search online
you find for some of these studies that

2826
00:54:13,030 --> 00:54:13,040
you find for some of these studies that
 

2827
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:15,530
you find for some of these studies that
taking handwritten notes because

2828
00:54:15,530 --> 00:54:15,540
taking handwritten notes because
 

2829
00:54:15,540 --> 00:54:17,599
taking handwritten notes because
handwriting is slower as were saying

2830
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:17,609
handwriting is slower as were saying
 

2831
00:54:17,609 --> 00:54:20,810
handwriting is slower as were saying
just now um it causes you to recoat the

2832
00:54:20,810 --> 00:54:20,820
just now um it causes you to recoat the
 

2833
00:54:20,820 --> 00:54:23,390
just now um it causes you to recoat the
knowledge in your own words more and

2834
00:54:23,390 --> 00:54:23,400
knowledge in your own words more and
 

2835
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:25,400
knowledge in your own words more and
that process of recoding promotes

2836
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:25,410
that process of recoding promotes
 

2837
00:54:25,410 --> 00:54:27,530
that process of recoding promotes
long-term attention this is as opposed

2838
00:54:27,530 --> 00:54:27,540
long-term attention this is as opposed
 

2839
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:29,840
long-term attention this is as opposed
to typing which is fine again typing is

2840
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:29,850
to typing which is fine again typing is
 

2841
00:54:29,850 --> 00:54:30,620
to typing which is fine again typing is
better than nothing

2842
00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:30,630
better than nothing
 

2843
00:54:30,630 --> 00:54:32,630
better than nothing
or in taking across and nautical is

2844
00:54:32,630 --> 00:54:32,640
or in taking across and nautical is
 

2845
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:34,609
or in taking across and nautical is
better than nothing any cause law but

2846
00:54:34,609 --> 00:54:34,619
better than nothing any cause law but
 

2847
00:54:34,619 --> 00:54:37,040
better than nothing any cause law but
comparing handwritten notes and typing

2848
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:37,050
comparing handwritten notes and typing
 

2849
00:54:37,050 --> 00:54:39,950
comparing handwritten notes and typing
um you can usually type faster for a lot

2850
00:54:39,950 --> 00:54:39,960
um you can usually type faster for a lot
 

2851
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:41,300
um you can usually type faster for a lot
of people do you can hand write notes

2852
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:41,310
of people do you can hand write notes
 

2853
00:54:41,310 --> 00:54:43,310
of people do you can hand write notes
and so when people type they're more

2854
00:54:43,310 --> 00:54:43,320
and so when people type they're more
 

2855
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:45,770
and so when people type they're more
likely to transcribe verbatim what they

2856
00:54:45,770 --> 00:54:45,780
likely to transcribe verbatim what they
 

2857
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:47,840
likely to transcribe verbatim what they
heard and that reduces the amount of

2858
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:47,850
heard and that reduces the amount of
 

2859
00:54:47,850 --> 00:54:50,510
heard and that reduces the amount of
recoding and that actually results in

2860
00:54:50,510 --> 00:54:50,520
recoding and that actually results in
 

2861
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:52,820
recoding and that actually results in
less long-term retention I don't know

2862
00:54:52,820 --> 00:54:52,830
less long-term retention I don't know
 

2863
00:54:52,830 --> 00:54:54,380
less long-term retention I don't know
what the psychological effect there is

2864
00:54:54,380 --> 00:54:54,390
what the psychological effect there is
 

2865
00:54:54,390 --> 00:54:56,060
what the psychological effect there is
but so true there's something

2866
00:54:56,060 --> 00:54:56,070
but so true there's something
 

2867
00:54:56,070 --> 00:54:57,499
but so true there's something
fundamentally different about

2868
00:54:57,499 --> 00:54:57,509
fundamentally different about
 

2869
00:54:57,509 --> 00:55:00,409
fundamentally different about
in handwriting I wonder what that is I

2870
00:55:00,409 --> 00:55:00,419
in handwriting I wonder what that is I
 

2871
00:55:00,419 --> 00:55:02,179
in handwriting I wonder what that is I
wonder if it is as simple as just the

2872
00:55:02,179 --> 00:55:02,189
wonder if it is as simple as just the
 

2873
00:55:02,189 --> 00:55:03,919
wonder if it is as simple as just the
time it takes to write it slower

2874
00:55:03,919 --> 00:55:03,929
time it takes to write it slower
 

2875
00:55:03,929 --> 00:55:06,979
time it takes to write it slower
yeah and and and because because you

2876
00:55:06,979 --> 00:55:06,989
yeah and and and because because you
 

2877
00:55:06,989 --> 00:55:08,839
yeah and and and because because you
can't write as many words you have to

2878
00:55:08,839 --> 00:55:08,849
can't write as many words you have to
 

2879
00:55:08,849 --> 00:55:10,999
can't write as many words you have to
take whatever they said and summarize it

2880
00:55:10,999 --> 00:55:11,009
take whatever they said and summarize it
 

2881
00:55:11,009 --> 00:55:12,889
take whatever they said and summarize it
into fewer words and that summarization

2882
00:55:12,889 --> 00:55:12,899
into fewer words and that summarization
 

2883
00:55:12,899 --> 00:55:14,870
into fewer words and that summarization
process requires deeper processing of

2884
00:55:14,870 --> 00:55:14,880
process requires deeper processing of
 

2885
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:17,299
process requires deeper processing of
the meaning which then results in better

2886
00:55:17,299 --> 00:55:17,309
the meaning which then results in better
 

2887
00:55:17,309 --> 00:55:20,569
the meaning which then results in better
attention that's fascinating oh and then

2888
00:55:20,569 --> 00:55:20,579
attention that's fascinating oh and then
 

2889
00:55:20,579 --> 00:55:22,279
attention that's fascinating oh and then
I spent I think yeah because of course

2890
00:55:22,279 --> 00:55:22,289
I spent I think yeah because of course
 

2891
00:55:22,289 --> 00:55:23,299
I spent I think yeah because of course
error I spent so much time studying

2892
00:55:23,299 --> 00:55:23,309
error I spent so much time studying
 

2893
00:55:23,309 --> 00:55:25,609
error I spent so much time studying
pedagogy thank you my passion that I

2894
00:55:25,609 --> 00:55:25,619
pedagogy thank you my passion that I
 

2895
00:55:25,619 --> 00:55:27,679
pedagogy thank you my passion that I
really love learning how to more

2896
00:55:27,679 --> 00:55:27,689
really love learning how to more
 

2897
00:55:27,689 --> 00:55:30,889
really love learning how to more
efficiently help others learn yeah one

2898
00:55:30,889 --> 00:55:30,899
efficiently help others learn yeah one
 

2899
00:55:30,899 --> 00:55:33,109
efficiently help others learn yeah one
of the things I do both in creating

2900
00:55:33,109 --> 00:55:33,119
of the things I do both in creating
 

2901
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:35,359
of the things I do both in creating
videos or when we write the batch is um

2902
00:55:35,359 --> 00:55:35,369
videos or when we write the batch is um
 

2903
00:55:35,369 --> 00:55:38,719
videos or when we write the batch is um
I kind of think is one minute spent of

2904
00:55:38,719 --> 00:55:38,729
I kind of think is one minute spent of
 

2905
00:55:38,729 --> 00:55:41,449
I kind of think is one minute spent of
us going to be a more efficient learning

2906
00:55:41,449 --> 00:55:41,459
us going to be a more efficient learning
 

2907
00:55:41,459 --> 00:55:43,009
us going to be a more efficient learning
experience than one minute spent

2908
00:55:43,009 --> 00:55:43,019
experience than one minute spent
 

2909
00:55:43,019 --> 00:55:46,249
experience than one minute spent
anywhere else and we really try to you

2910
00:55:46,249 --> 00:55:46,259
anywhere else and we really try to you
 

2911
00:55:46,259 --> 00:55:48,049
anywhere else and we really try to you

busy so when when we're editing them I

2916
00:55:51,939 --> 00:55:51,949
busy so when when we're editing them I
 

2917
00:55:51,949 --> 00:55:54,289
busy so when when we're editing them I
often tell my teams everywhere it needs

you think that way because there is

2928
00:56:02,929 --> 00:56:02,939
you think that way because there is
 

2929
00:56:02,939 --> 00:56:04,309
you think that way because there is
millions of people that are impacted by

millions of people that are impacted by
 

2931
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:05,659
millions of people that are impacted by
your teaching and sort of that one

minute spent has a ripple effect right

2934
00:56:07,939 --> 00:56:07,949
minute spent has a ripple effect right
 

2935
00:56:07,949 --> 00:56:10,519

three years of time which is just

2936
00:56:10,519 --> 00:56:10,529
three years of time which is just
 

2937
00:56:10,529 --> 00:56:13,370
three years of time which is just
fascinating talk about how does one make

2938
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:13,380
fascinating talk about how does one make
 

2939
00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:15,559
fascinating talk about how does one make

learning give advice for people we just

2942
00:56:18,919 --> 00:56:18,929
learning give advice for people we just
 

2943
00:56:18,929 --> 00:56:20,509
learning give advice for people we just
talked about sort of the beginning early

2944
00:56:20,509 --> 00:56:20,519
talked about sort of the beginning early
 

2945
00:56:20,519 --> 00:56:22,729
talked about sort of the beginning early
steps but if you want to make it a

2946
00:56:22,729 --> 00:56:22,739
steps but if you want to make it a
 

2947
00:56:22,739 --> 00:56:24,919
steps but if you want to make it a
entire life's journey or at least a

2948
00:56:24,919 --> 00:56:24,929
entire life's journey or at least a
 

2949
00:56:24,929 --> 00:56:27,439
entire life's journey or at least a
journey of a decade or two how did it

2950
00:56:27,439 --> 00:56:27,449
journey of a decade or two how did it
 

2951
00:56:27,449 --> 00:56:29,839
journey of a decade or two how did it
how do you do it so most important thing

2952
00:56:29,839 --> 00:56:29,849
how do you do it so most important thing
 

2953
00:56:29,849 --> 00:56:32,779
how do you do it so most important thing
is to get started right and ever I think

2954
00:56:32,779 --> 00:56:32,789
is to get started right and ever I think
 

2955
00:56:32,789 --> 00:56:36,139
is to get started right and ever I think
in the early part of a career coursework

2956
00:56:36,139 --> 00:56:36,149
in the early part of a career coursework
 

2957
00:56:36,149 --> 00:56:38,979
in the early part of a career coursework
um like the divine specialization or

2958
00:56:38,979 --> 00:56:38,989
um like the divine specialization or
 

2959
00:56:38,989 --> 00:56:42,379
um like the divine specialization or
it's a very efficient way to master this

2960
00:56:42,379 --> 00:56:42,389
it's a very efficient way to master this
 

2961
00:56:42,389 --> 00:56:46,599
it's a very efficient way to master this

2985
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:12,250
some of my PhD students want to jump in
the research right away and actually

2986
00:57:12,250 --> 00:57:12,260
the research right away and actually
 

2987
00:57:12,260 --> 00:57:14,260
the research right away and actually

2997
00:57:20,930 --> 00:57:22,810

you'd be better off in the long term

2998
00:57:22,810 --> 00:57:22,820
you'd be better off in the long term
 

2999
00:57:22,820 --> 00:57:25,210
you'd be better off in the long term
um beyond a certain point there's

3000
00:57:25,210 --> 00:57:25,220
um beyond a certain point there's
 

3001
00:57:25,220 --> 00:57:27,760
um beyond a certain point there's
materials that doesn't exist in courses

3002
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:27,770
materials that doesn't exist in courses
 

3003
00:57:27,770 --> 00:57:29,080
materials that doesn't exist in courses
because it's too cutting edge the

3004
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:29,090
because it's too cutting edge the
 

3005
00:57:29,090 --> 00:57:30,550
because it's too cutting edge the
courses we created yeah there's some

3006
00:57:30,550 --> 00:57:30,560
courses we created yeah there's some
 

3007
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:32,470
courses we created yeah there's some
practical experience that we're not yet

3008
00:57:32,470 --> 00:57:32,480
practical experience that we're not yet
 

3009
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:34,240
practical experience that we're not yet
that good as teaching in a in a course

3010
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:34,250
that good as teaching in a in a course
 

3011
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:36,370
that good as teaching in a in a course
and I think after exhausting the

3012
00:57:36,370 --> 00:57:36,380
and I think after exhausting the
 

3013
00:57:36,380 --> 00:57:38,730
and I think after exhausting the
efficient course were then most people

3014
00:57:38,730 --> 00:57:38,740
efficient course were then most people
 

3015
00:57:38,740 --> 00:57:43,510
efficient course were then most people
need to go on to either ideally work on

3016
00:57:43,510 --> 00:57:43,520
need to go on to either ideally work on
 

3017
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:46,270
need to go on to either ideally work on
projects and then maybe also continue

3018
00:57:46,270 --> 00:57:46,280
projects and then maybe also continue
 

3019
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:48,940
projects and then maybe also continue
their learning by reading blog polls and

3020
00:57:48,940 --> 00:57:48,950
their learning by reading blog polls and
 

3021
00:57:48,950 --> 00:57:50,370
their learning by reading blog polls and
research papers and thing like that

3022
00:57:50,370 --> 00:57:50,380
research papers and thing like that
 

3023
00:57:50,380 --> 00:57:52,980
research papers and thing like that
doing practice is really important and

3024
00:57:52,980 --> 00:57:52,990
doing practice is really important and
 

3025
00:57:52,990 --> 00:57:56,320
doing practice is really important and
again I think is important to start

3026
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:56,330
again I think is important to start
 

3027
00:57:56,330 --> 00:57:58,660
again I think is important to start

the top academic University you just
 

3111
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:32,010
the top academic University you just
need a PhD to do that but if it goes to

PhD is a good experience but I would
 

3119
00:59:38,170 --> 00:59:40,440
PhD is a good experience but I would
look at the different options available

3120
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:40,450
look at the different options available
 

3121
00:59:40,450 --> 00:59:42,029
look at the different options available
to someone you know where the places

to go after this rich space of
 

3453
01:06:09,039 --> 01:06:11,609
to go after this rich space of
opportunities is a very important way to

3454
01:06:11,609 --> 01:06:11,619
opportunities is a very important way to
 

3455
01:06:11,619 --> 01:06:13,979
opportunities is a very important way to
very important mechanism to get these

3456
01:06:13,979 --> 01:06:13,989
very important mechanism to get these
 

3457
01:06:13,989 --> 01:06:15,689
very important mechanism to get these
projects done that I think will move the

3458
01:06:15,689 --> 01:06:15,699
projects done that I think will move the
 

3459
01:06:15,699 --> 01:06:17,879
projects done that I think will move the
world forward so of unfortunate that

3460
01:06:17,879 --> 01:06:17,889
world forward so of unfortunate that
 

3461
01:06:17,889 --> 01:06:19,649
world forward so of unfortunate that
don't the few teams that had a

3462
01:06:19,649 --> 01:06:19,659
don't the few teams that had a
 

3463
01:06:19,659 --> 01:06:22,709
don't the few teams that had a
meaningful positive impact and I felt

3464
01:06:22,709 --> 01:06:22,719
meaningful positive impact and I felt
 

3465
01:06:22,719 --> 01:06:25,319
meaningful positive impact and I felt
that we might present do this in the

3466
01:06:25,319 --> 01:06:25,329
that we might present do this in the
 

3467
01:06:25,329 --> 01:06:28,169
that we might present do this in the
most systematic repeatable way so a

3468
01:06:28,169 --> 01:06:28,179
most systematic repeatable way so a
 

3469
01:06:28,179 --> 01:06:30,569
most systematic repeatable way so a
start-up studio is a relatively new

3470
01:06:30,569 --> 01:06:30,579
start-up studio is a relatively new
 

3471
01:06:30,579 --> 01:06:32,969
start-up studio is a relatively new
concept there there are maybe dozens of

3472
01:06:32,969 --> 01:06:32,979
concept there there are maybe dozens of
 

3473
01:06:32,979 --> 01:06:36,409
concept there there are maybe dozens of
startup studios you're right now but I

3474
01:06:36,409 --> 01:06:36,419
startup studios you're right now but I
 

3475
01:06:36,419 --> 01:06:39,719
startup studios you're right now but I
feel like all of us many teams are still

3476
01:06:39,719 --> 01:06:39,729
feel like all of us many teams are still
 

3477
01:06:39,729 --> 01:06:41,370
feel like all of us many teams are still
trying to figure out how do you

3478
01:06:41,370 --> 01:06:41,380
trying to figure out how do you
 

3479
01:06:41,380 --> 01:06:43,979
trying to figure out how do you
systematically build companies with a

3480
01:06:43,979 --> 01:06:43,989
systematically build companies with a
 

3481
01:06:43,989 --> 01:06:47,249
systematically build companies with a
high success rate so I think even though

3482
01:06:47,249 --> 01:06:47,259
high success rate so I think even though
 

3483
01:06:47,259 --> 01:06:49,259
high success rate so I think even though
my you know venture capital friends are

3484
01:06:49,259 --> 01:06:49,269
my you know venture capital friends are
 

3485
01:06:49,269 --> 01:06:51,299
my you know venture capital friends are
seem to be more and more building

3486
01:06:51,299 --> 01:06:51,309
seem to be more and more building
 

3487
01:06:51,309 --> 01:06:52,529
seem to be more and more building
companies rather than investing

3488
01:06:52,529 --> 01:06:52,539
companies rather than investing
 

3489
01:06:52,539 --> 01:06:54,449
companies rather than investing
companies but I find a fascinating thing

3490
01:06:54,449 --> 01:06:54,459
companies but I find a fascinating thing
 

3491
01:06:54,459 --> 01:06:56,789
companies but I find a fascinating thing
to do to figure out the mechanisms by

3492
01:06:56,789 --> 01:06:56,799
to do to figure out the mechanisms by
 

3493
01:06:56,799 --> 01:06:58,620
to do to figure out the mechanisms by
which we could systematically build

3494
01:06:58,620 --> 01:06:58,630
which we could systematically build
 

3495
01:06:58,630 --> 01:07:00,509
which we could systematically build
successful teams successful businesses

3496
01:07:00,509 --> 01:07:00,519
successful teams successful businesses
 

3497
01:07:00,519 --> 01:07:03,569
successful teams successful businesses
in in areas that we find meaningful so

3498
01:07:03,569 --> 01:07:03,579
in in areas that we find meaningful so
 

3499
01:07:03,579 --> 01:07:06,209
in in areas that we find meaningful so
startup studio is something is is a

3500
01:07:06,209 --> 01:07:06,219
startup studio is something is is a
 

3501
01:07:06,219 --> 01:07:09,479
startup studio is something is is a
place and a mechanism for startups to go

3502
01:07:09,479 --> 01:07:09,489
place and a mechanism for startups to go
 

3503
01:07:09,489 --> 01:07:12,419
place and a mechanism for startups to go
from zero to success so try to develop a

3504
01:07:12,419 --> 01:07:12,429
from zero to success so try to develop a
 

3505
01:07:12,429 --> 01:07:14,759
from zero to success so try to develop a
blueprint it's actually a place for us

3506
01:07:14,759 --> 01:07:14,769
blueprint it's actually a place for us
 

3507
01:07:14,769 --> 01:07:16,829
blueprint it's actually a place for us
to build startups from scratch so we

3508
01:07:16,829 --> 01:07:16,839
to build startups from scratch so we
 

3509
01:07:16,839 --> 01:07:20,759
to build startups from scratch so we
often bring in found this and work with

3510
01:07:20,759 --> 01:07:20,769
often bring in found this and work with
 

3511
01:07:20,769 --> 01:07:23,339
often bring in found this and work with
them or maybe even have existing ideas

3512
01:07:23,339 --> 01:07:23,349
them or maybe even have existing ideas
 

3513
01:07:23,349 --> 01:07:26,879
them or maybe even have existing ideas
that we match founders with and then

3514
01:07:26,879 --> 01:07:26,889
that we match founders with and then
 

3515
01:07:26,889 --> 01:07:29,909
that we match founders with and then
this launches yo hopefully into

3516
01:07:29,909 --> 01:07:29,919
this launches yo hopefully into
 

3517
01:07:29,919 --> 01:07:31,709
this launches yo hopefully into
successful companies so how close are

3518
01:07:31,709 --> 01:07:31,719
successful companies so how close are
 

3519
01:07:31,719 --> 01:07:35,219
successful companies so how close are
you to figuring out a way to automate

3520
01:07:35,219 --> 01:07:35,229
you to figuring out a way to automate
 

3521
01:07:35,229 --> 01:07:38,489
you to figuring out a way to automate
the process of starting from scratch and

3522
01:07:38,489 --> 01:07:38,499
the process of starting from scratch and
 

3523
01:07:38,499 --> 01:07:41,069
the process of starting from scratch and
building successful AI startup yeah I

3524
01:07:41,069 --> 01:07:41,079
building successful AI startup yeah I
 

3525
01:07:41,079 --> 01:07:43,620
building successful AI startup yeah I
think we've we've been constantly

3526
01:07:43,620 --> 01:07:43,630
think we've we've been constantly
 

3527
01:07:43,630 --> 01:07:46,169
think we've we've been constantly
improving and iterating on our processes

3528
01:07:46,169 --> 01:07:46,179
improving and iterating on our processes
 

3529
01:07:46,179 --> 01:07:49,379
improving and iterating on our processes
but how we do that so things like you

3530
01:07:49,379 --> 01:07:49,389
but how we do that so things like you
 

3531
01:07:49,389 --> 01:07:50,969
but how we do that so things like you
know how many customer calls do we need

3532
01:07:50,969 --> 01:07:50,979
know how many customer calls do we need
 

3533
01:07:50,979 --> 01:07:52,169
know how many customer calls do we need
to make and all they get customer

3534
01:07:52,169 --> 01:07:52,179
to make and all they get customer
 

3535
01:07:52,179 --> 01:07:54,149
to make and all they get customer
validation how do we make sure this

3536
01:07:54,149 --> 01:07:54,159
validation how do we make sure this
 

3537
01:07:54,159 --> 01:07:55,229
validation how do we make sure this
technology can be built

3538
01:07:55,229 --> 01:07:55,239
technology can be built
 

3539
01:07:55,239 --> 01:07:56,870
technology can be built
well all of our businesses need

3540
01:07:56,870 --> 01:07:56,880
well all of our businesses need
 

3541
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:59,009
well all of our businesses need
cutting-edge machine learning algorithms

3542
01:07:59,009 --> 01:07:59,019
cutting-edge machine learning algorithms
 

3543
01:07:59,019 --> 01:08:00,629
cutting-edge machine learning algorithms
so you know kind of Alrosa develop in

3544
01:08:00,629 --> 01:08:00,639
so you know kind of Alrosa develop in
 

3545
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:03,329
so you know kind of Alrosa develop in
the last one or two years and even if it

3546
01:08:03,329 --> 01:08:03,339
the last one or two years and even if it
 

3547
01:08:03,339 --> 01:08:05,459
the last one or two years and even if it
works in a research paper it turns out

3548
01:08:05,459 --> 01:08:05,469
works in a research paper it turns out
 

3549
01:08:05,469 --> 01:08:07,019
works in a research paper it turns out
taking the production it's really hard a

3550
01:08:07,019 --> 01:08:07,029
taking the production it's really hard a
 

3551
01:08:07,029 --> 01:08:09,059
taking the production it's really hard a
lot of issues for making these things

3552
01:08:09,059 --> 01:08:09,069
lot of issues for making these things
 

3553
01:08:09,069 --> 01:08:12,299
lot of issues for making these things
work in the real life didn't know why

3554
01:08:12,299 --> 01:08:12,309
work in the real life didn't know why
 

3555
01:08:12,309 --> 01:08:14,699
work in the real life didn't know why
the actress in academia so how do you

3556
01:08:14,699 --> 01:08:14,709
the actress in academia so how do you
 

3557
01:08:14,709 --> 01:08:15,450
the actress in academia so how do you
validate

3558
01:08:15,450 --> 01:08:15,460
validate
 

3559
01:08:15,460 --> 01:08:17,730
validate
is actually doable how do you build a

3560
01:08:17,730 --> 01:08:17,740
is actually doable how do you build a
 

3561
01:08:17,740 --> 01:08:19,590
is actually doable how do you build a
team get the specialize domain knowledge

whatever staffing are focusing on so I

3566
01:08:23,280 --> 01:08:23,290
whatever staffing are focusing on so I
 

3567
01:08:23,290 --> 01:08:24,720
whatever staffing are focusing on so I
think we're actually getting we've been

3568
01:08:24,720 --> 01:08:24,730
think we're actually getting we've been
 

3569
01:08:24,730 --> 01:08:28,080
think we're actually getting we've been
getting much better at giving the

3570
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:28,090
getting much better at giving the
 

3571
01:08:28,090 --> 01:08:30,840
getting much better at giving the
entrepreneurs a high success rate but I

3572
01:08:30,840 --> 01:08:30,850
entrepreneurs a high success rate but I
 

3573
01:08:30,850 --> 01:08:32,670
entrepreneurs a high success rate but I
think we're still I think the whole

3574
01:08:32,670 --> 01:08:32,680
think we're still I think the whole
 

3575
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:34,380
think we're still I think the whole
world is still in the early phases

3576
01:08:34,380 --> 01:08:34,390
world is still in the early phases
 

3577
01:08:34,390 --> 01:08:36,600
world is still in the early phases
freaking us out but do you think there

3578
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:36,610
freaking us out but do you think there
 

3579
01:08:36,610 --> 01:08:39,270
freaking us out but do you think there
is some aspects of that process the

3580
01:08:39,270 --> 01:08:39,280
is some aspects of that process the
 

3581
01:08:39,280 --> 01:08:41,430
is some aspects of that process the
transferable from one startup to another

3582
01:08:41,430 --> 01:08:41,440
transferable from one startup to another
 

3583
01:08:41,440 --> 01:08:44,120
transferable from one startup to another
to another to another yeah very much so

did well on the test set um and I think
 

4045
01:17:34,999 --> 01:17:38,560
did well on the test set um and I think
there is a gulf between what it takes to

so how do you actually get this to work

4082
01:18:18,009 --> 01:18:18,019
so how do you actually get this to work
 

4083
01:18:18,019 --> 01:18:19,660
so how do you actually get this to work
because your test set distribution is

4084
01:18:19,660 --> 01:18:19,670
because your test set distribution is
 

4085
01:18:19,670 --> 01:18:24,069
because your test set distribution is
going to change and I think um also if

4086
01:18:24,069 --> 01:18:24,079
going to change and I think um also if
 

4087
01:18:24,079 --> 01:18:25,719
going to change and I think um also if
you look at the number of lines of code

4088
01:18:25,719 --> 01:18:25,729
you look at the number of lines of code
 

4089
01:18:25,729 --> 01:18:27,609
you look at the number of lines of code
in a software system the machine

4090
01:18:27,609 --> 01:18:27,619
in a software system the machine
 

4091
01:18:27,619 --> 01:18:29,949
in a software system the machine
learning model it's maybe five percent

4092
01:18:29,949 --> 01:18:29,959
learning model it's maybe five percent
 

4093
01:18:29,959 --> 01:18:33,520
learning model it's maybe five percent
or even fewer relative to the entire

4094
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:33,530
or even fewer relative to the entire
 

4095
01:18:33,530 --> 01:18:36,129
or even fewer relative to the entire
software system we need to build so how

4096
01:18:36,129 --> 01:18:36,139
software system we need to build so how
 

4097
01:18:36,139 --> 01:18:37,569
software system we need to build so how
to get all that work done and make it

4098
01:18:37,569 --> 01:18:37,579
to get all that work done and make it
 

4099
01:18:37,579 --> 01:18:39,729
to get all that work done and make it
reliable and systematic a good software

4100
01:18:39,729 --> 01:18:39,739
reliable and systematic a good software
 

4101
01:18:39,739 --> 01:18:42,879
reliable and systematic a good software
engineering work is fundamental here to

4102
01:18:42,879 --> 01:18:42,889
engineering work is fundamental here to
 

4103
01:18:42,889 --> 01:18:45,189

01:18:45,189 --> 01:18:45,199
building a successful small machine
 

4105
01:18:45,199 --> 01:18:47,709
building a successful small machine
learning system yes and and and the

4106
01:18:47,709 --> 01:18:47,719
learning system yes and and and the
 

4107
01:18:47,719 --> 01:18:49,270

people's work clothes so machine

4110
01:18:51,699 --> 01:18:51,709
people's work clothes so machine

learning is automation on steroids

4112
01:18:53,859 --> 01:18:53,869
learning is automation on steroids
 

4113
01:18:53,869 --> 01:18:56,410
learning is automation on steroids
if we take one task all the many tasks

4114
01:18:56,410 --> 01:18:56,420
if we take one task all the many tasks
 

4115
01:18:56,420 --> 01:18:57,819
if we take one task all the many tasks
that done in factories so in factory

4116
01:18:57,819 --> 01:18:57,829
that done in factories so in factory
 

4117
01:18:57,829 --> 01:18:59,830
that done in factories so in factory
does lots of things one tosses visual

4118
01:18:59,830 --> 01:18:59,840
does lots of things one tosses visual
 

4119
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:02,439
does lots of things one tosses visual
inspection if we automate that one task

4120
01:19:02,439 --> 01:19:02,449
inspection if we automate that one task
 

4121
01:19:02,449 --> 01:19:04,419
inspection if we automate that one task
it can be really valuable but you may

4122
01:19:04,419 --> 01:19:04,429
it can be really valuable but you may
 

4123
01:19:04,429 --> 01:19:06,129
it can be really valuable but you may
need to redesign a lot of other tasks

4124
01:19:06,129 --> 01:19:06,139
need to redesign a lot of other tasks
 

4125
01:19:06,139 --> 01:19:08,859
need to redesign a lot of other tasks
around that one task for example say the

4126
01:19:08,859 --> 01:19:08,869
around that one task for example say the
 

4127
01:19:08,869 --> 01:19:10,299
around that one task for example say the
machine learning algorithm says this is

4128
01:19:10,299 --> 01:19:10,309
machine learning algorithm says this is
 

4129
01:19:10,309 --> 01:19:12,069
machine learning algorithm says this is
defective what is supposed to do is you

4130
01:19:12,069 --> 01:19:12,079
defective what is supposed to do is you
 

4131
01:19:12,079 --> 01:19:13,930
defective what is supposed to do is you
throw the way to get a human to double

4132
01:19:13,930 --> 01:19:13,940
throw the way to get a human to double
 

4133
01:19:13,940 --> 01:19:16,180
throw the way to get a human to double
check do you want to rework it or fix it

4134
01:19:16,180 --> 01:19:16,190
check do you want to rework it or fix it
 

4135
01:19:16,190 --> 01:19:18,459
check do you want to rework it or fix it
so you need to redesign a lot of toss

4136
01:19:18,459 --> 01:19:18,469
so you need to redesign a lot of toss
 

4137
01:19:18,469 --> 01:19:20,500
so you need to redesign a lot of toss
around that thing you've now automated

4138
01:19:20,500 --> 01:19:20,510
around that thing you've now automated
 

4139
01:19:20,510 --> 01:19:21,160
around that thing you've now automated
so

4140
01:19:21,160 --> 01:19:21,170
so
 

4141
01:19:21,170 --> 01:19:23,290
so
planning for the change management and

4142
01:19:23,290 --> 01:19:23,300
planning for the change management and
 

4143
01:19:23,300 --> 01:19:25,480
planning for the change management and

4144
01:19:25,480 --> 01:19:25,490
making sure that the software he write
 

4145
01:19:25,490 --> 01:19:27,340
making sure that the software he write
is consistent with the new work though

4146
01:19:27,340 --> 01:19:27,350
is consistent with the new work though
 

4147
01:19:27,350 --> 01:19:28,600
is consistent with the new work though
and you take the time to explain to

4148
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:28,610
and you take the time to explain to

01:19:28,610 --> 01:19:31,540
and you take the time to explain to
people when he so happens I think what

01:19:31,540 --> 01:19:31,550
people when he so happens I think what
 

4151
01:19:31,550 --> 01:19:35,710

we learned by making mistakes and you

4154
01:19:37,570 --> 01:19:37,580
we learned by making mistakes and you

what would become good at is working

4158
01:19:42,970 --> 01:19:42,980
what would become good at is working
 

4159
01:19:42,980 --> 01:19:44,650
what would become good at is working
with our partners to think through all

01:19:47,110 --> 01:19:47,120
the things beyond just the machine
 

4163
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:48,820

so how do you deal with the maintenance

4198
01:20:25,900 --> 01:20:25,910
so how do you deal with the maintenance
 

4199
01:20:25,910 --> 01:20:28,480
so how do you deal with the maintenance

interested in having big positive impact
 

4223
01:20:53,840 --> 01:20:56,530
interested in having big positive impact
in the world so let me ask the two are

4224
01:20:56,530 --> 01:20:56,540
in the world so let me ask the two are
 

4225
01:20:56,540 --> 01:20:58,330
in the world so let me ask the two are
not inconsistent no they're all together
