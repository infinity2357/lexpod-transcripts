because you can count by two two times
 

133
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:37,900
because you can count by two two times
or three times and so you have this

134
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:37,910
or three times and so you have this
 

135
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:40,360
or three times and so you have this

little bit of choice in that so there's

144
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:49,550
little bit of choice in that so there's
 

145
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:50,979

of what physical laws you're trying to
or what physical phenomena you're trying

164
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:12,410
or what physical phenomena you're trying
 

165
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:14,380
or what physical phenomena you're trying
to describe with math and I wonder if

166
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:14,390
to describe with math and I wonder if
 

167
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:16,060
to describe with math and I wonder if
the little glimpses that we have of what

168
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:16,070
the little glimpses that we have of what
 

169
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,830
the little glimpses that we have of what
choices you can make along the way based

170
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:17,840
choices you can make along the way based
 

171
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,360
choices you can make along the way based
on what different mathematicians have

172
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:19,370
on what different mathematicians have
 

173
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:20,890
on what different mathematicians have
brought to the table is just scratching

174
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:20,900
brought to the table is just scratching
 

175
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,600
brought to the table is just scratching
the surface surface of what the

176
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:22,610
the surface surface of what the
 

177
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:24,940
the surface surface of what the
different possibilities are if you have

178
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:24,950
different possibilities are if you have
 

179
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:26,800
different possibilities are if you have
a completely different mode of thought

180
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:26,810
a completely different mode of thought
 

181
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:28,690
a completely different mode of thought
right or a mode of interacting with the

182
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:28,700
right or a mode of interacting with the
 

183
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:31,509
right or a mode of interacting with the
universe and you think notation is the

184
00:03:31,509 --> 00:03:31,519
universe and you think notation is the
 

185
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:33,009
universe and you think notation is the
key part of the journey that we've taken

186
00:03:33,009 --> 00:03:33,019
key part of the journey that we've taken
 

187
00:03:33,019 --> 00:03:34,360
key part of the journey that we've taken
through math I think that's the most

188
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:34,370
through math I think that's the most
 

189
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:35,740
through math I think that's the most
salient part that you'd notice at first

190
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:35,750
salient part that you'd notice at first
 

191
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:38,289
salient part that you'd notice at first
I think the mode of thought is going to

192
00:03:38,289 --> 00:03:38,299
I think the mode of thought is going to
 

193
00:03:38,299 --> 00:03:39,430
I think the mode of thought is going to
influence things more than like the

194
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:39,440
influence things more than like the
 

195
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,080
influence things more than like the
notation itself but notation actually

196
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:41,090
notation itself but notation actually
 

197
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:43,150
notation itself but notation actually
carries a lot of weight when it comes to

198
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:43,160
carries a lot of weight when it comes to
 

199
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,220
carries a lot of weight when it comes to
how we think about things more so than

200
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:45,230
how we think about things more so than
 

201
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:47,620
how we think about things more so than
we usually give it credit for I would I

202
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:47,630
we usually give it credit for I would I
 

203
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:49,690
we usually give it credit for I would I
would be comfortable saying give a favor

204
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:49,700
would be comfortable saying give a favor
 

205
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:52,000
would be comfortable saying give a favor
or least favorite piece of notation in

206
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,010
or least favorite piece of notation in
 

207
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:53,770
or least favorite piece of notation in
terms of its effectiveness yes yeah well

208
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:53,780
terms of its effectiveness yes yeah well
 

209
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:55,330
terms of its effectiveness yes yeah well
so at least favorite one that I've been

210
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:55,340
so at least favorite one that I've been
 

211
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:57,160
so at least favorite one that I've been
thinking a lot about that will be a

212
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:57,170
thinking a lot about that will be a
 

213
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:58,949
thinking a lot about that will be a
video I don't know when but we'll see

214
00:03:58,949 --> 00:03:58,959
video I don't know when but we'll see
 

215
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:01,750
video I don't know when but we'll see
the number e we write the function e to

216
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:01,760
the number e we write the function e to
 

217
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,699
the number e we write the function e to
the X this general exponential function

218
00:04:03,699 --> 00:04:03,709
the X this general exponential function
 

219
00:04:03,709 --> 00:04:06,670
the X this general exponential function
with a notation e to the X that implies

00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:06,680
with a notation e to the X that implies
 

221
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,599
with a notation e to the X that implies
you should think about a particular

222
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:07,609
you should think about a particular
 

223
00:04:07,609 --> 00:04:09,510
you should think about a particular
number this constant of nature

224
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:09,520
number this constant of nature
 

225
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,550
number this constant of nature
you repeatedly multiply it by itself and

226
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:11,560
you repeatedly multiply it by itself and
 

227
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,530
you repeatedly multiply it by itself and
then you say well what's e to the square

228
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:13,540
then you say well what's e to the square
 

229
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:14,580
then you say well what's e to the square
root of two and you're like oh well

230
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:14,590
root of two and you're like oh well
 

231
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:16,410
root of two and you're like oh well
we've extended the idea of repeated

232
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:16,420
we've extended the idea of repeated
 

233
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:17,520
we've extended the idea of repeated
multiplication that's and that's all

234
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:17,530
multiplication that's and that's all
 

235
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:19,910
multiplication that's and that's all
nice that's all nice and well but very

236
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:19,920
nice that's all nice and well but very
 

237
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,930
nice that's all nice and well but very
famously you have like e to the PI

238
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:21,940
famously you have like e to the PI
 

239
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:24,090
famously you have like e to the PI
you're like well we're extending the

240
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:24,100
you're like well we're extending the
 

241
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,770
you're like well we're extending the
idea of repeated multiplication into the

242
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:25,780
idea of repeated multiplication into the
 

243
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:27,780
idea of repeated multiplication into the
complex numbers yeah you can think about

244
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:27,790
complex numbers yeah you can think about
 

245
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:30,510
complex numbers yeah you can think about
it that way in reality I think that it's

246
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:30,520
it that way in reality I think that it's
 

247
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,600
it that way in reality I think that it's
just the wrong way of notationally

248
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:33,610
just the wrong way of notationally
 

249
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:34,800
just the wrong way of notationally
representing this function the

250
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:34,810
representing this function the
 

251
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:37,170
representing this function the
exponential function which itself could

252
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:37,180
exponential function which itself could
 

253
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:38,430
exponential function which itself could
be represented a number of different

254
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:38,440
be represented a number of different
 

255
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,870
be represented a number of different
ways you can think about it in terms of

256
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:39,880
ways you can think about it in terms of
 

257
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,790
ways you can think about it in terms of
the problem it solves a certain very

258
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:41,800
the problem it solves a certain very
 

259
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,680
the problem it solves a certain very
simple differential equation which often

260
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:43,690
simple differential equation which often
 

261
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:46,080
simple differential equation which often
yields way more insight than trying to

262
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:46,090
yields way more insight than trying to
 

263
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:47,640
yields way more insight than trying to
twist to the idea of repeated

264
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:47,650
twist to the idea of repeated
 

265
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:49,890
twist to the idea of repeated
multiplication like take its arm and put

266
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:49,900
multiplication like take its arm and put
 

267
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,270
multiplication like take its arm and put
it behind its back and throw it on the

268
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:51,280
it behind its back and throw it on the
 

269
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,530
it behind its back and throw it on the
desk and be like you will apply to

270
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:52,540
desk and be like you will apply to
 

271
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,810
desk and be like you will apply to
complex numbers right that's not I don't

272
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:54,820
complex numbers right that's not I don't
 

273
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:56,510
complex numbers right that's not I don't
think that's pedagogically helpful and

274
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:56,520
think that's pedagogically helpful and
 

275
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,830
think that's pedagogically helpful and
so the repeater multiplication is

276
00:04:58,830 --> 00:04:58,840
so the repeater multiplication is
 

277
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,480
so the repeater multiplication is
actually missing the main point the

278
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:00,490
actually missing the main point the
 

279
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:03,720
actually missing the main point the
power of e to the S I mean what it

280
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:03,730
power of e to the S I mean what it
 

281
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:05,850
power of e to the S I mean what it
addresses is things where the rate at

282
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:05,860
addresses is things where the rate at
 

283
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:09,090
addresses is things where the rate at
which something changes depends on its

284
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:09,100
which something changes depends on its
 

285
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,920
which something changes depends on its
own value but more specifically it

286
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:10,930
own value but more specifically it
 

287
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:13,680
own value but more specifically it
depends on it linearly so for example if

288
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:13,690
depends on it linearly so for example if
 

289
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:15,120
depends on it linearly so for example if
you have like a population that's

290
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:15,130
you have like a population that's
 

291
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:16,380
you have like a population that's
growing and the rate at which it grows

292
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:16,390
growing and the rate at which it grows
 

293
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:17,910
growing and the rate at which it grows
depends on how many members of the

294
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:17,920
depends on how many members of the
 

295
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,500
depends on how many members of the
population are already there it looks

296
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:19,510
population are already there it looks
 

297
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:21,300
population are already there it looks
like this nice exponential curve it

298
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:21,310
like this nice exponential curve it
 

299
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:22,560
like this nice exponential curve it
makes sense to talk about repeated

300
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:22,570
makes sense to talk about repeated
 

301
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:24,300
makes sense to talk about repeated
multiplication because you say how much

302
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:24,310
multiplication because you say how much
 

303
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:25,500
multiplication because you say how much
is there after one year two years three

304
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:25,510
is there after one year two years three
 

305
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:26,730
is there after one year two years three
years you're multiplying by something

306
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:26,740
years you're multiplying by something
 

307
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:28,500
years you're multiplying by something
the relationship can be a little bit

308
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:28,510
the relationship can be a little bit
 

309
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:29,880
the relationship can be a little bit
different sometimes where let's say

310
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:29,890
different sometimes where let's say
 

311
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:34,080
different sometimes where let's say
you've got a ball on a string like a

312
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:34,090
you've got a ball on a string like a
 

313
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:36,450
you've got a ball on a string like a
like a game of tetherball going around a

314
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:36,460
like a game of tetherball going around a
 

315
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:39,660
like a game of tetherball going around a
rope right and you say it's velocity is

316
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:39,670
rope right and you say it's velocity is
 

317
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:41,330
rope right and you say it's velocity is
always perpendicular to its position

318
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:41,340
always perpendicular to its position

00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:30,220
rotation comes about because they both
 

481
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:32,069
rotation comes about because they both
come from pretty similar equations and

482
00:08:32,069 --> 00:08:32,079
come from pretty similar equations and
 

483
00:08:32,079 --> 00:08:33,839
come from pretty similar equations and
so what we see is the e and the pi

484
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:33,849
so what we see is the e and the pi
 

485
00:08:33,849 --> 00:08:35,980
so what we see is the e and the pi
juxtaposed

486
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:35,990
juxtaposed
 

487
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:38,230
juxtaposed
a little bit closer than they would be

488
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:38,240
a little bit closer than they would be
 

489
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,149
a little bit closer than they would be
with a purely natural representation I

490
00:08:40,149 --> 00:08:40,159
with a purely natural representation I
 

491
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:40,810
with a purely natural representation I
would think

492
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:40,820
would think
 

493
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,459
would think
here's how I would describe the relation

494
00:08:42,459 --> 00:08:42,469
here's how I would describe the relation
 

495
00:08:42,469 --> 00:08:43,839
here's how I would describe the relation
between the two you've got a very

496
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:43,849
between the two you've got a very
 

497
00:08:43,849 --> 00:08:45,250
between the two you've got a very
important function we might call X

498
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:45,260
important function we might call X
 

499
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,870
important function we might call X
that's like the exponential function

500
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:46,880
that's like the exponential function
 

501
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,019
that's like the exponential function
when you plug in one you get this nice

502
00:08:50,019 --> 00:08:50,029
when you plug in one you get this nice
 

503
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,519
when you plug in one you get this nice
constant called EE that shows up in like

504
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:51,529
constant called EE that shows up in like
 

505
00:08:51,529 --> 00:08:53,800
constant called EE that shows up in like
probability and calculus if you try to

506
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:53,810
probability and calculus if you try to
 

507
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:55,449
probability and calculus if you try to
move in the imaginary direction it's

508
00:08:55,449 --> 00:08:55,459
move in the imaginary direction it's
 

509
00:08:55,459 --> 00:08:58,690
move in the imaginary direction it's
periodic and the period is tau so those

510
00:08:58,690 --> 00:08:58,700
periodic and the period is tau so those
 

511
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,130
periodic and the period is tau so those
are these two constants associated with

512
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:00,140
are these two constants associated with
 

513
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:02,530
are these two constants associated with
this the same central function but for

514
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:02,540
this the same central function but for
 

515
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:04,930
this the same central function but for
kind of unrelated reasons right and not

516
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:04,940
kind of unrelated reasons right and not
 

517
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:07,240
kind of unrelated reasons right and not
unrelated but like orthogonal reasons

518
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:07,250
unrelated but like orthogonal reasons
 

519
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,560
unrelated but like orthogonal reasons
one of them is what happens when you're

520
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:08,570
one of them is what happens when you're
 

521
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:10,240
one of them is what happens when you're
moving in the real direction one's what

522
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:10,250
moving in the real direction one's what
 

523
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:11,620
moving in the real direction one's what
happens when you move in the imaginary

524
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:11,630
happens when you move in the imaginary
 

525
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:13,480
happens when you move in the imaginary
direction and like yeah those are

526
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:13,490
direction and like yeah those are
 

527
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:16,120
direction and like yeah those are
related they're not as related as the

528
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:16,130
related they're not as related as the
 

529
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:18,430
related they're not as related as the
famous equation seems to think it is

530
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:18,440
famous equation seems to think it is
 

531
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,930
famous equation seems to think it is
it's sort of putting all of the children

532
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:19,940
it's sort of putting all of the children
 

533
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:21,160
it's sort of putting all of the children
in one bed and they kind of like to

534
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:21,170
in one bed and they kind of like to
 

535
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:22,900
in one bed and they kind of like to
sleep in separate beds if they have the

536
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:22,910
sleep in separate beds if they have the
 

537
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:24,639
sleep in separate beds if they have the
choice but you see them all there and

538
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:24,649
choice but you see them all there and
 

539
00:09:24,649 --> 00:09:26,530
choice but you see them all there and
you know there is a family resemblance

540
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:26,540
you know there is a family resemblance
 

541
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:28,560
you know there is a family resemblance
but it's not that close

542
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:28,570
but it's not that close
 

543
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:31,660
but it's not that close
so actually think of it as a function is

544
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:31,670
so actually think of it as a function is
 

545
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:35,110
so actually think of it as a function is
uh this is the better idea and that's a

546
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:35,120
uh this is the better idea and that's a
 

547
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,780
uh this is the better idea and that's a
notational idea and yeah and like here's

548
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:37,790
notational idea and yeah and like here's
 

549
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:41,110
notational idea and yeah and like here's
the thing the constant e sort of stands

550
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:41,120
the thing the constant e sort of stands
 

551
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,610
the thing the constant e sort of stands
is this numerical representative of

552
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:42,620
is this numerical representative of
 

553
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:44,100
is this numerical representative of
calculus right yeah

554
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:44,110
calculus right yeah
 

555
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:46,570
calculus right yeah
calculus is the like study of change

556
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:46,580
calculus is the like study of change
 

557
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:48,550
calculus is the like study of change
mm-hmm so it's very at least there's a

558
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:48,560
mm-hmm so it's very at least there's a
 

559
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,320
mm-hmm so it's very at least there's a
little cognitive dissonance using a

560
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:50,330
little cognitive dissonance using a
 

561
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:52,720
little cognitive dissonance using a
constant to represent the science of

562
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:52,730
constant to represent the science of
 

563
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:54,280
constant to represent the science of
change never thought of it that way yeah

564
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:54,290
change never thought of it that way yeah
 

565
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:59,140
change never thought of it that way yeah
yeah it makes sense why the notation

566
00:09:59,140 --> 00:09:59,150
yeah it makes sense why the notation
 

567
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:00,730
yeah it makes sense why the notation
came about that way yes because this is

568
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:00,740
came about that way yes because this is
 

569
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:02,350
came about that way yes because this is
the first way that we saw it um in the

570
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:02,360
the first way that we saw it um in the
 

571
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,790
the first way that we saw it um in the
context of things like population growth

572
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:03,800
context of things like population growth
 

573
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,440
context of things like population growth
or compound interest it is nicer to

574
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:05,450
or compound interest it is nicer to
 

575
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:06,760
or compound interest it is nicer to
think about as repeated multiplication

576
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:06,770
think about as repeated multiplication
 

577
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:09,070
think about as repeated multiplication
that's definitely nicer but it's more

578
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:09,080
that's definitely nicer but it's more
 

579
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,079
that's definitely nicer but it's more
that that's the first application of

580
00:10:11,079 --> 00:10:11,089
that that's the first application of
 

581
00:10:11,089 --> 00:10:12,760
that that's the first application of
what turned out to be a much more

582
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:12,770
what turned out to be a much more
 

583
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:14,380
what turned out to be a much more
general function that maybe the

584
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:14,390
general function that maybe the
 

585
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:16,090
general function that maybe the
intelligent life your initial question

586
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:16,100
intelligent life your initial question
 

587
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:18,100
intelligent life your initial question
asked about would have come to recognize

588
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:18,110
asked about would have come to recognize
 

589
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:19,900
asked about would have come to recognize
as being much more significant than the

590
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:19,910
as being much more significant than the
 

591
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:22,090
as being much more significant than the
single use case which lends itself to

592
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:22,100
single use case which lends itself to
 

593
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:25,090
single use case which lends itself to
repeated multiplication notation but let

594
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:25,100
repeated multiplication notation but let
 

595
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:28,269
repeated multiplication notation but let
me jump back for a second to aliens and

596
00:10:28,269 --> 00:10:28,279
me jump back for a second to aliens and
 

597
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:32,440
me jump back for a second to aliens and
the nature of our universe okay do you

598
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:32,450
the nature of our universe okay do you
 

599
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:35,230
the nature of our universe okay do you
think math is discovered or invented so

600
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:35,240
think math is discovered or invented so
 

601
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,940
think math is discovered or invented so
we're talking about the different kind

602
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:36,950
we're talking about the different kind
 

603
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:38,440
we're talking about the different kind
of mathematics that could be developed

604
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:38,450
of mathematics that could be developed
 

605
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:41,199
of mathematics that could be developed
by the alien species the implied

606
00:10:41,199 --> 00:10:41,209
by the alien species the implied
 

607
00:10:41,209 --> 00:10:45,460
by the alien species the implied
question is is yeah it's math discovered

608
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:45,470
question is is yeah it's math discovered
 

609
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:48,250
question is is yeah it's math discovered
or invented is you know is fundamentally

610
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:48,260
or invented is you know is fundamentally
 

611
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:49,660
or invented is you know is fundamentally
everybody going to discover

612
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:49,670
everybody going to discover
 

613
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:53,230
everybody going to discover
the same principles of mathematics so

614
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:53,240
the same principles of mathematics so
 

615
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,460
the same principles of mathematics so
the way I think about it and everyone

616
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:54,470
the way I think about it and everyone
 

617
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:55,780
the way I think about it and everyone
thinks about it differently but here's

618
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:55,790
thinks about it differently but here's
 

619
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:56,320
thinks about it differently but here's
my take

620
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:56,330
my take
 

621
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:58,150
my take
I think there's a cycle at play where

622
00:10:58,150 --> 00:10:58,160
I think there's a cycle at play where
 

623
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,220
I think there's a cycle at play where
you discover things about the universe

624
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:00,230
you discover things about the universe
 

625
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:02,920
you discover things about the universe
that tell you what math will be useful

626
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:02,930
that tell you what math will be useful
 

627
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:07,510
that tell you what math will be useful
and that math itself is invented in a

628
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:07,520
and that math itself is invented in a
 

629
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,760
and that math itself is invented in a
sense but of all the possible maths that

630
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:09,770
sense but of all the possible maths that
 

631
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:12,130
sense but of all the possible maths that
you could have invented it's discoveries

632
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:12,140
you could have invented it's discoveries
 

633
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:13,600
you could have invented it's discoveries
about the world that tell you which ones

634
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:13,610
about the world that tell you which ones
 

635
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:16,120
about the world that tell you which ones
are so like a good example here is the

636
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:16,130
are so like a good example here is the
 

637
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:18,160
are so like a good example here is the
Pythagorean theorem when you look at

638
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:18,170
Pythagorean theorem when you look at
 

639
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:19,060
Pythagorean theorem when you look at
this do you think of that as a

640
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:19,070
this do you think of that as a
 

641
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:20,530
this do you think of that as a
definition or do you think of that as a

642
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:20,540
definition or do you think of that as a
 

643
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:22,810
definition or do you think of that as a
discovery from the historical

644
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:22,820
discovery from the historical
 

645
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,550
discovery from the historical
perspective right a discovery because

646
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:24,560
perspective right a discovery because
 

647
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,310
perspective right a discovery because
there were but that's probably because

648
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:27,320
there were but that's probably because
 

649
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,890
there were but that's probably because
they were using physical object to build

650
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:29,900
they were using physical object to build
 

651
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:33,370
they were using physical object to build
their intuition and from that intuition

652
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:33,380
their intuition and from that intuition
 

653
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:35,470
their intuition and from that intuition
came the mathematics so the mathematics

654
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:35,480
came the mathematics so the mathematics
 

655
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,810
came the mathematics so the mathematics
was some abstract world detached from

656
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:37,820
was some abstract world detached from
 

657
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:41,650
was some abstract world detached from
physics but I think more and more math

658
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:41,660
physics but I think more and more math
 

659
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:44,350
physics but I think more and more math
has become detached from you know we

660
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:44,360
has become detached from you know we
 

661
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,000
has become detached from you know we
when you even look at modern physics

662
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,010
when you even look at modern physics
 

663
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:49,090
when you even look at modern physics
from string theory so even general

664
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:49,100
from string theory so even general
 

665
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,950
from string theory so even general
relativity I mean all math behind the

00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:50,960
relativity I mean all math behind the
 

667
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:54,420
relativity I mean all math behind the
20th and 21st century physics kind of

668
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:54,430
20th and 21st century physics kind of
 

669
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:57,940
20th and 21st century physics kind of
takes a brisk walk outside of what our

670
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:57,950
takes a brisk walk outside of what our
 

671
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:59,950
takes a brisk walk outside of what our
mind can actually even comprehend

672
00:11:59,950 --> 00:11:59,960
mind can actually even comprehend
 

673
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,230

in multiple dimensions for example

674
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:02,240
in multiple dimensions for example
 

675
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,840
in multiple dimensions for example
anything beyond three dimensions maybe

676
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:04,850
anything beyond three dimensions maybe
 

677
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:07,390
anything beyond three dimensions maybe
four dimensions no higher dimensions can

678
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:07,400
four dimensions no higher dimensions can
 

679
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,070
four dimensions no higher dimensions can
be highly highly applicable I think this

680
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:09,080
be highly highly applicable I think this
 

681
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,740
be highly highly applicable I think this
is a common misinterpretation the if

682
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:11,750
is a common misinterpretation the if
 

683
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,690
is a common misinterpretation the if
you're asking questions about like a

684
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:13,700
you're asking questions about like a
 

685
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,610
you're asking questions about like a
five dimensional manifold that the only

686
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:15,620
five dimensional manifold that the only
 

687
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:16,870
five dimensional manifold that the only
way that that's connected to the

688
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:16,880
way that that's connected to the
 

689
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,850
way that that's connected to the
physical world is if the physical world

690
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:18,860
physical world is if the physical world
 

691
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:21,610
physical world is if the physical world
is itself a five dimensional manifold or

692
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:21,620
is itself a five dimensional manifold or

includes them wait wait wait a minute
 

695
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:26,320
includes them wait wait wait a minute
wait a minute you're telling me you can

696
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:26,330
wait a minute you're telling me you can
 

697
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:31,360
wait a minute you're telling me you can
imagine a five dimensional manifold no

698
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:31,370
imagine a five dimensional manifold no
 

699
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:33,430
imagine a five dimensional manifold no
no that's not what I said I I'm I would

700
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:33,440
no that's not what I said I I'm I would
 

701
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,110
no that's not what I said I I'm I would
make the claim that it is useful to a

702
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:35,120
make the claim that it is useful to a
 

703
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,540
make the claim that it is useful to a
three dimensional physical universe

704
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:36,550
three dimensional physical universe
 

705
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:38,500
three dimensional physical universe
despite itself not being three

706
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:38,510
despite itself not being three
 

707
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:40,300
despite itself not being three
dimensional so it's useful meaningful

708
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:40,310
dimensional so it's useful meaningful
 

709
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:41,890
dimensional so it's useful meaningful
even understand a three dimensional

710
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:41,900
even understand a three dimensional
 

711
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,960
even understand a three dimensional
world it would be useful to have five

712
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:43,970
world it would be useful to have five
 

713
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:45,550
world it would be useful to have five
dimensional manifolds yes absolutely

714
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:45,560
dimensional manifolds yes absolutely
 

715
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,440
dimensional manifolds yes absolutely
because of state spaces but you're

716
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:47,450
because of state spaces but you're
 

717
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:49,630
because of state spaces but you're
saying there in some in some deep way

718
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:49,640
saying there in some in some deep way
 

719
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:52,000
saying there in some in some deep way
for us humans it does it does always

720
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,010
for us humans it does it does always
 

721
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:52,960
for us humans it does it does always
come back to that three dimensional

722
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:52,970
come back to that three dimensional
 

723
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:55,750
come back to that three dimensional
world for the useful usefulness that the

724
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:55,760
world for the useful usefulness that the
 

725
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,120
world for the useful usefulness that the
dimensional world and therefore it

726
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:58,130
dimensional world and therefore it
 

727
00:12:58,130 --> 00:13:00,430
dimensional world and therefore it
starts with a discovery but then we

728
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:00,440
starts with a discovery but then we
 

729
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:03,130
starts with a discovery but then we
invent the mathematics that

730
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:03,140
invent the mathematics that
 

731
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:05,320
invent the mathematics that
helps us make sense of the discovery in

732
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:05,330
helps us make sense of the discovery in
 

733
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:07,930
helps us make sense of the discovery in
a sense yes I mean just to jump off of

734
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:07,940
a sense yes I mean just to jump off of
 

735
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:10,420
a sense yes I mean just to jump off of
the Pythagorean theorem it feels like a

00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:10,430
the Pythagorean theorem it feels like a
 

737
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:11,740
the Pythagorean theorem it feels like a
discovery you've got these beautiful

738
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:11,750
discovery you've got these beautiful
 

739
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,210
discovery you've got these beautiful
geometric proofs where you've got

740
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:13,220
geometric proofs where you've got
 

741
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,680
geometric proofs where you've got
squares and you're modifying there is it

742
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:14,690
squares and you're modifying there is it
 

743
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:17,259
squares and you're modifying there is it
feels like a discovery if you look at

744
00:13:17,259 --> 00:13:17,269
feels like a discovery if you look at
 

745
00:13:17,269 --> 00:13:19,630
feels like a discovery if you look at
how we formalize the idea of 2d space as

746
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:19,640
how we formalize the idea of 2d space as
 

747
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:22,449
how we formalize the idea of 2d space as
being r2 right all pairs of real numbers

748
00:13:22,449 --> 00:13:22,459
being r2 right all pairs of real numbers
 

749
00:13:22,459 --> 00:13:24,579
being r2 right all pairs of real numbers
and how we define a metric on it and

750
00:13:24,579 --> 00:13:24,589
and how we define a metric on it and
 

751
00:13:24,589 --> 00:13:26,620
and how we define a metric on it and
define distance okay hang on a second

752
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:26,630
define distance okay hang on a second
 

753
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:28,420
define distance okay hang on a second
we've defined distance so that the

754
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:28,430
we've defined distance so that the
 

755
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:30,460
we've defined distance so that the
Pythagorean theorem is true so then

756
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:30,470
Pythagorean theorem is true so then
 

757
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:32,530
Pythagorean theorem is true so then
suddenly it doesn't feel that great but

758
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:32,540
suddenly it doesn't feel that great but
 

759
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:34,000
suddenly it doesn't feel that great but
I think what's going on is the thing

760
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:34,010
I think what's going on is the thing
 

761
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:36,750
I think what's going on is the thing
that informed us what metric to put on

762
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:36,760
that informed us what metric to put on
 

763
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:40,180
that informed us what metric to put on
r2 to put on our abstract representation

764
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:40,190
r2 to put on our abstract representation
 

765
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:42,130
r2 to put on our abstract representation
of 2d space came from physical

766
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:42,140
of 2d space came from physical
 

767
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:43,840
of 2d space came from physical
observations and the thing is there's

768
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:43,850
observations and the thing is there's
 

769
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:45,310
observations and the thing is there's
other metrics you could have put on it

770
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:45,320
other metrics you could have put on it
 

771
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,500
other metrics you could have put on it
we could have consistent math with other

772
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:47,510
we could have consistent math with other
 

773
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:49,870
we could have consistent math with other
notions of distance it's just that those

774
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:49,880
notions of distance it's just that those
 

775
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,850
notions of distance it's just that those
pieces of math wouldn't be applicable to

776
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:51,860
pieces of math wouldn't be applicable to
 

777
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:53,740
pieces of math wouldn't be applicable to
the physical world that we study because

778
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:53,750
the physical world that we study because
 

779
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:54,730
the physical world that we study because
they're not the ones where the

780
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:54,740
they're not the ones where the
 

781
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:56,500
they're not the ones where the
Pythagorean theorem holds so we have a

782
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:56,510
Pythagorean theorem holds so we have a
 

783
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:58,600
Pythagorean theorem holds so we have a
discovery a genuine bona fide discovery

784
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:58,610
discovery a genuine bona fide discovery
 

785
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:00,519
discovery a genuine bona fide discovery
that informed the invention the

786
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:00,529
that informed the invention the
 

787
00:14:00,529 --> 00:14:02,769
that informed the invention the
invention of an abstract representation

788
00:14:02,769 --> 00:14:02,779
invention of an abstract representation
 

789
00:14:02,779 --> 00:14:05,050
invention of an abstract representation
of 2d space that we call r2 and things

of 2d space that we call r2 and things
 

791
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:07,569
of 2d space that we call r2 and things
like that and then from there you just

00:14:07,569 --> 00:14:07,579
like that and then from there you just
 

793
00:14:07,579 --> 00:14:09,819
like that and then from there you just
study r2 is an abstract thing that

study r2 is an abstract thing that
 

795
00:14:09,829 --> 00:14:11,590
study r2 is an abstract thing that
brings about more ideas and inventions

796
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:11,600
brings about more ideas and inventions
 

797
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,150
brings about more ideas and inventions

00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:21,230
feeds on itself that way that's how I
 

807
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:23,500
feeds on itself that way that's how I
think about it so it's not an either/or

808
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:23,510
think about it so it's not an either/or
 

809
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:25,420
think about it so it's not an either/or
it's not that math is one of these or

810
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:25,430
it's not that math is one of these or
 

811
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:27,100
it's not that math is one of these or
it's one of the others at different

it's one of the others at different
 

813
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:29,290
it's one of the others at different
times it's playing a different role so

814
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:29,300
times it's playing a different role so
 

815
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:32,139
times it's playing a different role so
then let me ask the the Richard Fineman

816
00:14:32,139 --> 00:14:32,149
then let me ask the the Richard Fineman
 

817
00:14:32,149 --> 00:14:36,460
then let me ask the the Richard Fineman
question then along that thread is what

818
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:36,470
question then along that thread is what
 

819
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:37,360
question then along that thread is what
do you think is a difference between

820
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:37,370
do you think is a difference between
 

821
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:42,210
do you think is a difference between
physics and math there's a giant overlap

822
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:42,220
physics and math there's a giant overlap
 

823
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:45,069
physics and math there's a giant overlap
there's a kind of intuition that

824
00:14:45,069 --> 00:14:45,079
there's a kind of intuition that
 

825
00:14:45,079 --> 00:14:47,079
there's a kind of intuition that
physicists have about the world that's

826
00:14:47,079 --> 00:14:47,089
physicists have about the world that's
 

827
00:14:47,089 --> 00:14:49,300
physicists have about the world that's
perhaps outside of mathematics it's this

828
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:49,310
perhaps outside of mathematics it's this
 

829
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:52,300
perhaps outside of mathematics it's this
mysterious art that they seem to possess

830
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:52,310
mysterious art that they seem to possess
 

831
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:54,519
mysterious art that they seem to possess
we humans generally possess and then

832
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:54,529
we humans generally possess and then
 

833
00:14:54,529 --> 00:14:56,980
we humans generally possess and then
there's the beautiful rigour of

00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:56,990
there's the beautiful rigour of
 

835
00:14:56,990 --> 00:15:00,040
there's the beautiful rigour of
mathematics that allows you to I mean

836
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:00,050
mathematics that allows you to I mean
 

837
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:02,370
mathematics that allows you to I mean
just like what as we were saying

838
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:02,380
just like what as we were saying
 

839
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:07,630

invent frameworks of understanding our
 

841
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,100
invent frameworks of understanding our
physical world so what do you think is

842
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:09,110
physical world so what do you think is
 

843
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:11,290
physical world so what do you think is
the difference there and how big is it

844
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:11,300
the difference there and how big is it
 

845
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,329
the difference there and how big is it
well I think of math as being the study

846
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:13,339
well I think of math as being the study
 

847
00:15:13,339 --> 00:15:15,579
well I think of math as being the study
of like abstractions over patterns and

848
00:15:15,579 --> 00:15:15,589
of like abstractions over patterns and

grounded in a desire to understand the
 

855
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:22,829
grounded in a desire to understand the

in the actual world is much more

in the actual world is much more
 

1157
00:21:11,889 --> 00:21:14,460

complicated well but we can we can do

complicated well but we can we can do
 

1159
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:17,220
complicated well but we can we can do
pretty awesome things right like we can

1160
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:17,230
pretty awesome things right like we can
 

1161
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:20,310
pretty awesome things right like we can
fly spaceships and that we have to have

1162
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:20,320
fly spaceships and that we have to have
 

1163
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,139
fly spaceships and that we have to have
some connection of reality to be able to

1164
00:21:22,139 --> 00:21:22,149
some connection of reality to be able to
 

1165
00:21:22,149 --> 00:21:24,960
some connection of reality to be able to
take our potentially oversimplified

take our potentially oversimplified
 

1167
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:26,909
take our potentially oversimplified
models of the world but then actually

1168
00:21:26,909 --> 00:21:26,919
models of the world but then actually
 

1169
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:29,099
models of the world but then actually
twist the world to our will based on it

1170
00:21:29,099 --> 00:21:29,109
twist the world to our will based on it
 

1171
00:21:29,109 --> 00:21:30,570
twist the world to our will based on it
so we have certain reality checks that

1172
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:30,580
so we have certain reality checks that
 

1173
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:33,810
so we have certain reality checks that
like physics isn't too far afield simply

00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:33,820
like physics isn't too far afield simply
 

1175
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:35,820
like physics isn't too far afield simply
based on what we can do and the fact

1176
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:35,830
based on what we can do and the fact
 

1177
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:37,409
based on what we can do and the fact
that we can fly is pretty good it's

1178
00:21:37,409 --> 00:21:37,419
that we can fly is pretty good it's

00:21:37,419 --> 00:21:43,349
that we can fly is pretty good it's
great the laws were working with our are

working well so I mentioned to the

working well so I mentioned to the
 

1183
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:48,029
working well so I mentioned to the
internet that I'm talking to you and so

internet that I'm talking to you and so
 

1185
00:21:48,039 --> 00:21:50,340
internet that I'm talking to you and so
the internet gave some questions so I

1186
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:50,350
the internet gave some questions so I
 

1187
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:52,440
the internet gave some questions so I
apologize for these but do you think

1188
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:52,450
apologize for these but do you think
 

1189
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:54,330
apologize for these but do you think
we're living in a simulation

1190
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:54,340
we're living in a simulation
 

1191
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:57,690
we're living in a simulation
that the universe is a computer or the

that the universe is a computer or the
 

1193
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,280
that the universe is a computer or the
universe is the computation running a

buy is you know you'll have the argument

1198
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:05,650
buy is you know you'll have the argument
 

1199
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:07,830
buy is you know you'll have the argument
that well let's say that it was the case

1200
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:07,840
that well let's say that it was the case
 

1201
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,110
that well let's say that it was the case
that you can have simulations then the

1202
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:10,120
that you can have simulations then the
 

1203
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:13,140
that you can have simulations then the
simulated world would itself eventually

1204
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:13,150
simulated world would itself eventually
 

1205
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:14,280
simulated world would itself eventually
get to a point where it's running

1206
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:14,290
get to a point where it's running
 

1207
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:16,620
get to a point where it's running
simulations yes and then the the second

1208
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:16,630
simulations yes and then the the second
 

1209
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:18,000
simulations yes and then the the second
layer down would create a third layer

1210
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:18,010
layer down would create a third layer
 

1211
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:19,590
layer down would create a third layer
down and on and on and on so

1212
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:19,600
down and on and on and on so
 

1213
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,390
down and on and on and on so
probabilistically you just throw a dart

1214
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:21,400
probabilistically you just throw a dart
 

1215
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,980
probabilistically you just throw a dart
at one of those layers we're probably in

1216
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:22,990
at one of those layers we're probably in
 

1217
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:25,380
at one of those layers we're probably in
one of the simulated layers I think if

1218
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:25,390
one of the simulated layers I think if
 

1219
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:27,000
one of the simulated layers I think if
there's some sort of limitations

1220
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:27,010
there's some sort of limitations
 

1221
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:28,680
there's some sort of limitations
unlike the information processing of

unlike the information processing of

unlike the information processing of
whatever the physical world is like it

1224
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:31,660
whatever the physical world is like it
 

1225
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:33,450
whatever the physical world is like it
quickly becomes the case that you have a

1226
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:33,460
quickly becomes the case that you have a
 

1227
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:35,040
quickly becomes the case that you have a
limit to the layers that could exist

1228
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:35,050
limit to the layers that could exist
 

1229
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:37,530
limit to the layers that could exist
there because like the resources

1230
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:37,540
there because like the resources
 

1231
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:39,270

necessary to simulate a universe like

1232
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:39,280
necessary to simulate a universe like
 

1233
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,210
necessary to simulate a universe like
ours clearly is a lot just in terms of

ours clearly is a lot just in terms of
 

1235
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:44,520
ours clearly is a lot just in terms of
the number of bits at play and so then

1236
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:44,530
the number of bits at play and so then
 

1237
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:46,470
the number of bits at play and so then
you can ask well what's more plausible

1238
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:46,480
you can ask well what's more plausible
 

1239
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,230
you can ask well what's more plausible
that there's an unbounded capacity of

that there's an unbounded capacity of

00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,970
that there's an unbounded capacity of
information processing in whatever they

00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:50,980
information processing in whatever they
 

1243
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:53,700
information processing in whatever they
like highest up level universe is or

1244
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:53,710
like highest up level universe is or
 

1245
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:55,680
like highest up level universe is or
that there's some bound to that capacity

1246
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:55,690
that there's some bound to that capacity
 

1247
00:22:55,690 --> 00:22:57,330
that there's some bound to that capacity
which then limits like the number of

1248
00:22:57,330 --> 00:22:57,340
which then limits like the number of
 

1249
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:59,490
which then limits like the number of

kind of probability distribution on like

kind of probability distribution on like
 

1253
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:02,760
kind of probability distribution on like
what the information capacity is I have

1254
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:02,770
what the information capacity is I have
 

1255
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:06,090
what the information capacity is I have
no idea but I I don't mean like people

no idea but I I don't mean like people

it's a little bit like a Pascal's wager

1264
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:14,830
it's a little bit like a Pascal's wager
 

1265

00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:22,990
but it's also very difficult to
 

1273
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:25,500
but it's also very difficult to
contextualize the amount so the amount

1274
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:25,510
contextualize the amount so the amount
 

1275
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:28,590
contextualize the amount so the amount
of information processing power required

1276
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:28,600
of information processing power required
 

1277
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:32,240
of information processing power required
to simulate like our universe seems like

1278
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:32,250
to simulate like our universe seems like
 

1279
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:35,790
to simulate like our universe seems like
amazingly huge what you can always raise

1280
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:35,800
amazingly huge what you can always raise
 

1281
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:38,190
amazingly huge what you can always raise
two to the power of that exactly yeah

1282
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:38,200
two to the power of that exactly yeah
 

1283
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:41,160
two to the power of that exactly yeah
like numbers bit big and we're easily

1284
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:41,170
like numbers bit big and we're easily
 

1285
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:43,260
like numbers bit big and we're easily
humbled but basically everything around

1286
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:43,270
humbled but basically everything around
 

1287
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:47,280
humbled but basically everything around
us so it's very difficult to to kind of

1288
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:47,290
us so it's very difficult to to kind of
 

1289
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:49,800
us so it's very difficult to to kind of
make sense of anything actually when you

1290
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:49,810
make sense of anything actually when you
 

1291
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:51,690
make sense of anything actually when you
look up at the sky and look at the stars

1292
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:51,700
look up at the sky and look at the stars
 

1293
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:54,210
look up at the sky and look at the stars
in the immensity of it all to make sense

1294
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:54,220
in the immensity of it all to make sense
 

1295
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:57,120
in the immensity of it all to make sense
of us the smallness of us the

1296
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:57,130
of us the smallness of us the
 

1297
00:23:57,130 --> 00:23:59,100
of us the smallness of us the
unlikeliness of everything that's on

1298
00:23:59,100 --> 00:23:59,110
unlikeliness of everything that's on
 

1299
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:02,610
unlikeliness of everything that's on
this earth coming to be then you could

1300
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:02,620
this earth coming to be then you could
 

1301
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:05,940
this earth coming to be then you could
basically anything could be all laws of

1302
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:05,950
basically anything could be all laws of
 

1303
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:07,710
basically anything could be all laws of
probability go out the window

1304
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:07,720
probability go out the window
 

1305
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:13,350
probability go out the window
to me because I guess because the amount

1306
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:13,360
to me because I guess because the amount
 

1307
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,669
to me because I guess because the amount
of information under which we're

1308
00:24:14,669 --> 00:24:14,679
of information under which we're
 

1309
00:24:14,679 --> 00:24:18,889
of information under which we're
operating is very low we basically know

1310
00:24:18,889 --> 00:24:18,899
operating is very low we basically know
 

1311
00:24:18,899 --> 00:24:21,590
operating is very low we basically know
nothing about the world around us

1312
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:21,600
nothing about the world around us
 

1313
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,930
nothing about the world around us
relatively speaking and so so when I

1314
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:24,940
relatively speaking and so so when I
 

1315
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:26,639
relatively speaking and so so when I
think about the simulation hypothesis I

1316
00:24:26,639 --> 00:24:26,649
think about the simulation hypothesis I
 

1317
00:24:26,649 --> 00:24:29,399
think about the simulation hypothesis I
think is just fun to think about it but

1318
00:24:29,399 --> 00:24:29,409
think is just fun to think about it but
 

1319
00:24:29,409 --> 00:24:31,230
think is just fun to think about it but
it's also I think there is a thought

1320
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:31,240
it's also I think there is a thought
 

1321
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,789
it's also I think there is a thought
experiment kind of interesting to think

1322
00:24:32,789 --> 00:24:32,799
experiment kind of interesting to think
 

1323
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:35,639
experiment kind of interesting to think
of the power of computation where there

1324
00:24:35,639 --> 00:24:35,649
of the power of computation where there
 

1325
00:24:35,649 --> 00:24:39,090
of the power of computation where there
are the limits of a Turing machine sort

1326
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:39,100
are the limits of a Turing machine sort
 

1327
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:40,889
are the limits of a Turing machine sort
of the limits of our current computers

1328
00:24:40,889 --> 00:24:40,899
of the limits of our current computers
 

1329
00:24:40,899 --> 00:24:42,240
of the limits of our current computers
when you start to think about artificial

1330
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:42,250
when you start to think about artificial
 

1331
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:45,029
when you start to think about artificial
intelligence how far can we get with

1332
00:24:45,029 --> 00:24:45,039
intelligence how far can we get with
 

1333
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:49,279
intelligence how far can we get with
computers and that's kind of where the

1334
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:49,289
computers and that's kind of where the
 

1335
00:24:49,289 --> 00:24:51,450
computers and that's kind of where the
simulation hypothesis useless me as a

1336
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:51,460
simulation hypothesis useless me as a
 

1337
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:53,999
simulation hypothesis useless me as a
thought experiment is is the universe

1338
00:24:53,999 --> 00:24:54,009

1339
00:24:54,009 --> 00:24:57,360

just the computer is it just the

1340
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:57,370
just the computer is it just the
 

1341
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:59,399
just the computer is it just the

computation is all of this just the
 

1343
00:24:59,409 --> 00:25:01,470
computation is all of this just the
computation and so the same kind of

1344
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:01,480
computation and so the same kind of
 

1345
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,360
computation and so the same kind of

tools we apply to analyzing algorithms
 

1347

tools we apply to analyzing algorithms
can that be applied you know if we scale

1348
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:05,590
can that be applied you know if we scale
 

1349
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:06,869
can that be applied you know if we scale
further and further and further

further and further and further

something fundamentally different needs
to be created well it's interesting that

to be created well it's interesting that
 

1361
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,269
to be created well it's interesting that
in our universe it's not arbitrarily

in our universe it's not arbitrarily

in our universe it's not arbitrarily

00:26:38,309 --> 00:26:41,359
are you psychologically comfortable with
the concept of infinity I think so

1430
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:41,369
the concept of infinity I think so
 

1431
00:26:41,369 --> 00:26:42,619
the concept of infinity I think so
are you okay with it I'm pretty okay

1432
00:26:42,619 --> 00:26:42,629
are you okay with it I'm pretty okay
 

1433
00:26:42,629 --> 00:26:45,889
are you okay with it I'm pretty okay
yeah okay no not really it doesn't make

1434
00:26:45,889 --> 00:26:45,899
yeah okay no not really it doesn't make
 

1435
00:26:45,899 --> 00:26:46,639
yeah okay no not really it doesn't make
any sense to me

1436
00:26:46,639 --> 00:26:46,649
any sense to me
 

1437
00:26:46,649 --> 00:26:48,649
any sense to me
I don't know like how many how many

1438
00:26:48,649 --> 00:26:48,659
I don't know like how many how many
 

1439
00:26:48,659 --> 00:26:51,440
I don't know like how many how many
words how many possible words do you

1440
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:51,450
words how many possible words do you
 

1441
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:53,899
words how many possible words do you
think could exist that are just like

1442
00:26:53,899 --> 00:26:53,909
think could exist that are just like
 

1443
00:26:53,909 --> 00:26:56,989
think could exist that are just like
strings of letters so that that's a sort

1444
00:26:56,989 --> 00:26:56,999
strings of letters so that that's a sort
 

1445
00:26:56,999 --> 00:26:59,479
strings of letters so that that's a sort
of mathematical statement as beautiful

1446
00:26:59,479 --> 00:26:59,489
of mathematical statement as beautiful
 

1447
00:26:59,489 --> 00:27:01,669
of mathematical statement as beautiful
and we use infinity basically everything

1448
00:27:01,669 --> 00:27:01,679
and we use infinity basically everything
 

1449
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:05,450
and we use infinity basically everything
we do everything we do inside in science

1450
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:05,460
we do everything we do inside in science
 

1451
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:08,269
we do everything we do inside in science
math and engineering yes but you said

1452
00:27:08,269 --> 00:27:08,279
math and engineering yes but you said
 

1453
00:27:08,279 --> 00:27:12,320
math and engineering yes but you said
exist my the question is well you said

1454
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:12,330
exist my the question is well you said
 

1455
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:13,249
exist my the question is well you said
letters of words

1456
00:27:13,249 --> 00:27:13,259
letters of words
 

1457
00:27:13,259 --> 00:27:17,089
letters of words
I said words words the to bring words

1458
00:27:17,089 --> 00:27:17,099
I said words words the to bring words
 

1459
00:27:17,099 --> 00:27:18,649
I said words words the to bring words
into existence to me you have to start

1460
00:27:18,649 --> 00:27:18,659
into existence to me you have to start
 

1461
00:27:18,659 --> 00:27:20,749
into existence to me you have to start
like saying them or like writing them or

1462
00:27:20,749 --> 00:27:20,759
like saying them or like writing them or
 

1463
00:27:20,759 --> 00:27:22,249
like saying them or like writing them or
like listing them that's an

00:27:22,249 --> 00:27:22,259
like listing them that's an
 

1465
00:27:22,259 --> 00:27:24,349

1466
00:27:24,349 --> 00:27:24,359
instantiation okay combination how many
 

1467
00:27:24,359 --> 00:27:26,359

abstract words exist it was the idea of

1468
00:27:26,359 --> 00:27:26,369
abstract words exist it was the idea of
 

1469
00:27:26,369 --> 00:27:29,359
abstract words exist it was the idea of
abstract yeah the the idea of abstract

1470
00:27:29,359 --> 00:27:29,369
abstract yeah the the idea of abstract
 

1471
00:27:29,369 --> 00:27:31,580
abstract yeah the the idea of abstract
notions and ideas I think we should be

1472
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:31,590
notions and ideas I think we should be
 

1473
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:33,529
notions and ideas I think we should be
clear around terminology I mean you

1474
00:27:33,529 --> 00:27:33,539
clear around terminology I mean you
 

1475
00:27:33,539 --> 00:27:35,299
clear around terminology I mean you
think about intelligence a lot like

1476
00:27:35,299 --> 00:27:35,309
think about intelligence a lot like
 

1477
00:27:35,309 --> 00:27:38,239
think about intelligence a lot like
artificial intelligence would you not

1478
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:38,249
artificial intelligence would you not
 

1479
00:27:38,249 --> 00:27:39,649
artificial intelligence would you not
say that what it's doing is a kind of

1480
00:27:39,649 --> 00:27:39,659
say that what it's doing is a kind of
 

1481
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:40,310
say that what it's doing is a kind of
abstraction

1482
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:40,320
abstraction
 

1483
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,519
abstraction
they're like abstraction is key to

1484
00:27:42,519 --> 00:27:42,529
they're like abstraction is key to
 

1485
00:27:42,529 --> 00:27:45,320
they're like abstraction is key to
conceptualizing the universe you get

1486
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:45,330
conceptualizing the universe you get
 

1487
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:47,419
conceptualizing the universe you get
this raw sensory data you need I need

1488
00:27:47,419 --> 00:27:47,429
this raw sensory data you need I need
 

1489
00:27:47,429 --> 00:27:48,950
this raw sensory data you need I need
something that every time you move your

1490
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:48,960
something that every time you move your
 

1491
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,139
something that every time you move your
face a little bit and the they're not

1492
00:27:51,139 --> 00:27:51,149
face a little bit and the they're not
 

1493
00:27:51,149 --> 00:27:53,029
face a little bit and the they're not
pixels but like analog of pixels on my

1494
00:27:53,029 --> 00:27:53,039
pixels but like analog of pixels on my
 

1495
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:55,580
pixels but like analog of pixels on my
retina change entirely yeah that I can

1496
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:55,590
retina change entirely yeah that I can
 

1497
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:57,469
retina change entirely yeah that I can
still have some coherent notion of this

1498
00:27:57,469 --> 00:27:57,479
still have some coherent notion of this
 

1499
00:27:57,479 --> 00:27:59,810
still have some coherent notion of this
is Lex and planet Lex yes right what

1500
00:27:59,810 --> 00:27:59,820
is Lex and planet Lex yes right what
 

1501
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:01,369
is Lex and planet Lex yes right what
that requires is you have a disparate

1502
00:28:01,369 --> 00:28:01,379
that requires is you have a disparate
 

1503
00:28:01,379 --> 00:28:03,680
that requires is you have a disparate
set of possible images hitting me that

1504
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:03,690
set of possible images hitting me that
 

1505
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:06,259
set of possible images hitting me that
are unified in a notion of Lex yeah

1506
00:28:06,259 --> 00:28:06,269
are unified in a notion of Lex yeah
 

1507
00:28:06,269 --> 00:28:08,719
are unified in a notion of Lex yeah
right that's a kind of abstraction it's

1508
00:28:08,719 --> 00:28:08,729
right that's a kind of abstraction it's
 

1509
00:28:08,729 --> 00:28:10,190
right that's a kind of abstraction it's
a thing that could apply to a lot of

1510
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:10,200
a thing that could apply to a lot of
 

1511
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,769
a thing that could apply to a lot of
different images that I see and it

1512
00:28:12,769 --> 00:28:12,779
different images that I see and it
 

1513
00:28:12,779 --> 00:28:14,299
different images that I see and it
represents it in a much more compressed

1514
00:28:14,299 --> 00:28:14,309
represents it in a much more compressed
 

1515
00:28:14,309 --> 00:28:16,489
represents it in a much more compressed
way and one that's like much more

1516
00:28:16,489 --> 00:28:16,499
way and one that's like much more
 

1517
00:28:16,499 --> 00:28:17,960
way and one that's like much more
resilient to that I think in the same

1518
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:17,970
resilient to that I think in the same
 

1519
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:20,119
resilient to that I think in the same
way if I'm talking about infinity as an

1520
00:28:20,119 --> 00:28:20,129
way if I'm talking about infinity as an
 

1521
00:28:20,129 --> 00:28:22,489
way if I'm talking about infinity as an
abstraction I don't mean non-physical

1522
00:28:22,489 --> 00:28:22,499
abstraction I don't mean non-physical

00:28:23,669 --> 00:28:26,479
woowoo
it like ineffable or something what I

1526
00:28:26,479 --> 00:28:26,489
it like ineffable or something what I
 

1527
00:28:26,489 --> 00:28:28,460
it like ineffable or something what I
mean is it something that can apply to a

1528
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:28,470
mean is it something that can apply to a
 

1529
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:30,470
mean is it something that can apply to a
multiplicity of situations that share

1530
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:30,480
multiplicity of situations that share
 

1531

single notion to it like in that way
 

1541
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:41,060

infinity is an abstraction and it's very

infinity is an abstraction and it's very
 

1543

through such abstraction that we can

00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:46,340
through such abstraction that we can
actually understand like the world and

infinity the way I think about it the
 

1553
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:52,520

don't have to think of all the words at

add one more that gives it this nature
 

1571
00:29:06,809 --> 00:29:08,750
add one more that gives it this nature
of infinite enos in the same way that

of infinite enos in the same way that

face that give it the Lexx miss right so
 

1577
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:15,950
face that give it the Lexx miss right so
like infinity should be no more worrying

1578
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:15,960
like infinity should be no more worrying
 

1579
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,460
like infinity should be no more worrying
than the I can always add one more

00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,580
more elegant way than I could put it so
thank you for doing that as yet another

1586
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:25,590
thank you for doing that as yet another
 

1587

thank you for doing that as yet another
abstraction and yes indeed that's what

1588
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:28,530
abstraction and yes indeed that's what
 

1589
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:30,169
abstraction and yes indeed that's what
our brain does that's what intelligence

systems do this what programming does

I think infinity is very difficult to

1652
00:30:45,799 --> 00:30:45,809
I think infinity is very difficult to
 

1653
00:30:45,809 --> 00:30:48,080
I think infinity is very difficult to
visualize for our mind

1654
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:48,090
visualize for our mind
 

1655
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:51,320
visualize for our mind
we can delude ourselves into thinking we

1656
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:51,330
we can delude ourselves into thinking we
 

1657
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:54,890
we can delude ourselves into thinking we
can visualize it but we can't I don't

1658
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:54,900
can visualize it but we can't I don't
 

1659
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:56,840
can visualize it but we can't I don't
that means I don't I would venture to

1660
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:56,850
that means I don't I would venture to
 

1661
00:30:56,850 --> 00:30:58,190
that means I don't I would venture to
say it's very difficult and so there's

1662
00:30:58,190 --> 00:30:58,200
say it's very difficult and so there's
 

1663
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:01,010
say it's very difficult and so there's
some concepts of mathematics like maybe

00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:01,020
some concepts of mathematics like maybe
 

1665

some concepts of mathematics like maybe

00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:31,970
can't wrap my head around I just wanted
to put something concrete to it that

00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:31,980
to put something concrete to it that
 

1741
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:34,040
to put something concrete to it that
makes me understand and I think a lot of

00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:38,660
the motivation for the channel is
channeling that sentiment of yeah a lot

you're putting it in a visual right like

you're putting it in a visual right like
 

1823
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:56,890
you're putting it in a visual right like
that it's an actual arrow it's an actual

that it's an actual arrow it's an actual

1831
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:04,630

one if you're illustrating it and I

one if you're illustrating it and I
 

1833
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,310
one if you're illustrating it and I
think this is the power of being in a

think this is the power of being in a
 

1835
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,710
think this is the power of being in a
medium like video or if you're writing a

medium like video or if you're writing a
 

1837
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:10,510
medium like video or if you're writing a
textbook and you force yourself to put a

00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:10,520
textbook and you force yourself to put a
 

1839
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:13,120

path to understanding you know I'm sorry
 

1849
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:23,889
path to understanding you know I'm sorry
to interrupt you but you just made me

1850
00:34:23,889 --> 00:34:23,899
to interrupt you but you just made me
 

1851
00:34:23,899 --> 00:34:25,750
to interrupt you but you just made me
realize that that's exactly right so the

1852
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:25,760
realize that that's exactly right so the
 

1853
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,180
realize that that's exactly right so the
visualization is you're creating while

1854
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:28,190
visualization is you're creating while
 

1855
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:29,560
visualization is you're creating while
you're sometimes talking about

1856
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:29,570
you're sometimes talking about
 

1857
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:32,440
you're sometimes talking about
abstractions the actual visualization is

1858
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:32,450
abstractions the actual visualization is
 

1859
00:34:32,450 --> 00:34:36,159
abstractions the actual visualization is
a explicit low-level example yes so

1860
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:36,169
a explicit low-level example yes so
 

1861
00:34:36,169 --> 00:34:38,110
a explicit low-level example yes so
there there's an actual like in the code

1862
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:38,120
there there's an actual like in the code
 

1863
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:40,690
there there's an actual like in the code
you have to say what the what the vector

1864
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:40,700
you have to say what the what the vector
 

1865
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:43,030
you have to say what the what the vector
is what's the direction of the arrow

1866
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:43,040
is what's the direction of the arrow
 

1867
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:46,000
is what's the direction of the arrow
what's the magnitude of the yeah so

1868
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:46,010
what's the magnitude of the yeah so
 

1869
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:48,669
what's the magnitude of the yeah so
that's you're going the visualization

1870
00:34:48,669 --> 00:34:48,679
that's you're going the visualization
 

1871
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:50,470
that's you're going the visualization
itself is actually going to the bottom I

1872
00:34:50,470 --> 00:34:50,480
itself is actually going to the bottom I
 

1873
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,419
itself is actually going to the bottom I
think and I think that's very important

1874
00:34:52,419 --> 00:34:52,429
think and I think that's very important
 

1875
00:34:52,429 --> 00:34:54,250
think and I think that's very important
I also think about this a lot in writing

1876
00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:54,260
I also think about this a lot in writing
 

1877
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:56,050
I also think about this a lot in writing
scripts where even before you get to the

1878
00:34:56,050 --> 00:34:56,060
scripts where even before you get to the
 

1879
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:59,890
scripts where even before you get to the
visuals the first instinct is to I don't

1880
00:34:59,890 --> 00:34:59,900
visuals the first instinct is to I don't
 

1881
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,840
visuals the first instinct is to I don't
know why I just always do I say the

1882
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:01,850
know why I just always do I say the
 

1883
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:03,190
know why I just always do I say the
abstract thing I say the general

1884
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:03,200
abstract thing I say the general
 

1885
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,350
abstract thing I say the general
definition the powerful thing and then I

1886
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:05,360
definition the powerful thing and then I
 

1887
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,840
definition the powerful thing and then I
fill it in with examples later always it

1888
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:07,850
fill it in with examples later always it
 

1889
00:35:07,850 --> 00:35:09,040
fill it in with examples later always it
will be more compelling and easier to

1890
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:09,050
will be more compelling and easier to
 

1891
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:10,420
will be more compelling and easier to

00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:00,210
themselves but in terms of another set
of numbers they're like the non-trivial

2048
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:00,220
of numbers they're like the non-trivial
 

2049
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:02,609
of numbers they're like the non-trivial
zeros of the zeta function and again I'm

2050
00:38:02,609 --> 00:38:02,619
zeros of the zeta function and again I'm
 

2051
00:38:02,619 --> 00:38:04,589
zeros of the zeta function and again I'm
very kind of in over my head in a lot of

2052
00:38:04,589 --> 00:38:04,599
very kind of in over my head in a lot of
 

2053
00:38:04,599 --> 00:38:06,210
very kind of in over my head in a lot of
ways as I like try to get to understand

2054
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:06,220
ways as I like try to get to understand
 

2055
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:08,730
ways as I like try to get to understand
it but the more I do its it always

2056
00:38:08,730 --> 00:38:08,740
it but the more I do its it always
 

2057
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:10,200
it but the more I do its it always
leaves enough mystery that it remains

2058
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:10,210
leaves enough mystery that it remains
 

2059
00:38:10,210 --> 00:38:12,240
leaves enough mystery that it remains
very beautiful to me so whenever there's

2060
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:12,250
very beautiful to me so whenever there's
 

2061
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:14,250
very beautiful to me so whenever there's
a little bit of mystery just outside of

00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:14,260
a little bit of mystery just outside of
 

2063
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:17,190
a little bit of mystery just outside of
the understanding that and by the way

2064
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:17,200
the understanding that and by the way
 

2065
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,620
the understanding that and by the way
the process of learning more about it

2066
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:19,630
the process of learning more about it
 

2067
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,029
the process of learning more about it
how does that come about just your own

2068
00:38:21,029 --> 00:38:21,039
how does that come about just your own
 

2069
00:38:21,039 --> 00:38:24,299
how does that come about just your own
thought or are you reading reading yes

2070
00:38:24,299 --> 00:38:24,309
thought or are you reading reading yes
 

2071
00:38:24,309 --> 00:38:26,910
thought or are you reading reading yes
or is the visualization itself revealing

00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:26,920
or is the visualization itself revealing
 

2073
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:29,910
or is the visualization itself revealing
more to you visuals help I mean in one

2074
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:29,920
more to you visuals help I mean in one
 

2075
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:30,839
more to you visuals help I mean in one
time when I was just trying to

2076
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:30,849
time when I was just trying to
 

2077
00:38:30,849 --> 00:38:32,309
time when I was just trying to
understand like analytic continuation

2078
00:38:32,309 --> 00:38:32,319
understand like analytic continuation
 

2079
00:38:32,319 --> 00:38:35,010
understand like analytic continuation
and playing around with visualizing

2080
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:35,020
and playing around with visualizing
 

2081
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:37,019
and playing around with visualizing
complex functions this is what led to a

2082
00:38:37,019 --> 00:38:37,029
complex functions this is what led to a
 

2083
00:38:37,029 --> 00:38:39,900
complex functions this is what led to a
video about this function it's titled

video about this function it's titled
 

2085
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:41,250

something like visualizing the riemann

2086
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:41,260
something like visualizing the riemann
 

2087
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:43,349
something like visualizing the riemann
zeta function it's one that came about

2088
00:38:43,349 --> 00:38:43,359
zeta function it's one that came about
 

2089
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:45,900
zeta function it's one that came about
because i was programming and tried to

2090
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:45,910
because i was programming and tried to
 

2091
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:47,730
because i was programming and tried to
see what a certain thing looked like and

2092
00:38:47,730 --> 00:38:47,740
see what a certain thing looked like and
 

2093
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:49,220
see what a certain thing looked like and
then i looked at it like well that's

2094
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:49,230
then i looked at it like well that's
 

2095
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:51,359
then i looked at it like well that's
elucidating and then i decided to make a

2096
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:51,369
elucidating and then i decided to make a
 

2097
00:38:51,369 --> 00:38:56,279
elucidating and then i decided to make a
video about it but i mean you try to get

2098
00:38:56,279 --> 00:38:56,289
video about it but i mean you try to get
 

2099
00:38:56,289 --> 00:38:57,599
video about it but i mean you try to get
your hands on as much reading as you can

2100
00:38:57,599 --> 00:38:57,609
your hands on as much reading as you can
 

2101
00:38:57,609 --> 00:39:00,870
your hands on as much reading as you can
you you know in this case i think if

2102
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:00,880
you you know in this case i think if
 

2103
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,490
you you know in this case i think if
anyone wants to start to understand it

2104
00:39:02,490 --> 00:39:02,500
anyone wants to start to understand it
 

2105

of what the common players are but I'll
 

2149
00:39:45,490 --> 00:39:48,450
of what the common players are but I'll
emphasize again like I feel very in over

charming and like to your question very

2170
00:40:11,819 --> 00:40:11,829
charming and like to your question very

beautiful and the beauty is in the what

2172
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:14,710
beautiful and the beauty is in the what

in the journey versus the destination
 

2175
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:18,450
in the journey versus the destination
well it's that each each thing doesn't

2176
00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:18,460
well it's that each each thing doesn't
 

2177
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:20,220
well it's that each each thing doesn't
feel arbitrary I think that's a big part

2178
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:20,230
feel arbitrary I think that's a big part
 

2179
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:22,519
feel arbitrary I think that's a big part
is that you have these unpredictable

2180
00:40:22,519 --> 00:40:22,529
is that you have these unpredictable
 

2181
00:40:22,529 --> 00:40:24,900
is that you have these unpredictable
none yeah these very unpredictable

2182
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:24,910
none yeah these very unpredictable
 

2183
00:40:24,910 --> 00:40:28,440
none yeah these very unpredictable
patterns were these intricate properties

2184
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:28,450
patterns were these intricate properties
 

2185
00:40:28,450 --> 00:40:30,750
patterns were these intricate properties
of like a certain function but at the

2186
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:30,760
of like a certain function but at the
 

2187
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:32,190
of like a certain function but at the
same time it doesn't feel like humans

2188
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:32,200
same time it doesn't feel like humans
 

2189
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,630
same time it doesn't feel like humans
ever made an arbitrary choice in

2190
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:33,640
ever made an arbitrary choice in
 

2191
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:36,599
ever made an arbitrary choice in
studying this particular thing so you

2192
00:40:36,599 --> 00:40:36,609
studying this particular thing so you
 

2193
00:40:36,609 --> 00:40:38,519
studying this particular thing so you
know it feels like you're speaking to

2194
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:38,529
know it feels like you're speaking to
 

2195
00:40:38,529 --> 00:40:40,400
know it feels like you're speaking to
patterns themselves or nature itself

2196
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:40,410
patterns themselves or nature itself
 

2197
00:40:40,410 --> 00:40:43,529
patterns themselves or nature itself
that's a big part of it I think things

2198
00:40:43,529 --> 00:40:43,539
that's a big part of it I think things
 

2199
00:40:43,539 --> 00:40:45,539
that's a big part of it I think things
that are too arbitrary it's just hard

2200
00:40:45,539 --> 00:40:45,549
that are too arbitrary it's just hard
 

2201
00:40:45,549 --> 00:40:48,029
that are too arbitrary it's just hard

it makes you feel like if you came
 

2217
00:41:07,270 --> 00:41:09,029
it makes you feel like if you came
across another intelligent civilization

it may be with different notation but
 

2223
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:16,170
it may be with different notation but
personally yeah but yeah like that's

2224
00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:16,180
personally yeah but yeah like that's
 

2225
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:17,760

something amazing I'm gonna ask the
 

2243
00:41:36,849 --> 00:41:39,329
something amazing I'm gonna ask the
question that that you've already been

00:41:41,490 --> 00:41:41,500
asked a lot that you'll get more and
 

2247
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:43,890
asked a lot that you'll get more and
more asked in your life but what was

2248
00:41:43,890 --> 00:41:43,900
more asked in your life but what was
 

2249
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:45,660
more asked in your life but what was
your favorite video to create

2250
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:45,670
your favorite video to create
 

2251
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:49,859
your favorite video to create
Oh favorite to create one of my

2252
00:41:49,859 --> 00:41:49,869
Oh favorite to create one of my
 

2253
00:41:49,869 --> 00:41:52,109
Oh favorite to create one of my
favorites is the title is who cares

2254
00:41:52,109 --> 00:41:52,119
favorites is the title is who cares
 

2255
00:41:52,119 --> 00:41:54,930
favorites is the title is who cares
about topology you want me to pull it up

2256
00:41:54,930 --> 00:41:54,940
about topology you want me to pull it up
 

2257
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:59,089
about topology you want me to pull it up
or not if you want sure yeah it is about

2258
00:41:59,089 --> 00:41:59,099
or not if you want sure yeah it is about
 

2259
00:41:59,099 --> 00:42:01,440
or not if you want sure yeah it is about
well it starts by describing an unsolved

2260
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:01,450
well it starts by describing an unsolved
 

2261
00:42:01,450 --> 00:42:02,910
well it starts by describing an unsolved
problem that still unsolved in math

2262
00:42:02,910 --> 00:42:02,920
problem that still unsolved in math
 

2263
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:05,099
problem that still unsolved in math
called the inscribed square problem you

2264
00:42:05,099 --> 00:42:05,109
called the inscribed square problem you
 

2265
00:42:05,109 --> 00:42:06,900
called the inscribed square problem you
draw any loop and then you ask are there

2266
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:06,910
draw any loop and then you ask are there
 

2267
00:42:06,910 --> 00:42:08,130
draw any loop and then you ask are there
four points on that loop that make a

2268
00:42:08,130 --> 00:42:08,140
four points on that loop that make a
 

2269
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:10,710
four points on that loop that make a
square totally useless right this is not

2270
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:10,720
square totally useless right this is not
 

2271
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,569
square totally useless right this is not
answering any physical questions it's

2272
00:42:12,569 --> 00:42:12,579
answering any physical questions it's
 

2273
00:42:12,579 --> 00:42:13,920
answering any physical questions it's
mostly interesting that we can't answer

2274
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:13,930
mostly interesting that we can't answer
 

2275
00:42:13,930 --> 00:42:15,690
mostly interesting that we can't answer
that question and it seems like such a

2276
00:42:15,690 --> 00:42:15,700
that question and it seems like such a
 

2277
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:20,009
that question and it seems like such a
natural thing to ask now if you weaken

2278
00:42:20,009 --> 00:42:20,019
natural thing to ask now if you weaken
 

2279
00:42:20,019 --> 00:42:21,390
natural thing to ask now if you weaken
it a little bit and you ask can you

2280
00:42:21,390 --> 00:42:21,400
it a little bit and you ask can you
 

2281
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,130
it a little bit and you ask can you
always find a rectangle you choose four

2282
00:42:23,130 --> 00:42:23,140
always find a rectangle you choose four
 

2283
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:24,750
always find a rectangle you choose four
points on this curve can you find a

2284
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:24,760
points on this curve can you find a
 

2285
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:27,089
points on this curve can you find a
rectangle that's hard but it's doable

2286
00:42:27,089 --> 00:42:27,099
rectangle that's hard but it's doable
 

2287
00:42:27,099 --> 00:42:31,529
rectangle that's hard but it's doable
and the path to it involves things like

2288
00:42:31,529 --> 00:42:31,539
and the path to it involves things like
 

2289
00:42:31,539 --> 00:42:33,870
and the path to it involves things like
looking at a torus this surface with a

2290
00:42:33,870 --> 00:42:33,880
looking at a torus this surface with a
 

2291
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,370
looking at a torus this surface with a
single hole in it like a donut we're

2292
00:42:35,370 --> 00:42:35,380
single hole in it like a donut we're
 

2293
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:37,920
single hole in it like a donut we're
looking at a mobius strip in ways that

2294
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:37,930
looking at a mobius strip in ways that
 

2295
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:40,140
looking at a mobius strip in ways that
feel so much less contrived to when I

2296
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:40,150
feel so much less contrived to when I
 

2297
00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:42,089
feel so much less contrived to when I
first as like a little kid learned about

2298
00:42:42,089 --> 00:42:42,099
first as like a little kid learned about
 

2299
00:42:42,099 --> 00:42:43,920
first as like a little kid learned about
these surfaces and shapes like a mobius

2300
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:43,930
these surfaces and shapes like a mobius
 

2301
00:42:43,930 --> 00:42:46,470
these surfaces and shapes like a mobius
strip and a torus like what you learn is

2302
00:42:46,470 --> 00:42:46,480
strip and a torus like what you learn is
 

2303
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,690
strip and a torus like what you learn is
oh this mobius strip you take a piece of

2304
00:42:48,690 --> 00:42:48,700
oh this mobius strip you take a piece of
 

2305
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:50,519
oh this mobius strip you take a piece of
paper put a twist glue it together and

2306
00:42:50,519 --> 00:42:50,529
paper put a twist glue it together and
 

2307
00:42:50,529 --> 00:42:52,259
paper put a twist glue it together and
now you have a shape with one edge and

2308
00:42:52,259 --> 00:42:52,269
now you have a shape with one edge and
 

2309
00:42:52,269 --> 00:42:55,499
now you have a shape with one edge and
just one side and as a student you

2310
00:42:55,499 --> 00:42:55,509
just one side and as a student you
 

2311
00:42:55,509 --> 00:42:59,039
just one side and as a student you
should think who cares right like how

2312
00:42:59,039 --> 00:42:59,049
should think who cares right like how
 

2313
00:42:59,049 --> 00:43:00,630
should think who cares right like how
does that help me solve any problems I

2314
00:43:00,630 --> 00:43:00,640
does that help me solve any problems I
 

2315
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:02,099
does that help me solve any problems I
thought math was about problem solving

2316
00:43:02,099 --> 00:43:02,109
thought math was about problem solving
 

2317
00:43:02,109 --> 00:43:05,519
thought math was about problem solving
so what I liked about the piece of math

2318
00:43:05,519 --> 00:43:05,529
so what I liked about the piece of math
 

2319
00:43:05,529 --> 00:43:07,950
so what I liked about the piece of math
that this was describing that was in

2320
00:43:07,950 --> 00:43:07,960
that this was describing that was in
 

2321
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,299
that this was describing that was in
this paper by a mathematician named

2322
00:43:09,299 --> 00:43:09,309
this paper by a mathematician named
 

2323
00:43:09,309 --> 00:43:12,329
this paper by a mathematician named
Vaughan was that it arises very

2324
00:43:12,329 --> 00:43:12,339
Vaughan was that it arises very
 

2325
00:43:12,339 --> 00:43:14,160
Vaughan was that it arises very
naturally it's clear what it represents

2326
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:14,170
naturally it's clear what it represents
 

2327
00:43:14,170 --> 00:43:16,019
naturally it's clear what it represents
it's doing something it's not just

2328
00:43:16,019 --> 00:43:16,029
it's doing something it's not just
 

2329
00:43:16,029 --> 00:43:18,390
it's doing something it's not just
playing with construction paper and the

2330
00:43:18,390 --> 00:43:18,400
playing with construction paper and the
 

2331
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,130
playing with construction paper and the
way that it solves the problem is really

2332
00:43:20,130 --> 00:43:20,140
way that it solves the problem is really
 

2333
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:23,339
way that it solves the problem is really
beautiful so kind of putting all of that

2334
00:43:23,339 --> 00:43:23,349
beautiful so kind of putting all of that
 

2335
00:43:23,349 --> 00:43:26,039
beautiful so kind of putting all of that
down and concretizing it right like I

2336
00:43:26,039 --> 00:43:26,049
down and concretizing it right like I
 

2337
00:43:26,049 --> 00:43:28,230
down and concretizing it right like I
was talking about how when you have to

2338
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:28,240
was talking about how when you have to
 

2339
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:30,329
was talking about how when you have to
put visuals to it it demands that what's

2340
00:43:30,329 --> 00:43:30,339
put visuals to it it demands that what's
 

2341
00:43:30,339 --> 00:43:32,099
put visuals to it it demands that what's
on screen is a very specific example of

2342
00:43:32,099 --> 00:43:32,109
on screen is a very specific example of
 

2343
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:33,690
on screen is a very specific example of
what you're describing the cut the

2344
00:43:33,690 --> 00:43:33,700
what you're describing the cut the
 

2345
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:35,160
what you're describing the cut the
construction here is very abstract in

2346
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:35,170
construction here is very abstract in
 

2347
00:43:35,170 --> 00:43:37,049
construction here is very abstract in
nature you describe this very abstract

2348
00:43:37,049 --> 00:43:37,059
nature you describe this very abstract
 

2349
00:43:37,059 --> 00:43:39,660
nature you describe this very abstract
kind of surface in 3d space so then when

2350
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:39,670
kind of surface in 3d space so then when
 

2351
00:43:39,670 --> 00:43:41,309
kind of surface in 3d space so then when
I was finding myself in this case I

2352
00:43:41,309 --> 00:43:41,319
I was finding myself in this case I
 

2353
00:43:41,319 --> 00:43:43,200
I was finding myself in this case I
wasn't programming I was using Grapher

2354
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:43,210
wasn't programming I was using Grapher
 

2355
00:43:43,210 --> 00:43:45,480
wasn't programming I was using Grapher
that's like built into OSX for the 3d

2356
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:45,490
that's like built into OSX for the 3d
 

2357

that's like built into OSX for the 3d
stuff to draw that surface you realize

2358
00:43:49,079 --> 00:43:49,089
stuff to draw that surface you realize
 

2359
00:43:49,089 --> 00:43:51,839
stuff to draw that surface you realize
oh man the topology argument is very non

2360
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:51,849
oh man the topology argument is very non
 

2361
00:43:51,849 --> 00:43:54,210
oh man the topology argument is very non
constructive I have to make a lot of you

2362
00:43:54,210 --> 00:43:54,220
constructive I have to make a lot of you
 

2363
00:43:54,220 --> 00:43:55,920
constructive I have to make a lot of you
have to do a lot of extra work in order

2364
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:55,930
have to do a lot of extra work in order
 

2365
00:43:55,930 --> 00:43:57,660
have to do a lot of extra work in order
to make the surface show up but then

2366
00:43:57,660 --> 00:43:57,670
to make the surface show up but then
 

2367
00:43:57,670 --> 00:43:59,559
to make the surface show up but then
once you see it it's quite pretty

2368
00:43:59,559 --> 00:43:59,569
once you see it it's quite pretty
 

2369
00:43:59,569 --> 00:44:00,819
once you see it it's quite pretty
very satisfying to see a specific

00:44:00,819 --> 00:44:00,829
very satisfying to see a specific
 

2371
00:44:00,829 --> 00:44:02,799
very satisfying to see a specific
instance of it and you also feel like

2372
00:44:02,799 --> 00:44:02,809
instance of it and you also feel like
 

2373
00:44:02,809 --> 00:44:05,229
instance of it and you also feel like
I've actually added something on top of

00:44:05,239 --> 00:44:06,849
I've actually added something on top of
what the original paper was doing that

2376
00:44:06,849 --> 00:44:06,859
what the original paper was doing that
 

2377
00:44:06,859 --> 00:44:08,319
what the original paper was doing that
it shows something that's completely

2378
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:08,329
it shows something that's completely
 

2379
00:44:08,329 --> 00:44:10,630
it shows something that's completely
correct it's a very beautiful argument

2380
00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:10,640
correct it's a very beautiful argument
 

2381
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:12,249
correct it's a very beautiful argument
but you don't see what it looks like and

2382
00:44:12,249 --> 00:44:12,259
but you don't see what it looks like and
 

2383
00:44:12,259 --> 00:44:15,279
but you don't see what it looks like and
I found something satisfying and seeing

00:44:15,279 --> 00:44:15,289
I found something satisfying and seeing
 

2385
00:44:15,289 --> 00:44:17,259
I found something satisfying and seeing
what it looked like that could only ever

00:44:17,269 --> 00:44:18,489
what it looked like that could only ever
have come about from the forcing

00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:18,499
have come about from the forcing

was talking abut your most weren't able

2394
00:44:23,349 --> 00:44:23,359
was talking abut your most weren't able
 

2395

don't know idea I had no idea and it was

don't know idea I had no idea and it was
 

2399
00:44:26,989 --> 00:44:29,259

wonderful right it was totally it looks

00:44:29,259 --> 00:44:29,269
wonderful right it was totally it looks
 

2401
00:44:29,269 --> 00:44:30,729
wonderful right it was totally it looks
like a Sydney Opera House or some sort

2402
00:44:30,729 --> 00:44:30,739
like a Sydney Opera House or some sort
 

2403
00:44:30,739 --> 00:44:33,430
like a Sydney Opera House or some sort
of Frank Gehry design and it was you

2404
00:44:33,430 --> 00:44:33,440
of Frank Gehry design and it was you
 

2405
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,349
of Frank Gehry design and it was you
knew it was gonna be something and you

2406
00:44:35,349 --> 00:44:35,359
knew it was gonna be something and you
 

2407
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:36,670
knew it was gonna be something and you
can say various things about it like oh

2408
00:44:36,670 --> 00:44:36,680
can say various things about it like oh
 

2409
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:39,549
can say various things about it like oh
it it touches the curve itself it has a

2410
00:44:39,549 --> 00:44:39,559
it it touches the curve itself it has a
 

2411
00:44:39,559 --> 00:44:41,289
it it touches the curve itself it has a
boundary that's this curve on the 2d

2412
00:44:41,289 --> 00:44:41,299
boundary that's this curve on the 2d
 

2413
00:44:41,299 --> 00:44:43,959
boundary that's this curve on the 2d
plane it all sits above the plane but

2414
00:44:43,959 --> 00:44:43,969
plane it all sits above the plane but
 

2415
00:44:43,969 --> 00:44:45,699
plane it all sits above the plane but
before you actually draw it so it's very

2416
00:44:45,699 --> 00:44:45,709
before you actually draw it so it's very
 

2417
00:44:45,709 --> 00:44:47,160
before you actually draw it so it's very
unclear what the thing will look like

2418
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:47,170
unclear what the thing will look like
 

2419
00:44:47,170 --> 00:44:50,109
unclear what the thing will look like
and to see it it's very it's just

2420
00:44:50,109 --> 00:44:50,119
and to see it it's very it's just
 

2421
00:44:50,119 --> 00:44:51,400
and to see it it's very it's just
pleasing right so that was that was fun

2422
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:51,410
pleasing right so that was that was fun
 

2423
00:44:51,410 --> 00:44:54,069
pleasing right so that was that was fun
to make very fun to share I hope that it

2424
00:44:54,069 --> 00:44:54,079
to make very fun to share I hope that it
 

2425
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:57,239
to make very fun to share I hope that it
has elucidated for some people out there

2426
00:44:57,239 --> 00:44:57,249
has elucidated for some people out there
 

2427
00:44:57,249 --> 00:44:59,680
has elucidated for some people out there
where these constructs of topology come

2428
00:44:59,680 --> 00:44:59,690
where these constructs of topology come
 

2429
00:44:59,690 --> 00:45:01,930
where these constructs of topology come
from that it's not arbitrary play with

2430
00:45:01,930 --> 00:45:01,940
from that it's not arbitrary play with
 

2431
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:04,689
from that it's not arbitrary play with
construction paper so that's I think

2432
00:45:04,689 --> 00:45:04,699
construction paper so that's I think
 

2433
00:45:04,699 --> 00:45:07,209
construction paper so that's I think
this is good a good sort of example to

2434
00:45:07,209 --> 00:45:07,219
this is good a good sort of example to
 

2435
00:45:07,219 --> 00:45:09,579
this is good a good sort of example to
talk a little bit about your process so

2436
00:45:09,579 --> 00:45:09,589
talk a little bit about your process so
 

2437
00:45:09,589 --> 00:45:11,939
talk a little bit about your process so
you have you have a list of ideas so

2438
00:45:11,939 --> 00:45:11,949
you have you have a list of ideas so
 

2439
00:45:11,949 --> 00:45:15,539
you have you have a list of ideas so
that sort of the the curse of having

2440
00:45:15,539 --> 00:45:15,549
that sort of the the curse of having
 

2441
00:45:15,549 --> 00:45:18,609
that sort of the the curse of having
having an active and brilliant mind is

2442
00:45:18,609 --> 00:45:18,619
having an active and brilliant mind is
 

2443
00:45:18,619 --> 00:45:19,989
having an active and brilliant mind is
I'm sure you have a list that's growing

2444
00:45:19,989 --> 00:45:19,999
I'm sure you have a list that's growing
 

2445
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:24,819
I'm sure you have a list that's growing
faster than you can utilize and but

2446
00:45:24,819 --> 00:45:24,829
faster than you can utilize and but
 

2447
00:45:24,829 --> 00:45:27,309
faster than you can utilize and but
there's some sorting procedure depending

2448
00:45:27,309 --> 00:45:27,319
there's some sorting procedure depending
 

2449
00:45:27,319 --> 00:45:30,339
there's some sorting procedure depending
on mood and interest and so on but okay

2450
00:45:30,339 --> 00:45:30,349
on mood and interest and so on but okay
 

2451
00:45:30,349 --> 00:45:33,670
on mood and interest and so on but okay
so pick an idea then you have to try to

2452
00:45:33,670 --> 00:45:33,680
so pick an idea then you have to try to
 

2453
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:37,209
so pick an idea then you have to try to
write a narrative arc it's sort of how

2454
00:45:37,209 --> 00:45:37,219
write a narrative arc it's sort of how
 

2455
00:45:37,219 --> 00:45:39,939
write a narrative arc it's sort of how
do I elucidate how how do I make this

2456
00:45:39,939 --> 00:45:39,949
do I elucidate how how do I make this
 

2457
00:45:39,949 --> 00:45:41,949
do I elucidate how how do I make this
idea beautiful and clear and explain it

2458
00:45:41,949 --> 00:45:41,959
idea beautiful and clear and explain it
 

2459
00:45:41,959 --> 00:45:43,719
idea beautiful and clear and explain it
and then there's a set of visualizations

2460
00:45:43,719 --> 00:45:43,729
and then there's a set of visualizations
 

2461
00:45:43,729 --> 00:45:47,109
and then there's a set of visualizations
that'll be attached to it sort of you've

2462
00:45:47,109 --> 00:45:47,119
that'll be attached to it sort of you've
 

2463
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:48,579
that'll be attached to it sort of you've
talked about some of this before but

2464
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:48,589
talked about some of this before but
 

2465
00:45:48,589 --> 00:45:51,519
talked about some of this before but
sort of writing the story attaching the

2466
00:45:51,519 --> 00:45:51,529
sort of writing the story attaching the
 

2467
00:45:51,529 --> 00:45:54,189
sort of writing the story attaching the
visualizations can you talk through

2468
00:45:54,189 --> 00:45:54,199
visualizations can you talk through
 

2469
00:45:54,199 --> 00:45:57,400
visualizations can you talk through
interesting painful beautiful parts of

2470
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:57,410
interesting painful beautiful parts of
 

2471
00:45:57,410 --> 00:46:00,699
interesting painful beautiful parts of
that process well the most painful is if

2472
00:46:00,699 --> 00:46:00,709
that process well the most painful is if
 

2473
00:46:00,709 --> 00:46:02,620
that process well the most painful is if
you've chosen a topic that you do want

2474
00:46:02,620 --> 00:46:02,630
you've chosen a topic that you do want
 

2475
00:46:02,630 --> 00:46:04,859
you've chosen a topic that you do want
to do but then it's hard to think of I

2476
00:46:04,859 --> 00:46:04,869
to do but then it's hard to think of I
 

2477
00:46:04,869 --> 00:46:08,620
to do but then it's hard to think of I
guess how to structure the script this

2478
00:46:08,620 --> 00:46:08,630
guess how to structure the script this
 

2479
00:46:08,630 --> 00:46:10,749
guess how to structure the script this
is sort of where I have been on one for

2480
00:46:10,749 --> 00:46:10,759
is sort of where I have been on one for
 

2481
00:46:10,759 --> 00:46:12,370
is sort of where I have been on one for
like the last two or three months and I

2482
00:46:12,370 --> 00:46:12,380
like the last two or three months and I
 

2483
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:13,269
like the last two or three months and I
think the ultimately the right

2484
00:46:13,269 --> 00:46:13,279
think the ultimately the right
 

2485
00:46:13,279 --> 00:46:13,720
think the ultimately the right
resolution

2486
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:13,730
resolution
 

2487
00:46:13,730 --> 00:46:16,690
resolution
just like set it aside and instead do

2488
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:16,700
just like set it aside and instead do
 

2489
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:18,040
just like set it aside and instead do
some other things where the script comes

2490
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:18,050
some other things where the script comes
 

2491
00:46:18,050 --> 00:46:19,390
some other things where the script comes
more naturally because you sort of don't

2492
00:46:19,390 --> 00:46:19,400
more naturally because you sort of don't
 

2493
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:23,560
more naturally because you sort of don't
want to overwork a narrative that the

2494
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:23,570
want to overwork a narrative that the
 

2495
00:46:23,570 --> 00:46:24,940
want to overwork a narrative that the
more you've thought about it the less

2496
00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:24,950
more you've thought about it the less
 

2497
00:46:24,950 --> 00:46:26,590
more you've thought about it the less
you can empathize with the student who

2498
00:46:26,590 --> 00:46:26,600
you can empathize with the student who
 

2499
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:27,940
you can empathize with the student who
doesn't yet understand the thing you're

2500
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:27,950
doesn't yet understand the thing you're
 

2501
00:46:27,950 --> 00:46:28,690
doesn't yet understand the thing you're
trying to teach

trying to teach
 

2503
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:32,140
trying to teach
who is the judger in your head sort of

2504
00:46:32,140 --> 00:46:32,150
who is the judger in your head sort of
 

2505
00:46:32,150 --> 00:46:36,010
who is the judger in your head sort of
the person the creature the essence

2506

that's saying this sucks er this is good

2508
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:38,150
that's saying this sucks er this is good
 

2509
00:46:38,150 --> 00:46:40,030
that's saying this sucks er this is good
and you mentioned kind of the student

2510
00:46:40,030 --> 00:46:40,040
and you mentioned kind of the student
 

2511
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:43,210
and you mentioned kind of the student
you're you're thinking about um what can

2512
00:46:43,210 --> 00:46:43,220
you're you're thinking about um what can
 

2513
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:45,490
you're you're thinking about um what can
you uh who is that what is that thing

2514
00:46:45,490 --> 00:46:45,500
you uh who is that what is that thing
 

2515
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:48,370
you uh who is that what is that thing
that's Chris that is the perfections

2516
00:46:48,370 --> 00:46:48,380
that's Chris that is the perfections
 

2517
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:50,349
that's Chris that is the perfections
that says this thing sucks you need to

2518
00:46:50,349 --> 00:46:50,359
that says this thing sucks you need to
 

2519
00:46:50,359 --> 00:46:51,820
that says this thing sucks you need to
work on it in front of the two three

2520
00:46:51,820 --> 00:46:51,830
work on it in front of the two three
 

2521
00:46:51,830 --> 00:46:55,420
work on it in front of the two three
months I don't know I think it's my past

2522
00:46:55,420 --> 00:46:55,430
months I don't know I think it's my past
 

2523
00:46:55,430 --> 00:46:57,520
months I don't know I think it's my past
self I think that's the entity that I'm

2524
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:57,530
self I think that's the entity that I'm
 

2525
00:46:57,530 --> 00:46:59,710
self I think that's the entity that I'm
most trying to empathize with is like

2526
00:46:59,710 --> 00:46:59,720
most trying to empathize with is like
 

2527
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:01,480
most trying to empathize with is like
you take who I was because it's kind of

2528
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:01,490
you take who I was because it's kind of
 

2529
00:47:01,490 --> 00:47:02,920
you take who I was because it's kind of
the only person I know like you don't

2530
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:02,930
the only person I know like you don't
 

2531
00:47:02,930 --> 00:47:04,599
the only person I know like you don't
really know anyone other than versions

2532
00:47:04,599 --> 00:47:04,609
really know anyone other than versions
 

2533
00:47:04,609 --> 00:47:06,640
really know anyone other than versions
of yourself so I start with the version

2534
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:06,650
of yourself so I start with the version
 

2535
00:47:06,650 --> 00:47:08,470
of yourself so I start with the version
of myself that I know who doesn't yet

2536
00:47:08,470 --> 00:47:08,480
of myself that I know who doesn't yet
 

2537
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:10,960
of myself that I know who doesn't yet
understand the thing right and then I

2538
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:10,970
understand the thing right and then I
 

2539
00:47:10,970 --> 00:47:15,160
understand the thing right and then I
just try to view it with fresh eyes a

2540
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:15,170
just try to view it with fresh eyes a
 

2541
00:47:15,170 --> 00:47:17,380
just try to view it with fresh eyes a
particular visual or a particular script

2542
00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:17,390
particular visual or a particular script
 

2543
00:47:17,390 --> 00:47:19,359
particular visual or a particular script
like is this motivating does this make

2544
00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:19,369
like is this motivating does this make
 

2545
00:47:19,369 --> 00:47:21,580
like is this motivating does this make
sense which has its downsides because

2546
00:47:21,580 --> 00:47:21,590
sense which has its downsides because
 

2547
00:47:21,590 --> 00:47:24,099
sense which has its downsides because
sometimes I find myself speaking to

2548
00:47:24,099 --> 00:47:24,109
sometimes I find myself speaking to
 

2549
00:47:24,109 --> 00:47:27,040
sometimes I find myself speaking to
motivations that only myself would be

2550
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:27,050
motivations that only myself would be
 

2551
00:47:27,050 --> 00:47:29,470
motivations that only myself would be
interested in I don't like it I did this

2552
00:47:29,470 --> 00:47:29,480
interested in I don't like it I did this
 

2553
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:31,990
interested in I don't like it I did this
project on quaternions where what I

2554
00:47:31,990 --> 00:47:32,000
project on quaternions where what I
 

2555
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,490
project on quaternions where what I
really wanted was to understand what are

2556
00:47:33,490 --> 00:47:33,500
really wanted was to understand what are
 

2557
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:35,290
really wanted was to understand what are
they doing in four dimensions can we see

2558
00:47:35,290 --> 00:47:35,300
they doing in four dimensions can we see
 

2559
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:36,490
they doing in four dimensions can we see
what they're doing in four dimensions

2560
00:47:36,490 --> 00:47:36,500
what they're doing in four dimensions
 

2561
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:40,240
what they're doing in four dimensions
right and I can way of thinking about it

2562
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:40,250
right and I can way of thinking about it
 

2563
00:47:40,250 --> 00:47:41,770
right and I can way of thinking about it
that really answered the question in my

2564
00:47:41,770 --> 00:47:41,780
that really answered the question in my
 

2565
00:47:41,780 --> 00:47:44,080
that really answered the question in my
head that maybe very satisfied and being

2566
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:44,090
head that maybe very satisfied and being
 

2567
00:47:44,090 --> 00:47:45,970
head that maybe very satisfied and being
able to think about concretely with a 3d

2568
00:47:45,970 --> 00:47:45,980
able to think about concretely with a 3d
 

2569
00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:47,859
able to think about concretely with a 3d
visual what are they doing to a 4d

2570
00:47:47,859 --> 00:47:47,869
visual what are they doing to a 4d
 

2571
00:47:47,869 --> 00:47:49,599
visual what are they doing to a 4d
sphere and some like great this is

2572
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:49,609
sphere and some like great this is
 

2573
00:47:49,609 --> 00:47:51,130
sphere and some like great this is
exactly what my past self would have

2574
00:47:51,130 --> 00:47:51,140
exactly what my past self would have
 

2575
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:52,390
exactly what my past self would have
wanted right and I make a thing on it

2576
00:47:52,390 --> 00:47:52,400
wanted right and I make a thing on it
 

2577
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:53,680
wanted right and I make a thing on it
and I'm sure it's what some other people

2578
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:53,690
and I'm sure it's what some other people
 

2579
00:47:53,690 --> 00:47:56,290
and I'm sure it's what some other people
wanted to it but in hindsight I think

2580
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:56,300
wanted to it but in hindsight I think
 

2581
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:57,340
wanted to it but in hindsight I think
most people who want to learn about

2582
00:47:57,340 --> 00:47:57,350
most people who want to learn about
 

2583
00:47:57,350 --> 00:48:00,010
most people who want to learn about
quaternions are like robotics engineers

2584
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:00,020
quaternions are like robotics engineers
 

2585
00:48:00,020 --> 00:48:02,650
quaternions are like robotics engineers
or graphics programmers who want to

2586
00:48:02,650 --> 00:48:02,660
or graphics programmers who want to
 

2587
00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:04,780
or graphics programmers who want to
understand how they're used to describe

2588
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:04,790
understand how they're used to describe
 

2589
00:48:04,790 --> 00:48:07,090
understand how they're used to describe
3d rotations and like their use case was

2590
00:48:07,090 --> 00:48:07,100
3d rotations and like their use case was
 

2591
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:08,530
3d rotations and like their use case was
actually a little bit different than my

2592
00:48:08,530 --> 00:48:08,540
actually a little bit different than my
 

2593
00:48:08,540 --> 00:48:10,330
actually a little bit different than my
past self and in that way like I

2594
00:48:10,330 --> 00:48:10,340
past self and in that way like I
 

2595
00:48:10,340 --> 00:48:11,920
past self and in that way like I
wouldn't actually recommend that video

2596
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:11,930
wouldn't actually recommend that video
 

2597
00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:14,320
wouldn't actually recommend that video
to people who are coming at it from that

2598
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:14,330
to people who are coming at it from that
 

2599
00:48:14,330 --> 00:48:16,060
to people who are coming at it from that
angle of wanting to know hey I'm a

2600
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:16,070
angle of wanting to know hey I'm a
 

2601
00:48:16,070 --> 00:48:18,460
angle of wanting to know hey I'm a
robotics program or like how do these

2602
00:48:18,460 --> 00:48:18,470
robotics program or like how do these
 

2603
00:48:18,470 --> 00:48:20,590
robotics program or like how do these
quarter neon things work to describe

2604
00:48:20,590 --> 00:48:20,600
quarter neon things work to describe
 

2605
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:24,160
quarter neon things work to describe
position in 3d space I would say other

2606
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:24,170
position in 3d space I would say other
 

2607
00:48:24,170 --> 00:48:26,020
position in 3d space I would say other
great resources for that if you ever

2608
00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:26,030
great resources for that if you ever
 

2609
00:48:26,030 --> 00:48:27,640
great resources for that if you ever
find yourself wanting to say

2610
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:27,650
find yourself wanting to say
 

2611
00:48:27,650 --> 00:48:29,590
find yourself wanting to say
but hang on in what sense are they

2612
00:48:29,590 --> 00:48:29,600
but hang on in what sense are they
 

2613
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:31,330
but hang on in what sense are they
acting in four dimensions then come back

2614
00:48:31,330 --> 00:48:31,340
acting in four dimensions then come back
 

2615
00:48:31,340 --> 00:48:33,820
acting in four dimensions then come back
but until then it's a little different

2616
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:33,830
but until then it's a little different
 

2617
00:48:33,830 --> 00:48:36,340
but until then it's a little different
yeah it's interesting because so you

2618
00:48:36,340 --> 00:48:36,350
yeah it's interesting because so you
 

2619
00:48:36,350 --> 00:48:38,620
yeah it's interesting because so you
have incredible videos on your networks

2620
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:38,630
have incredible videos on your networks
 

2621
00:48:38,630 --> 00:48:40,510
have incredible videos on your networks
for example and for my certain

2622
00:48:40,510 --> 00:48:40,520
for example and for my certain
 

2623
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:43,300
for example and for my certain
perspectives have probably I mean I

2624
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:43,310
perspectives have probably I mean I
 

2625
00:48:43,310 --> 00:48:47,020
perspectives have probably I mean I
looked at the is served my field and

2626
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:47,030
looked at the is served my field and
 

2627
00:48:47,030 --> 00:48:48,670
looked at the is served my field and
I've also looked at the basic

2628
00:48:48,670 --> 00:48:48,680
I've also looked at the basic
 

2629
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:50,260
I've also looked at the basic
introduction of neural networks like a

2630
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:50,270
introduction of neural networks like a
 

2631
00:48:50,270 --> 00:48:51,220
introduction of neural networks like a
million times from different

2632
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:51,230
million times from different
 

2633
00:48:51,230 --> 00:48:53,350
million times from different
perspectives and it made me realize that

2634
00:48:53,350 --> 00:48:53,360
perspectives and it made me realize that
 

2635
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:55,480
perspectives and it made me realize that
there's a lot of ways to present it so

2636
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:55,490
there's a lot of ways to present it so
 

2637
00:48:55,490 --> 00:48:58,390
there's a lot of ways to present it so
you were sort of you did an incredible

2638
00:48:58,390 --> 00:48:58,400
you were sort of you did an incredible
 

2639
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:00,720
you were sort of you did an incredible
job I mean sort of the

2640
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:00,730
job I mean sort of the
 

2641
00:49:00,730 --> 00:49:03,280
job I mean sort of the
but you could also do it differently and

2642
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:03,290
but you could also do it differently and
 

2643
00:49:03,290 --> 00:49:07,210
but you could also do it differently and
also incredible like to create a

2644
00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:07,220
also incredible like to create a
 

2645
00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:09,370
also incredible like to create a
beautiful presentation of a basic

2646
00:49:09,370 --> 00:49:09,380
beautiful presentation of a basic
 

2647
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:14,110
beautiful presentation of a basic
concept is requires sort of creativity

2648
00:49:14,110 --> 00:49:14,120
concept is requires sort of creativity
 

2649
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:16,420
concept is requires sort of creativity
requires genius and so on but you can

2650
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:16,430
requires genius and so on but you can
 

2651
00:49:16,430 --> 00:49:17,710
requires genius and so on but you can
take it from a bunch of different

2652
00:49:17,710 --> 00:49:17,720
take it from a bunch of different
 

2653
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:19,810
take it from a bunch of different
perspectives in that video and you'll

2654
00:49:19,810 --> 00:49:19,820
perspectives in that video and you'll
 

2655
00:49:19,820 --> 00:49:21,280
perspectives in that video and you'll
know which mean you realize that and

2656
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:21,290
know which mean you realize that and
 

2657
00:49:21,290 --> 00:49:23,560
know which mean you realize that and
just as you're saying you kind of have a

2658
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:23,570
just as you're saying you kind of have a
 

2659
00:49:23,570 --> 00:49:27,550
just as you're saying you kind of have a
certain mindset a certain view but from

2660
00:49:27,550 --> 00:49:27,560
certain mindset a certain view but from
 

2661
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:29,170
certain mindset a certain view but from
if you take a different view from a

2662
00:49:29,170 --> 00:49:29,180
if you take a different view from a
 

2663
00:49:29,180 --> 00:49:32,770
if you take a different view from a
physics perspective from a neuroscience

2664
00:49:32,770 --> 00:49:32,780
physics perspective from a neuroscience
 

2665
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:33,970
physics perspective from a neuroscience
perspective talking about neural

2666
00:49:33,970 --> 00:49:33,980
perspective talking about neural
 

2667
00:49:33,980 --> 00:49:37,990
perspective talking about neural
networks or from robotics perspective or

2668
00:49:37,990 --> 00:49:38,000
networks or from robotics perspective or
 

2669
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,260
networks or from robotics perspective or
from let's see from a pure learning

2670
00:49:41,260 --> 00:49:41,270
from let's see from a pure learning
 

2671
00:49:41,270 --> 00:49:44,140
from let's see from a pure learning
statistics perspective so you you can

2672
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:44,150
statistics perspective so you you can
 

2673
00:49:44,150 --> 00:49:46,120
statistics perspective so you you can
create totally different videos and

2674
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:46,130
create totally different videos and
 

2675
00:49:46,130 --> 00:49:47,680
create totally different videos and
you've done that with a few actually

2676
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:47,690
you've done that with a few actually
 

2677
00:49:47,690 --> 00:49:49,360
you've done that with a few actually
concepts where you've have taken

2678
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:49,370
concepts where you've have taken
 

2679
00:49:49,370 --> 00:49:52,810
concepts where you've have taken
different costs like at the at the at

2680
00:49:52,810 --> 00:49:52,820
different costs like at the at the at
 

2681
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:55,000
different costs like at the at the at
the Euler equation right the you've

2682
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:55,010
the Euler equation right the you've
 

2683
00:49:55,010 --> 00:49:57,160
the Euler equation right the you've
taken different views of that I think

2684
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:57,170
taken different views of that I think
 

2685
00:49:57,170 --> 00:49:58,870
taken different views of that I think
I've made three videos on it and I

2686
00:49:58,870 --> 00:49:58,880
I've made three videos on it and I
 

2687
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:01,200
I've made three videos on it and I
definitely will make at least one more

2688
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:01,210
definitely will make at least one more
 

2689
00:50:01,210 --> 00:50:04,540
definitely will make at least one more
never enough never enough so you don't

2690
00:50:04,540 --> 00:50:04,550
never enough never enough so you don't
 

2691
00:50:04,550 --> 00:50:05,650
never enough never enough so you don't
think it's the most beautiful equation

2692
00:50:05,650 --> 00:50:05,660
think it's the most beautiful equation
 

2693
00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:08,980
think it's the most beautiful equation
in mathematics no like I said as we

2694
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:08,990
in mathematics no like I said as we
 

2695
00:50:08,990 --> 00:50:10,570
in mathematics no like I said as we
represent it it's one of the most

2696
00:50:10,570 --> 00:50:10,580
represent it it's one of the most
 

2697
00:50:10,580 --> 00:50:12,580
represent it it's one of the most
hideous it involves a lot of the most

2698
00:50:12,580 --> 00:50:12,590
hideous it involves a lot of the most
 

2699
00:50:12,590 --> 00:50:14,140
hideous it involves a lot of the most
hideous aspects of our notation I talked

2700
00:50:14,140 --> 00:50:14,150
hideous aspects of our notation I talked
 

2701
00:50:14,150 --> 00:50:16,090
hideous aspects of our notation I talked
about II the fact that we use PI instead

2702
00:50:16,090 --> 00:50:16,100
about II the fact that we use PI instead
 

2703
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:19,510
about II the fact that we use PI instead
of tau the fact that we call imaginary

2704
00:50:19,510 --> 00:50:19,520
of tau the fact that we call imaginary
 

2705
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:22,180
of tau the fact that we call imaginary
numbers imaginary and then and actually

2706
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:22,190
numbers imaginary and then and actually
 

2707
00:50:22,190 --> 00:50:23,770
numbers imaginary and then and actually
wonder if we use the I because of

2708
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:23,780
wonder if we use the I because of
 

2709
00:50:23,780 --> 00:50:25,360
wonder if we use the I because of
imaginary I don't know if that's

2710
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:25,370
imaginary I don't know if that's
 

2711
00:50:25,370 --> 00:50:27,310
imaginary I don't know if that's
historically accurate but at least a lot

2712
00:50:27,310 --> 00:50:27,320
historically accurate but at least a lot
 

2713
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:28,660
historically accurate but at least a lot
of people they read the eye and they

2714
00:50:28,660 --> 00:50:28,670
of people they read the eye and they
 

2715
00:50:28,670 --> 00:50:31,000
of people they read the eye and they
think imaginary like all three of those

2716
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:31,010
think imaginary like all three of those
 

2717
00:50:31,010 --> 00:50:32,650
think imaginary like all three of those
facts it's like those are things that

2718
00:50:32,650 --> 00:50:32,660
facts it's like those are things that
 

2719
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:33,850
facts it's like those are things that
have added more confusion than they

2720
00:50:33,850 --> 00:50:33,860
have added more confusion than they
 

2721
00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:35,200
have added more confusion than they
needed to and we're wrapping them up in

2722
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:35,210
needed to and we're wrapping them up in
 

2723
00:50:35,210 --> 00:50:36,790
needed to and we're wrapping them up in
one equation like boy that's just very

2724
00:50:36,790 --> 00:50:36,800
one equation like boy that's just very
 

2725
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:40,150
one equation like boy that's just very
hideous right the idea is that it does

2726
00:50:40,150 --> 00:50:40,160
hideous right the idea is that it does
 

2727
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:41,270
hideous right the idea is that it does
tie together when you want

2728
00:50:41,270 --> 00:50:41,280
tie together when you want
 

2729
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:43,070
tie together when you want
away the notation look it's okay it's

2730
00:50:43,070 --> 00:50:43,080
away the notation look it's okay it's
 

2731
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:46,120
away the notation look it's okay it's
pretty it's nice but it's not like

2732
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:46,130
pretty it's nice but it's not like
 

2733
00:50:46,130 --> 00:50:48,380
pretty it's nice but it's not like
mind-blowing greatest thing in the

2734
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:48,390
mind-blowing greatest thing in the
 

2735
00:50:48,390 --> 00:50:50,270
mind-blowing greatest thing in the
universe which is maybe what I was

2736
00:50:50,270 --> 00:50:50,280
universe which is maybe what I was
 

2737
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:52,490
universe which is maybe what I was
thinking of when I said like once you

2738
00:50:52,490 --> 00:50:52,500
thinking of when I said like once you
 

2739
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:54,800
thinking of when I said like once you
understand something it doesn't have the

2740
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:54,810
understand something it doesn't have the
 

2741
00:50:54,810 --> 00:50:57,080
understand something it doesn't have the
same beauty like I feel like I

2742
00:50:57,080 --> 00:50:57,090
same beauty like I feel like I
 

2743
00:50:57,090 --> 00:50:59,300
same beauty like I feel like I
understand Euler's formula and I feel

2744
00:50:59,300 --> 00:50:59,310
understand Euler's formula and I feel
 

2745
00:50:59,310 --> 00:51:02,180
understand Euler's formula and I feel
like I understand it enough to sort of

2746
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:02,190
like I understand it enough to sort of
 

2747
00:51:02,190 --> 00:51:04,490
like I understand it enough to sort of
see the version that just woke up

2748
00:51:04,490 --> 00:51:04,500
see the version that just woke up
 

2749
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:06,890
see the version that just woke up
it hasn't really gotten itself dressed

2750
00:51:06,890 --> 00:51:06,900
it hasn't really gotten itself dressed
 

2751
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:08,090
it hasn't really gotten itself dressed
in the morning that's a little bit

2752
00:51:08,090 --> 00:51:08,100
in the morning that's a little bit
 

2753
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:09,680
in the morning that's a little bit
groggy and there's bags under its eyes

2754
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:09,690
groggy and there's bags under its eyes
 

2755
00:51:09,690 --> 00:51:11,900
groggy and there's bags under its eyes
so years like it's their past yeah the

2756
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:11,910
so years like it's their past yeah the
 

2757
00:51:11,910 --> 00:51:14,000
so years like it's their past yeah the
the the dating stage you know we're no

2758
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:14,010
the the dating stage you know we're no
 

2759
00:51:14,010 --> 00:51:15,590
the the dating stage you know we're no
longer dating right instead of dating

2760
00:51:15,590 --> 00:51:15,600
longer dating right instead of dating
 

2761
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:17,180
longer dating right instead of dating
Bizet des function this head like she's

2762
00:51:17,180 --> 00:51:17,190
Bizet des function this head like she's
 

2763
00:51:17,190 --> 00:51:19,760
Bizet des function this head like she's
beautiful and right and like we have fun

2764
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:19,770
beautiful and right and like we have fun
 

2765
00:51:19,770 --> 00:51:22,250
beautiful and right and like we have fun
and it's that that high dopamine part

2766
00:51:22,250 --> 00:51:22,260
and it's that that high dopamine part
 

2767
00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:24,290
and it's that that high dopamine part
for like maybe at some point will settle

2768
00:51:24,290 --> 00:51:24,300
for like maybe at some point will settle
 

2769
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:26,240
for like maybe at some point will settle
into the more mundane nature the

2770
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:26,250
into the more mundane nature the
 

2771
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:27,620
into the more mundane nature the
relationship where I like see her for

2772
00:51:27,620 --> 00:51:27,630
relationship where I like see her for
 

2773
00:51:27,630 --> 00:51:29,090
relationship where I like see her for
who she truly is and she'll still be

2774
00:51:29,090 --> 00:51:29,100
who she truly is and she'll still be
 

2775
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:30,620
who she truly is and she'll still be
beautiful in her own way but it won't

2776
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:30,630
beautiful in her own way but it won't
 

2777
00:51:30,630 --> 00:51:33,230
beautiful in her own way but it won't
have the same romantic pizzazz right

2778
00:51:33,230 --> 00:51:33,240
have the same romantic pizzazz right
 

2779
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:34,730
have the same romantic pizzazz right
well that's the nice thing about

2780
00:51:34,730 --> 00:51:34,740
well that's the nice thing about
 

2781
00:51:34,740 --> 00:51:37,790
well that's the nice thing about
mathematics I think as long as you don't

2782
00:51:37,790 --> 00:51:37,800
mathematics I think as long as you don't
 

2783
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:40,520
mathematics I think as long as you don't
live forever there will always be enough

2784
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:40,530
live forever there will always be enough
 

2785
00:51:40,530 --> 00:51:42,320
live forever there will always be enough
mystery and fun with some of the

2786
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:42,330
mystery and fun with some of the
 

2787
00:51:42,330 --> 00:51:44,540
mystery and fun with some of the
equations even if you do the rate at

2788
00:51:44,540 --> 00:51:44,550
equations even if you do the rate at
 

2789
00:51:44,550 --> 00:51:45,920
equations even if you do the rate at
which questions comes up is much faster

2790
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:45,930
which questions comes up is much faster
 

2791
00:51:45,930 --> 00:51:47,390
which questions comes up is much faster
than the rate at which answers come up

2792
00:51:47,390 --> 00:51:47,400
than the rate at which answers come up
 

2793
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:50,260
than the rate at which answers come up
so if you could live forever would you I

2794
00:51:50,260 --> 00:51:50,270
so if you could live forever would you I
 

2795
00:51:50,270 --> 00:51:53,000
so if you could live forever would you I
think so yeah do you think you don't

2796
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:53,010
think so yeah do you think you don't
 

2797
00:51:53,010 --> 00:51:54,470
think so yeah do you think you don't
think mortality is the thing that makes

2798
00:51:54,470 --> 00:51:54,480
think mortality is the thing that makes
 

2799
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:57,260
think mortality is the thing that makes
life meaningful would your life be four

2800
00:51:57,260 --> 00:51:57,270
life meaningful would your life be four
 

2801
00:51:57,270 --> 00:52:00,620
life meaningful would your life be four
times as meaningful if you died at 25 so

2802
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:00,630
times as meaningful if you died at 25 so
 

2803
00:52:00,630 --> 00:52:02,930
times as meaningful if you died at 25 so
this goes to infinity I think you and I

2804
00:52:02,930 --> 00:52:02,940
this goes to infinity I think you and I
 

2805
00:52:02,940 --> 00:52:05,540
this goes to infinity I think you and I
that's really interesting so what I said

2806
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:05,550
that's really interesting so what I said
 

2807
00:52:05,550 --> 00:52:08,450
that's really interesting so what I said
is infinite not not four times longer

2808
00:52:08,450 --> 00:52:08,460
is infinite not not four times longer
 

2809
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:12,290
is infinite not not four times longer
mm-hmm I said infinite so the the actual

2810
00:52:12,290 --> 00:52:12,300
mm-hmm I said infinite so the the actual
 

2811
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:15,350
mm-hmm I said infinite so the the actual
existence of the finiteness the

2812
00:52:15,350 --> 00:52:15,360
existence of the finiteness the
 

2813
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:17,210
existence of the finiteness the
existence of the end no matter the

2814
00:52:17,210 --> 00:52:17,220
existence of the end no matter the
 

2815
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:20,030
existence of the end no matter the
length is the thing that may sort of

2816
00:52:20,030 --> 00:52:20,040

is that most of my life I'm not thinking
about death but I still feel very

2856
00:53:10,130 --> 00:53:10,140
about death but I still feel very
 

2857
00:53:10,140 --> 00:53:12,229
about death but I still feel very
motivated to like make things and to

2863
00:53:15,509 --> 00:53:18,019
experienced love or things like that I'm
very motivated and I it's strange that

2864
00:53:18,019 --> 00:53:18,029
very motivated and I it's strange that
 

2865
00:53:18,029 --> 00:53:20,599
very motivated and I it's strange that
that motivation comes while death is not

2866
00:53:20,599 --> 00:53:20,609
that motivation comes while death is not
 

2867
00:53:20,609 --> 00:53:22,189
that motivation comes while death is not
in my mind at all and this might just be

00:53:22,189 --> 00:53:22,199
in my mind at all and this might just be
 

2869
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:23,870
in my mind at all and this might just be
because I'm young enough that it's not

2870
00:53:23,870 --> 00:53:23,880
because I'm young enough that it's not
 

2871

because I'm young enough that it's not

that you were instructed an illusion

2874
00:53:27,649 --> 00:53:27,659
that you were instructed an illusion
 

2875
00:53:27,659 --> 00:53:30,109
that you were instructed an illusion
that allows you to escape the fact of

that allows you to escape the fact of

to me I mean when I look at math when I
 

2893
00:53:48,089 --> 00:53:50,149
to me I mean when I look at math when I
look at science is the kind of an escape

look at science is the kind of an escape
 

2895
00:53:50,159 --> 00:53:53,390
look at science is the kind of an escape

so when do you know when the video is

2956
00:55:17,670 --> 00:55:17,680
so when do you know when the video is
 

2957
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:20,430
so when do you know when the video is
done when you're working on it

2958
00:55:20,430 --> 00:55:20,440
done when you're working on it
 

2959
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:22,320
done when you're working on it
that's pretty easy actually because I'm

2960
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:22,330
that's pretty easy actually because I'm
 

2961
00:55:22,330 --> 00:55:24,720
that's pretty easy actually because I'm
you know I'll write the script I want

2962
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:24,730
you know I'll write the script I want
 

2963
00:55:24,730 --> 00:55:26,400
you know I'll write the script I want
there to be some kind of aha moment in

2964
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:26,410
there to be some kind of aha moment in
 

2965
00:55:26,410 --> 00:55:28,140
there to be some kind of aha moment in
there and then hopefully the script can

2966
00:55:28,140 --> 00:55:28,150
there and then hopefully the script can
 

2967
00:55:28,150 --> 00:55:29,790
there and then hopefully the script can
revolve around some kind of aha moment

2968
00:55:29,790 --> 00:55:29,800
revolve around some kind of aha moment
 

2969
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:31,710
revolve around some kind of aha moment
and then from there you know you're

2970
00:55:31,710 --> 00:55:31,720
and then from there you know you're
 

2971
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:33,420
and then from there you know you're
putting visuals to each sentence that

2972
00:55:33,420 --> 00:55:33,430
putting visuals to each sentence that
 

2973
00:55:33,430 --> 00:55:35,310
putting visuals to each sentence that
exists and then you narrate it you edit

2974
00:55:35,310 --> 00:55:35,320
exists and then you narrate it you edit
 

2975
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:37,170
exists and then you narrate it you edit
it all together so given that there's a

00:55:37,170 --> 00:55:37,180
it all together so given that there's a
 

2977
00:55:37,180 --> 00:55:39,410
it all together so given that there's a
script the the end becomes quite clear

2978
00:55:39,410 --> 00:55:39,420
script the the end becomes quite clear
 

2979
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:43,350
script the the end becomes quite clear
and you know you're as I as I animated I

2980
00:55:43,350 --> 00:55:43,360
and you know you're as I as I animated I

but it's a very deterministic process at
 

2987
00:55:51,940 --> 00:55:54,090
but it's a very deterministic process at
that point it makes it much easier to

2988
00:55:54,090 --> 00:55:54,100
that point it makes it much easier to
 

2989
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:55,950
that point it makes it much easier to

2994
00:55:59,250 --> 00:55:59,260
like for problem-solving videos that's
 

2995
00:55:59,260 --> 00:56:01,020
like for problem-solving videos that's
quite simple it's it's once you feel

2996
00:56:01,020 --> 00:56:01,030
quite simple it's it's once you feel
 

2997
00:56:01,030 --> 00:56:02,220
quite simple it's it's once you feel
like someone who didn't understand the

2998
00:56:02,220 --> 00:56:02,230
like someone who didn't understand the
 

2999
00:56:02,230 --> 00:56:03,990
like someone who didn't understand the
solution now could for things like

3000
00:56:03,990 --> 00:56:04,000
solution now could for things like
 

3001
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,310
solution now could for things like
neural networks that was a lot harder

3002
00:56:05,310 --> 00:56:05,320
neural networks that was a lot harder
 

3003
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:06,990
neural networks that was a lot harder
because like you said there's so many

3004
00:56:06,990 --> 00:56:07,000
because like you said there's so many
 

3005
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,420
because like you said there's so many
angles at which you could attack it and

3006
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:09,430
angles at which you could attack it and
 

3007
00:56:09,430 --> 00:56:11,820
angles at which you could attack it and
there it's it's just at some point you

3008
00:56:11,820 --> 00:56:11,830
there it's it's just at some point you
 

3009
00:56:11,830 --> 00:56:15,180
there it's it's just at some point you
feel like this this asks a meaningful

3010
00:56:15,180 --> 00:56:15,190
feel like this this asks a meaningful
 

3011
00:56:15,190 --> 00:56:16,500
feel like this this asks a meaningful
question and it answers that question

3012
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:16,510
question and it answers that question
 

3013
00:56:16,510 --> 00:56:20,160
question and it answers that question
right what is the best way to learn math

3014
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:20,170
right what is the best way to learn math
 

3015
00:56:20,170 --> 00:56:21,690
right what is the best way to learn math
for people who might be at the beginning

3016
00:56:21,690 --> 00:56:21,700
for people who might be at the beginning
 

3017
00:56:21,700 --> 00:56:23,730
for people who might be at the beginning
of that journey I think that's a it's a

3018
00:56:23,730 --> 00:56:23,740
of that journey I think that's a it's a
 

3019
00:56:23,740 --> 00:56:25,380
of that journey I think that's a it's a
question that a lot of folks kind of ask

3020
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:25,390
question that a lot of folks kind of ask
 

3021
00:56:25,390 --> 00:56:27,510
question that a lot of folks kind of ask
and think about and it doesn't even for

3022
00:56:27,510 --> 00:56:27,520
and think about and it doesn't even for
 

3023
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:28,800
and think about and it doesn't even for
folks who are not really at the

3024
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:28,810
folks who are not really at the
 

3025
00:56:28,810 --> 00:56:30,720
folks who are not really at the
beginning of their journey like there

3026
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:30,730
beginning of their journey like there
 

3027
00:56:30,730 --> 00:56:33,330
beginning of their journey like there
might be actually is deep in their

3028
00:56:33,330 --> 00:56:33,340
might be actually is deep in their
 

3029
00:56:33,340 --> 00:56:35,760
might be actually is deep in their
career some type they've taken college a

3030
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:35,770
career some type they've taken college a
 

3031
00:56:35,770 --> 00:56:37,320
career some type they've taken college a
taking calculus and so on but still

3032
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:37,330
taking calculus and so on but still
 

3033
00:56:37,330 --> 00:56:39,930
taking calculus and so on but still
wanna sort of explore math well what

3034
00:56:39,930 --> 00:56:39,940
wanna sort of explore math well what
 

3035
00:56:39,940 --> 00:56:41,070
wanna sort of explore math well what
would be your advice instead of

3036
00:56:41,070 --> 00:56:41,080
would be your advice instead of
 

3037
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:43,500
would be your advice instead of
education at all ages your temptation

3038
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:43,510
education at all ages your temptation
 

3039
00:56:43,510 --> 00:56:46,290
education at all ages your temptation
will be to spend more time like watching

3040
00:56:46,290 --> 00:56:46,300
will be to spend more time like watching
 

3041
00:56:46,300 --> 00:56:49,080
will be to spend more time like watching
lectures or reading try to force

3042
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:49,090
lectures or reading try to force
 

3043
00:56:49,090 --> 00:56:50,700
lectures or reading try to force
yourself to do more problems than you

3044
00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:50,710
yourself to do more problems than you
 

3045
00:56:50,710 --> 00:56:53,430
yourself to do more problems than you
naturally would that's a big one like

3046
00:56:53,430 --> 00:56:53,440
naturally would that's a big one like
 

3047
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:55,800
naturally would that's a big one like
the the focus time that you're spending

3048
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:55,810
the the focus time that you're spending
 

3049
00:56:55,810 --> 00:56:57,840
the the focus time that you're spending
should be on like solving specific

3050
00:56:57,840 --> 00:56:57,850
should be on like solving specific
 

3051
00:56:57,850 --> 00:57:00,450
should be on like solving specific
problems and seek entities that have

3052
00:57:00,450 --> 00:57:00,460
problems and seek entities that have
 

3053
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:02,609
problems and seek entities that have
well curated lists of problems so go

3054
00:57:02,609 --> 00:57:02,619
well curated lists of problems so go
 

3055
00:57:02,619 --> 00:57:04,680
well curated lists of problems so go
into like a textbook almost in and the

3056
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:04,690
into like a textbook almost in and the
 

3057
00:57:04,690 --> 00:57:07,349
into like a textbook almost in and the
problems in the back of a text and back

3058
00:57:07,349 --> 00:57:07,359
problems in the back of a text and back
 

3059
00:57:07,359 --> 00:57:09,359
problems in the back of a text and back
of a chapter so if you can take a little

3060
00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:09,369
of a chapter so if you can take a little
 

3061
00:57:09,369 --> 00:57:10,740
of a chapter so if you can take a little
look through those questions at the end

3062
00:57:10,740 --> 00:57:10,750
look through those questions at the end
 

3063
00:57:10,750 --> 00:57:11,880
look through those questions at the end
of the chapter before you read the

3064
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:11,890
of the chapter before you read the
 

3065
00:57:11,890 --> 00:57:13,500
of the chapter before you read the
chapter a lot of them won't make sense

3066
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:13,510
chapter a lot of them won't make sense
 

3067
00:57:13,510 --> 00:57:15,150
chapter a lot of them won't make sense
some of them might and those are those

3068
00:57:15,150 --> 00:57:15,160
some of them might and those are those
 

3069
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:16,710
some of them might and those are those
are the best ones to think about a lot

3070
00:57:16,710 --> 00:57:16,720
are the best ones to think about a lot
 

3071
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:18,000
are the best ones to think about a lot
of them won't but just you know take a

3072
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:18,010
of them won't but just you know take a
 

3073
00:57:18,010 --> 00:57:19,680
of them won't but just you know take a
quick look and then read a little bit of

3074
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:19,690
quick look and then read a little bit of
 

3075
00:57:19,690 --> 00:57:20,130
quick look and then read a little bit of
the chapter

3076
00:57:20,130 --> 00:57:20,140
the chapter
 

3077
00:57:20,140 --> 00:57:21,450
the chapter
and maybe take a look again and things

3078
00:57:21,450 --> 00:57:21,460
and maybe take a look again and things
 

3079
00:57:21,460 --> 00:57:23,610
and maybe take a look again and things
like that and don't consider yourself

3080
00:57:23,610 --> 00:57:23,620
like that and don't consider yourself
 

3081
00:57:23,620 --> 00:57:25,560
like that and don't consider yourself
done with the chapter until you've

3082
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:25,570
done with the chapter until you've
 

3083
00:57:25,570 --> 00:57:27,060
done with the chapter until you've
actually worked through a couple

3084
00:57:27,060 --> 00:57:27,070
actually worked through a couple
 

3085
00:57:27,070 --> 00:57:30,480
actually worked through a couple
exercises right and and this is so

3086
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:30,490
exercises right and and this is so
 

3087
00:57:30,490 --> 00:57:31,650
exercises right and and this is so
hypocritical right because I like put

3088
00:57:31,650 --> 00:57:31,660
hypocritical right because I like put
 

3089
00:57:31,660 --> 00:57:34,080
hypocritical right because I like put
out videos that pretty much never have

3090
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:34,090
out videos that pretty much never have
 

3091
00:57:34,090 --> 00:57:36,450
out videos that pretty much never have
associated exercises I just view myself

3092
00:57:36,450 --> 00:57:36,460
associated exercises I just view myself
 

3093
00:57:36,460 --> 00:57:37,760
associated exercises I just view myself
as a different part of the ecosystem

3094
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:37,770
as a different part of the ecosystem
 

3095
00:57:37,770 --> 00:57:40,860
as a different part of the ecosystem
which means I'm kind of admitting that

3096
00:57:40,860 --> 00:57:40,870
which means I'm kind of admitting that
 

3097
00:57:40,870 --> 00:57:43,230
which means I'm kind of admitting that
you're not really learning or at least

3098
00:57:43,230 --> 00:57:43,240
you're not really learning or at least
 

3099
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:44,820
you're not really learning or at least
this is only a partial part of the

3100
00:57:44,820 --> 00:57:44,830
this is only a partial part of the
 

3101
00:57:44,830 --> 00:57:45,900
this is only a partial part of the
learning process if you're watching

3102
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:45,910
learning process if you're watching
 

3103
00:57:45,910 --> 00:57:47,490
learning process if you're watching
these videos

3104
00:57:47,490 --> 00:57:47,500
these videos
 

3105
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:49,440
these videos
I think if someone's at the very

3106
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:49,450
I think if someone's at the very
 

3107
00:57:49,450 --> 00:57:51,480
I think if someone's at the very
beginning like I do think Khan Academy

3108
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:51,490
beginning like I do think Khan Academy
 

3109
00:57:51,490 --> 00:57:53,520
beginning like I do think Khan Academy
does a good job they have a pretty large

3110
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:53,530
does a good job they have a pretty large
 

3111
00:57:53,530 --> 00:57:55,350
does a good job they have a pretty large
set of questions you can work through

3112
00:57:55,350 --> 00:57:55,360
set of questions you can work through
 

3113
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:58,080
set of questions you can work through
just a very basic sort of just picking

3114
00:57:58,080 --> 00:57:58,090
just a very basic sort of just picking
 

3115
00:57:58,090 --> 00:57:59,730
just a very basic sort of just picking
picking out getting getting comfortable

3116
00:57:59,730 --> 00:57:59,740
picking out getting getting comfortable
 

3117
00:57:59,740 --> 00:58:02,010
picking out getting getting comfortable
is a very basically algebra calculus fun

3118
00:58:02,010 --> 00:58:02,020
is a very basically algebra calculus fun
 

3119
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:04,920
is a very basically algebra calculus fun
Khan Academy programming is actually I

3120
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:04,930
Khan Academy programming is actually I
 

3121
00:58:04,930 --> 00:58:06,780
Khan Academy programming is actually I
think a great like learned to program

3122
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:06,790
think a great like learned to program
 

3123
00:58:06,790 --> 00:58:08,880
think a great like learned to program
and like let the way the math is

3124
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:08,890
and like let the way the math is
 

3125
00:58:08,890 --> 00:58:10,830
and like let the way the math is
motivated from that angle push you

3126
00:58:10,830 --> 00:58:10,840
motivated from that angle push you
 

3127
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:12,840
motivated from that angle push you
through I know a lot of people who

3128
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:12,850
through I know a lot of people who
 

3129
00:58:12,850 --> 00:58:15,120
through I know a lot of people who
didn't like math got into programming in

3130
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:15,130
didn't like math got into programming in
 

3131
00:58:15,130 --> 00:58:16,320
didn't like math got into programming in
some way and that's what turned them on

3132
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:16,330
some way and that's what turned them on
 

3133
00:58:16,330 --> 00:58:18,480
some way and that's what turned them on
to math maybe I'm biased cuz like I live

3134
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:18,490
to math maybe I'm biased cuz like I live
 

3135
00:58:18,490 --> 00:58:20,040
to math maybe I'm biased cuz like I live
in the Bay Area so I'm more likely to

3136
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:20,050
in the Bay Area so I'm more likely to
 

3137
00:58:20,050 --> 00:58:22,590
in the Bay Area so I'm more likely to
run into someone who has that phenotype

3138
00:58:22,590 --> 00:58:22,600
run into someone who has that phenotype
 

3139
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:25,890
run into someone who has that phenotype
but I am willing to speculate that that

3140
00:58:25,890 --> 00:58:25,900
but I am willing to speculate that that
 

3141
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:28,260
but I am willing to speculate that that
is a more generalizable path so you

3142
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:28,270
is a more generalizable path so you
 

3143
00:58:28,270 --> 00:58:30,000
is a more generalizable path so you
yourself kind of in creating the videos

3144
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:30,010
yourself kind of in creating the videos
 

3145
00:58:30,010 --> 00:58:31,980
yourself kind of in creating the videos
are using programming to illuminate a

3146
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:31,990
are using programming to illuminate a
 

3147
00:58:31,990 --> 00:58:35,160
are using programming to illuminate a
concept but for yourself as well so

3148
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:35,170
concept but for yourself as well so
 

3149
00:58:35,170 --> 00:58:36,960
concept but for yourself as well so
would you recommend somebody try to make

3150
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:36,970
would you recommend somebody try to make
 

3151
00:58:36,970 --> 00:58:39,630
would you recommend somebody try to make
a sort of almost like try to make videos

3152
00:58:39,630 --> 00:58:39,640
a sort of almost like try to make videos
 

3153
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:42,330
a sort of almost like try to make videos
like you do what's the one thing I've

3154
00:58:42,330 --> 00:58:42,340
like you do what's the one thing I've
 

3155
00:58:42,340 --> 00:58:43,680
like you do what's the one thing I've
heard before I don't know if this is

3156
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:43,690
heard before I don't know if this is
 

3157
00:58:43,690 --> 00:58:45,060
heard before I don't know if this is
based on any actual study this might be

3158
00:58:45,060 --> 00:58:45,070
based on any actual study this might be
 

3159
00:58:45,070 --> 00:58:46,770
based on any actual study this might be
like a total fictional anecdote of

3160
00:58:46,770 --> 00:58:46,780
like a total fictional anecdote of
 

3161
00:58:46,780 --> 00:58:48,630
like a total fictional anecdote of
numbers but it rings in the mind as

3162
00:58:48,630 --> 00:58:48,640
numbers but it rings in the mind as
 

3163
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:50,820
numbers but it rings in the mind as
being true you remember about 10 percent

3164
00:58:50,820 --> 00:58:50,830
being true you remember about 10 percent
 

3165
00:58:50,830 --> 00:58:52,920
being true you remember about 10 percent
of what you read you remember about 20%

3166
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:52,930
of what you read you remember about 20%
 

3167
00:58:52,930 --> 00:58:55,560
of what you read you remember about 20%
of what you listen to remember about 70%

3168
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:55,570
of what you listen to remember about 70%
 

3169
00:58:55,570 --> 00:58:57,360
of what you listen to remember about 70%
of what you actively interact with in

3170
00:58:57,360 --> 00:58:57,370
of what you actively interact with in
 

3171
00:58:57,370 --> 00:58:59,250
of what you actively interact with in
some way and then about 90% of what you

3172
00:58:59,250 --> 00:58:59,260
some way and then about 90% of what you
 

3173
00:58:59,260 --> 00:59:01,710
some way and then about 90% of what you
teach this is a thing I heard again

3174
00:59:01,710 --> 00:59:01,720
teach this is a thing I heard again
 

3175
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:03,540
teach this is a thing I heard again
those numbers might be meaningless but

3176
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:03,550
those numbers might be meaningless but
 

3177
00:59:03,550 --> 00:59:04,680
those numbers might be meaningless but
they bring true don't they

3178
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:04,690
they bring true don't they
 

3179
00:59:04,690 --> 00:59:07,110
they bring true don't they
right I'm willing to say I learned the

3180
00:59:07,110 --> 00:59:07,120
right I'm willing to say I learned the
 

3181
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:09,300
right I'm willing to say I learned the
nine times better than reading that

3182
00:59:09,300 --> 00:59:09,310
nine times better than reading that
 

3183
00:59:09,310 --> 00:59:12,090
nine times better than reading that
might even be a lowball yeah right so so

3184
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:12,100
might even be a lowball yeah right so so
 

3185
00:59:12,100 --> 00:59:13,320
might even be a lowball yeah right so so
doing something to teach or to like

3186
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:13,330
doing something to teach or to like
 

3187
00:59:13,330 --> 00:59:15,630
doing something to teach or to like
actively try to explain things is huge

3188
00:59:15,630 --> 00:59:15,640
actively try to explain things is huge
 

3189
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:17,910
actively try to explain things is huge
for consolidating the knowledge outside

3190
00:59:17,910 --> 00:59:17,920
for consolidating the knowledge outside
 

3191
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:20,250
for consolidating the knowledge outside
of family and friends is there a moment

3192
00:59:20,250 --> 00:59:20,260
of family and friends is there a moment
 

3193
00:59:20,260 --> 00:59:22,920
of family and friends is there a moment
you can remember that you would like to

3194
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:22,930
you can remember that you would like to
 

3195
00:59:22,930 --> 00:59:25,410
you can remember that you would like to
relive because it made you truly happy

3196
00:59:25,410 --> 00:59:25,420
relive because it made you truly happy
 

3197
00:59:25,420 --> 00:59:28,770
relive because it made you truly happy
or it was transformative in some

3198
00:59:28,770 --> 00:59:28,780
or it was transformative in some
 

3199
00:59:28,780 --> 00:59:30,900
or it was transformative in some
fundamental way a moment that was

3200
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:30,910
fundamental way a moment that was
 

3201
00:59:30,910 --> 00:59:31,770
fundamental way a moment that was
transformed

3202
00:59:31,770 --> 00:59:31,780
transformed
 

3203
00:59:31,780 --> 00:59:35,640
transformed
or made you truly happy yeah I think

3204
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:35,650
or made you truly happy yeah I think
 

3205
00:59:35,650 --> 00:59:37,650
or made you truly happy yeah I think
there's times like music used to be a

3206
00:59:37,650 --> 00:59:37,660
there's times like music used to be a
 

3207
00:59:37,660 --> 00:59:39,030
there's times like music used to be a
much bigger part of my life than it is

3208
00:59:39,030 --> 00:59:39,040
much bigger part of my life than it is
 

3209
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:39,450
much bigger part of my life than it is
now

3210
00:59:39,450 --> 00:59:39,460
now
 

3211
00:59:39,460 --> 00:59:40,980
now
like when I was a let's say a teenager

3212
00:59:40,980 --> 00:59:40,990
like when I was a let's say a teenager
 

3213
00:59:40,990 --> 00:59:43,230
like when I was a let's say a teenager
and I can think of sometimes in like

3214
00:59:43,230 --> 00:59:43,240
and I can think of sometimes in like
 

3215
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:46,440
and I can think of sometimes in like
playing music there was one way at my

3216
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:46,450
playing music there was one way at my
 

3217
00:59:46,450 --> 00:59:47,820
playing music there was one way at my
command my brother and a friend of mine

3218
00:59:47,820 --> 00:59:47,830
command my brother and a friend of mine
 

3219
00:59:47,830 --> 00:59:49,800
command my brother and a friend of mine
this slightly violates the family and

3220
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:49,810
this slightly violates the family and
 

3221
00:59:49,810 --> 00:59:51,420
this slightly violates the family and
friends but there was a music that made

3222
00:59:51,420 --> 00:59:51,430
friends but there was a music that made
 

3223
00:59:51,430 --> 00:59:54,540
friends but there was a music that made
me happy they were just company um we

3224
00:59:54,540 --> 00:59:54,550
me happy they were just company um we
 

3225
00:59:54,550 --> 00:59:57,660
me happy they were just company um we
like played a gig at a ski resort such

3226
00:59:57,660 --> 00:59:57,670
like played a gig at a ski resort such
 

3227
00:59:57,670 --> 00:59:59,099
like played a gig at a ski resort such
that you like take a gondola to the top

3228
00:59:59,099 --> 00:59:59,109
that you like take a gondola to the top
 

3229
00:59:59,109 --> 01:00:01,170
that you like take a gondola to the top
and like did a thing then on the gondola

3230
01:00:01,170 --> 01:00:01,180
and like did a thing then on the gondola
 

3231
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:03,060
and like did a thing then on the gondola
ride down we decided to just jam a

3232
01:00:03,060 --> 01:00:03,070
ride down we decided to just jam a
 

3233
01:00:03,070 --> 01:00:06,060
ride down we decided to just jam a
little bit and it was just like I don't

3234
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:06,070
little bit and it was just like I don't
 

3235
01:00:06,070 --> 01:00:08,370
little bit and it was just like I don't
know the the gondola sort of over came

3236
01:00:08,370 --> 01:00:08,380
know the the gondola sort of over came
 

3237
01:00:08,380 --> 01:00:10,080
know the the gondola sort of over came
over a mountain and you saw the the city

3238
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:10,090
over a mountain and you saw the the city
 

3239
01:00:10,090 --> 01:00:12,390
over a mountain and you saw the the city
lights and were just like jamming like

3240
01:00:12,390 --> 01:00:12,400
lights and were just like jamming like
 

3241
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:14,400
lights and were just like jamming like
playing some music I wouldn't describe

3242
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:14,410
playing some music I wouldn't describe
 

3243
01:00:14,410 --> 01:00:16,650
playing some music I wouldn't describe
that nice transformative I don't know

3244
01:00:16,650 --> 01:00:16,660
that nice transformative I don't know
 

3245
01:00:16,660 --> 01:00:18,150
that nice transformative I don't know
why but that popped into my mind as a

3246
01:00:18,150 --> 01:00:18,160
why but that popped into my mind as a
 

3247
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:20,609
why but that popped into my mind as a
moment of in a way that wasn't

3248
01:00:20,609 --> 01:00:20,619
moment of in a way that wasn't
 

3249
01:00:20,619 --> 01:00:22,230
moment of in a way that wasn't
associated with people I love but more

3250
01:00:22,230 --> 01:00:22,240
associated with people I love but more
 

3251
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:24,390
associated with people I love but more
with like a thing I was doing something

3252
01:00:24,390 --> 01:00:24,400
with like a thing I was doing something
 

3253
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:26,280
with like a thing I was doing something
that was just it was just happy and it

3254
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:26,290
that was just it was just happy and it
 

3255
01:00:26,290 --> 01:00:29,670
that was just it was just happy and it
was just like it a great moment I don't

3256
01:00:29,670 --> 01:00:29,680
was just like it a great moment I don't
 

3257
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:30,780
was just like it a great moment I don't
think I can give you anything deeper

3258
01:00:30,780 --> 01:00:30,790
think I can give you anything deeper
 

3259
01:00:30,790 --> 01:00:32,640
think I can give you anything deeper
than that though well as a musician

3260
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:32,650
than that though well as a musician
 

3261
01:00:32,650 --> 01:00:36,359
than that though well as a musician
myself I'd love to see as you mentioned

3262
01:00:36,359 --> 01:00:36,369
myself I'd love to see as you mentioned
 

3263
01:00:36,369 --> 01:00:38,130
myself I'd love to see as you mentioned
before music enter back into your work

3264
01:00:38,130 --> 01:00:38,140
before music enter back into your work
 

3265
01:00:38,140 --> 01:00:40,170
before music enter back into your work
and back into your creative work I'd

3266
01:00:40,170 --> 01:00:40,180
and back into your creative work I'd
 

3267
01:00:40,180 --> 01:00:42,599
and back into your creative work I'd
love to see that I'm certainly allowing

3268
01:00:42,599 --> 01:00:42,609
love to see that I'm certainly allowing
 

3269
01:00:42,609 --> 01:00:44,130
love to see that I'm certainly allowing
you to enter back into mine and it's

3270
01:00:44,130 --> 01:00:44,140
you to enter back into mine and it's
 

3271
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:46,760
you to enter back into mine and it's
it's a it's a beautiful thing for

3272
01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:46,770
it's a it's a beautiful thing for
 

3273
01:00:46,770 --> 01:00:49,470
it's a it's a beautiful thing for
mathematician for scientists to allow

3274
01:00:49,470 --> 01:00:49,480
mathematician for scientists to allow
 

3275
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:52,589
mathematician for scientists to allow
music to enter their work I think only

3276
01:00:52,589 --> 01:00:52,599
music to enter their work I think only
 

3277
01:00:52,599 --> 01:00:54,390
