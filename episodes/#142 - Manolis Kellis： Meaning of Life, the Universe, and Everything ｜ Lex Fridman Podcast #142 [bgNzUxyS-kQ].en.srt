so if you look at regions of the brain

480

region of the brain

486
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:12,160
region of the brain
 

487
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,830
region of the brain
can actually sing because it's exactly

488
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:15,840

489
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,950
can actually sing because it's exactly
the symmetric region

490
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:16,960
the symmetric region
 

491
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,189
the symmetric region
of the brain and that again teaches you

musicality and you know rhythmic

498
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:27,680
musicality and you know rhythmic
 

499
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,270
musicality and you know rhythmic
patterns and

500
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:29,280
patterns and
 

501
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,670
patterns and
eventually language do you have a sense

502
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:31,680
eventually language do you have a sense
 

503
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,870
eventually language do you have a sense
of why songs

504
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:32,880
of why songs
 

505
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,269
of why songs
developed so you're kind of suggesting

506
00:08:35,269 --> 00:08:35,279
developed so you're kind of suggesting
 

507
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,110
developed so you're kind of suggesting
that it's possible that

508
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:37,120
that it's possible that
 

509
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,870
that it's possible that
there is something important about our

510
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:40,880
there is something important about our
 

511
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,269
there is something important about our
connection with song and with music on

512
00:08:43,269 --> 00:08:43,279
connection with song and with music on
 

513
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:44,710
connection with song and with music on
the level of

514
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:44,720
the level of
 

515
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,230
the level of
the importance of language is it

516
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:46,240
the importance of language is it
 

517
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,870
the importance of language is it
possible it's not just possible in my

518
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:48,880
possible it's not just possible in my
 

519
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,269
possible it's not just possible in my
view

520
00:08:49,269 --> 00:08:49,279
view
 

521
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,430
view
language comes after music language

522
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:51,440
language comes after music language
 

523
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,389
language comes after music language
comes after song

524
00:08:52,389 --> 00:08:52,399
comes after song
 

525
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,630
comes after song
no seriously like basically my view of

526
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:54,640
no seriously like basically my view of
 

527
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,710
no seriously like basically my view of
human cognitive evolution

528
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:56,720
human cognitive evolution
 

529
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,230
human cognitive evolution
is rituals if you look at many early

530
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:00,240
is rituals if you look at many early
 

531
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,269
is rituals if you look at many early
cultures

532
00:09:01,269 --> 00:09:01,279
cultures
 

533
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,509
cultures
there's rituals around every stage of

534
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:03,519
there's rituals around every stage of
 

535
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:04,470
there's rituals around every stage of
life

536
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:04,480
life
 

537
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,150
life
there's organized dance performances

538
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:08,160
there's organized dance performances
 

539
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,790
there's organized dance performances
around mating and if you look at mate

540
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:10,800
around mating and if you look at mate
 

541
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,550
around mating and if you look at mate
selection i mean that's an evolutionary

542
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:12,560
selection i mean that's an evolutionary
 

543
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,910
selection i mean that's an evolutionary
drive right there

544
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:13,920
drive right there
 

545
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,350
drive right there
so basically if you're not able to

546
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:15,360
so basically if you're not able to
 

547
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,509
so basically if you're not able to
string together a complex dance

548
00:09:17,509 --> 00:09:17,519
string together a complex dance
 

549
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,150
string together a complex dance
as a bird you don't get a mate and that

550
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:20,160
as a bird you don't get a mate and that
 

551
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,509
as a bird you don't get a mate and that
actually forms

552
00:09:21,509 --> 00:09:21,519
actually forms
 

553
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,550
actually forms
this development for many song

554
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:24,560
this development for many song
 

555
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,630
this development for many song
learning birds not every bird knows how

556
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:26,640
learning birds not every bird knows how
 

557
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,670
learning birds not every bird knows how
to sing

558
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:27,680
to sing
 

559
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,670
to sing
and not every bird knows how to learn a

560
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:29,680
and not every bird knows how to learn a
 

561
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,870
and not every bird knows how to learn a
complicated song

562
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:30,880
complicated song
 

563
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,590
complicated song
so basically there's birds that simply

564
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:33,600
so basically there's birds that simply
 

565
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,389
so basically there's birds that simply
have the same

566
00:09:34,389 --> 00:09:34,399
have the same
 

567
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,310
have the same
few tunes that they know how to play and

568
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:36,320
few tunes that they know how to play and
 

569
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,910
few tunes that they know how to play and
a lot of that is inherent

570
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:37,920
a lot of that is inherent
 

571
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,389
a lot of that is inherent
and genetically encoded and others are

572
00:09:40,389 --> 00:09:40,399
and genetically encoded and others are
 

573
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:41,350
and genetically encoded and others are
birds that learn

574
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:41,360
birds that learn
 

575
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,949
birds that learn
how to sing and the you know

576
00:09:44,949 --> 00:09:44,959
how to sing and the you know
 

577
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,470
how to sing and the you know
if you look at a lot of these exotic

578
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:46,480
if you look at a lot of these exotic
 

579
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,829
if you look at a lot of these exotic
birds of paradise and stuff like that

580
00:09:47,829 --> 00:09:47,839
birds of paradise and stuff like that
 

581
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:48,150
birds of paradise and stuff like that
like

582
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:48,160
like
 

583
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,910
like
the mating rituals they have are

584
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:49,920
the mating rituals they have are
 

585
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,350
the mating rituals they have are
enormously amazing

586
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:51,360
enormously amazing
 

587
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,670
enormously amazing
and i think human mating rituals of you

588
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:53,680
and i think human mating rituals of you
 

589
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,030
and i think human mating rituals of you
know ancient tribes

590
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:55,040
know ancient tribes
 

591
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,190
know ancient tribes
are not very far off from that and in my

592
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:57,200
are not very far off from that and in my
 

593
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,509
are not very far off from that and in my
view the sequential formation

594
00:09:59,509 --> 00:09:59,519
view the sequential formation
 

595
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:03,269
view the sequential formation
of these movements is a prelude

596
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:03,279
of these movements is a prelude
 

597
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:06,150
of these movements is a prelude
to the cognitive capabilities that

598
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:06,160
to the cognitive capabilities that
 

599
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,069
to the cognitive capabilities that
ultimately enable language

600
00:10:08,069 --> 00:10:08,079
ultimately enable language
 

601
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:09,509
ultimately enable language
and it's fascinating to think that

602
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:09,519
and it's fascinating to think that
 

603
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,670
and it's fascinating to think that
that's uh not just an accidental

604
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:11,680
that's uh not just an accidental
 

605
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,350
that's uh not just an accidental
precursor to intelligence

606
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:13,360
precursor to intelligence
 

607
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,230
precursor to intelligence
yeah it's uh sexually selected it's well

608
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:16,240
yeah it's uh sexually selected it's well
 

609
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,110
yeah it's uh sexually selected it's well
sexually selected

610
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:17,120
sexually selected
 

611
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,230
sexually selected
and it's a prerequisite yeah it's like

612
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:20,240
and it's a prerequisite yeah it's like
 

613
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,310
and it's a prerequisite yeah it's like
it's required for intelligence and and

614
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:22,320
it's required for intelligence and and
 

615
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,870
it's required for intelligence and and
even as language has now developed

616
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:24,880
even as language has now developed
 

617
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,910
even as language has now developed
i think the artistic expression is

618
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:27,920
i think the artistic expression is
 

619
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,269
i think the artistic expression is
needed like badly needed by our brain

620
00:10:31,269 --> 00:10:31,279
needed like badly needed by our brain
 

621
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:34,230
needed like badly needed by our brain
so it's not just that oh our brain can

622
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:34,240
so it's not just that oh our brain can
 

623
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:34,790
so it's not just that oh our brain can
kind of

624
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:34,800
kind of
 

625
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,230
kind of
you know take a break and go do that

626
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:36,240
you know take a break and go do that
 

627
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,310
you know take a break and go do that
stuff no i mean you know

628
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:38,320
stuff no i mean you know
 

629
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,670
stuff no i mean you know
i don't know if you remember that scene

630
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:39,680
i don't know if you remember that scene
 

631
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,430
i don't know if you remember that scene
from oh gosh we're certain

the things the word things don't
 

2233
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,550
the things the word things don't
turn out the way you expect it to yeah

2234
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:46,560
turn out the way you expect it to yeah
 

2235

turn out the way you expect it to yeah
the way so like to feel

2236
00:39:48,310 --> 00:39:48,320
the way so like to feel
 

2237
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,550
the way so like to feel
lucky is like focusing on the on the

2238
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:50,560
lucky is like focusing on the on the
 

2239
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,150
lucky is like focusing on the on the
beautiful consequences yeah

2240
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:52,160
beautiful consequences yeah
 

2241
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,870
beautiful consequences yeah
but then that feeling of things being

2242
00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:54,880
but then that feeling of things being
 

2243
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,510
but then that feeling of things being
different

2244
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:55,520
different
 

2245
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:58,710
different
than you expected that uh you stumble in

2246
00:39:58,710 --> 00:39:58,720
than you expected that uh you stumble in
 

2247
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,069
than you expected that uh you stumble in
all the kinds of ways that

2248
00:40:00,069 --> 00:40:00,079
all the kinds of ways that
 

2249
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:02,790
all the kinds of ways that
that seems to be needs to be paired with

that seems to be needs to be paired with
the feeling there's basically one way

2252
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:04,640
the feeling there's basically one way
 

2253
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,710
the feeling there's basically one way
the only way not to make mistakes is to

2254
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:06,720
the only way not to make mistakes is to
 

2255
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,829
the only way not to make mistakes is to
never do anything

2256
00:40:08,829 --> 00:40:08,839
never do anything
 

2257
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:11,510
never do anything
right basically you have to embrace the

2258
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:11,520
right basically you have to embrace the
 

2259
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,790
right basically you have to embrace the
fact that you'll be wrong

2260
00:40:12,790 --> 00:40:12,800
fact that you'll be wrong
 

2261
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,309
fact that you'll be wrong
so many times in so many research

2262
00:40:14,309 --> 00:40:14,319
so many times in so many research
 

2263
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:16,710
so many times in so many research
meetings i just go off on a tangent and

2264
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:16,720
meetings i just go off on a tangent and
 

2265
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:19,430
meetings i just go off on a tangent and
say let's think about this for a second

2266
00:40:19,430 --> 00:40:19,440
say let's think about this for a second
 

2267
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,390
say let's think about this for a second
and it's just

2268
00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:20,400
and it's just
 

2269
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,950
and it's just
crazy for me who's a computer scientist

2270
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:22,960
crazy for me who's a computer scientist
 

2271
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:23,510
crazy for me who's a computer scientist
to just

2272
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:23,520
to just
 

2273
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,870
to just
tell my biologist friends what if

2274
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:24,880
tell my biologist friends what if
 

2275
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,349
tell my biologist friends what if
biology kind of worked this way

2276
00:40:27,349 --> 00:40:27,359
biology kind of worked this way

00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:51,680
from the music perspective
 

2359
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:55,030
from the music perspective
let's uh talk about life from human life

let's uh talk about life from human life
 

2361
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,870
let's uh talk about life from human life
from perhaps other perspective and it's

00:41:56,870 --> 00:41:56,880
from perhaps other perspective and it's
 

2363
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:57,349
from perhaps other perspective and it's
meaning

2364
00:41:57,349 --> 00:41:57,359
meaning
 

2365
00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:01,589
meaning
so this is episode 142.

2366
00:42:01,589 --> 00:42:01,599
so this is episode 142.
 

2367
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:05,030
so this is episode 142.
uh there is perhaps uh an

2368
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:05,040
uh there is perhaps uh an
 

2369
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:08,390
uh there is perhaps uh an
absurdly uh deep

2370
00:42:08,390 --> 00:42:08,400
absurdly uh deep
 

2371
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,510
absurdly uh deep
meaning to the number 42 that uh

2372
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:11,520
meaning to the number 42 that uh
 

2373
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,910
meaning to the number 42 that uh
the our culture has has elevated so this

2374
00:42:13,910 --> 00:42:13,920
the our culture has has elevated so this
 

2375
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,670
the our culture has has elevated so this
is a perfect time to talk about the

2376
00:42:15,670 --> 00:42:15,680
is a perfect time to talk about the
 

2377
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:16,630
is a perfect time to talk about the
meaning of life

2378
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:16,640
meaning of life
 

2379
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:19,109
meaning of life
we've talked about it already but do you

2380
00:42:19,109 --> 00:42:19,119
we've talked about it already but do you
 

2381
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:21,190
we've talked about it already but do you
think this question

2382
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:21,200
think this question
 

2383
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:24,230
think this question
that's so simple and

2384
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:24,240
that's so simple and
 

2385
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:27,510
that's so simple and
so seemingly absurd has value

2386
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:27,520
so seemingly absurd has value
 

2387
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,430
so seemingly absurd has value
of what is the meaning of life is it

2388
00:42:29,430 --> 00:42:29,440
of what is the meaning of life is it
 

2389
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:30,790
of what is the meaning of life is it
something

2390
00:42:30,790 --> 00:42:30,800
something
 

2391
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,750
something
that raising the question and trying to

2392
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:33,760
that raising the question and trying to
 

2393
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:34,870
that raising the question and trying to
answer it

2394
00:42:34,870 --> 00:42:34,880
answer it
 

2395
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,870
answer it
is that a ridiculous pursuit or is this

2396
00:42:36,870 --> 00:42:36,880
is that a ridiculous pursuit or is this
 

2397
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:39,270
is that a ridiculous pursuit or is this
some value is it answerable at all

2398
00:42:39,270 --> 00:42:39,280
some value is it answerable at all
 

2399
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,510
some value is it answerable at all
so first of all i i feel that we owe it

2400
00:42:41,510 --> 00:42:41,520
so first of all i i feel that we owe it
 

2401
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,990
so first of all i i feel that we owe it
to your listeners to say why 42

2402
00:42:43,990 --> 00:42:44,000
to your listeners to say why 42
 

2403
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,270
to your listeners to say why 42
sure so of course the hitchhiker's guide

2404
00:42:47,270 --> 00:42:47,280
sure so of course the hitchhiker's guide
 

2405
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,230
sure so of course the hitchhiker's guide
to the galaxy

2406
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:48,240
to the galaxy
 

2407
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:51,589
to the galaxy
came up with 42 as basically a random

2408
00:42:51,589 --> 00:42:51,599
came up with 42 as basically a random
 

2409
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:54,470
came up with 42 as basically a random
number just you know the author just

2410
00:42:54,470 --> 00:42:54,480
number just you know the author just
 

2411
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:55,430
number just you know the author just
pulled it out of a hat

2412
00:42:55,430 --> 00:42:55,440
pulled it out of a hat
 

2413
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,589
pulled it out of a hat
and he's admitted so he said mile 42

2414
00:42:57,589 --> 00:42:57,599
and he's admitted so he said mile 42
 

2415
00:42:57,599 --> 00:42:58,950
and he's admitted so he said mile 42
just seemed like

2416
00:42:58,950 --> 00:42:58,960
just seemed like
 

2417
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:01,750
just seemed like
just random numbers any but in fact

2418
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:01,760
just random numbers any but in fact
 

2419
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:02,630
just random numbers any but in fact
there's many

2420
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:02,640
there's many
 

2421
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:06,230
there's many
numbers that are linked to 42. so

2422
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:06,240
numbers that are linked to 42. so
 

2423
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:09,270
numbers that are linked to 42. so
42 again just just to summarize

2424
00:43:09,270 --> 00:43:09,280
42 again just just to summarize
 

2425
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:12,309
42 again just just to summarize
is the answer that these

2426
00:43:12,309 --> 00:43:12,319
is the answer that these
 

2427
00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:14,550
is the answer that these
super mega computer that had computed

the computer says um i have an answer

2436
00:43:23,270 --> 00:43:23,280
the computer says um i have an answer
 

2437
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:25,589
the computer says um i have an answer
and they're like what it's like you're

2438
00:43:25,589 --> 00:43:25,599
and they're like what it's like you're
 

2439
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:27,030
and they're like what it's like you're
not going to like it

2440
00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:27,040
not going to like it
 

2441
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:30,230
not going to like it
like what is it it's 42.

2442
00:43:30,230 --> 00:43:30,240
like what is it it's 42.
 

2443
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,990
like what is it it's 42.
and then the irony is that they had

2444
00:43:31,990 --> 00:43:32,000
and then the irony is that they had
 

2445
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,430
and then the irony is that they had
forgotten of course what the question

2446
00:43:33,430 --> 00:43:33,440
forgotten of course what the question
 

2447
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:34,710
forgotten of course what the question
was yes

2448
00:43:34,710 --> 00:43:34,720
was yes
 

2449
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:35,910
was yes
so now they have to build a bigger

2450
00:43:35,910 --> 00:43:35,920
so now they have to build a bigger
 

2451
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,030
so now they have to build a bigger
computer to figure out what the question

2452
00:43:37,030 --> 00:43:37,040
computer to figure out what the question
 

2453
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:37,829
computer to figure out what the question
was the question

2454
00:43:37,829 --> 00:43:37,839
was the question
 

2455
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:40,390
was the question
to which the answer is 42. so as i was

2456
00:43:40,390 --> 00:43:40,400
to which the answer is 42. so as i was
 

2457
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:41,349
to which the answer is 42. so as i was
turning 42

2458
00:43:41,349 --> 00:43:41,359
turning 42
 

2459
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:44,390
turning 42
i basically sort of researched uh why 42

2460
00:43:44,390 --> 00:43:44,400
i basically sort of researched uh why 42
 

2461
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:45,589
i basically sort of researched uh why 42
is such a cool number

2462
00:43:45,589 --> 00:43:45,599
is such a cool number
 

2463
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:48,069
is such a cool number
and it turns out that and i put together

2464
00:43:48,069 --> 00:43:48,079
and it turns out that and i put together
 

2465
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:49,510
and it turns out that and i put together
this little passage that was explaining

2466
00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:49,520
this little passage that was explaining
 

2467
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:50,470
this little passage that was explaining
to all those

2468
00:43:50,470 --> 00:43:50,480
to all those
 

2469
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:53,270
to all those
guests to my 42nd birthday party why we

2470
00:43:53,270 --> 00:43:53,280
guests to my 42nd birthday party why we
 

2471
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:54,870
guests to my 42nd birthday party why we
were talking about the meaning of life

2472
00:43:54,870 --> 00:43:54,880
were talking about the meaning of life
 

2473
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:58,470
were talking about the meaning of life
and basically talked about how 42

2474
00:43:58,470 --> 00:43:58,480
and basically talked about how 42
 

2475
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:01,910
and basically talked about how 42
is the angle at which light reflects

2476
00:44:01,910 --> 00:44:01,920
is the angle at which light reflects
 

2477
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:05,589
is the angle at which light reflects
off of water to create a rainbow

2478
00:44:05,589 --> 00:44:05,599
off of water to create a rainbow
 

2479
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:07,109
off of water to create a rainbow
and it's so beautiful because the

2480
00:44:07,109 --> 00:44:07,119
and it's so beautiful because the
 

2481
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:08,710
and it's so beautiful because the
rainbow is basically the

2482
00:44:08,710 --> 00:44:08,720
rainbow is basically the
 

2483
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:10,630
rainbow is basically the
combination of sort of it's been raining

2484
00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:10,640
combination of sort of it's been raining
 

2485
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:12,309
combination of sort of it's been raining
but there's hope because the sun just

2486
00:44:12,309 --> 00:44:12,319
but there's hope because the sun just
 

2487
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:13,109
but there's hope because the sun just
came out

2488
00:44:13,109 --> 00:44:13,119
came out
 

2489
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:15,349
came out
it's a very beautiful number there so 42

2490
00:44:15,349 --> 00:44:15,359
it's a very beautiful number there so 42
 

2491
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:16,230
it's a very beautiful number there so 42
is also the sum

2492
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:16,240
is also the sum
 

2493
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:18,950
is also the sum
of all rows and columns of a magic cube

2494
00:44:18,950 --> 00:44:18,960
of all rows and columns of a magic cube
 

2495
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:19,670
of all rows and columns of a magic cube
that contains

2496
00:44:19,670 --> 00:44:19,680
that contains
 

2497
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:22,550
that contains
all consecutive integers starting at one

2498
00:44:22,550 --> 00:44:22,560
all consecutive integers starting at one
 

2499
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,069
all consecutive integers starting at one
so basically if you if you take all

2500
00:44:24,069 --> 00:44:24,079
so basically if you if you take all
 

2501
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:25,270
so basically if you if you take all
integers between one

2502
00:44:25,270 --> 00:44:25,280
integers between one
 

2503
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:27,349
integers between one
and however many vertices there are the

2504
00:44:27,349 --> 00:44:27,359
and however many vertices there are the
 

2505
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:29,750
and however many vertices there are the
sums is always 42.

2506
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:29,760
sums is always 42.
 

2507
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:32,790
sums is always 42.

a yeast cell
 

2681
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:32,470
a yeast cell
which is uh called a single cell

research has

2686
00:47:35,270 --> 00:47:35,280
research has
 

2687
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:38,710
research has
exactly 42 million proteins anyway so

2688
00:47:38,710 --> 00:47:38,720
exactly 42 million proteins anyway so
 

2689
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:40,870
exactly 42 million proteins anyway so
so there's seriously you're on fire with

2690
00:47:40,870 --> 00:47:40,880
so there's seriously you're on fire with
 

2691
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:42,790
so there's seriously you're on fire with
this these are really good

2692
00:47:42,790 --> 00:47:42,800
this these are really good
 

2693
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:44,150
this these are really good
so i guess what you're saying is just a

2694
00:47:44,150 --> 00:47:44,160
so i guess what you're saying is just a
 

2695
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:47,270
so i guess what you're saying is just a
random number yeah basically

2696
00:47:47,270 --> 00:47:47,280
random number yeah basically
 

2697
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:49,670
random number yeah basically
so all of these are acronyms so you know

2698
00:47:49,670 --> 00:47:49,680
so all of these are acronyms so you know
 

2699
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:50,870
so all of these are acronyms so you know
after you have the number you figure out

2700
00:47:50,870 --> 00:47:50,880
after you have the number you figure out
 

2701
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:51,990
after you have the number you figure out
why that don't work

2702
00:47:51,990 --> 00:47:52,000
why that don't work
 

2703
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,630
why that don't work
so anyway so uh now that we've spoken

2704
00:47:54,630 --> 00:47:54,640
so anyway so uh now that we've spoken
 

2705
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:55,910
so anyway so uh now that we've spoken
about why 42

2706
00:47:55,910 --> 00:47:55,920
about why 42
 

2707
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:59,109
about why 42
uh why do we search for meaning and uh

2708
00:47:59,109 --> 00:47:59,119
uh why do we search for meaning and uh
 

2709
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:01,030
uh why do we search for meaning and uh
you're asking you know will that search

2710
00:48:01,030 --> 00:48:01,040
you're asking you know will that search
 

2711
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:03,030
you're asking you know will that search
ultimately lead to our destruction and

2712
00:48:03,030 --> 00:48:03,040
ultimately lead to our destruction and
 

2713
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:04,790
ultimately lead to our destruction and
my my thinking is exactly the opposite

2714
00:48:04,790 --> 00:48:04,800
my my thinking is exactly the opposite
 

2715
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:05,670
my my thinking is exactly the opposite
so basically

2716
00:48:05,670 --> 00:48:05,680
so basically
 

2717
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:09,030
so basically
that asking about meaning is something

2718
00:48:09,030 --> 00:48:09,040
that asking about meaning is something
 

2719
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:09,670
that asking about meaning is something
that's so

2720
00:48:09,670 --> 00:48:09,680
that's so
 

2721
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:11,750
that's so
inherent to human nature it's something

2722
00:48:11,750 --> 00:48:11,760
inherent to human nature it's something
 

2723
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:13,349
inherent to human nature it's something
that makes life beautiful

2724
00:48:13,349 --> 00:48:13,359
that makes life beautiful
 

2725
00:48:13,359 --> 00:48:15,510
that makes life beautiful
that makes it worth living and that

2726
00:48:15,510 --> 00:48:15,520
that makes it worth living and that
 

2727
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:16,710
that makes it worth living and that
searching for meaning

2728
00:48:16,710 --> 00:48:16,720
searching for meaning
 

2729
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:19,430
searching for meaning
is actually the point it's not defining

2730
00:48:19,430 --> 00:48:19,440
is actually the point it's not defining
 

2731
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:22,150
is actually the point it's not defining
it i think when you found it you're dead

2732
00:48:22,150 --> 00:48:22,160
it i think when you found it you're dead
 

2733
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:25,190
it i think when you found it you're dead
yeah don't don't ever be satisfied that

2734
00:48:25,190 --> 00:48:25,200
yeah don't don't ever be satisfied that
 

2735
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:27,589
yeah don't don't ever be satisfied that
you know i've got it so i like to say

2736
00:48:27,589 --> 00:48:27,599
you know i've got it so i like to say
 

2737
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:28,470
you know i've got it so i like to say
that life is

2738
00:48:28,470 --> 00:48:28,480
that life is
 

2739
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,950
that life is
lived forward but it only makes sense

2740
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:30,960
lived forward but it only makes sense
 

2741
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:32,150
lived forward but it only makes sense
backward

2742
00:48:32,150 --> 00:48:32,160
backward
 

2743
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:34,549
backward
and i don't remember whose quote that is

2744
00:48:34,549 --> 00:48:34,559
and i don't remember whose quote that is
 

2745
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:35,349
and i don't remember whose quote that is
but

2746
00:48:35,349 --> 00:48:35,359
but
 

2747
00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:38,390
but
the the the whole search itself is the

2748
00:48:38,390 --> 00:48:38,400
the the the whole search itself is the
 

2749
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:39,589
the the the whole search itself is the
meaning

2750
00:48:39,589 --> 00:48:39,599
meaning
 

2751
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:43,270
meaning
and what i love about it is that

2752
00:48:43,270 --> 00:48:43,280
and what i love about it is that
 

2753
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:45,109
and what i love about it is that
there's a double search going on there's

2754
00:48:45,109 --> 00:48:45,119
there's a double search going on there's
 

2755
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:46,390
there's a double search going on there's
a search in

2756
00:48:46,390 --> 00:48:46,400
a search in
 

2757
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:49,430
a search in
every one of us through our own lives to

2758
00:48:49,430 --> 00:48:49,440
every one of us through our own lives to
 

2759
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:50,630
every one of us through our own lives to
find meaning

2760
00:48:50,630 --> 00:48:50,640
find meaning
 

2761
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:52,470
find meaning
and then there's a search which is

2762
00:48:52,470 --> 00:48:52,480
and then there's a search which is
 

2763
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:54,790
and then there's a search which is
happening for humanity itself

2764
00:48:54,790 --> 00:48:54,800
happening for humanity itself
 

2765
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:58,150
happening for humanity itself
to find our meaning and

2766
00:48:58,150 --> 00:48:58,160
to find our meaning and
 

2767
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:01,270
to find our meaning and
we as humans like to look at animals and

2768
00:49:01,270 --> 00:49:01,280
we as humans like to look at animals and
 

2769
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:03,030
we as humans like to look at animals and
say of course they have a meaning

2770
00:49:03,030 --> 00:49:03,040
say of course they have a meaning
 

2771
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:05,190
say of course they have a meaning
like a dog has its meaning it's just a

2772
00:49:05,190 --> 00:49:05,200
like a dog has its meaning it's just a
 

2773
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:06,150
like a dog has its meaning it's just a
bunch of instincts

2774
00:49:06,150 --> 00:49:06,160
bunch of instincts
 

2775
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:07,750
bunch of instincts
you know running around loving

2776
00:49:07,750 --> 00:49:07,760
you know running around loving
 

2777
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:09,270
you know running around loving
everything um

00:49:20,309 --> 00:49:20,319
i i'm noticing the yin yang symbol right
 

2787
00:49:20,319 --> 00:49:21,670
i i'm noticing the yin yang symbol right
here with this whole panda

2788
00:49:21,670 --> 00:49:21,680
here with this whole panda
 

2789
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:23,430

gold
ascii value for uh the star symbol

2796
00:49:29,430 --> 00:49:29,440
ascii value for uh the star symbol
 

2797
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:32,790
ascii value for uh the star symbol
damn anyway so so basically in my view

2798
00:49:32,790 --> 00:49:32,800
damn anyway so so basically in my view
 

2799
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:33,109
damn anyway so so basically in my view
the

2800
00:49:33,109 --> 00:49:33,119
the
 

2801
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:36,150
the
the search for meaning and the act of

2802
00:49:36,150 --> 00:49:36,160
the search for meaning and the act of
 

2803
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:37,750
the search for meaning and the act of
uh searching for something more

2804
00:49:37,750 --> 00:49:37,760
uh searching for something more
 

2805
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:39,270
uh searching for something more
meaningful

2806
00:49:39,270 --> 00:49:39,280
meaningful
 

2807
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:42,309
meaningful
is life's meaning

2808
00:49:42,309 --> 00:49:42,319
is life's meaning
 

2809
00:49:42,319 --> 00:49:44,470
is life's meaning
by itself but the fact that we kind of

2810
00:49:44,470 --> 00:49:44,480
by itself but the fact that we kind of
 

2811
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:46,549
by itself but the fact that we kind of
always hope that yes maybe for animals

2812
00:49:46,549 --> 00:49:46,559
always hope that yes maybe for animals
 

2813
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:47,910
always hope that yes maybe for animals
that's not the case

2814
00:49:47,910 --> 00:49:47,920
that's not the case
 

2815
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:50,309
that's not the case
but maybe humans have something that we

2816
00:49:50,309 --> 00:49:50,319
but maybe humans have something that we
 

2817
00:49:50,319 --> 00:49:51,109
but maybe humans have something that we
should be doing

2818
00:49:51,109 --> 00:49:51,119
should be doing
 

2819
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:52,630
should be doing
and something else and it's not just

2820
00:49:52,630 --> 00:49:52,640
and something else and it's not just
 

2821
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:54,790
and something else and it's not just
about procreation it's not just about

2822
00:49:54,790 --> 00:49:54,800
about procreation it's not just about
 

2823
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:56,710
about procreation it's not just about
dominance it's not just about strength

2824
00:49:56,710 --> 00:49:56,720
dominance it's not just about strength
 

2825
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:58,230
dominance it's not just about strength
and feeding et cetera

2826
00:49:58,230 --> 00:49:58,240
and feeding et cetera
 

2827
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:00,069
and feeding et cetera
like we're the one species that spends

2828
00:50:00,069 --> 00:50:00,079
like we're the one species that spends
 

2829
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:02,150
like we're the one species that spends
such a tiny little minority of its time

2830
00:50:02,150 --> 00:50:02,160
such a tiny little minority of its time
 

2831
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:05,349
such a tiny little minority of its time
feeding that we have this enormous

00:50:05,359 --> 00:50:08,630
feeding that we have this enormous
you know huge cognitive capability

2834
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:08,640
you know huge cognitive capability
 

2835
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:09,990
you know huge cognitive capability
that we can just use for all kinds of

2836
00:50:09,990 --> 00:50:10,000
that we can just use for all kinds of
 

2837
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,309
that we can just use for all kinds of
other stuff and that's where art

2838
00:50:12,309 --> 00:50:12,319
other stuff and that's where art
 

2839
00:50:12,319 --> 00:50:14,069
other stuff and that's where art
comes in that's where you know the

2840
00:50:14,069 --> 00:50:14,079
comes in that's where you know the
 

2841
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:15,349
comes in that's where you know the
healthy mind

2842
00:50:15,349 --> 00:50:15,359
healthy mind
 

2843
00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:17,430
healthy mind
comes in with you know exploring all of

2844
00:50:17,430 --> 00:50:17,440
comes in with you know exploring all of
 

2845
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:18,630
comes in with you know exploring all of
these different aspects that are just

2846
00:50:18,630 --> 00:50:18,640
these different aspects that are just
 

2847
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:19,190
these different aspects that are just
not

2848
00:50:19,190 --> 00:50:19,200
not
 

2849
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:22,870
not
directly tied to um

2850
00:50:22,870 --> 00:50:22,880
directly tied to um
 

2851
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:24,790
directly tied to um
to a purpose that's not directly tied to

2852
00:50:24,790 --> 00:50:24,800
to a purpose that's not directly tied to
 

2853
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:26,950
to a purpose that's not directly tied to
a function it's really just the the

2854
00:50:26,950 --> 00:50:26,960
a function it's really just the the
 

2855
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:27,829
a function it's really just the the
playing

2856
00:50:27,829 --> 00:50:27,839
playing
 

2857
00:50:27,839 --> 00:50:30,870
playing
of life the you know not not for

2858
00:50:30,870 --> 00:50:30,880
of life the you know not not for
 

2859
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:33,109
of life the you know not not for
particular reason do you think this

2860
00:50:33,109 --> 00:50:33,119
particular reason do you think this
 

2861
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:34,230
particular reason do you think this
thing we got

2862
00:50:34,230 --> 00:50:34,240
thing we got
 

2863
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:39,589
thing we got
this this mind is unique in the universe

2864
00:50:39,589 --> 00:50:39,599
this this mind is unique in the universe
 

2865
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:42,150
this this mind is unique in the universe
in terms of how difficult it is to build

2866
00:50:42,150 --> 00:50:42,160
in terms of how difficult it is to build
 

2867
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:43,270
in terms of how difficult it is to build
so

2868
00:50:43,270 --> 00:50:43,280
so
 

2869
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:46,790
so
is it possible that we're the the most

2870
00:50:46,790 --> 00:50:46,800
is it possible that we're the the most
 

2871
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:48,390
is it possible that we're the the most
beautiful thing that the universe has

2872
00:50:48,390 --> 00:50:48,400
beautiful thing that the universe has
 

2873
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:50,549
beautiful thing that the universe has
constructed both the most beautiful the

2874
00:50:50,549 --> 00:50:50,559
constructed both the most beautiful the
 

2875
00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:52,470
constructed both the most beautiful the
most ugly but certainly the most complex

2876
00:50:52,470 --> 00:50:52,480
most ugly but certainly the most complex
 

2877
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:55,109
most ugly but certainly the most complex
so look at evolutionary time uh the

2878
00:50:55,109 --> 00:50:55,119
so look at evolutionary time uh the
 

2879
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:57,430
so look at evolutionary time uh the
dinosaurs ruled the earth for 135

2880
00:50:57,430 --> 00:50:57,440
dinosaurs ruled the earth for 135
 

2881
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:58,790
dinosaurs ruled the earth for 135
million years

2882
00:50:58,790 --> 00:50:58,800
million years
 

2883
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:02,950
million years
we've been around for a million years

2884
00:51:02,950 --> 00:51:02,960

 

2885
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:06,230

so one versus 135. so

2886
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:06,240
so one versus 135. so
 

2887
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:07,990
so one versus 135. so
dinosaurs were extinct you know about 60

2888
00:51:07,990 --> 00:51:08,000
dinosaurs were extinct you know about 60
 

2889
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,750
dinosaurs were extinct you know about 60
million years ago and mammals that had

2890
00:51:09,750 --> 00:51:09,760
million years ago and mammals that had
 

2891
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:11,510
million years ago and mammals that had
been happily evolving as tiny little

2892
00:51:11,510 --> 00:51:11,520
been happily evolving as tiny little
 

2893
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:12,069
been happily evolving as tiny little
creatures

2894
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:12,079
creatures
 

2895
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:13,829
creatures
for 30 million years then took over the

2896
00:51:13,829 --> 00:51:13,839
for 30 million years then took over the
 

2897
00:51:13,839 --> 00:51:15,990
for 30 million years then took over the
planet and then you know dramatically

2898
00:51:15,990 --> 00:51:16,000
planet and then you know dramatically
 

2899
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,950
planet and then you know dramatically
radiated about 60 million years ago

2900
00:51:18,950 --> 00:51:18,960
radiated about 60 million years ago
 

2901
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:23,190
radiated about 60 million years ago
out of these mammals came the neocortex

2902
00:51:23,190 --> 00:51:23,200
out of these mammals came the neocortex
 

2903
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:25,510
out of these mammals came the neocortex
formation so basically the the neocortex

2904
00:51:25,510 --> 00:51:25,520
formation so basically the the neocortex
 

2905
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:27,030
formation so basically the the neocortex
which is sort of the outer layer of our

2906
00:51:27,030 --> 00:51:27,040
which is sort of the outer layer of our
 

2907
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:27,910
which is sort of the outer layer of our
brain

2908
00:51:27,910 --> 00:51:27,920
brain
 

2909
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:29,430
brain
compared to our quote-unquote reptilian

2910
00:51:29,430 --> 00:51:29,440
compared to our quote-unquote reptilian
 

2911
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:31,190
compared to our quote-unquote reptilian
brain which we share the structure of

2912
00:51:31,190 --> 00:51:31,200
brain which we share the structure of
 

2913
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:33,589
brain which we share the structure of
with all of the dinosaurs they didn't

2914
00:51:33,589 --> 00:51:33,599
with all of the dinosaurs they didn't
 

2915
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:35,829
with all of the dinosaurs they didn't
have that and yet they ruled the planet

2916
00:51:35,829 --> 00:51:35,839
have that and yet they ruled the planet
 

2917
00:51:35,839 --> 00:51:37,270
have that and yet they ruled the planet
so how many other planets

2918
00:51:37,270 --> 00:51:37,280
so how many other planets
 

2919
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:40,630
so how many other planets
have still you know mindless dinosaurs

2920
00:51:40,630 --> 00:51:40,640
have still you know mindless dinosaurs
 

2921
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:43,829
have still you know mindless dinosaurs
where strength was the only dimension uh

2922
00:51:43,829 --> 00:51:43,839
where strength was the only dimension uh
 

2923
00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:45,430
where strength was the only dimension uh
ruling the planet

2924
00:51:45,430 --> 00:51:45,440
ruling the planet
 

2925
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:47,750
ruling the planet
so there was something weird that

2926
00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:47,760
so there was something weird that
 

2927
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:49,270
so there was something weird that
annihilated the dinosaurs

2928
00:51:49,270 --> 00:51:49,280
annihilated the dinosaurs
 

2929
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:50,630
annihilated the dinosaurs
and again you could look at biblical

2930
00:51:50,630 --> 00:51:50,640
and again you could look at biblical
 

2931
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:52,390
and again you could look at biblical
things of sort of god coming and wiping

2932
00:51:52,390 --> 00:51:52,400
things of sort of god coming and wiping
 

2933
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,069
things of sort of god coming and wiping
out his creatures and yes to make room

2934
00:51:54,069 --> 00:51:54,079
out his creatures and yes to make room
 

2935
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:55,030
out his creatures and yes to make room
for the next ones

2936
00:51:55,030 --> 00:51:55,040
for the next ones
 

2937
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:58,390
for the next ones
so the mammals basically sort of took

2938
00:51:58,390 --> 00:51:58,400
so the mammals basically sort of took
 

2939
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:00,710
so the mammals basically sort of took
off the planet and then grew

2940
00:52:00,710 --> 00:52:00,720
off the planet and then grew
 

2941
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:04,069
off the planet and then grew
this cognitive capability of this

2942
00:52:04,069 --> 00:52:04,079
this cognitive capability of this
 

2943
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:08,790

2945
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:11,270
general-purpose machine and primates
push that to extreme and humans among

if you look at human cognition
 

2969
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:43,589
if you look at human cognition
it's gone down a weird evolutionary path

is enormously fascinating and it has to

or that have gone extinct
 

3045
00:54:00,319 --> 00:54:03,109
or that have gone extinct
and that has now created this weird

and that has now created this weird
 

3047
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:04,230

so that can basically make us think that
 

3055
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:11,990

there's something very weird and unique

there's something very weird and unique
that happened in human evolution that

00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:19,599
you know sister earth and the dinosaurs

00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:20,630
you know sister earth and the dinosaurs

3073
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:30,549

however we're not as unique as we like

00:54:30,549 --> 00:54:30,559
however we're not as unique as we like
 

3075

however we're not as unique as we like
to think

3076
00:54:31,270 --> 00:54:31,280
to think
 

3077
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:32,630
to think
because there was this enormous

00:54:32,630 --> 00:54:32,640
because there was this enormous
 

3079
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:35,750
because there was this enormous
diversity of other human-like forms

diversity of other human-like forms
 

3081
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:37,829
diversity of other human-like forms
and once you make it to that stage where

3082
00:54:37,829 --> 00:54:37,839
and once you make it to that stage where
 

3083
00:54:37,839 --> 00:54:39,349
and once you make it to that stage where
you have a neocortex-like

3084
00:54:39,349 --> 00:54:39,359
you have a neocortex-like
 

3085
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:41,670
you have a neocortex-like
explosion of wow we're now competing on

3086
00:54:41,670 --> 00:54:41,680
explosion of wow we're now competing on
 

3087
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:42,789
explosion of wow we're now competing on
intelligence

3088
00:54:42,789 --> 00:54:42,799
intelligence
 

3089
00:54:42,799 --> 00:54:44,150
intelligence
and we're now competing on social

3090
00:54:44,150 --> 00:54:44,160
and we're now competing on social
 

3091
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:45,990
and we're now competing on social
structures and we're now competing on

3092
00:54:45,990 --> 00:54:46,000
structures and we're now competing on
 

3093
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:49,270
structures and we're now competing on
larger and larger groups and being able

3094
00:54:49,270 --> 00:54:49,280
larger and larger groups and being able
 

3095
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:50,309
larger and larger groups and being able
to

3096
00:54:50,309 --> 00:54:50,319
to
 

3097
00:54:50,319 --> 00:54:53,190
to
coordinate and being able to have

coordinate and being able to have
 

3099
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:54,309

empathy

3100
00:54:54,309 --> 00:54:54,319
empathy
 

3101
00:54:54,319 --> 00:54:57,109
empathy
the concept of empathy the concept of an

3102
00:54:57,109 --> 00:54:57,119
the concept of empathy the concept of an
 

3103
00:54:57,119 --> 00:54:57,670
the concept of empathy the concept of an
ego

ego
 

3105
00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:01,190
ego
the concept of a self of self-awareness

3106
00:55:01,190 --> 00:55:01,200
the concept of a self of self-awareness
 

3107
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:04,829
the concept of a self of self-awareness
comes probably from being able to

3108
00:55:04,829 --> 00:55:04,839
comes probably from being able to
 

3109
00:55:04,839 --> 00:55:09,109
comes probably from being able to
project another person's intentions

3110
00:55:09,109 --> 00:55:09,119
project another person's intentions
 

3111
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:11,030
project another person's intentions
to understand what they mean when you

3112
00:55:11,030 --> 00:55:11,040
to understand what they mean when you
 

3113
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:12,150
to understand what they mean when you
have these large

3114
00:55:12,150 --> 00:55:12,160
have these large
 

3115
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:16,309
have these large
cognitive groups large social groups so

3116
00:55:16,309 --> 00:55:16,319
cognitive groups large social groups so
 

3117
00:55:16,319 --> 00:55:18,549
cognitive groups large social groups so
me being able to sort of create a mental

3118
00:55:18,549 --> 00:55:18,559
me being able to sort of create a mental
 

3119
00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:20,789
me being able to sort of create a mental
model of how you think

3120
00:55:20,789 --> 00:55:20,799
model of how you think
 

3121
00:55:20,799 --> 00:55:22,549
model of how you think
may have come before i was able to

3122
00:55:22,549 --> 00:55:22,559
may have come before i was able to
 

3123
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:24,309
may have come before i was able to
create a personal

3124
00:55:24,309 --> 00:55:24,319
create a personal
 

3125
00:55:24,319 --> 00:55:26,630
create a personal
mental model of how do i think so this

3126
00:55:26,630 --> 00:55:26,640
mental model of how do i think so this
 

3127
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:27,829
mental model of how do i think so this
introspection

3128
00:55:27,829 --> 00:55:27,839
introspection
 

3129
00:55:27,839 --> 00:55:31,430
introspection
probably came after this sort of

3130
00:55:31,430 --> 00:55:31,440
probably came after this sort of
 

3131
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:33,510
probably came after this sort of
projection and this empathy which

3132
00:55:33,510 --> 00:55:33,520
projection and this empathy which
 

3133
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:34,470
projection and this empathy which
basically means

3134
00:55:34,470 --> 00:55:34,480
basically means
 

3135
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:37,589
basically means
you know passion pathos suffering

3136
00:55:37,589 --> 00:55:37,599
you know passion pathos suffering
 

3137
00:55:37,599 --> 00:55:39,670
you know passion pathos suffering
but basically sensing so basically

3138
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:39,680
but basically sensing so basically
 

3139
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:40,789
but basically sensing so basically
empathy means

3140
00:55:40,789 --> 00:55:40,799
empathy means
 

3141
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:42,870
empathy means
feeling what you're feeling trying to

3142
00:55:42,870 --> 00:55:42,880
feeling what you're feeling trying to
 

3143
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:45,190
feeling what you're feeling trying to
project your emotional state

3144
00:55:45,190 --> 00:55:45,200
project your emotional state
 

3145
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:47,910
project your emotional state
onto my cognitive apparatus and i think

3146
00:55:47,910 --> 00:55:47,920
onto my cognitive apparatus and i think
 

3147
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:48,870
onto my cognitive apparatus and i think
that

3148
00:55:48,870 --> 00:55:48,880
that
 

3149
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:52,230
that
is what eventually led to

3150
00:55:52,230 --> 00:55:52,240
is what eventually led to
 

3151
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:55,270
is what eventually led to
this enormous cognitive explosion that

3152
00:55:55,270 --> 00:55:55,280
this enormous cognitive explosion that
 

3153
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:56,630
this enormous cognitive explosion that
happened in humanity

3154
00:55:56,630 --> 00:55:56,640
happened in humanity
 

3155
00:55:56,640 --> 00:56:00,069
happened in humanity
so you know life itself

3156
00:56:00,069 --> 00:56:00,079
so you know life itself
 

3157
00:56:00,079 --> 00:56:03,510
so you know life itself
in my view is inevitable on every planet

3158
00:56:03,510 --> 00:56:03,520
in my view is inevitable on every planet
 

3159
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:06,390
in my view is inevitable on every planet
inevitable inevitable but the evolution

3160
00:56:06,390 --> 00:56:06,400
inevitable inevitable but the evolution
 

3161
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:07,030
inevitable inevitable but the evolution
of life

3162
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:07,040
of life
 

3163
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:10,069
of life
to self-awareness and cognition and all

3164
00:56:10,069 --> 00:56:10,079
to self-awareness and cognition and all
 

3165
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:11,430
to self-awareness and cognition and all
the incredible things that humans have

3166
00:56:11,430 --> 00:56:11,440
the incredible things that humans have
 

3167
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:12,630
the incredible things that humans have
done

3168
00:56:12,630 --> 00:56:12,640
done
 

3169
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:14,470
done
you know that might not be as inevitable

3170
00:56:14,470 --> 00:56:14,480
you know that might not be as inevitable
 

3171
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:16,150
you know that might not be as inevitable
that's your intuition so

3172
00:56:16,150 --> 00:56:16,160
that's your intuition so
 

3173
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:18,630
that's your intuition so
uh if you were to sort of uh estimate

3174
00:56:18,630 --> 00:56:18,640
uh if you were to sort of uh estimate
 

3175
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:20,549
uh if you were to sort of uh estimate
and bet some money on it

3176
00:56:20,549 --> 00:56:20,559
and bet some money on it
 

3177
00:56:20,559 --> 00:56:26,150
and bet some money on it
if we re-ran earth a million times

3178
00:56:26,150 --> 00:56:26,160
if we re-ran earth a million times
 

3179
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:28,470
if we re-ran earth a million times
would what we got now be the most

3180
00:56:28,470 --> 00:56:28,480
would what we got now be the most
 

3181
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:29,510
would what we got now be the most
special thing

3182
00:56:29,510 --> 00:56:29,520
special thing
 

3183
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:31,670
special thing
and how often would it be so

3184
00:56:31,670 --> 00:56:31,680
and how often would it be so
 

3185
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:32,950
and how often would it be so
scientifically speaking

3186
00:56:32,950 --> 00:56:32,960
scientifically speaking
 

3187
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:36,230
scientifically speaking
how repeatable is this experiment

3188
00:56:36,230 --> 00:56:36,240
how repeatable is this experiment
 

3189
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:40,470
how repeatable is this experiment
so this whole cognitive revolution yes

3190
00:56:40,470 --> 00:56:40,480
so this whole cognitive revolution yes
 

3191
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:43,829
so this whole cognitive revolution yes
maybe not maybe not basically i feel

3192
00:56:43,829 --> 00:56:43,839
maybe not maybe not basically i feel
 

3193
00:56:43,839 --> 00:56:44,390
maybe not maybe not basically i feel
that

3194
00:56:44,390 --> 00:56:44,400
that
 

3195
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:49,430
that
the longevity of you know dinosaurs

3196
00:56:49,430 --> 00:56:49,440
the longevity of you know dinosaurs
 

3197
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:50,870
the longevity of you know dinosaurs
suggests that it was not quite

3198
00:56:50,870 --> 00:56:50,880
suggests that it was not quite
 

3199
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:53,030
suggests that it was not quite
inevitable that we uh

3200
00:56:53,030 --> 00:56:53,040
inevitable that we uh
 

3201
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:56,549
inevitable that we uh
that we humans eventually uh made it

3202
00:56:56,549 --> 00:56:56,559
that we humans eventually uh made it
 

3203
00:56:56,559 --> 00:56:59,109
that we humans eventually uh made it
what you're also implying one thing here

3204
00:56:59,109 --> 00:56:59,119
what you're also implying one thing here
 

3205
00:56:59,119 --> 00:56:59,750
what you're also implying one thing here
you're saying

3206
00:56:59,750 --> 00:56:59,760
you're saying
 

3207
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:01,589
you're saying
you're implying that humans also don't

3208
00:57:01,589 --> 00:57:01,599
you're implying that humans also don't
 

3209
00:57:01,599 --> 00:57:03,510
you're implying that humans also don't
have this longevity

3210
00:57:03,510 --> 00:57:03,520
have this longevity
 

3211
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:05,270
have this longevity
this is the interesting question so with

3212
00:57:05,270 --> 00:57:05,280
this is the interesting question so with
 

3213
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:06,870
this is the interesting question so with
the fermi paradox

3214
00:57:06,870 --> 00:57:06,880
the fermi paradox
 

3215
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:10,309
the fermi paradox
the idea that the basic question is like

3216
00:57:10,309 --> 00:57:10,319
the idea that the basic question is like
 

3217
00:57:10,319 --> 00:57:13,430
the idea that the basic question is like
if if the universe has a lot of uh alien

3218
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:13,440
if if the universe has a lot of uh alien
 

3219
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:15,349
if if the universe has a lot of uh alien
life forms in it why haven't we seen

3220
00:57:15,349 --> 00:57:15,359
life forms in it why haven't we seen
 

3221
00:57:15,359 --> 00:57:15,829
life forms in it why haven't we seen
them

3222
00:57:15,829 --> 00:57:15,839
them
 

3223
00:57:15,839 --> 00:57:18,390
them
yeah and one thought is that there is a

3224
00:57:18,390 --> 00:57:18,400
yeah and one thought is that there is a
 

3225
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:21,030
yeah and one thought is that there is a
great filter or multiple great filters

3226
00:57:21,030 --> 00:57:21,040
great filter or multiple great filters
 

3227
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:24,069
great filter or multiple great filters
that basically would destroy intelligent

3228
00:57:24,069 --> 00:57:24,079
that basically would destroy intelligent
 

3229
00:57:24,079 --> 00:57:25,430
that basically would destroy intelligent
civilizations like we

3230
00:57:25,430 --> 00:57:25,440
civilizations like we
 

3231
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:26,950
civilizations like we
this thing that we you know this

3232
00:57:26,950 --> 00:57:26,960
this thing that we you know this
 

3233
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:28,470
this thing that we you know this
multi-folding brain

3234
00:57:28,470 --> 00:57:28,480
multi-folding brain
 

3235
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:30,870
multi-folding brain
that can keeps growing may not be such a

3236
00:57:30,870 --> 00:57:30,880
that can keeps growing may not be such a
 

3237
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:31,910
that can keeps growing may not be such a
big feature

3238
00:57:31,910 --> 00:57:31,920
big feature
 

3239
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:34,549
big feature
it might be useful for survival but it

3240
00:57:34,549 --> 00:57:34,559
it might be useful for survival but it
 

3241
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:34,950
it might be useful for survival but it
like

3242
00:57:34,950 --> 00:57:34,960
like
 

3243
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:38,390
like
takes us down a uh side road

3244
00:57:38,390 --> 00:57:38,400
takes us down a uh side road
 

3245
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:40,549
takes us down a uh side road
that is a very short one with a quick

3246
00:57:40,549 --> 00:57:40,559
that is a very short one with a quick
 

3247
00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:42,230
that is a very short one with a quick
dead end what do you think about that

3248
00:57:42,230 --> 00:57:42,240
dead end what do you think about that
 

3249
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:45,510
dead end what do you think about that
so i think the universe is enormous

3250
00:57:45,510 --> 00:57:45,520
so i think the universe is enormous
 

3251
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:50,069
so i think the universe is enormous
not just in space but also in time

3252
00:57:50,069 --> 00:57:50,079

 

3253
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:53,510

and the the pretense that

3254
00:57:53,510 --> 00:57:53,520
and the the pretense that
 

3255
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:56,630
and the the pretense that
you know the last blink of an instant

3256
00:57:56,630 --> 00:57:56,640
you know the last blink of an instant
 

3257
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:58,710
you know the last blink of an instant
that we've been able to send radio waves

3258
00:57:58,710 --> 00:57:58,720
that we've been able to send radio waves
 

3259
00:57:58,720 --> 00:57:59,910
that we've been able to send radio waves
is when somebody should have been paying

3260
00:57:59,910 --> 00:57:59,920
is when somebody should have been paying
 

3261
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:01,510
is when somebody should have been paying
attention to our planet

3262
00:58:01,510 --> 00:58:01,520
attention to our planet
 

3263
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:04,630
attention to our planet
he's a little ridiculous so my

means that any of these you know alien

3298
00:58:42,069 --> 00:58:42,079
means that any of these you know alien
 

3299
00:58:42,079 --> 00:58:43,589
means that any of these you know alien
civilizations would need to be paying

3300
00:58:43,589 --> 00:58:43,599
civilizations would need to be paying

and the book is just so beautiful this
 

3311
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:53,589
and the book is just so beautiful this
whole concept of

can travel as light
 

3317
00:58:57,599 --> 00:58:59,829
can travel as light
we can send instructions for people to

3318
00:58:59,829 --> 00:58:59,839
we can send instructions for people to
 

3319
00:58:59,839 --> 00:59:00,950
we can send instructions for people to
create machines

3320
00:59:00,950 --> 00:59:00,960
create machines
 

3321
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:03,030
create machines
that will allow us to beam down light

3322
00:59:03,030 --> 00:59:03,040
that will allow us to beam down light
 

3323
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:04,710
that will allow us to beam down light
and recreate ourselves

3324
00:59:04,710 --> 00:59:04,720
and recreate ourselves
 

3325
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:06,390
and recreate ourselves
and in the book you know the aliens

3326
00:59:06,390 --> 00:59:06,400
and in the book you know the aliens
 

3327
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:08,390
and in the book you know the aliens
actually take over

3328
00:59:08,390 --> 00:59:08,400
actually take over

we have to eventually go and conquer
 

3335
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:16,150
we have to eventually go and conquer
every planet i mean i think that

3336
00:59:16,150 --> 00:59:16,160
every planet i mean i think that
 

3337
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:18,710
every planet i mean i think that
yes we will become a galactic species so

3338
00:59:18,710 --> 00:59:18,720
yes we will become a galactic species so
 

3339
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:19,829

00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:25,910
of course i mean
now that we've made it so far you we so

3346
00:59:25,910 --> 00:59:25,920
now that we've made it so far you we so
 

3347

you think i
made it oh gosh i feel that you know

3350
00:59:29,190 --> 00:59:29,200
made it oh gosh i feel that you know
 

3351
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:29,990
made it oh gosh i feel that you know
cognition

3352
00:59:29,990 --> 00:59:30,000
cognition
 

3353
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,750
cognition
the cognition as an evolutionary trait

3354
00:59:31,750 --> 00:59:31,760
the cognition as an evolutionary trait
 

3355
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:33,670
the cognition as an evolutionary trait
has won over in our planet

3356
00:59:33,670 --> 00:59:33,680
has won over in our planet
 

3357
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:35,349
has won over in our planet
there's no doubt that we've made it so

3358
00:59:35,349 --> 00:59:35,359
there's no doubt that we've made it so
 

3359
00:59:35,359 --> 00:59:37,349
there's no doubt that we've made it so
basically humans have

3360
00:59:37,349 --> 00:59:37,359
basically humans have
 

3361
00:59:37,359 --> 00:59:41,349
basically humans have
won the battle for you know uh dominance

3362
00:59:41,349 --> 00:59:41,359
won the battle for you know uh dominance
 

3363
00:59:41,359 --> 00:59:42,950
won the battle for you know uh dominance
it wasn't necessarily the case with

3364
00:59:42,950 --> 00:59:42,960
it wasn't necessarily the case with
 

3365
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:45,109
it wasn't necessarily the case with
dinosaurs like i mean

3366
00:59:45,109 --> 00:59:45,119
dinosaurs like i mean
 

3367
00:59:45,119 --> 00:59:48,950
dinosaurs like i mean
yes you know there's some claims of

3368
00:59:48,950 --> 00:59:48,960
yes you know there's some claims of
 

3369
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:51,109
yes you know there's some claims of
uh intelligence and if you look at

3370
00:59:51,109 --> 00:59:51,119
uh intelligence and if you look at
 

3371
00:59:51,119 --> 00:59:53,829
uh intelligence and if you look at
jurassic park yeah sure whatever

3372
00:59:53,829 --> 00:59:53,839
jurassic park yeah sure whatever
 

3373
00:59:53,839 --> 00:59:55,829
jurassic park yeah sure whatever
but you know they just don't have the

3374
00:59:55,829 --> 00:59:55,839
but you know they just don't have the
 

3375
00:59:55,839 --> 00:59:57,190
but you know they just don't have the
hardware for it

3376
00:59:57,190 --> 00:59:57,200
hardware for it
 

3377
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:59,270
hardware for it
yeah and humans have the hardware

3378
00:59:59,270 --> 00:59:59,280
yeah and humans have the hardware
 

3379
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:00,950
yeah and humans have the hardware
there's no doubt that mammals

3380
01:00:00,950 --> 01:00:00,960
there's no doubt that mammals
 

3381
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:03,589
there's no doubt that mammals
have a dramatically improved hardware

3382
01:00:03,589 --> 01:00:03,599
have a dramatically improved hardware
 

3383
01:00:03,599 --> 01:00:04,789
have a dramatically improved hardware
for cognition

3384
01:00:04,789 --> 01:00:04,799
for cognition
 

3385
01:00:04,799 --> 01:00:07,030
for cognition
over dinosaurs like basically there's

3386
01:00:07,030 --> 01:00:07,040
over dinosaurs like basically there's
 

3387
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:07,990
over dinosaurs like basically there's
universes where

3388
01:00:07,990 --> 01:00:08,000
universes where
 

3389
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,870
universes where
strength went out and in our planet in

3390
01:00:10,870 --> 01:00:10,880
strength went out and in our planet in
 

3391
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:11,270
strength went out and in our planet in
our

3392
01:00:11,270 --> 01:00:11,280
our
 

3393
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:13,109
our
you know particular version of whatever

3394
01:00:13,109 --> 01:00:13,119
you know particular version of whatever
 

3395
01:00:13,119 --> 01:00:15,430
you know particular version of whatever
happened in this planet

3396
01:00:15,430 --> 01:00:15,440
happened in this planet
 

3397
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:17,910
happened in this planet
cognition went out and it's kind of cool

3398
01:00:17,910 --> 01:00:17,920
cognition went out and it's kind of cool
 

3399
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:19,430
cognition went out and it's kind of cool
i mean it's it's a privilege

3400
01:00:19,430 --> 01:00:19,440
i mean it's it's a privilege
 

3401
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:21,109
i mean it's it's a privilege
right but it's kind of like living in

3402
01:00:21,109 --> 01:00:21,119
right but it's kind of like living in
 

3403
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:22,710
right but it's kind of like living in
boston instead of i don't know

3404
01:00:22,710 --> 01:00:22,720
boston instead of i don't know
 

3405
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:26,230
boston instead of i don't know
some middle uh middle-aged uh

3406
01:00:26,230 --> 01:00:26,240
some middle uh middle-aged uh
 

3407
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:27,349
some middle uh middle-aged uh
place where everybody's like hitting

3408
01:00:27,349 --> 01:00:27,359
place where everybody's like hitting
 

3409

01:00:32,150 --> 01:00:32,160
weapons and sticks back to the lucky one
 

3413
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:33,510
weapons and sticks back to the lucky one
song

3414
01:00:33,510 --> 01:00:33,520
song
 

3415
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:36,309
song
i mean we are the lucky ones but the

3416
01:00:36,309 --> 01:00:36,319
i mean we are the lucky ones but the
 

3417
01:00:36,319 --> 01:00:37,670
i mean we are the lucky ones but the
flip side of that

3418
01:00:37,670 --> 01:00:37,680
flip side of that
 

3419
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:40,230
flip side of that
uh is that this hardware also allows us

3420
01:00:40,230 --> 01:00:40,240
uh is that this hardware also allows us
 

3421
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:40,950
uh is that this hardware also allows us
to develop

3422
01:00:40,950 --> 01:00:40,960
to develop
 

3423
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:43,030
to develop
weapons and methods of destroying

3424
01:00:43,030 --> 01:00:43,040
weapons and methods of destroying
 

3425
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:45,190
weapons and methods of destroying
ourselves

3426
01:00:45,190 --> 01:00:45,200
ourselves
 

3427
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:47,430
ourselves
so you again i want to go back to pinker

3428
01:00:47,430 --> 01:00:47,440
so you again i want to go back to pinker
 

3429
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:50,309
so you again i want to go back to pinker
yeah and the better angels of our nature

3430
01:00:50,309 --> 01:00:50,319
yeah and the better angels of our nature
 

3431
01:00:50,319 --> 01:00:53,349
yeah and the better angels of our nature
the whole concept that

3432
01:00:53,349 --> 01:00:53,359
the whole concept that
 

3433
01:00:53,359 --> 01:00:57,990
the whole concept that
civilization and the act of civilizing

3434
01:00:57,990 --> 01:00:58,000
civilization and the act of civilizing
 

3435
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:01,150
civilization and the act of civilizing
has dramatically reduced violence

3436
01:01:01,150 --> 01:01:01,160
has dramatically reduced violence
 

3437
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:04,150
has dramatically reduced violence
dramatically if you look you know

3438
01:01:04,150 --> 01:01:04,160
dramatically if you look you know
 

3439
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:07,270
dramatically if you look you know
at every scale as soon as

3440
01:01:07,270 --> 01:01:07,280
at every scale as soon as
 

3441
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:10,950
at every scale as soon as
organization comes the state basically

3442
01:01:10,950 --> 01:01:10,960
organization comes the state basically
 

3443
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:13,829
organization comes the state basically
owns the right to violence and

3444
01:01:13,829 --> 01:01:13,839
owns the right to violence and
 

3445
01:01:13,839 --> 01:01:15,109
owns the right to violence and
eventually

3446
01:01:15,109 --> 01:01:15,119
eventually
 

3447
01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:18,390
eventually
the state gives that right of

3448
01:01:18,390 --> 01:01:18,400
the state gives that right of
 

3449
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:20,789
the state gives that right of
governance to the people but but

3450
01:01:20,789 --> 01:01:20,799
governance to the people but but
 

3451
01:01:20,799 --> 01:01:22,309
governance to the people but but
violence has been eliminated by that

3452
01:01:22,309 --> 01:01:22,319
violence has been eliminated by that
 

3453
01:01:22,319 --> 01:01:23,270
violence has been eliminated by that
state

3454
01:01:23,270 --> 01:01:23,280
state
 

3455
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:25,990
state
so this whole concept of central

3456
01:01:25,990 --> 01:01:26,000
so this whole concept of central
 

3457
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,030
so this whole concept of central
governance

3458
01:01:27,030 --> 01:01:27,040
governance
 

3459
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:30,789
governance
and people agreeing to live together and

3460
01:01:30,789 --> 01:01:30,799
and people agreeing to live together and
 

3461
01:01:30,799 --> 01:01:33,990
and people agreeing to live together and
share responsibilities and duties

3462
01:01:33,990 --> 01:01:34,000
share responsibilities and duties
 

3463
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:37,190
share responsibilities and duties
and you know all of that is something

3464
01:01:37,190 --> 01:01:37,200
and you know all of that is something
 

3465
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:38,470
and you know all of that is something
that has led

3466
01:01:38,470 --> 01:01:38,480
that has led
 

3467
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:42,230
that has led
so much to less violence less death

3468
01:01:42,230 --> 01:01:42,240
so much to less violence less death
 

3469
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:45,750
so much to less violence less death
less suffering less you know poverty

3470
01:01:45,750 --> 01:01:45,760
less suffering less you know poverty
 

3471
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:49,910
less suffering less you know poverty
less um you know war i mean

3472
01:01:49,910 --> 01:01:49,920
less um you know war i mean
 

3473
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:52,549
less um you know war i mean
yes we have the capability to destroy

3474
01:01:52,549 --> 01:01:52,559
yes we have the capability to destroy
 

3475
01:01:52,559 --> 01:01:53,510
yes we have the capability to destroy
ourselves

3476
01:01:53,510 --> 01:01:53,520
ourselves
 

3477
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:57,349
ourselves
but the arc of civilization has led to

3478
01:01:57,349 --> 01:01:57,359
but the arc of civilization has led to
 

3479
01:01:57,359 --> 01:01:59,109
but the arc of civilization has led to
much much less destruction much much

3480
01:01:59,109 --> 01:01:59,119
much much less destruction much much
 

3481
01:01:59,119 --> 01:02:00,950
much much less destruction much much
less war and much more peace

3482
01:02:00,950 --> 01:02:00,960
less war and much more peace
 

3483
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:03,109
less war and much more peace
and of course there's blips back and

3484
01:02:03,109 --> 01:02:03,119
and of course there's blips back and
 

3485
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:03,990
and of course there's blips back and
forth

3486
01:02:03,990 --> 01:02:04,000
forth
 

3487
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,549
forth
and you know there are setbacks but

3488
01:02:06,549 --> 01:02:06,559
and you know there are setbacks but
 

3489
01:02:06,559 --> 01:02:07,510
and you know there are setbacks but
again

3490
01:02:07,510 --> 01:02:07,520
again
 

3491
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:10,789
again
the moral arc of the universe but it

3492
01:02:10,789 --> 01:02:10,799
the moral arc of the universe but it
 

3493
01:02:10,799 --> 01:02:13,190
the moral arc of the universe but it
seems to just i probably imagine there

3494
01:02:13,190 --> 01:02:13,200
seems to just i probably imagine there
 

3495
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:14,870
seems to just i probably imagine there
were two dinosaurs back in the day

3496
01:02:14,870 --> 01:02:14,880
were two dinosaurs back in the day
 

3497
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:16,950
were two dinosaurs back in the day
having this exact conversation

3498
01:02:16,950 --> 01:02:16,960
having this exact conversation
 

3499
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:18,950
having this exact conversation
and they look up to the sky and there

3500
01:02:18,950 --> 01:02:18,960
and they look up to the sky and there
 

3501
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:21,109
and they look up to the sky and there
seems to be something like an asteroid

3502
01:02:21,109 --> 01:02:21,119
seems to be something like an asteroid
 

3503
01:02:21,119 --> 01:02:23,910
seems to be something like an asteroid
going towards earth so it's while it's

3504
01:02:23,910 --> 01:02:23,920
going towards earth so it's while it's
 

3505
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:24,710
going towards earth so it's while it's
it's very true

3506
01:02:24,710 --> 01:02:24,720
it's very true
 

3507
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:27,670
it's very true
that the the arc of our society of human

3508
01:02:27,670 --> 01:02:27,680
that the the arc of our society of human
 

3509
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:28,470
that the the arc of our society of human
civilization

3510
01:02:28,470 --> 01:02:28,480
civilization
 

3511
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:30,870
civilization
seems to be progressing towards a better

3512
01:02:30,870 --> 01:02:30,880
seems to be progressing towards a better
 

3513
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:32,789
seems to be progressing towards a better
better life for everybody

3514
01:02:32,789 --> 01:02:32,799
better life for everybody
 

3515
01:02:32,799 --> 01:02:35,829
better life for everybody
in in the many ways that you described

3516
01:02:35,829 --> 01:02:35,839
in in the many ways that you described
 

3517
01:02:35,839 --> 01:02:39,029
in in the many ways that you described
uh things can change in a moment

3518
01:02:39,029 --> 01:02:39,039
uh things can change in a moment
 

3519
01:02:39,039 --> 01:02:41,109
uh things can change in a moment
and it feels like it's not just us

3520
01:02:41,109 --> 01:02:41,119
and it feels like it's not just us
 

3521
01:02:41,119 --> 01:02:44,069
and it feels like it's not just us
humans we're living through a pandemic

3522
01:02:44,069 --> 01:02:44,079
humans we're living through a pandemic
 

3523
01:02:44,079 --> 01:02:46,470
humans we're living through a pandemic
you could imagine that a pandemic would

3524
01:02:46,470 --> 01:02:46,480
you could imagine that a pandemic would
 

3525
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:50,309
you could imagine that a pandemic would
be more destructive or

3526
01:02:50,309 --> 01:02:50,319

 

3527
01:02:50,319 --> 01:02:52,069

or there could be asteroids that just

3528
01:02:52,069 --> 01:02:52,079
or there could be asteroids that just
 

3529
01:02:52,079 --> 01:02:54,390
or there could be asteroids that just
appear out of the the darkness of space

3530
01:02:54,390 --> 01:02:54,400
appear out of the the darkness of space
 

3531
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:57,029
appear out of the the darkness of space
which i would recently learned it's not

3532
01:02:57,029 --> 01:02:57,039
which i would recently learned it's not
 

3533
01:02:57,039 --> 01:02:58,390
which i would recently learned it's not
that easy to uh

3534
01:02:58,390 --> 01:02:58,400
that easy to uh
 

3535
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:00,309
that easy to uh
give you another number detect them yes

3536
01:03:00,309 --> 01:03:00,319
give you another number detect them yes
 

3537
01:03:00,319 --> 01:03:01,510
give you another number detect them yes
so 48

3538
01:03:01,510 --> 01:03:01,520
so 48
 

3539
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:04,870
so 48
what happens in 48 years

3540
01:03:04,870 --> 01:03:04,880

 

3541
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:08,630

2068 apophis there's an asteroid that's

3542
01:03:08,630 --> 01:03:08,640
2068 apophis there's an asteroid that's
 

3543
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:09,510
2068 apophis there's an asteroid that's
coming

3544
01:03:09,510 --> 01:03:09,520
coming
 

3545
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:11,589
coming
in 48 years it has very high chance of

3546
01:03:11,589 --> 01:03:11,599
in 48 years it has very high chance of
 

3547
01:03:11,599 --> 01:03:12,870
in 48 years it has very high chance of
actually wiping us out

3548
01:03:12,870 --> 01:03:12,880
actually wiping us out
 

3549
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:16,230
actually wiping us out
completely yes so we have 48

3550
01:03:16,230 --> 01:03:16,240
completely yes so we have 48
 

3551
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:18,710
completely yes so we have 48
48 years to get our act together it's

3552
01:03:18,710 --> 01:03:18,720
48 years to get our act together it's
 

3553
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:20,150
48 years to get our act together it's
not like some distant distant

3554
01:03:20,150 --> 01:03:20,160
not like some distant distant
 

3555
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:22,390
not like some distant distant
hypothesis yes like yeah sure they're

3556
01:03:22,390 --> 01:03:22,400
hypothesis yes like yeah sure they're
 

3557
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:23,670
hypothesis yes like yeah sure they're
hard to detect but this one we know

3558
01:03:23,670 --> 01:03:23,680
hard to detect but this one we know
 

3559
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:25,109
hard to detect but this one we know
about it's coming

3560
01:03:25,109 --> 01:03:25,119
about it's coming
 

3561
01:03:25,119 --> 01:03:26,390
about it's coming
so how do you feel about that why are

3562
01:03:26,390 --> 01:03:26,400
so how do you feel about that why are
 

3563
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:28,710
so how do you feel about that why are
you still talking oh gosh i'm so happy

3564
01:03:28,710 --> 01:03:28,720
you still talking oh gosh i'm so happy
 

3565
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:30,150
you still talking oh gosh i'm so happy
with where we are now this is going to

3566
01:03:30,150 --> 01:03:30,160
with where we are now this is going to
 

3567
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:31,589
with where we are now this is going to
be great seriously if you look at

3568
01:03:31,589 --> 01:03:31,599
be great seriously if you look at
 

3569
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:32,710
be great seriously if you look at
progress

3570
01:03:32,710 --> 01:03:32,720
progress
 

3571
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:35,109
progress
if you look at again the speed with

3572
01:03:35,109 --> 01:03:35,119
if you look at again the speed with
 

3573
01:03:35,119 --> 01:03:36,069
if you look at again the speed with
which

3574
01:03:36,069 --> 01:03:36,079
which
 

3575
01:03:36,079 --> 01:03:38,870
which
knowledge has been transferred what what

3576
01:03:38,870 --> 01:03:38,880
knowledge has been transferred what what
 

3577
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:39,190
knowledge has been transferred what what
has

3578
01:03:39,190 --> 01:03:39,200
has
 

3579
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:41,910
has
led to humanity making so many advances

3580
01:03:41,910 --> 01:03:41,920
led to humanity making so many advances
 

3581
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:43,190
led to humanity making so many advances
so fast

3582
01:03:43,190 --> 01:03:43,200
so fast
 

3583
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:46,230
so fast
okay so what has led to humanity

3584
01:03:46,230 --> 01:03:46,240
okay so what has led to humanity
 

3585
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:48,230
okay so what has led to humanity
making so many advances is not just the

3586
01:03:48,230 --> 01:03:48,240
making so many advances is not just the
 

3587
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:50,230
making so many advances is not just the
hardware upgrades

3588
01:03:50,230 --> 01:03:50,240
hardware upgrades
 

3589
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:52,789
hardware upgrades
it's also the software upgrades so by

3590
01:03:52,789 --> 01:03:52,799
it's also the software upgrades so by
 

3591
01:03:52,799 --> 01:03:54,390
it's also the software upgrades so by
hardware upgrades i basically mean our

3592
01:03:54,390 --> 01:03:54,400
hardware upgrades i basically mean our
 

3593
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:55,430
hardware upgrades i basically mean our
neocortex

3594
01:03:55,430 --> 01:03:55,440
neocortex
 

3595
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:57,670
neocortex
and the expansion and these layers and

3596
01:03:57,670 --> 01:03:57,680
and the expansion and these layers and
 

3597
01:03:57,680 --> 01:03:59,349
and the expansion and these layers and
you know folds of her brain

3598
01:03:59,349 --> 01:03:59,359
you know folds of her brain
 

3599
01:03:59,359 --> 01:04:01,510
you know folds of her brain
and all of that that's the hardware the

3600
01:04:01,510 --> 01:04:01,520
and all of that that's the hardware the
 

3601
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:02,470
and all of that that's the hardware the
software

3602
01:04:02,470 --> 01:04:02,480
software
 

3603
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:05,349
software
hasn't uh you know the the hardware

3604
01:04:05,349 --> 01:04:05,359
hasn't uh you know the the hardware
 

3605
01:04:05,359 --> 01:04:06,470
hasn't uh you know the the hardware
hasn't changed much

3606
01:04:06,470 --> 01:04:06,480
hasn't changed much
 

3607
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:10,470
hasn't changed much
in the last what seventy thousand years

3608
01:04:10,470 --> 01:04:10,480

 

3609
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:12,309

as i mentioned last time if you take a

3610
01:04:12,309 --> 01:04:12,319
as i mentioned last time if you take a
 

3611
01:04:12,319 --> 01:04:13,990
as i mentioned last time if you take a
person from ancient egypt and you bring

3612
01:04:13,990 --> 01:04:14,000
person from ancient egypt and you bring
 

3613
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:15,109
person from ancient egypt and you bring
them up now

3614
01:04:15,109 --> 01:04:15,119
them up now
 

3615
01:04:15,119 --> 01:04:18,950
them up now
they're just as equally fit so

3616
01:04:18,950 --> 01:04:18,960
they're just as equally fit so
 

3617
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:21,589
they're just as equally fit so
hardware hasn't changed what has changed

3618
01:04:21,589 --> 01:04:21,599
hardware hasn't changed what has changed
 

3619
01:04:21,599 --> 01:04:22,309
hardware hasn't changed what has changed
is software

3620
01:04:22,309 --> 01:04:22,319
is software
 

3621
01:04:22,319 --> 01:04:26,230
is software
what has changed is that we

3622
01:04:26,230 --> 01:04:26,240
what has changed is that we
 

3623
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:29,109
what has changed is that we
are growing up in societies that are

3624
01:04:29,109 --> 01:04:29,119
are growing up in societies that are
 

3625
01:04:29,119 --> 01:04:30,789
are growing up in societies that are
much more complex

3626
01:04:30,789 --> 01:04:30,799
much more complex
 

3627
01:04:30,799 --> 01:04:33,349
much more complex
this whole concept of neotimi basically

3628
01:04:33,349 --> 01:04:33,359
this whole concept of neotimi basically
 

3629
01:04:33,359 --> 01:04:35,750
this whole concept of neotimi basically
allows our exponential growth

3630
01:04:35,750 --> 01:04:35,760
allows our exponential growth
 

3631
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:38,470
allows our exponential growth
the concept that our brain has not fully

3632
01:04:38,470 --> 01:04:38,480
the concept that our brain has not fully
 

3633
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:40,710
the concept that our brain has not fully
formed has not fully

3634
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:40,720
formed has not fully
 

3635
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:42,710
formed has not fully
stabilized itself until after teenage

3636
01:04:42,710 --> 01:04:42,720
stabilized itself until after teenage
 

3637
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:45,270
stabilized itself until after teenage
years so we basically have a good 16

3638
01:04:45,270 --> 01:04:45,280
years so we basically have a good 16
 

3639
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:46,549
years so we basically have a good 16
years 18 years

3640
01:04:46,549 --> 01:04:46,559
years 18 years
 

3641
01:04:46,559 --> 01:04:48,950
years 18 years
to sort of infuse it with the latest and

3642
01:04:48,950 --> 01:04:48,960
to sort of infuse it with the latest and
 

3643
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:51,190
to sort of infuse it with the latest and
greatest in software

3644
01:04:51,190 --> 01:04:51,200
greatest in software
 

3645
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:52,549
greatest in software
if you look at what happened in ancient

3646
01:04:52,549 --> 01:04:52,559
if you look at what happened in ancient
 

3647
01:04:52,559 --> 01:04:54,710
if you look at what happened in ancient
greece why

3648
01:04:54,710 --> 01:04:54,720
greece why
 

3649
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:57,910
greece why
did everything explode at once my take

3650
01:04:57,910 --> 01:04:57,920
did everything explode at once my take
 

3651
01:04:57,920 --> 01:04:58,549
did everything explode at once my take
on this

3652
01:04:58,549 --> 01:04:58,559
on this
 

3653
01:04:58,559 --> 01:05:00,870
on this
is that it was the shift from the

3654
01:05:00,870 --> 01:05:00,880
is that it was the shift from the
 

3655
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:03,430
is that it was the shift from the
egyptian and hieroglyphic software

3656
01:05:03,430 --> 01:05:03,440
egyptian and hieroglyphic software
 

3657
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:06,470
egyptian and hieroglyphic software
to the greek language software

3658
01:05:06,470 --> 01:05:06,480
to the greek language software
 

3659
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:08,710
to the greek language software
this whole concept of creating abstract

3660
01:05:08,710 --> 01:05:08,720
this whole concept of creating abstract
 

3661
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:09,910
this whole concept of creating abstract
notions

layers of cognition

3666
01:05:16,630 --> 01:05:16,640
layers of cognition
 

3667
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:18,630
layers of cognition
and layers of meaning and layers of

01:05:30,559 --> 01:05:32,630
of
peace and justice and you know these

3682
01:05:32,630 --> 01:05:32,640
peace and justice and you know these
 

3683
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:34,390
peace and justice and you know these
concepts of

3684
01:05:34,390 --> 01:05:34,400
concepts of
 

3685
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:37,910
concepts of
or even you know uh macabre concepts

3686
01:05:37,910 --> 01:05:37,920
or even you know uh macabre concepts
 

3687
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:40,870
or even you know uh macabre concepts
of doom etc like you don't you don't

3688
01:05:40,870 --> 01:05:40,880
of doom etc like you don't you don't
 

3689
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:42,150
of doom etc like you don't you don't
have the language for it

3690
01:05:42,150 --> 01:05:42,160
have the language for it
 

3691
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:45,270
have the language for it
your brain has trouble

3692
01:05:45,270 --> 01:05:45,280
your brain has trouble
 

3693
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:48,309
your brain has trouble
getting at that concept

3694
01:05:48,309 --> 01:05:48,319
getting at that concept
 

3695
01:05:48,319 --> 01:05:51,670
getting at that concept
so what i'm trying to say is that these

3696
01:05:51,670 --> 01:05:51,680
so what i'm trying to say is that these
 

3697
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:53,190
so what i'm trying to say is that these
software upgrades

3698
01:05:53,190 --> 01:05:53,200
software upgrades
 

3699
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:57,029
software upgrades
for human language human culture

3700
01:05:57,029 --> 01:05:57,039
for human language human culture
 

3701
01:05:57,039 --> 01:06:00,230
for human language human culture
human environment human education have

3702
01:06:00,230 --> 01:06:00,240
human environment human education have
 

3703
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:03,510
human environment human education have
basically led to this enormous explosion

3704
01:06:03,510 --> 01:06:03,520
basically led to this enormous explosion
 

3705
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:06,390
basically led to this enormous explosion
of knowledge and eventually after the

3706
01:06:06,390 --> 01:06:06,400
of knowledge and eventually after the
 

3707
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:07,270
of knowledge and eventually after the
enlightenment

3708
01:06:07,270 --> 01:06:07,280
enlightenment
 

3709
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:09,910
enlightenment
and as i was mentioning the 42 line

3710
01:06:09,910 --> 01:06:09,920
and as i was mentioning the 42 line
 

3711
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:11,270
and as i was mentioning the 42 line
bible

3712

bible
 

3713
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:12,950
bible
and the printed press the dissemination

3714
01:06:12,950 --> 01:06:12,960
and the printed press the dissemination
 

3715
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:14,710
and the printed press the dissemination
of knowledge you basically now have this

3716
01:06:14,710 --> 01:06:14,720
of knowledge you basically now have this
 

3717
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:16,150
of knowledge you basically now have this
whole horizontal

3718

whole horizontal
 

3719
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:18,789
whole horizontal

reason why human civilization exploded
 

3735
01:06:31,359 --> 01:06:32,710
reason why human civilization exploded
is not a hardware change anymore it's

3736
01:06:32,710 --> 01:06:32,720
is not a hardware change anymore it's
 

3737
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:34,549
is not a hardware change anymore it's
really a software change

3738
01:06:34,549 --> 01:06:34,559
really a software change
 

3739
01:06:34,559 --> 01:06:36,549
really a software change
so if you're looking at now where we are

3740
01:06:36,549 --> 01:06:36,559
so if you're looking at now where we are
 

3741
01:06:36,559 --> 01:06:38,950
so if you're looking at now where we are
today

3742
01:06:38,950 --> 01:06:38,960
today
 

3743
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:41,510
today
look at coronavirus yes sure it could

3744
01:06:41,510 --> 01:06:41,520
look at coronavirus yes sure it could
 

3745
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:42,470
look at coronavirus yes sure it could
have killed us

3746
01:06:42,470 --> 01:06:42,480
have killed us
 

3747
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:44,710
have killed us
a hundred years ago it would have but it

3748
01:06:44,710 --> 01:06:44,720
a hundred years ago it would have but it
 

3749
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:45,589
a hundred years ago it would have but it
didn't

3750
01:06:45,589 --> 01:06:45,599
didn't
 

3751
01:06:45,599 --> 01:06:49,029
didn't
why because in january we

3752
01:06:49,029 --> 01:06:49,039
why because in january we
 

3753
01:06:49,039 --> 01:06:52,069
why because in january we
we published the genome a month later

3754
01:06:52,069 --> 01:06:52,079
we published the genome a month later
 

3755
01:06:52,079 --> 01:06:53,270
we published the genome a month later
less than a month later the first

3756
01:06:53,270 --> 01:06:53,280
less than a month later the first
 

3757
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:54,870
less than a month later the first
vaccine designs were done

3758
01:06:54,870 --> 01:06:54,880
vaccine designs were done
 

3759
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:57,510
vaccine designs were done
and now less than a year later 10 months

3760
01:06:57,510 --> 01:06:57,520
and now less than a year later 10 months
 

3761
01:06:57,520 --> 01:06:58,069
and now less than a year later 10 months
later

3762
01:06:58,069 --> 01:06:58,079
later
 

3763
01:06:58,079 --> 01:06:59,670
later
we already have a working vaccine that's

3764
01:06:59,670 --> 01:06:59,680
we already have a working vaccine that's
 

3765
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:02,390
we already have a working vaccine that's
90 efficient i mean that is ridiculous

3766
01:07:02,390 --> 01:07:02,400
90 efficient i mean that is ridiculous
 

3767
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:02,789
90 efficient i mean that is ridiculous
by

3768
01:07:02,789 --> 01:07:02,799
by
 

3769
01:07:02,799 --> 01:07:05,990
by
any standards and the reason is sharing

3770
01:07:05,990 --> 01:07:06,000
any standards and the reason is sharing
 

3771
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,390
any standards and the reason is sharing
so you know the asteroid yes could wipe

3772
01:07:08,390 --> 01:07:08,400
so you know the asteroid yes could wipe
 

3773
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:10,870
so you know the asteroid yes could wipe
us out in 48 years but 48 years

3774
01:07:10,870 --> 01:07:10,880
us out in 48 years but 48 years
 

3775
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:12,829
us out in 48 years but 48 years
i mean look at where we were 48 years

3776
01:07:12,829 --> 01:07:12,839
i mean look at where we were 48 years
 

3777
01:07:12,839 --> 01:07:14,230
i mean look at where we were 48 years
ago

3778
01:07:14,230 --> 01:07:14,240
ago
 

3779
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:17,430
ago
technologically i mean how much more we

3780
01:07:17,430 --> 01:07:17,440
technologically i mean how much more we
 

3781
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:18,390
technologically i mean how much more we
understand

3782
01:07:18,390 --> 01:07:18,400
understand
 

3783
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:21,910
understand
the basic foundations of space

3784
01:07:21,910 --> 01:07:21,920
the basic foundations of space
 

3785
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:23,910
the basic foundations of space
is enormous the technological

3786
01:07:23,910 --> 01:07:23,920
is enormous the technological
 

3787
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:25,910
is enormous the technological
revolutions of

3788
01:07:25,910 --> 01:07:25,920
revolutions of
 

3789
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:29,270
revolutions of
digitization the amount of compute power

3790
01:07:29,270 --> 01:07:29,280
digitization the amount of compute power
 

3791
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:30,789
digitization the amount of compute power
we can put on any like

3792
01:07:30,789 --> 01:07:30,799
we can put on any like
 

3793
01:07:30,799 --> 01:07:34,549
we can put on any like
you know by in nail size

3794
01:07:34,549 --> 01:07:34,559
you know by in nail size
 

3795
01:07:34,559 --> 01:07:37,670
you know by in nail size
you know hardware is enormous so and

3796
01:07:37,670 --> 01:07:37,680
you know hardware is enormous so and
 

3797
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:38,069
you know hardware is enormous so and
this

3798
01:07:38,069 --> 01:07:38,079
this
 

3799
01:07:38,079 --> 01:07:40,789
this
is nowhere near ending you know we all

3800
01:07:40,789 --> 01:07:40,799
is nowhere near ending you know we all
 

3801
01:07:40,799 --> 01:07:41,990
is nowhere near ending you know we all
have our like little

3802
01:07:41,990 --> 01:07:42,000
have our like little
 

3803
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,750
have our like little
you know problems going back and forth

3804
01:07:43,750 --> 01:07:43,760
you know problems going back and forth
 

3805
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:45,430
you know problems going back and forth
on the social side yeah and on the

3806
01:07:45,430 --> 01:07:45,440
on the social side yeah and on the
 

3807
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:47,349
on the social side yeah and on the
political side on the cognitive

3808
01:07:47,349 --> 01:07:47,359
political side on the cognitive
 

3809
01:07:47,359 --> 01:07:49,430
political side on the cognitive
and on the sort of human side and the

3810
01:07:49,430 --> 01:07:49,440
and on the sort of human side and the
 

3811
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:50,549
and on the sort of human side and the
societal side

3812
01:07:50,549 --> 01:07:50,559
societal side
 

3813
01:07:50,559 --> 01:07:54,069
societal side
but science has not slowed down

3814
01:07:54,069 --> 01:07:54,079
but science has not slowed down
 

3815
01:07:54,079 --> 01:07:56,549
but science has not slowed down
science is moving at a breakneck pace

3816
01:07:56,549 --> 01:07:56,559
science is moving at a breakneck pace
 

3817
01:07:56,559 --> 01:07:57,349
science is moving at a breakneck pace
ahead

3818
01:07:57,349 --> 01:07:57,359
ahead
 

3819
01:07:57,359 --> 01:07:59,910
ahead
so you know elon is now putting rockets

3820
01:07:59,910 --> 01:07:59,920
so you know elon is now putting rockets
 

3821
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:00,549
so you know elon is now putting rockets
out

3822
01:08:00,549 --> 01:08:00,559
out
 

3823
01:08:00,559 --> 01:08:02,990
out
from the private space i mean that now

3824
01:08:02,990 --> 01:08:03,000
from the private space i mean that now
 

3825
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:04,150
from the private space i mean that now
democratization

3826
01:08:04,150 --> 01:08:04,160
democratization
 

3827
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:07,510
democratization
of space exploration is you know gonna

3828
01:08:07,510 --> 01:08:07,520
of space exploration is you know gonna
 

3829
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:08,950
of space exploration is you know gonna
reveal it's gonna explode

3830
01:08:08,950 --> 01:08:08,960
reveal it's gonna explode
 

3831
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:10,950
reveal it's gonna explode
continue in the same way that every

3832
01:08:10,950 --> 01:08:10,960
continue in the same way that every
 

3833
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:12,470
continue in the same way that every
technology has exploded

3834
01:08:12,470 --> 01:08:12,480
technology has exploded
 

3835
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:15,029
technology has exploded
this is the shift to space technology

3836
01:08:15,029 --> 01:08:15,039
this is the shift to space technology
 

3837
01:08:15,039 --> 01:08:15,829
this is the shift to space technology
exploding

3838
01:08:15,829 --> 01:08:15,839
exploding
 

3839
01:08:15,839 --> 01:08:19,269
exploding
so 48 years is infinity from now

3840
01:08:19,269 --> 01:08:19,279
so 48 years is infinity from now
 

3841
01:08:19,279 --> 01:08:21,430
so 48 years is infinity from now
in terms of space capabilities so i'm

3842
01:08:21,430 --> 01:08:21,440
in terms of space capabilities so i'm
 

3843
01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:22,470
in terms of space capabilities so i'm
not worried at all

3844
01:08:22,470 --> 01:08:22,480
not worried at all
 

3845
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:24,229
not worried at all
are you excited by the possibility of a

3846
01:08:24,229 --> 01:08:24,239
are you excited by the possibility of a
 

3847
01:08:24,239 --> 01:08:25,829
are you excited by the possibility of a
human

3848
01:08:25,829 --> 01:08:25,839
human
 

3849
01:08:25,839 --> 01:08:29,030
human
well one human stepping foot on mars and

3850
01:08:29,030 --> 01:08:29,040
well one human stepping foot on mars and
 

3851
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:32,149
well one human stepping foot on mars and
to possible colonization of not

3852
01:08:32,149 --> 01:08:32,159
to possible colonization of not
 

3853
01:08:32,159 --> 01:08:33,990
to possible colonization of not
necessarily mars but other planets and

3854
01:08:33,990 --> 01:08:34,000
necessarily mars but other planets and
 

3855
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:35,430
necessarily mars but other planets and
all that kind of stuff for people living

3856
01:08:35,430 --> 01:08:35,440
all that kind of stuff for people living
 

3857
01:08:35,440 --> 01:08:36,070
all that kind of stuff for people living
in space

3858
01:08:36,070 --> 01:08:36,080
in space
 

3859
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:38,390
in space
inevitable and never inevitable would

3860
01:08:38,390 --> 01:08:38,400
inevitable and never inevitable would
 

3861
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:41,430
inevitable and never inevitable would
you do it are you kind of like earth

3862
01:08:41,430 --> 01:08:41,440
you do it are you kind of like earth
 

3863
01:08:41,440 --> 01:08:43,030
you do it are you kind of like earth
you know how many how many how many

3864
01:08:43,030 --> 01:08:43,040
you know how many how many how many
 

3865
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:44,950
you know how many how many how many
people will you wait when you wait for

3866
01:08:44,950 --> 01:08:44,960
people will you wait when you wait for
 

3867
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:47,829
people will you wait when you wait for
i think it was about when um the the

3868
01:08:47,829 --> 01:08:47,839
i think it was about when um the the
 

3869
01:08:47,839 --> 01:08:48,630
i think it was about when um the the
declaration of

3870
01:08:48,630 --> 01:08:48,640
declaration of
 

3871
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:50,870
declaration of
independence was signs about two to

3872
01:08:50,870 --> 01:08:50,880
independence was signs about two to
 

3873
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:51,990
independence was signs about two to
three million people lived

3874
01:08:51,990 --> 01:08:52,000
three million people lived
 

3875
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,470
three million people lived
here so would you move like before would

3876
01:08:54,470 --> 01:08:54,480
here so would you move like before would
 

3877
01:08:54,480 --> 01:08:55,430
here so would you move like before would
you be like

3878
01:08:55,430 --> 01:08:55,440
you be like
 

3879
01:08:55,440 --> 01:08:57,510
you be like
on the first boat would you be on the

3880
01:08:57,510 --> 01:08:57,520
on the first boat would you be on the
 

3881
01:08:57,520 --> 01:08:59,030
on the first boat would you be on the
10th boat would you wait until the

3882
01:08:59,030 --> 01:08:59,040
10th boat would you wait until the
 

3883
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:00,390
10th boat would you wait until the
declaration of independence

3884
01:09:00,390 --> 01:09:00,400
declaration of independence
 

3885
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:01,990
declaration of independence
i don't think i'll be on the shortlist

3886
01:09:01,990 --> 01:09:02,000
i don't think i'll be on the shortlist
 

3887
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,829
i don't think i'll be on the shortlist
because i'll be old by then

3888
01:09:03,829 --> 01:09:03,839
because i'll be old by then
 

3889
01:09:03,839 --> 01:09:05,269
because i'll be old by then
they'll probably get a bunch of younger

3890
01:09:05,269 --> 01:09:05,279
they'll probably get a bunch of younger
 

3891
01:09:05,279 --> 01:09:08,070
they'll probably get a bunch of younger
people but you're it's the

3892
01:09:08,070 --> 01:09:08,080
people but you're it's the
 

3893
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:11,110
people but you're it's the
it's the wisdom and the uh the wait

3894
01:09:11,110 --> 01:09:11,120
it's the wisdom and the uh the wait
 

3895
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:12,550
it's the wisdom and the uh the wait
then you are in the classroom

3896
01:09:12,550 --> 01:09:12,560
then you are in the classroom
 

3897
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:14,470
then you are in the classroom
horizontally you i gotta tell you you

3898
01:09:14,470 --> 01:09:14,480
horizontally you i gotta tell you you
 

3899
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:15,749
horizontally you i gotta tell you you
are the lucky one so you might be on the

3900
01:09:15,749 --> 01:09:15,759
are the lucky one so you might be on the
 

3901
01:09:15,759 --> 01:09:16,630
are the lucky one so you might be on the
list i don't know

3902
01:09:16,630 --> 01:09:16,640
list i don't know
 

3903
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:19,510
list i don't know
yeah i mean i i kind of feel like i

3904
01:09:19,510 --> 01:09:19,520
yeah i mean i i kind of feel like i
 

3905
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:20,709
yeah i mean i i kind of feel like i
would love to see

3906
01:09:20,709 --> 01:09:20,719
would love to see
 

3907
01:09:20,719 --> 01:09:22,950
would love to see
earth from above just to watch our

3908
01:09:22,950 --> 01:09:22,960
earth from above just to watch our
 

3909
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:23,749
earth from above just to watch our
planet

3910
01:09:23,749 --> 01:09:23,759
planet
 

3911
01:09:23,759 --> 01:09:25,749
planet
i mean just i mean you know you can

3912
01:09:25,749 --> 01:09:25,759
i mean just i mean you know you can
 

3913
01:09:25,759 --> 01:09:27,829
i mean just i mean you know you can
watch a live feed of the

3914
01:09:27,829 --> 01:09:27,839
watch a live feed of the
 

3915
01:09:27,839 --> 01:09:31,110
watch a live feed of the
space station watching earth

3916
01:09:31,110 --> 01:09:31,120
space station watching earth
 

3917
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:34,390
space station watching earth
is magnificent like this blue tiny

3918
01:09:34,390 --> 01:09:34,400
is magnificent like this blue tiny
 

3919
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:35,829
is magnificent like this blue tiny
little shield

3920
01:09:35,829 --> 01:09:35,839
little shield
 

3921
01:09:35,839 --> 01:09:38,309
little shield
it's so thin our atmosphere like if you

3922
01:09:38,309 --> 01:09:38,319
it's so thin our atmosphere like if you
 

3923
01:09:38,319 --> 01:09:39,829
it's so thin our atmosphere like if you
drive to new york you're basically in

3924
01:09:39,829 --> 01:09:39,839
drive to new york you're basically in
 

3925
01:09:39,839 --> 01:09:41,510
drive to new york you're basically in
outer space i mean it's ridiculous it's

3926
01:09:41,510 --> 01:09:41,520
outer space i mean it's ridiculous it's
 

3927
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:43,269
outer space i mean it's ridiculous it's
just so thin

3928
01:09:43,269 --> 01:09:43,279
just so thin
 

3929
01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:45,030
just so thin
and it's just again such a privilege to

3930
01:09:45,030 --> 01:09:45,040
and it's just again such a privilege to
 

3931
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:47,269
and it's just again such a privilege to
be on this planet such a privilege

3932
01:09:47,269 --> 01:09:47,279
be on this planet such a privilege
 

3933
01:09:47,279 --> 01:09:51,349
be on this planet such a privilege
but i think our species is in for

3934
01:09:51,349 --> 01:09:51,359
but i think our species is in for
 

3935
01:09:51,359 --> 01:09:54,709
but i think our species is in for
big good things

3936
01:09:54,709 --> 01:09:54,719

 

3937
01:09:54,719 --> 01:09:57,430

i think that you know we will overcome

3938
01:09:57,430 --> 01:09:57,440
i think that you know we will overcome
 

3939
01:09:57,440 --> 01:09:58,870
i think that you know we will overcome
our little problems

3940
01:09:58,870 --> 01:09:58,880
our little problems
 

3941
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:00,870
our little problems
and eventually come together as a

3942
01:10:00,870 --> 01:10:00,880
and eventually come together as a
 

3943
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:02,070
and eventually come together as a
species i feel that we

3944
01:10:02,070 --> 01:10:02,080
species i feel that we
 

3945
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:04,310
species i feel that we
we we're definitely on the path to that

3946
01:10:04,310 --> 01:10:04,320
we we're definitely on the path to that
 

3947
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:05,350
we we're definitely on the path to that
and

3948
01:10:05,350 --> 01:10:05,360
and
 

3949
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:07,990
and
you know it's just not permeated through

3950
01:10:07,990 --> 01:10:08,000
you know it's just not permeated through
 

3951
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:08,950
you know it's just not permeated through
the whole

3952
01:10:08,950 --> 01:10:08,960
the whole
 

3953
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:10,470
the whole
universe yeah i mean through the whole

3954
01:10:10,470 --> 01:10:10,480
universe yeah i mean through the whole
 

3955
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:12,390
universe yeah i mean through the whole
world yet through the whole earth yet

3956
01:10:12,390 --> 01:10:12,400
world yet through the whole earth yet
 

3957
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:15,590
world yet through the whole earth yet
but it's definitely permeating so you've

3958
01:10:15,590 --> 01:10:15,600
but it's definitely permeating so you've
 

3959
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:18,790
but it's definitely permeating so you've
talked about humans as special

3960
01:10:18,790 --> 01:10:18,800
talked about humans as special
 

3961
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:22,470
talked about humans as special
how exactly are we special relative to

3962
01:10:22,470 --> 01:10:22,480
how exactly are we special relative to
 

3963
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:25,510
how exactly are we special relative to
the dinosaurs so i mentioned that

3964
01:10:25,510 --> 01:10:25,520
the dinosaurs so i mentioned that
 

3965
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:28,149
the dinosaurs so i mentioned that
there's um you know this dramatic

3966
01:10:28,149 --> 01:10:28,159
there's um you know this dramatic
 

3967
01:10:28,159 --> 01:10:29,270
there's um you know this dramatic
cognitive

3968
01:10:29,270 --> 01:10:29,280
cognitive
 

3969
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:32,470
cognitive
improvement that we've made but i think

3970
01:10:32,470 --> 01:10:32,480
improvement that we've made but i think
 

3971
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:32,950
improvement that we've made but i think
it goes

3972
01:10:32,950 --> 01:10:32,960
it goes
 

3973
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:35,350
it goes
much deeper than that so if you look at

3974
01:10:35,350 --> 01:10:35,360
much deeper than that so if you look at
 

3975
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:36,470
much deeper than that so if you look at
a lion

3976
01:10:36,470 --> 01:10:36,480
a lion
 

3977
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:39,189
a lion
attacking a gazelle in the middle of the

3978
01:10:39,189 --> 01:10:39,199
attacking a gazelle in the middle of the
 

3979
01:10:39,199 --> 01:10:40,870
attacking a gazelle in the middle of the
serengeti

3987
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:51,750

hormones and neuroreceptors are sort of

3988
01:10:51,750 --> 01:10:51,760
hormones and neuroreceptors are sort of
 

3989
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:54,470
hormones and neuroreceptors are sort of
getting it ready for impulse

3990
01:10:54,470 --> 01:10:54,480
getting it ready for impulse

kind of
seen the hunt yes i've kind of seen the

seen the hunt yes i've kind of seen the
 

4001
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:08,229
seen the hunt yes i've kind of seen the
sort of game of waiting

and the mitochondria in the muscles
 

4005
01:11:12,159 --> 01:11:15,750
and the mitochondria in the muscles
of the lion are basically ready for

4006
01:11:15,750 --> 01:11:15,760
of the lion are basically ready for

01:11:18,950 --> 01:11:18,960
you know jumping they're
 

4009
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:21,350
you know jumping they're
expensing an enormous amount of energy

01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:27,590
the grass as it's flowing
is constantly transforming solar energy

4014
01:11:27,590 --> 01:11:27,600
is constantly transforming solar energy
 

4015
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:30,229
is constantly transforming solar energy
into chloroplasts you know through the

the lions and so forth so as

4024
01:11:39,350 --> 01:11:39,360
the lions and so forth so as
 

4025
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:44,229
the lions and so forth so as
humans we experience all of that

4026
01:11:44,229 --> 01:11:44,239
humans we experience all of that
 

4027
01:11:44,239 --> 01:11:47,510
humans we experience all of that
but the lion only experiences

4028
01:11:47,510 --> 01:11:47,520
but the lion only experiences
 

4029
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:51,030
but the lion only experiences
one layer the mitochondria in its body

4030
01:11:51,030 --> 01:11:51,040
one layer the mitochondria in its body
 

4031
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:52,470
one layer the mitochondria in its body
are only experiencing one layer the

01:11:52,470 --> 01:11:52,480
are only experiencing one layer the
 

4033
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:54,070
are only experiencing one layer the

layer
 

4037
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:58,790
layer
the you know photoreceptors and the

4038
01:11:58,790 --> 01:11:58,800
the you know photoreceptors and the
 

4039
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:00,550
the you know photoreceptors and the
smell receptors the chemical receptors

4040
01:12:00,550 --> 01:12:00,560
smell receptors the chemical receptors
 

4041
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:02,149
smell receptors the chemical receptors
like the lion always attacks against the

4042
01:12:02,149 --> 01:12:02,159
like the lion always attacks against the
 

4043
01:12:02,159 --> 01:12:02,630
like the lion always attacks against the
wind

4044
01:12:02,630 --> 01:12:02,640
wind
 

4045
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:05,830
wind
so that it's not smelled like

4046
01:12:05,830 --> 01:12:05,840
so that it's not smelled like
 

4047
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:08,870
so that it's not smelled like
all of these things are

4048
01:12:08,870 --> 01:12:08,880
all of these things are
 

4049
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:11,910
all of these things are
one layer at a time and we humans

4050
01:12:11,910 --> 01:12:11,920
one layer at a time and we humans
 

4051
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:14,630
one layer at a time and we humans
somehow perceive the whole stack

4052
01:12:14,630 --> 01:12:14,640
somehow perceive the whole stack
 

4053
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:17,030
somehow perceive the whole stack
so going back to software infrastructure

4054
01:12:17,030 --> 01:12:17,040
so going back to software infrastructure
 

4055
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:18,630
so going back to software infrastructure
and hardware infrastructure

4056
01:12:18,630 --> 01:12:18,640
and hardware infrastructure
 

4057
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:21,030
and hardware infrastructure
if you design a computer you basically

4058
01:12:21,030 --> 01:12:21,040
if you design a computer you basically
 

4059
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:22,149
if you design a computer you basically
have a physical layer

4060
01:12:22,149 --> 01:12:22,159
have a physical layer
 

4061
01:12:22,159 --> 01:12:23,910
have a physical layer
that you start with and then on top of

4062
01:12:23,910 --> 01:12:23,920
that you start with and then on top of
 

4063
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:25,430
that you start with and then on top of
that physical layer you have

4064
01:12:25,430 --> 01:12:25,440
that physical layer you have
 

4065
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:27,590
that physical layer you have
you know the electrical layer and on top

4066
01:12:27,590 --> 01:12:27,600
you know the electrical layer and on top
 

4067
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:29,030
you know the electrical layer and on top
of the electrical layer you have

4068
01:12:29,030 --> 01:12:29,040
of the electrical layer you have
 

4069
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:31,430
of the electrical layer you have
basically gates and logic and an

4070
01:12:31,430 --> 01:12:31,440
basically gates and logic and an
 

4071
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:32,550
basically gates and logic and an
assembly layer

4072
01:12:32,550 --> 01:12:32,560
assembly layer
 

4073
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:33,750
assembly layer
and on top of the assembly layer you

4074
01:12:33,750 --> 01:12:33,760
and on top of the assembly layer you
 

4075
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:36,390
and on top of the assembly layer you
have your you know higher order

4076
01:12:36,390 --> 01:12:36,400
have your you know higher order
 

4077
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:38,070
have your you know higher order
higher level programming and on top of

4078
01:12:38,070 --> 01:12:38,080
higher level programming and on top of
 

4079
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:39,590
higher level programming and on top of
that you have your deep learning routine

4080
01:12:39,590 --> 01:12:39,600
that you have your deep learning routine
 

4081
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:40,229
that you have your deep learning routine
etc

4082
01:12:40,229 --> 01:12:40,239
etc
 

4083
01:12:40,239 --> 01:12:42,149
etc
and on top of that you eventually build

4084
01:12:42,149 --> 01:12:42,159
and on top of that you eventually build
 

4085
01:12:42,159 --> 01:12:43,910
and on top of that you eventually build
a cognitive system

4086
01:12:43,910 --> 01:12:43,920
a cognitive system
 

4087
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:47,669
a cognitive system
that's smart i want you to now picture

4088
01:12:47,669 --> 01:12:47,679
that's smart i want you to now picture
 

4089
01:12:47,679 --> 01:12:50,790
that's smart i want you to now picture
this cognitive system becoming not just

4090
01:12:50,790 --> 01:12:50,800
this cognitive system becoming not just
 

4091
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:53,270
this cognitive system becoming not just
self-aware

4092
01:12:53,270 --> 01:12:53,280
self-aware
 

4093
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:55,910
self-aware
but also becoming aware of the hardware

4094
01:12:55,910 --> 01:12:55,920
but also becoming aware of the hardware
 

4095
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:57,669
but also becoming aware of the hardware
that it's made of

01:12:57,669 --> 01:12:57,679
that it's made of
 

4097
01:12:57,679 --> 01:12:59,750
that it's made of
and the atoms that there that it's made

what basically humans are doing
so if you if you look at our reasoning

4160
01:14:07,510 --> 01:14:07,520
so if you if you look at our reasoning

01:18:08,870 --> 01:18:08,880
out i've been
 

4395
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:10,470
out i've been
building all these beautiful things and

4396
01:18:10,470 --> 01:18:10,480
building all these beautiful things and
 

4397
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:12,070
building all these beautiful things and
somebody can appreciate it and figured

4398
01:18:12,070 --> 01:18:12,080
somebody can appreciate it and figured
 

4399
01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:13,910
somebody can appreciate it and figured
me out from god's perspective meaning

4400
01:18:13,910 --> 01:18:13,920
me out from god's perspective meaning
 

4401
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:15,110
me out from god's perspective meaning
like become aware

4402
01:18:15,110 --> 01:18:15,120
like become aware
 

4403
01:18:15,120 --> 01:18:17,910
like become aware
of yeah you know yeah so it's kind of

4404
01:18:17,910 --> 01:18:17,920
of yeah you know yeah so it's kind of
 

4405
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:18,870
of yeah you know yeah so it's kind of
interesting so

4406
01:18:18,870 --> 01:18:18,880
interesting so
 

4407
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:21,030
interesting so
to think of the world in this way as

4408
01:18:21,030 --> 01:18:21,040
to think of the world in this way as
 

4409
01:18:21,040 --> 01:18:23,350
to think of the world in this way as
layers and us humans

4410
01:18:23,350 --> 01:18:23,360
layers and us humans
 

4411
01:18:23,360 --> 01:18:25,830
layers and us humans
are able to convert those layers into

4412
01:18:25,830 --> 01:18:25,840
are able to convert those layers into
 

4413
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:27,110
are able to convert those layers into
ideas that they

4414
01:18:27,110 --> 01:18:27,120
ideas that they
 

4415
01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:30,310
ideas that they
you can then like combine right so we're

4416
01:18:30,310 --> 01:18:30,320
you can then like combine right so we're
 

4417
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:31,990
you can then like combine right so we're
doing some kind of conversion

4418
01:18:31,990 --> 01:18:32,000
doing some kind of conversion
 

4419
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,310
doing some kind of conversion
exactly exactly and last time you asked

4420
01:18:34,310 --> 01:18:34,320
exactly exactly and last time you asked
 

4421
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:35,110
exactly exactly and last time you asked
me about

4422
01:18:35,110 --> 01:18:35,120
me about
 

4423
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:36,550
me about
whether we live in a simulation for

4424
01:18:36,550 --> 01:18:36,560
whether we live in a simulation for
 

4425
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:39,750
whether we live in a simulation for
example i mean

4426
01:18:39,750 --> 01:18:39,760
example i mean
 

4427
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:42,390
example i mean
realize that we are living in a

4428
01:18:42,390 --> 01:18:42,400
realize that we are living in a
 

4429
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:43,350
realize that we are living in a
simulation

4430
01:18:43,350 --> 01:18:43,360
simulation
 

4431
01:18:43,360 --> 01:18:45,910
simulation
we are the reality that we're in without

4432
01:18:45,910 --> 01:18:45,920
we are the reality that we're in without
 

4433
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:46,709
we are the reality that we're in without
any sort of

4434
01:18:46,709 --> 01:18:46,719
any sort of
 

4435
01:18:46,719 --> 01:18:49,430
any sort of
person programming this is a simulation

4436
01:18:49,430 --> 01:18:49,440
person programming this is a simulation
 

4437
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:50,390
person programming this is a simulation
like basically

4438
01:18:50,390 --> 01:18:50,400
like basically
 

4439
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:52,790
like basically
what happens inside your skull there's

4440
01:18:52,790 --> 01:18:52,800
what happens inside your skull there's
 

4441
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:55,669
what happens inside your skull there's
this integration of sensory inputs

4442
01:18:55,669 --> 01:18:55,679
this integration of sensory inputs
 

4443
01:18:55,679 --> 01:18:57,590
this integration of sensory inputs
which are translated into perceptory

4444
01:18:57,590 --> 01:18:57,600
which are translated into perceptory
 

4445
01:18:57,600 --> 01:19:00,070
which are translated into perceptory
signals which are then translated into a

4446
01:19:00,070 --> 01:19:00,080
signals which are then translated into a
 

4447
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:01,750
signals which are then translated into a
conceptual model of the world

4448
01:19:01,750 --> 01:19:01,760
conceptual model of the world
 

4449
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:05,830
conceptual model of the world
around you and that exercise

4450
01:19:05,830 --> 01:19:05,840
around you and that exercise
 

4451
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:09,990
around you and that exercise
is happening seamlessly and yet

4452
01:19:09,990 --> 01:19:10,000
is happening seamlessly and yet
 

4453
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:11,189
is happening seamlessly and yet
you know if you if you think about sort

4454
01:19:11,189 --> 01:19:11,199
you know if you if you think about sort
 

4455
01:19:11,199 --> 01:19:13,510
you know if you if you think about sort
of again this whole simulation and neo

4456
01:19:13,510 --> 01:19:13,520
of again this whole simulation and neo
 

4457
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:17,350
of again this whole simulation and neo
um analogy you can think of the reality

4458
01:19:17,350 --> 01:19:17,360
um analogy you can think of the reality
 

4459
01:19:17,360 --> 01:19:18,950
um analogy you can think of the reality
that we live in as a matrix

4460
01:19:18,950 --> 01:19:18,960
that we live in as a matrix
 

4461
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:21,590
that we live in as a matrix
as the matrix but we've actually broken

4462
01:19:21,590 --> 01:19:21,600
as the matrix but we've actually broken
 

4463
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:22,870
as the matrix but we've actually broken
through the matrix

4464
01:19:22,870 --> 01:19:22,880
through the matrix
 

4465
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:24,870
through the matrix
we've actually traversed the layers we

4466
01:19:24,870 --> 01:19:24,880
we've actually traversed the layers we
 

4467
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:26,470
we've actually traversed the layers we
didn't have to take a pill like we

4468
01:19:26,470 --> 01:19:26,480
didn't have to take a pill like we
 

4469
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:27,430
didn't have to take a pill like we
didn't nick

4470
01:19:27,430 --> 01:19:27,440
didn't nick
 

4471
01:19:27,440 --> 01:19:29,990
didn't nick
you know morpheus didn't have to show up

4472
01:19:29,990 --> 01:19:30,000
you know morpheus didn't have to show up
 

4473
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:31,350
you know morpheus didn't have to show up
to basically give us the blue pill or

4474
01:19:31,350 --> 01:19:31,360
to basically give us the blue pill or
 

4475
01:19:31,360 --> 01:19:32,470
to basically give us the blue pill or
the red pill

4476
01:19:32,470 --> 01:19:32,480
the red pill
 

4477
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:35,510
the red pill
we were able to sufficiently evolve

4478
01:19:35,510 --> 01:19:35,520
we were able to sufficiently evolve
 

4479
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:36,470
we were able to sufficiently evolve
cognitively

4480
01:19:36,470 --> 01:19:36,480

breaking through the matrix realizing

4490
01:19:46,310 --> 01:19:46,320
breaking through the matrix realizing
 

4491
01:19:46,320 --> 01:19:47,910
breaking through the matrix realizing
that we live in a matrix

4492
01:19:47,910 --> 01:19:47,920
that we live in a matrix
 

4493
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:50,310
that we live in a matrix
and realizing that we are this thing in

4494
01:19:50,310 --> 01:19:50,320
and realizing that we are this thing in
 

4495
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:51,189
and realizing that we are this thing in
there

4496
01:19:51,189 --> 01:19:51,199
there
 

4497
01:19:51,199 --> 01:19:53,030
there
and yet that thing in there has a

4498
01:19:53,030 --> 01:19:53,040
and yet that thing in there has a
 

4499
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:54,310
and yet that thing in there has a
consciousness that

4500
01:19:54,310 --> 01:19:54,320
consciousness that
 

4501
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:57,270
consciousness that
lives through all these layers and i

4502
01:19:57,270 --> 01:19:57,280
lives through all these layers and i
 

4503
01:19:57,280 --> 01:19:58,709
lives through all these layers and i
think we're the only species we're the

4504
01:19:58,709 --> 01:19:58,719
think we're the only species we're the
 

4505
01:19:58,719 --> 01:20:00,390
think we're the only species we're the
only thing that we even can think of

01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:02,470
only thing that we even can think of
that has actually done that has

that has actually done that has
 

4509
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:08,229
that has actually done that has
sort of permeated space and time

4510
01:20:08,229 --> 01:20:08,239
sort of permeated space and time
 

4511
01:20:08,239 --> 01:20:11,910
sort of permeated space and time
scales and layers of abstraction

4512
01:20:11,910 --> 01:20:11,920
scales and layers of abstraction
 

4513
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:14,709
scales and layers of abstraction
plowing through them and realizing what

4514
01:20:14,709 --> 01:20:14,719
plowing through them and realizing what
 

4515
01:20:14,719 --> 01:20:15,510
plowing through them and realizing what
we're really

4516
01:20:15,510 --> 01:20:15,520
we're really
 

4517
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:17,910
we're really
really made of and the next frontier is

4518
01:20:17,910 --> 01:20:17,920
really made of and the next frontier is
 

4519
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:19,990
really made of and the next frontier is
of course cognition

4520
01:20:19,990 --> 01:20:20,000
of course cognition
 

4521
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,470
of course cognition
so we understand so much of the cosmos

4522
01:20:22,470 --> 01:20:22,480
so we understand so much of the cosmos
 

4523
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:24,149
so we understand so much of the cosmos
so much of the stuff around us

4524
01:20:24,149 --> 01:20:24,159
so much of the stuff around us
 

4525
01:20:24,159 --> 01:20:26,629
so much of the stuff around us
but the stuff inside here finding the

4526
01:20:26,629 --> 01:20:26,639
but the stuff inside here finding the
 

4527
01:20:26,639 --> 01:20:27,990
but the stuff inside here finding the
basis for the soul

4528
01:20:27,990 --> 01:20:28,000
basis for the soul
 

4529
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,470
basis for the soul
finding the basis for the ego for the

4530
01:20:30,470 --> 01:20:30,480
finding the basis for the ego for the
 

4531
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:31,189
finding the basis for the ego for the
self

4532
01:20:31,189 --> 01:20:31,199
self
 

4533
01:20:31,199 --> 01:20:33,830
self
the self-awareness when do when does the

4534
01:20:33,830 --> 01:20:33,840
the self-awareness when do when does the
 

4535
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:35,030
the self-awareness when do when does the
spark happen

4536
01:20:35,030 --> 01:20:35,040
spark happen
 

4537
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:38,709
spark happen
that basically sort of makes you you

4538
01:20:38,709 --> 01:20:38,719
that basically sort of makes you you
 

4539
01:20:38,719 --> 01:20:40,550
that basically sort of makes you you
i mean that's you know really the next

4540
01:20:40,550 --> 01:20:40,560
i mean that's you know really the next
 

4541
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:42,550
i mean that's you know really the next
frontier so so in terms of these

4542
01:20:42,550 --> 01:20:42,560
frontier so so in terms of these
 

4543
01:20:42,560 --> 01:20:44,950
frontier so so in terms of these
peeling off layers of complexity

4544
01:20:44,950 --> 01:20:44,960
peeling off layers of complexity
 

4545
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:47,350
peeling off layers of complexity
somewhere between the cognitive layer

4546
01:20:47,350 --> 01:20:47,360
somewhere between the cognitive layer
 

4547
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:50,790
somewhere between the cognitive layer
and the reasoning layer

4548
01:20:50,790 --> 01:20:50,800
and the reasoning layer
 

4549
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:52,790
and the reasoning layer
or the computational layer there's still

4550
01:20:52,790 --> 01:20:52,800
or the computational layer there's still
 

4551
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:54,310
or the computational layer there's still
some stuff to be figured out there

4552
01:20:54,310 --> 01:20:54,320
some stuff to be figured out there
 

4553
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:55,990
some stuff to be figured out there
and i think that's the final frontier of

4554
01:20:55,990 --> 01:20:56,000
and i think that's the final frontier of
 

4555
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:57,990
and i think that's the final frontier of
sort of completing our journey through

4556
01:20:57,990 --> 01:20:58,000
sort of completing our journey through
 

4557
01:20:58,000 --> 01:20:58,950
sort of completing our journey through
that matrix

4558
01:20:58,950 --> 01:20:58,960
that matrix
 

4559
01:20:58,960 --> 01:21:01,990
that matrix
and maybe duplicating it in the

4560
01:21:01,990 --> 01:21:02,000
and maybe duplicating it in the
 

4561
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,149
and maybe duplicating it in the
in other versions of ourselves through

4562
01:21:04,149 --> 01:21:04,159
in other versions of ourselves through
 

4563
01:21:04,159 --> 01:21:05,430
in other versions of ourselves through
ai

4564
01:21:05,430 --> 01:21:05,440
ai
 

4565
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:07,990
ai
which is another very exciting uh

4566
01:21:07,990 --> 01:21:08,000
which is another very exciting uh
 

4567
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:08,629
which is another very exciting uh
possibility

4568
01:21:08,629 --> 01:21:08,639
possibility
 

4569
01:21:08,639 --> 01:21:11,270
possibility
what i love about ai and the way that it

4570
01:21:11,270 --> 01:21:11,280
what i love about ai and the way that it
 

4571
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:12,629
what i love about ai and the way that it
operates right now

4572
01:21:12,629 --> 01:21:12,639
operates right now
 

4573
01:21:12,639 --> 01:21:16,070
operates right now
is the fact that it is unpredictable

4574
01:21:16,070 --> 01:21:16,080
is the fact that it is unpredictable
 

4575
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:18,870
is the fact that it is unpredictable
there's emergent behavior in our

01:21:18,870 --> 01:21:18,880
there's emergent behavior in our

that we can certainly model but we don't

4582

that we can certainly model but we don't
 

4583
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:31,430
that we can certainly model but we don't
encode directly and that's a key

4584
01:21:31,430 --> 01:21:31,440
encode directly and that's a key
 

4585
01:21:31,440 --> 01:21:34,870
encode directly and that's a key
difference so we like to say oh

4586
01:21:34,870 --> 01:21:34,880
difference so we like to say oh
 

4587
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:36,629
difference so we like to say oh
of course this is not really intelligent

4588

of course this is not really intelligent
 

4589
01:21:36,639 --> 01:21:38,790
of course this is not really intelligent
because we coded it up

4590
01:21:38,790 --> 01:21:38,800
because we coded it up
 

4591
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:40,629
because we coded it up
and we just put in these little

4592
01:21:40,629 --> 01:21:40,639
and we just put in these little
 

4593
01:21:40,639 --> 01:21:41,990
and we just put in these little
parameters there and there's like you

4594
01:21:41,990 --> 01:21:42,000
parameters there and there's like you
 

4595
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:42,629
parameters there and there's like you
know

4596
01:21:42,629 --> 01:21:42,639
know
 

4597
01:21:42,639 --> 01:21:44,070
know
six billion parameters and once you've

4598
01:21:44,070 --> 01:21:44,080
six billion parameters and once you've
 

4599
01:21:44,080 --> 01:21:45,910
six billion parameters and once you've
learned them you know we kind of

4600
01:21:45,910 --> 01:21:45,920
learned them you know we kind of
 

4601
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:47,990
learned them you know we kind of
understand the layers

4602

understand the layers
 

4603
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:51,189
understand the layers
but that's an oversimplification it's

what to do no no
 

4673
01:22:55,199 --> 01:22:56,790
what to do no no
you basically now just program the

4674
01:22:56,790 --> 01:22:56,800
you basically now just program the
 

4675
01:22:56,800 --> 01:22:59,270
you basically now just program the
primitives and then he learns from that

4676
01:22:59,270 --> 01:22:59,280
primitives and then he learns from that
 

4677
01:22:59,280 --> 01:23:01,110
primitives and then he learns from that
so even though the origins are humble

4678
01:23:01,110 --> 01:23:01,120
so even though the origins are humble
 

4679
01:23:01,120 --> 01:23:03,270
so even though the origins are humble
just like it is for our genetic code

4680
01:23:03,270 --> 01:23:03,280
just like it is for our genetic code
 

4681
01:23:03,280 --> 01:23:05,030
just like it is for our genetic code

cognizant of all the other layers in uh
 

4695
01:23:24,480 --> 01:23:27,669
cognizant of all the other layers in uh
of its you know it's not

4696
01:23:27,669 --> 01:23:27,679
of its you know it's not
 

4697
01:23:27,679 --> 01:23:31,189
of its you know it's not
it's not able to think about

01:23:31,189 --> 01:23:31,199
it's not able to think about
 

4699
01:23:31,199 --> 01:23:34,070
it's not able to think about
space and time it's not able to think

yet so so if you look at humans

4706
01:23:40,950 --> 01:23:40,960
yet so so if you look at humans
 

4707
01:23:40,960 --> 01:23:42,709
yet so so if you look at humans
we basically have the same cognitive

4708
01:23:42,709 --> 01:23:42,719
we basically have the same cognitive
 

4709
01:23:42,719 --> 01:23:44,149
we basically have the same cognitive
architecture as monkeys

4710
01:23:44,149 --> 01:23:44,159
architecture as monkeys
 

4711
01:23:44,159 --> 01:23:47,669
architecture as monkeys
as the great apes it's just a ton more

4712
01:23:47,669 --> 01:23:47,679
as the great apes it's just a ton more
 

4713
01:23:47,679 --> 01:23:49,030
as the great apes it's just a ton more
of it

4714
01:23:49,030 --> 01:23:49,040
of it
 

4715
01:23:49,040 --> 01:23:53,030
of it
if you look at um gpt3 versus gpd2

4716
01:23:53,030 --> 01:23:53,040
if you look at um gpt3 versus gpd2
 

4717
01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:55,030
if you look at um gpt3 versus gpd2
again it's the same architecture just

4718
01:23:55,030 --> 01:23:55,040
again it's the same architecture just
 

4719
01:23:55,040 --> 01:23:56,310
again it's the same architecture just
more of it

4720
01:23:56,310 --> 01:23:56,320
more of it
 

4721
01:23:56,320 --> 01:23:58,629
more of it
and yet it's able to do so much more

4722
01:23:58,629 --> 01:23:58,639
and yet it's able to do so much more
 

4723
01:23:58,639 --> 01:24:00,550
and yet it's able to do so much more
yeah so if you start thinking about sort

4724
01:24:00,550 --> 01:24:00,560
yeah so if you start thinking about sort
 

4725
01:24:00,560 --> 01:24:02,310
yeah so if you start thinking about sort
of what's the future of that

4726
01:24:02,310 --> 01:24:02,320
of what's the future of that
 

4727
01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:05,189
of what's the future of that
gpt 455 do you really need fundamentally

4728
01:24:05,189 --> 01:24:05,199
gpt 455 do you really need fundamentally
 

4729
01:24:05,199 --> 01:24:06,709
gpt 455 do you really need fundamentally
different architectures or do you just

4730
01:24:06,709 --> 01:24:06,719
different architectures or do you just
 

4731
01:24:06,719 --> 01:24:08,629
different architectures or do you just
need a ton more hardware

4732
01:24:08,629 --> 01:24:08,639
need a ton more hardware
 

4733
01:24:08,639 --> 01:24:11,350
need a ton more hardware
and we do have a ton more hardware like

4734
01:24:11,350 --> 01:24:11,360
and we do have a ton more hardware like
 

4735
01:24:11,360 --> 01:24:13,430
and we do have a ton more hardware like
these systems are nowhere near

4736
01:24:13,430 --> 01:24:13,440
these systems are nowhere near
 

4737
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:16,470
these systems are nowhere near
what humans have between our ears

4738
01:24:16,470 --> 01:24:16,480
what humans have between our ears
 

4739
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:19,910
what humans have between our ears
so you know there's something to be said

4740
01:24:19,910 --> 01:24:19,920
so you know there's something to be said
 

4741
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:20,550
so you know there's something to be said
about

4742
01:24:20,550 --> 01:24:20,560
about
 

4743
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:23,590
about
stay tuned for emergent behavior

4744
01:24:23,590 --> 01:24:23,600
stay tuned for emergent behavior
 

4745
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:24,870
stay tuned for emergent behavior
we keep thinking that general

4746
01:24:24,870 --> 01:24:24,880
we keep thinking that general
 

4747
01:24:24,880 --> 01:24:28,390
we keep thinking that general
intelligence might just be forever away

4748
01:24:28,390 --> 01:24:28,400
intelligence might just be forever away
 

4749
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:30,790
intelligence might just be forever away
but it could just simply be that we just

4750
01:24:30,790 --> 01:24:30,800
but it could just simply be that we just
 

4751
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:32,550
but it could just simply be that we just
need a ton more hardware

4752
01:24:32,550 --> 01:24:32,560
need a ton more hardware
 

4753
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:33,990
need a ton more hardware
and that humans are just not that

4754
01:24:33,990 --> 01:24:34,000
and that humans are just not that
 

4755
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:35,830
and that humans are just not that
different from the great apes

4756
01:24:35,830 --> 01:24:35,840
different from the great apes
 

4757
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:38,229
different from the great apes
except for just a ton more of it yeah

4758
01:24:38,229 --> 01:24:38,239
except for just a ton more of it yeah
 

4759
01:24:38,239 --> 01:24:39,990
except for just a ton more of it yeah
it's interesting that in the

4760
01:24:39,990 --> 01:24:40,000
it's interesting that in the
 

4761
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:43,350
it's interesting that in the
ai community maybe it is a human-centric

4762
01:24:43,350 --> 01:24:43,360
ai community maybe it is a human-centric
 

4763
01:24:43,360 --> 01:24:44,229

01:24:48,550 --> 01:24:48,560
but the notion that gpt 10 will be
 

4767
01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:50,070
but the notion that gpt 10 will be
will achieve general intelligence is

4768
01:24:50,070 --> 01:24:50,080
will achieve general intelligence is
 

4769
01:24:50,080 --> 01:24:51,830
will achieve general intelligence is
something that people shy away from

4770
01:24:51,830 --> 01:24:51,840
something that people shy away from
 

4771
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:53,750
something that people shy away from
that there has to be something totally

4772
01:24:53,750 --> 01:24:53,760
that there has to be something totally
 

4773
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:56,070
that there has to be something totally

4775
01:24:56,080 --> 01:24:58,790

and yet it's not seriously considered

4776
01:24:58,790 --> 01:24:58,800
and yet it's not seriously considered

01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:21,669
some non-physical thing and it's like
or it could just be a lot more of the

01:25:21,669 --> 01:25:21,679
or it could just be a lot more of the
 

4801
01:25:21,679 --> 01:25:22,870
or it could just be a lot more of the

01:26:40,390 --> 01:26:40,400
egyptian be born and then ship them over
 

4883
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:42,870
egyptian be born and then ship them over
it's like no that egyptian would be

4884
01:26:42,870 --> 01:26:42,880
it's like no that egyptian would be
 

4885
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:43,430
it's like no that egyptian would be
listening

4886
01:26:43,430 --> 01:26:43,440
listening
 

4887
01:26:43,440 --> 01:26:45,510
listening
in to the complex of the world and then

4888
01:26:45,510 --> 01:26:45,520
in to the complex of the world and then
 

4889
01:26:45,520 --> 01:26:47,750
in to the complex of the world and then
getting born and sort of seeing

4890
01:26:47,750 --> 01:26:47,760
getting born and sort of seeing
 

4891
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:49,510
getting born and sort of seeing
just how much more complex the world is

4892
01:26:49,510 --> 01:26:49,520
just how much more complex the world is
 

4893
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:51,270
just how much more complex the world is
so it's a combination

4894
01:26:51,270 --> 01:26:51,280
so it's a combination
 

4895
01:26:51,280 --> 01:26:54,709
so it's a combination
of the underlying hardware which

4896
01:26:54,709 --> 01:26:54,719
of the underlying hardware which
 

4897
01:26:54,719 --> 01:26:57,750
of the underlying hardware which
if you think about as a geneticist in my

4898
01:26:57,750 --> 01:26:57,760
if you think about as a geneticist in my
 

4899
01:26:57,760 --> 01:26:58,790
if you think about as a geneticist in my
view the hardware

4900
01:26:58,790 --> 01:26:58,800
view the hardware
 

4901
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:00,629
view the hardware
gives you an upper bound of cognitive

4902
01:27:00,629 --> 01:27:00,639
gives you an upper bound of cognitive
 

4903
01:27:00,639 --> 01:27:02,070
gives you an upper bound of cognitive
capabilities

4904
01:27:02,070 --> 01:27:02,080
capabilities
 

4905
01:27:02,080 --> 01:27:03,510
capabilities
but it's the environment that makes

4906
01:27:03,510 --> 01:27:03,520
but it's the environment that makes
 

4907
01:27:03,520 --> 01:27:05,910
but it's the environment that makes
those capabilities shine and reach their

4908
01:27:05,910 --> 01:27:05,920
those capabilities shine and reach their
 

4909
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:09,270
those capabilities shine and reach their
maxima so we're a combination of

4910
01:27:09,270 --> 01:27:09,280
maxima so we're a combination of
 

4911
01:27:09,280 --> 01:27:11,990
maxima so we're a combination of
nature and nurture the nature is our

4912
01:27:11,990 --> 01:27:12,000
nature and nurture the nature is our
 

4913
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:12,709
nature and nurture the nature is our
genes

4914
01:27:12,709 --> 01:27:12,719
genes
 

4915
01:27:12,719 --> 01:27:15,590
genes
and our cognitive apparatus and the

4919
01:27:16,639 --> 01:27:18,709
nurture
is the richness of the environment that

4920
01:27:18,709 --> 01:27:18,719
is the richness of the environment that
 

4921
01:27:18,719 --> 01:27:20,709
is the richness of the environment that
makes that cognitive apparatus reach

4922
01:27:20,709 --> 01:27:20,719
makes that cognitive apparatus reach
 

4923
01:27:20,719 --> 01:27:24,070
makes that cognitive apparatus reach
its potential and we are so far

4924
01:27:24,070 --> 01:27:24,080
its potential and we are so far
 

4925
01:27:24,080 --> 01:27:27,270
its potential and we are so far
from reaching our full potential so far

4926

from reaching our full potential so far
i think that kids being born 100 years

4928
01:27:29,990 --> 01:27:30,000
i think that kids being born 100 years
 

4929
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:30,870
i think that kids being born 100 years
from now

from now
 

4931
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:33,350
from now
they'll be looking at us now and saying

they'll be looking at us now and saying
 

4933
01:27:33,360 --> 01:27:34,310
they'll be looking at us now and saying
what primitive

4934

01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:43,189
you know virtual reality from birth as
we are now because like

01:27:43,189 --> 01:27:43,199
we are now because like

01:27:43,199 --> 01:27:46,070
we are now because like
they're clearly inferior and so forth so

they're clearly inferior and so forth so
 

4945
01:27:46,080 --> 01:27:47,270
they're clearly inferior and so forth so
i basically think that

4946
01:27:47,270 --> 01:27:47,280
i basically think that
 

4947
01:27:47,280 --> 01:27:50,870
i basically think that
our environment will continue exploding

4948
01:27:50,870 --> 01:27:50,880
our environment will continue exploding
 

4949
01:27:50,880 --> 01:27:53,350
our environment will continue exploding
and our cognitive capabilities it's not

4950
01:27:53,350 --> 01:27:53,360
and our cognitive capabilities it's not
 

4951
01:27:53,360 --> 01:27:54,790
and our cognitive capabilities it's not
like oh we're only using two percent of

like oh we're only using two percent of
 

4953
01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:55,830
like oh we're only using two percent of
our brain that's ridiculous of course

01:27:55,830 --> 01:27:55,840
our brain that's ridiculous of course

we're using 100 of our brain
 

4957
01:27:57,600 --> 01:28:00,149
we're using 100 of our brain
but it's still constrained by how

4958
01:28:00,149 --> 01:28:00,159
but it's still constrained by how
 

4959
01:28:00,159 --> 01:28:01,990
but it's still constrained by how
complex our environment is

4960
01:28:01,990 --> 01:28:02,000
complex our environment is
 

4961
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:03,910
complex our environment is
so the hardware will remain the same but

4962
01:28:03,910 --> 01:28:03,920
so the hardware will remain the same but
 

4963
01:28:03,920 --> 01:28:06,229
so the hardware will remain the same but
the software

4964
01:28:06,229 --> 01:28:06,239
the software
 

4965
01:28:06,239 --> 01:28:08,870
the software
in a quickly advancing environment the

4966
01:28:08,870 --> 01:28:08,880
in a quickly advancing environment the
 

4967
01:28:08,880 --> 01:28:11,430
in a quickly advancing environment the
software will make a huge difference in

4968
01:28:11,430 --> 01:28:11,440
software will make a huge difference in
 

4969
01:28:11,440 --> 01:28:14,149

it's fascinating to think that humans

4974
01:28:17,030 --> 01:28:17,040
it's fascinating to think that humans
 

4975
01:28:17,040 --> 01:28:18,870
it's fascinating to think that humans
will look very different 100 years from

now
 

4979
01:28:19,360 --> 01:28:20,629

01:28:20,629 --> 01:28:20,639
just because the environment changed

01:28:20,639 --> 01:28:22,310
just because the environment changed
even though we're still the same great

so but i want to take that concept just

5046
01:29:36,629 --> 01:29:36,639
so but i want to take that concept just
 

5047
01:29:36,639 --> 01:29:40,229
so but i want to take that concept just
you know into another twist which is

5048
01:29:40,229 --> 01:29:40,239
you know into another twist which is
 

5049
01:29:40,239 --> 01:29:43,750
you know into another twist which is
the horizontal transfer of

5050
01:29:43,750 --> 01:29:43,760
the horizontal transfer of
 

5051
01:29:43,760 --> 01:29:47,110
the horizontal transfer of
humans with fellowships

5052
01:29:47,110 --> 01:29:47,120
humans with fellowships
 

5053
01:29:47,120 --> 01:29:51,030
humans with fellowships
and the fact that as people apply to mit

5054
01:29:51,030 --> 01:29:51,040
and the fact that as people apply to mit
 

5055
01:29:51,040 --> 01:29:53,030
and the fact that as people apply to mit
from around the world

5056
01:29:53,030 --> 01:29:53,040
from around the world
 

5057
01:29:53,040 --> 01:29:55,830
from around the world
there's a selection that happens not

5058
01:29:55,830 --> 01:29:55,840
there's a selection that happens not
 

5059
01:29:55,840 --> 01:29:56,709
there's a selection that happens not
just for

5060
01:29:56,709 --> 01:29:56,719
just for
 

5061
01:29:56,719 --> 01:29:59,510
just for
their ideas but also for the cognitive

5062
01:29:59,510 --> 01:29:59,520
their ideas but also for the cognitive
 

5063
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:00,629
their ideas but also for the cognitive
hardware

5064
01:30:00,629 --> 01:30:00,639
hardware
 

5065
01:30:00,639 --> 01:30:03,189
hardware
that came up with those ideas so we

5066
01:30:03,189 --> 01:30:03,199
that came up with those ideas so we
 

5067
01:30:03,199 --> 01:30:05,110
that came up with those ideas so we
don't just ship ideas around anymore

5068
01:30:05,110 --> 01:30:05,120
don't just ship ideas around anymore
 

5069
01:30:05,120 --> 01:30:07,189
don't just ship ideas around anymore
they don't evolve in a vacuum

5070
01:30:07,189 --> 01:30:07,199
they don't evolve in a vacuum
 

5071
01:30:07,199 --> 01:30:10,149
they don't evolve in a vacuum
the ideas themselves influence the

5072
01:30:10,149 --> 01:30:10,159
the ideas themselves influence the
 

5073
01:30:10,159 --> 01:30:12,390
the ideas themselves influence the
distribution of cognitive systems

5074
01:30:12,390 --> 01:30:12,400
distribution of cognitive systems
 

5075
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:15,350
distribution of cognitive systems
i.e humans and brains around the planet

5076
01:30:15,350 --> 01:30:15,360
i.e humans and brains around the planet
 

5077
01:30:15,360 --> 01:30:17,110
i.e humans and brains around the planet
yeah we ship them to different locations

5078
01:30:17,110 --> 01:30:17,120
yeah we ship them to different locations
 

5079
01:30:17,120 --> 01:30:18,790
yeah we ship them to different locations
based on their properties that's exactly

5080
01:30:18,790 --> 01:30:18,800
based on their properties that's exactly
 

5081
01:30:18,800 --> 01:30:19,590
based on their properties that's exactly
right

5082
01:30:19,590 --> 01:30:19,600
right
 

5083
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:22,470
right
so so those cognitive systems that think

5084
01:30:22,470 --> 01:30:22,480
so so those cognitive systems that think
 

5085
01:30:22,480 --> 01:30:23,030
so so those cognitive systems that think
of

5086
01:30:23,030 --> 01:30:23,040
of
 

5087
01:30:23,040 --> 01:30:25,110
of
you know physics for example might go to

5088
01:30:25,110 --> 01:30:25,120
you know physics for example might go to
 

5089
01:30:25,120 --> 01:30:27,510
you know physics for example might go to
cern and those that think of

5090
01:30:27,510 --> 01:30:27,520
cern and those that think of
 

5091
01:30:27,520 --> 01:30:30,310
cern and those that think of
genomics might go to the broad institute

5092
01:30:30,310 --> 01:30:30,320
genomics might go to the broad institute
 

5093
01:30:30,320 --> 01:30:31,990
genomics might go to the broad institute
and those that think of computer science

5094
01:30:31,990 --> 01:30:32,000
and those that think of computer science
 

5095
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:33,990
and those that think of computer science
might go to i don't know stanford or cmu

5096
01:30:33,990 --> 01:30:34,000
might go to i don't know stanford or cmu
 

5097
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:35,750
might go to i don't know stanford or cmu
or mit

5098
01:30:35,750 --> 01:30:35,760
or mit
 

5099
01:30:35,760 --> 01:30:37,910
or mit
and you basically have this co-evolution

5100
01:30:37,910 --> 01:30:37,920
and you basically have this co-evolution
 

5101
01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:39,110
and you basically have this co-evolution
now of

5102
01:30:39,110 --> 01:30:39,120
now of
 

5103
01:30:39,120 --> 01:30:42,870
now of
memes and ideas and the cognitive

5104
01:30:42,870 --> 01:30:42,880
memes and ideas and the cognitive
 

5105
01:30:42,880 --> 01:30:45,990
memes and ideas and the cognitive
conversational systems that love these

5106
01:30:45,990 --> 01:30:46,000
conversational systems that love these
 

5107
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:47,270
conversational systems that love these
ideas and feed on these ideas and

5108
01:30:47,270 --> 01:30:47,280
ideas and feed on these ideas and
 

5109
01:30:47,280 --> 01:30:48,390
ideas and feed on these ideas and
understand these ideas and appreciate

5110
01:30:48,390 --> 01:30:48,400
understand these ideas and appreciate
 

5111
01:30:48,400 --> 01:30:50,149
understand these ideas and appreciate
these ideas

5112
01:30:50,149 --> 01:30:50,159
these ideas
 

5113
01:30:50,159 --> 01:30:52,790
these ideas
now coming together so you basically

5114
01:30:52,790 --> 01:30:52,800
now coming together so you basically
 

5115
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:54,070
now coming together so you basically
have

5116
01:30:54,070 --> 01:30:54,080
have
 

5117
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:55,910
have
students coming to boston to study

5118
01:30:55,910 --> 01:30:55,920
students coming to boston to study
 

5119
01:30:55,920 --> 01:30:57,270
students coming to boston to study
because that's the place where

5120
01:30:57,270 --> 01:30:57,280
because that's the place where
 

5121
01:30:57,280 --> 01:31:00,950
because that's the place where
these type of cognitive systems thrive

5122
01:31:00,950 --> 01:31:00,960
these type of cognitive systems thrive
 

5123
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:04,470
these type of cognitive systems thrive
and they're selected based on their

5124
01:31:04,470 --> 01:31:04,480
and they're selected based on their
 

5125
01:31:04,480 --> 01:31:07,910
and they're selected based on their
cognitive output and their idea output

5126
01:31:07,910 --> 01:31:07,920
cognitive output and their idea output
 

5127
01:31:07,920 --> 01:31:11,750
cognitive output and their idea output
but once they get into that place the

5128
01:31:11,750 --> 01:31:11,760
but once they get into that place the
 

5129
01:31:11,760 --> 01:31:14,950
but once they get into that place the
boiling and interbreeding of these memes

5130
01:31:14,950 --> 01:31:14,960
boiling and interbreeding of these memes
 

5131
01:31:14,960 --> 01:31:18,070
boiling and interbreeding of these memes
becomes so much more frequent that what

5132
01:31:18,070 --> 01:31:18,080
becomes so much more frequent that what
 

5133
01:31:18,080 --> 01:31:19,510
becomes so much more frequent that what
comes out of it

5134
01:31:19,510 --> 01:31:19,520
comes out of it
 

5135
01:31:19,520 --> 01:31:22,790
comes out of it
is so far beyond if ideas were evolving

5136
01:31:22,790 --> 01:31:22,800
is so far beyond if ideas were evolving
 

5137
01:31:22,800 --> 01:31:23,910
is so far beyond if ideas were evolving

01:32:46,149 --> 01:32:46,159
certain building too so like within that
 

5211
01:32:46,159 --> 01:32:46,790
certain building too so like within that
there's

5212
01:32:46,790 --> 01:32:46,800
there's
 

5213
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:49,030
there's
there's uh there's clusters on top of

5214
01:32:49,030 --> 01:32:49,040
there's uh there's clusters on top of
 

5215
01:32:49,040 --> 01:32:50,870
there's uh there's clusters on top of
clusters type of clusters what about

5216
01:32:50,870 --> 01:32:50,880
clusters type of clusters what about
 

5217
01:32:50,880 --> 01:32:54,310
clusters type of clusters what about
in the online world is that do you also

5218
01:32:54,310 --> 01:32:54,320
in the online world is that do you also
 

5219
01:32:54,320 --> 01:32:57,030
in the online world is that do you also
see that kind of because people now

5220
01:32:57,030 --> 01:32:57,040
see that kind of because people now
 

5221
01:32:57,040 --> 01:32:59,350
see that kind of because people now
form groups on the internet that they

5222
01:32:59,350 --> 01:32:59,360
form groups on the internet that they
 

5223
01:32:59,360 --> 01:33:01,990
form groups on the internet that they
stick together so they

5224
01:33:01,990 --> 01:33:02,000
stick together so they
 

5225
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,790
stick together so they
they can sort of uh these cognitive

5226
01:33:04,790 --> 01:33:04,800
they can sort of uh these cognitive
 

5227
01:33:04,800 --> 01:33:07,270
they can sort of uh these cognitive
systems can

5228
01:33:07,270 --> 01:33:07,280
systems can
 

5229
01:33:07,280 --> 01:33:11,030
systems can
collect themselves and uh breed together

5230
01:33:11,030 --> 01:33:11,040
collect themselves and uh breed together
 

5231
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:14,229
collect themselves and uh breed together
uh on in in different layers of spaces

5232
01:33:14,229 --> 01:33:14,239
uh on in in different layers of spaces
 

5233
01:33:14,239 --> 01:33:15,510
uh on in in different layers of spaces
it doesn't just have to be physical

5234
01:33:15,510 --> 01:33:15,520
it doesn't just have to be physical
 

5235
01:33:15,520 --> 01:33:15,910
it doesn't just have to be physical
space

5236
01:33:15,910 --> 01:33:15,920
space
 

5237
01:33:15,920 --> 01:33:17,430
space
absolutely absolutely so basically

5238
01:33:17,430 --> 01:33:17,440
absolutely absolutely so basically
 

5239
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:19,510
absolutely absolutely so basically
there's the physical rearrangement

5240
01:33:19,510 --> 01:33:19,520
there's the physical rearrangement
 

5241
01:33:19,520 --> 01:33:22,390
there's the physical rearrangement
but there's also the conglomeration of

5242
01:33:22,390 --> 01:33:22,400
but there's also the conglomeration of
 

5243
01:33:22,400 --> 01:33:24,229
but there's also the conglomeration of
the same cognitive system

5244
01:33:24,229 --> 01:33:24,239
the same cognitive system
 

5245
01:33:24,239 --> 01:33:26,950
the same cognitive system
doesn't need to be a human it doesn't

5246
01:33:26,950 --> 01:33:26,960
doesn't need to be a human it doesn't
 

5247
01:33:26,960 --> 01:33:28,629
doesn't need to be a human it doesn't
need to belong to only one community

5248
01:33:28,629 --> 01:33:28,639
need to belong to only one community
 

5249
01:33:28,639 --> 01:33:30,390
need to belong to only one community
yeah so yes you might be a member of the

5250
01:33:30,390 --> 01:33:30,400
yeah so yes you might be a member of the
 

5251
01:33:30,400 --> 01:33:31,830
yeah so yes you might be a member of the
computer science department but you can

5252
01:33:31,830 --> 01:33:31,840
computer science department but you can
 

5253
01:33:31,840 --> 01:33:33,590
computer science department but you can
also hang out in the biology department

5254
01:33:33,590 --> 01:33:33,600
also hang out in the biology department
 

5255
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:35,669
also hang out in the biology department
but you might also go online online into

5256
01:33:35,669 --> 01:33:35,679
but you might also go online online into
 

5257
01:33:35,679 --> 01:33:37,350
but you might also go online online into
i don't know poetry department uh

5258
01:33:37,350 --> 01:33:37,360
i don't know poetry department uh
 

5259
01:33:37,360 --> 01:33:39,750
i don't know poetry department uh
readings and so forth or you might be

5260
01:33:39,750 --> 01:33:39,760
readings and so forth or you might be
 

5261
01:33:39,760 --> 01:33:41,590
readings and so forth or you might be
part of a group that only has 12 people

5262
01:33:41,590 --> 01:33:41,600
part of a group that only has 12 people
 

5263
01:33:41,600 --> 01:33:43,830
part of a group that only has 12 people
in the world but that are connected

5264
01:33:43,830 --> 01:33:43,840
in the world but that are connected
 

5265
01:33:43,840 --> 01:33:45,189
in the world but that are connected
through their ideas

5266
01:33:45,189 --> 01:33:45,199
through their ideas
 

5267
01:33:45,199 --> 01:33:47,910
through their ideas
and are now interbreeding these ideas in

5268
01:33:47,910 --> 01:33:47,920
and are now interbreeding these ideas in
 

5269
01:33:47,920 --> 01:33:49,270
and are now interbreeding these ideas in
a whole other way

5270
01:33:49,270 --> 01:33:49,280
a whole other way
 

5271
01:33:49,280 --> 01:33:52,470
a whole other way
so this um this coevolution of genes and

5272
01:33:52,470 --> 01:33:52,480
so this um this coevolution of genes and
 

5273
01:33:52,480 --> 01:33:53,110
so this um this coevolution of genes and
memes

5274
01:33:53,110 --> 01:33:53,120
memes
 

5275
01:33:53,120 --> 01:33:55,350
memes
is not just physically instantiated it's

5276
01:33:55,350 --> 01:33:55,360
is not just physically instantiated it's
 

5277
01:33:55,360 --> 01:33:57,669
is not just physically instantiated it's
also sort of rearranged

5278
01:33:57,669 --> 01:33:57,679
also sort of rearranged
 

5279
01:33:57,679 --> 01:34:00,629
also sort of rearranged
you know in this cognitive uh space as

5280
01:34:00,629 --> 01:34:00,639
you know in this cognitive uh space as
 

5281
01:34:00,639 --> 01:34:01,669
you know in this cognitive uh space as
well

5282
01:34:01,669 --> 01:34:01,679
well
 

5283
01:34:01,679 --> 01:34:03,750
well
and uh and sometimes these cognitive

5284
01:34:03,750 --> 01:34:03,760
and uh and sometimes these cognitive
 

5285
01:34:03,760 --> 01:34:05,830
and uh and sometimes these cognitive
systems hold conferences and they all

5286
01:34:05,830 --> 01:34:05,840
systems hold conferences and they all
 

5287
01:34:05,840 --> 01:34:07,669
systems hold conferences and they all
get gather around and there's like one

5288
01:34:07,669 --> 01:34:07,679
get gather around and there's like one
 

5289
01:34:07,679 --> 01:34:09,350
get gather around and there's like one
of them is like talking and they're all

5290
01:34:09,350 --> 01:34:09,360
of them is like talking and they're all
 

5291
01:34:09,360 --> 01:34:10,390
of them is like talking and they're all
like listening and then

5292
01:34:10,390 --> 01:34:10,400
like listening and then
 

5293
01:34:10,400 --> 01:34:12,070
like listening and then
you discuss and then they have free

5294
01:34:12,070 --> 01:34:12,080
you discuss and then they have free
 

5295
01:34:12,080 --> 01:34:13,510
you discuss and then they have free
lunch and so on no but

5296
01:34:13,510 --> 01:34:13,520
lunch and so on no but
 

5297
01:34:13,520 --> 01:34:15,990
lunch and so on no but
but then that's where you find students

5298
01:34:15,990 --> 01:34:16,000
but then that's where you find students
 

5299
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:16,709
but then that's where you find students
where you know

5300
01:34:16,709 --> 01:34:16,719
where you know
 

5301
01:34:16,719 --> 01:34:18,310
where you know
when when i go to a conference i go

5302
01:34:18,310 --> 01:34:18,320
when when i go to a conference i go
 

5303
01:34:18,320 --> 01:34:20,070
when when i go to a conference i go
through the posters where i'm on a

5304
01:34:20,070 --> 01:34:20,080
through the posters where i'm on a
 

5305
01:34:20,080 --> 01:34:20,870
through the posters where i'm on a
mission

5306
01:34:20,870 --> 01:34:20,880
mission
 

5307
01:34:20,880 --> 01:34:22,950
mission
basically my mission is to read and

5308
01:34:22,950 --> 01:34:22,960
basically my mission is to read and
 

5309
01:34:22,960 --> 01:34:24,950
basically my mission is to read and
understand what every poster is about

5310
01:34:24,950 --> 01:34:24,960
understand what every poster is about
 

5311
01:34:24,960 --> 01:34:26,390
understand what every poster is about
and for a few of them i'll dive deeply

5312
01:34:26,390 --> 01:34:26,400
and for a few of them i'll dive deeply
 

5313
01:34:26,400 --> 01:34:28,310
and for a few of them i'll dive deeply
and understand everything but i make it

5314
01:34:28,310 --> 01:34:28,320
and understand everything but i make it
 

5315
01:34:28,320 --> 01:34:30,070
and understand everything but i make it
a point to just go post after posting in

5316
01:34:30,070 --> 01:34:30,080
a point to just go post after posting in
 

5317
01:34:30,080 --> 01:34:30,470
a point to just go post after posting in
order

5318
01:34:30,470 --> 01:34:30,480
order
 

5319
01:34:30,480 --> 01:34:33,590
order
to read all of them and i find some gems

5320
01:34:33,590 --> 01:34:33,600
to read all of them and i find some gems
 

5321
01:34:33,600 --> 01:34:35,510
to read all of them and i find some gems
and students that i speak to that

5322
01:34:35,510 --> 01:34:35,520
and students that i speak to that
 

5323
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:37,750
and students that i speak to that
sometimes eventually join my lab

5324
01:34:37,750 --> 01:34:37,760
sometimes eventually join my lab
 

5325
01:34:37,760 --> 01:34:39,669
sometimes eventually join my lab
and then sort of you're you're sort of

5326
01:34:39,669 --> 01:34:39,679
and then sort of you're you're sort of
 

5327
01:34:39,679 --> 01:34:41,750
and then sort of you're you're sort of
creating this permeation

5328
01:34:41,750 --> 01:34:41,760
creating this permeation
 

5329
01:34:41,760 --> 01:34:45,189
creating this permeation
of you know the transfer

5330
01:34:45,189 --> 01:34:45,199
of you know the transfer
 

5331
01:34:45,199 --> 01:34:48,229
of you know the transfer
of ideas of ways of thinking

5332
01:34:48,229 --> 01:34:48,239
of ideas of ways of thinking
 

5333
01:34:48,239 --> 01:34:51,270
of ideas of ways of thinking
and very often of moral values of

5334
01:34:51,270 --> 01:34:51,280
and very often of moral values of
 

5335
01:34:51,280 --> 01:34:57,030
and very often of moral values of
social structures of you know just more

5336
01:34:57,030 --> 01:34:57,040
social structures of you know just more
 

5337
01:34:57,040 --> 01:34:59,990
social structures of you know just more
imperceptible properties of these

5338
01:34:59,990 --> 01:35:00,000
imperceptible properties of these
 

5339
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:01,669
imperceptible properties of these
cognitive systems that simply just cling

5340
01:35:01,669 --> 01:35:01,679
cognitive systems that simply just cling
 

5341
01:35:01,679 --> 01:35:02,790
cognitive systems that simply just cling
together

5342
01:35:02,790 --> 01:35:02,800
together
 

5343
01:35:02,800 --> 01:35:05,350
together
basically you know there's i have the

5344
01:35:05,350 --> 01:35:05,360
basically you know there's i have the
 

5345
01:35:05,360 --> 01:35:06,070
basically you know there's i have the
luxury

5346
01:35:06,070 --> 01:35:06,080
luxury
 

5347
01:35:06,080 --> 01:35:08,950
luxury
at mit of not just choosing smart people

5348
01:35:08,950 --> 01:35:08,960
at mit of not just choosing smart people
 

5349
01:35:08,960 --> 01:35:09,590
at mit of not just choosing smart people
but choosing

5350
01:35:09,590 --> 01:35:09,600
but choosing
 

5351
01:35:09,600 --> 01:35:12,709
but choosing
smart people who i get along with

5352
01:35:12,709 --> 01:35:12,719

and creative and smart and you know
 

5357
01:35:19,360 --> 01:35:23,189
and creative and smart and you know
excited and childish in their

excited and childish in their
 

5359
01:35:23,199 --> 01:35:25,510
excited and childish in their
in you know uninhibited behaviors and so

5360
01:35:25,510 --> 01:35:25,520
in you know uninhibited behaviors and so
 

5361
01:35:25,520 --> 01:35:26,629
in you know uninhibited behaviors and so
forth so

forth so
 

5363
01:35:26,639 --> 01:35:28,470
forth so
you basically can choose yourself to

5364
01:35:28,470 --> 01:35:28,480
you basically can choose yourself to
 

5365
01:35:28,480 --> 01:35:29,830
you basically can choose yourself to
surround

5366

you can choose to surround yourself with
 

5369
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,790
you can choose to surround yourself with
people who are not only cognitively

5370
01:35:34,790 --> 01:35:34,800
people who are not only cognitively
 

5371
01:35:34,800 --> 01:35:38,550
people who are not only cognitively

the teams are made out of complementary

the teams are made out of complementary
components not just compatible but

5388
01:35:54,629 --> 01:35:54,639
components not just compatible but
 

5389
01:35:54,639 --> 01:35:56,790
components not just compatible but
very often complementary so in my own

01:35:56,790 --> 01:35:56,800
very often complementary so in my own
 

5391
01:35:56,800 --> 01:35:58,709
very often complementary so in my own
team i have a diversity of

there's a whole spectrum of biology to

5398
01:36:03,510 --> 01:36:03,520
there's a whole spectrum of biology to
 

5399
01:36:03,520 --> 01:36:05,669
there's a whole spectrum of biology to
computation of course but within biology

5400
01:36:05,669 --> 01:36:05,679
computation of course but within biology
 

5401
01:36:05,679 --> 01:36:06,790
computation of course but within biology
there's a lot of realms within

5402
01:36:06,790 --> 01:36:06,800
there's a lot of realms within
 

5403
01:36:06,800 --> 01:36:08,830
there's a lot of realms within
computation there's a lot of rounds

5404
01:36:08,830 --> 01:36:08,840
computation there's a lot of rounds
 

5405
01:36:08,840 --> 01:36:13,270
computation there's a lot of rounds
and what makes us click so well together

5406
01:36:13,270 --> 01:36:13,280
and what makes us click so well together
 

5407
01:36:13,280 --> 01:36:15,669
and what makes us click so well together
is the fact that not only do we have a

5408
01:36:15,669 --> 01:36:15,679
is the fact that not only do we have a
 

5409
01:36:15,679 --> 01:36:17,830
is the fact that not only do we have a
common mission a common passion

5410
01:36:17,830 --> 01:36:17,840
common mission a common passion
 

5411
01:36:17,840 --> 01:36:21,350
common mission a common passion
and a common you know view of

5412
01:36:21,350 --> 01:36:21,360
and a common you know view of
 

5413
01:36:21,360 --> 01:36:24,629
and a common you know view of
the world but that were complementary in

5414
01:36:24,629 --> 01:36:24,639
the world but that were complementary in
 

5415
01:36:24,639 --> 01:36:25,510
the world but that were complementary in
our skills

5416
01:36:25,510 --> 01:36:25,520
our skills
 

5417
01:36:25,520 --> 01:36:27,350
our skills
in our angles with which we accommodate

5418
01:36:27,350 --> 01:36:27,360
in our angles with which we accommodate
 

5419
01:36:27,360 --> 01:36:28,790
in our angles with which we accommodate
and so so forth and that's sort of what

5420
01:36:28,790 --> 01:36:28,800
and so so forth and that's sort of what
 

5421
01:36:28,800 --> 01:36:30,310
and so so forth and that's sort of what
makes it click yeah it's fascinating

5422
01:36:30,310 --> 01:36:30,320
makes it click yeah it's fascinating
 

5423
01:36:30,320 --> 01:36:30,790
makes it click yeah it's fascinating
that the

5424
01:36:30,790 --> 01:36:30,800
that the
 

5425
01:36:30,800 --> 01:36:34,390
that the
the the stickiness of multiple cognitive

5426
01:36:34,390 --> 01:36:34,400
the the stickiness of multiple cognitive
 

5427
01:36:34,400 --> 01:36:35,990
the the stickiness of multiple cognitive
systems together

5428
01:36:35,990 --> 01:36:36,000
systems together
 

5429
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,229
systems together
includes both the commonality so you

5430
01:36:38,229 --> 01:36:38,239
includes both the commonality so you
 

5431
01:36:38,239 --> 01:36:39,270
includes both the commonality so you
meet because you're

5432
01:36:39,270 --> 01:36:39,280
meet because you're
 

5433
01:36:39,280 --> 01:36:41,510
meet because you're
there's some common thing but you stick

5434
01:36:41,510 --> 01:36:41,520
there's some common thing but you stick
 

5435
01:36:41,520 --> 01:36:42,629
there's some common thing but you stick
together

5436
01:36:42,629 --> 01:36:42,639
together
 

5437
01:36:42,639 --> 01:36:45,669
together
because you're dif different in all the

5438
01:36:45,669 --> 01:36:45,679
because you're dif different in all the
 

5439
01:36:45,679 --> 01:36:46,629
because you're dif different in all the
useful ways

5440
01:36:46,629 --> 01:36:46,639
useful ways
 

5441
01:36:46,639 --> 01:36:49,109
useful ways
yeah yeah and my wife and i i mean we

5442
01:36:49,109 --> 01:36:49,119
yeah yeah and my wife and i i mean we
 

5443
01:36:49,119 --> 01:36:51,669
yeah yeah and my wife and i i mean we
adore each other like to pieces

5444
01:36:51,669 --> 01:36:51,679
adore each other like to pieces
 

5445
01:36:51,679 --> 01:36:53,590
adore each other like to pieces
but we're also extremely different in

5446
01:36:53,590 --> 01:36:53,600
but we're also extremely different in
 

5447
01:36:53,600 --> 01:36:54,950
but we're also extremely different in
many ways and that's

5448
01:36:54,950 --> 01:36:54,960
many ways and that's
 

5449
01:36:54,960 --> 01:36:58,390
many ways and that's
beautiful but i love that about

5450
01:36:58,390 --> 01:36:58,400
beautiful but i love that about
 

5451
01:36:58,400 --> 01:37:00,629
beautiful but i love that about
about us i love the fact that you know

5452
01:37:00,629 --> 01:37:00,639
about us i love the fact that you know
 

5453

about us i love the fact that you know
i'm like living out there in the

5454
01:37:02,310 --> 01:37:02,320
i'm like living out there in the
 

5455
01:37:02,320 --> 01:37:04,149
i'm like living out there in the
you know world of ideas and i forget

5456
01:37:04,149 --> 01:37:04,159
you know world of ideas and i forget
 

5457
01:37:04,159 --> 01:37:05,430
you know world of ideas and i forget
what day it is

5458
01:37:05,430 --> 01:37:05,440
what day it is
 

5459
01:37:05,440 --> 01:37:07,189
what day it is

01:37:13,830 --> 01:37:13,840
and uh you know yeah i do get yelled at
 

5465

and uh you know yeah i do get yelled at
but but i need it basically i need her

5466
01:37:16,790 --> 01:37:16,800
but but i need it basically i need her
 

5467
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:18,550
but but i need it basically i need her
as much as she needs me and she

5468
01:37:18,550 --> 01:37:18,560
as much as she needs me and she
 

5469
01:37:18,560 --> 01:37:20,149
as much as she needs me and she
loves interacting with me and talking i

5470
01:37:20,149 --> 01:37:20,159
loves interacting with me and talking i
 

5471
01:37:20,159 --> 01:37:22,070
loves interacting with me and talking i
mean you know last night we were talking

5472
01:37:22,070 --> 01:37:22,080
mean you know last night we were talking
 

5473
01:37:22,080 --> 01:37:22,629
mean you know last night we were talking
about

5474
01:37:22,629 --> 01:37:22,639
about
 

5475
01:37:22,639 --> 01:37:24,629
about
this and i showed her the questions and

5476
01:37:24,629 --> 01:37:24,639
this and i showed her the questions and
 

5477
01:37:24,639 --> 01:37:26,470
this and i showed her the questions and
we were bouncing ideas of each other

5478
01:37:26,470 --> 01:37:26,480
we were bouncing ideas of each other
 

5479
01:37:26,480 --> 01:37:28,149
we were bouncing ideas of each other
and it was just beautiful like we

5480
01:37:28,149 --> 01:37:28,159
and it was just beautiful like we
 

5481
01:37:28,159 --> 01:37:30,870
and it was just beautiful like we
basically have these you know

5482
01:37:30,870 --> 01:37:30,880
basically have these you know
 

5483
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:33,990
basically have these you know
basically cognitive you know

5484
01:37:33,990 --> 01:37:34,000
basically cognitive you know
 

5485
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,709
basically cognitive you know
let it all loose kind of dates where you

5486
01:37:36,709 --> 01:37:36,719
let it all loose kind of dates where you
 

5487
01:37:36,719 --> 01:37:37,350
let it all loose kind of dates where you
know we just

5488
01:37:37,350 --> 01:37:37,360
know we just
 

5489
01:37:37,360 --> 01:37:39,590
know we just
bring papers and we're like you know

5490
01:37:39,590 --> 01:37:39,600
bring papers and we're like you know
 

5491
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:41,350
bring papers and we're like you know
bouncing ideas etc so

5492
01:37:41,350 --> 01:37:41,360
bouncing ideas etc so
 

5493
01:37:41,360 --> 01:37:43,669
bouncing ideas etc so
you know we have extremely different

5494
01:37:43,669 --> 01:37:43,679
you know we have extremely different
 

5495
01:37:43,679 --> 01:37:44,870
you know we have extremely different
perspectives but

5496
01:37:44,870 --> 01:37:44,880
perspectives but
 

5497
01:37:44,880 --> 01:37:48,070
perspectives but
very common you know goals and

5498
01:37:48,070 --> 01:37:48,080
very common you know goals and
 

5499
01:37:48,080 --> 01:37:50,390
very common you know goals and
interests and anyway what do you make of

5500
01:37:50,390 --> 01:37:50,400
interests and anyway what do you make of
 

5501
01:37:50,400 --> 01:37:52,390
interests and anyway what do you make of
the communication mechanism that we

5502
01:37:52,390 --> 01:37:52,400
the communication mechanism that we
 

5503
01:37:52,400 --> 01:37:54,470
the communication mechanism that we
humans use to share those ideas because

5504
01:37:54,470 --> 01:37:54,480
humans use to share those ideas because
 

5505
01:37:54,480 --> 01:37:56,950
humans use to share those ideas because
like one essential element of all of

5506
01:37:56,950 --> 01:37:56,960
like one essential element of all of
 

5507
01:37:56,960 --> 01:38:00,310
like one essential element of all of
this is not just that we're able to

5508
01:38:00,310 --> 01:38:00,320
this is not just that we're able to
 

5509
01:38:00,320 --> 01:38:02,629
this is not just that we're able to
have these ideas but we're also able to

5510
01:38:02,629 --> 01:38:02,639
have these ideas but we're also able to
 

5511
01:38:02,639 --> 01:38:03,669
have these ideas but we're also able to
share them

5512
01:38:03,669 --> 01:38:03,679
share them
 

5513
01:38:03,679 --> 01:38:06,310
share them
we tend to maybe you can correct me but

5514
01:38:06,310 --> 01:38:06,320
we tend to maybe you can correct me but
 

5515
01:38:06,320 --> 01:38:08,070
we tend to maybe you can correct me but
we seem to use

5516
01:38:08,070 --> 01:38:08,080
we seem to use
 

5517
01:38:08,080 --> 01:38:10,470
we seem to use
language to share the ideas maybe we

5518
01:38:10,470 --> 01:38:10,480
language to share the ideas maybe we
 

5519
01:38:10,480 --> 01:38:12,149
language to share the ideas maybe we
share them in some much deeper way than

5520
01:38:12,149 --> 01:38:12,159
share them in some much deeper way than
 

5521
01:38:12,159 --> 01:38:13,109
share them in some much deeper way than
language i don't know

5522
01:38:13,109 --> 01:38:13,119
language i don't know
 

5523
01:38:13,119 --> 01:38:15,030
language i don't know
but what do you make of this whole

5524
01:38:15,030 --> 01:38:15,040
but what do you make of this whole
 

5525
01:38:15,040 --> 01:38:17,669
but what do you make of this whole
mechanism and how fundamental it is to

5526
01:38:17,669 --> 01:38:17,679
mechanism and how fundamental it is to
 

5527
01:38:17,679 --> 01:38:19,590
mechanism and how fundamental it is to
the human condition so some people will

5528
01:38:19,590 --> 01:38:19,600
the human condition so some people will
 

5529
01:38:19,600 --> 01:38:21,750
the human condition so some people will
tell you that your language

5530
01:38:21,750 --> 01:38:21,760
tell you that your language
 

5531
01:38:21,760 --> 01:38:23,830
tell you that your language
dictates your thoughts and your thoughts

5532
01:38:23,830 --> 01:38:23,840
dictates your thoughts and your thoughts
 

5533
01:38:23,840 --> 01:38:26,149

and um my wife was giving me a massage

5562
01:38:56,950 --> 01:38:56,960
and um my wife was giving me a massage
 

5563
01:38:56,960 --> 01:38:57,990
and um my wife was giving me a massage
the other day because like my

5564
01:38:57,990 --> 01:38:58,000
the other day because like my
 

5565
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,950
the other day because like my
left side was frozen and i started

5566
01:39:00,950 --> 01:39:00,960
left side was frozen and i started
 

5567
01:39:00,960 --> 01:39:01,510
left side was frozen and i started
playing

5568
01:39:01,510 --> 01:39:01,520
playing
 

5569
01:39:01,520 --> 01:39:04,550
playing
the recording and as i was listening to

5570
01:39:04,550 --> 01:39:04,560
the recording and as i was listening to
 

5571
01:39:04,560 --> 01:39:04,870
the recording and as i was listening to
it

5572
01:39:04,870 --> 01:39:04,880
it
 

5573
01:39:04,880 --> 01:39:06,229
it
i was like i don't remember any of that

5574
01:39:06,229 --> 01:39:06,239
i was like i don't remember any of that
 

5575
01:39:06,239 --> 01:39:07,910
i was like i don't remember any of that
and i was like of course

5576
01:39:07,910 --> 01:39:07,920
and i was like of course
 

5577
01:39:07,920 --> 01:39:10,229
and i was like of course
and then the entire thing came back but

5578
01:39:10,229 --> 01:39:10,239
and then the entire thing came back but
 

5579
01:39:10,239 --> 01:39:12,310
and then the entire thing came back but
then there's no way any other person

5580
01:39:12,310 --> 01:39:12,320
then there's no way any other person
 

5581
01:39:12,320 --> 01:39:13,109
then there's no way any other person
could have

5582
01:39:13,109 --> 01:39:13,119
could have
 

5583
01:39:13,119 --> 01:39:15,750
could have
recreated that entire sort of you know

5584
01:39:15,750 --> 01:39:15,760
recreated that entire sort of you know
 

5585
01:39:15,760 --> 01:39:17,270
recreated that entire sort of you know

three-dimensional
 

5587
01:39:17,280 --> 01:39:20,310
three-dimensional
uh shape and dream and concept and in

01:39:20,310 --> 01:39:20,320
uh shape and dream and concept and in
 

5589
01:39:20,320 --> 01:39:22,390
uh shape and dream and concept and in
the same way when i'm thinking of ideas

5590
01:39:22,390 --> 01:39:22,400
the same way when i'm thinking of ideas
 

5591
01:39:22,400 --> 01:39:23,990
the same way when i'm thinking of ideas
there's so many ideas i can't put two

5592
01:39:23,990 --> 01:39:24,000
there's so many ideas i can't put two
 

5593

there's so many ideas i can't put two
words i mean i will describe him with a

01:39:26,470 --> 01:39:26,480
words i mean i will describe him with a
 

5595
01:39:26,480 --> 01:39:27,270
words i mean i will describe him with a
thousand words but

5596
01:39:27,270 --> 01:39:27,280
thousand words but
 

5597
01:39:27,280 --> 01:39:29,910
thousand words but
the idea itself is much more precise or

5598
01:39:29,910 --> 01:39:29,920
the idea itself is much more precise or
 

5599
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:30,790
the idea itself is much more precise or
much more sort of

5600
01:39:30,790 --> 01:39:30,800
much more sort of
 

5601
01:39:30,800 --> 01:39:33,590
much more sort of
abstract or much more something you know

5602
01:39:33,590 --> 01:39:33,600
abstract or much more something you know
 

5603
01:39:33,600 --> 01:39:34,790
abstract or much more something you know
difference either

5604
01:39:34,790 --> 01:39:34,800
difference either
 

5605
01:39:34,800 --> 01:39:36,790
difference either
less abstract or more abstract and it's

5606
01:39:36,790 --> 01:39:36,800
less abstract or more abstract and it's
 

5607
01:39:36,800 --> 01:39:38,470
less abstract or more abstract and it's
either you know

5608
01:39:38,470 --> 01:39:38,480
either you know
 

5609
01:39:38,480 --> 01:39:41,990
either you know
basically the there's just a projection

5610
01:39:41,990 --> 01:39:42,000
basically the there's just a projection
 

5611
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:42,790
basically the there's just a projection
that happens

5612
01:39:42,790 --> 01:39:42,800
that happens
 

5613
01:39:42,800 --> 01:39:45,189
that happens
from the three-dimensional ideas into

5614
01:39:45,189 --> 01:39:45,199
from the three-dimensional ideas into
 

5615
01:39:45,199 --> 01:39:48,470
from the three-dimensional ideas into
let's say a one-dimensional language

5616
01:39:48,470 --> 01:39:48,480
let's say a one-dimensional language
 

5617
01:39:48,480 --> 01:39:50,310
let's say a one-dimensional language
and the language certainly gives you the

5618
01:39:50,310 --> 01:39:50,320
and the language certainly gives you the
 

5619
01:39:50,320 --> 01:39:51,910
and the language certainly gives you the
apparatus to think about

5620
01:39:51,910 --> 01:39:51,920
apparatus to think about
 

5621
01:39:51,920 --> 01:39:53,910
apparatus to think about
concepts that you didn't realize existed

5622
01:39:53,910 --> 01:39:53,920
concepts that you didn't realize existed
 

5623
01:39:53,920 --> 01:39:54,950
concepts that you didn't realize existed
before

5624
01:39:54,950 --> 01:39:54,960
before
 

5625
01:39:54,960 --> 01:39:57,189
before
and with my team we often create new

5626
01:39:57,189 --> 01:39:57,199
and with my team we often create new
 

5627
01:39:57,199 --> 01:39:58,390
and with my team we often create new
words i'm like well

5628
01:39:58,390 --> 01:39:58,400
words i'm like well
 

5629
01:39:58,400 --> 01:39:59,510
words i'm like well
now we're going to call this the

5630
01:39:59,510 --> 01:39:59,520
now we're going to call this the
 

5631
01:39:59,520 --> 01:40:01,669
now we're going to call this the
regulatory plexus of a gene and that

5632
01:40:01,669 --> 01:40:01,679
regulatory plexus of a gene and that
 

5633
01:40:01,679 --> 01:40:03,510
regulatory plexus of a gene and that
gives us now the language to sort of

5634
01:40:03,510 --> 01:40:03,520
gives us now the language to sort of
 

5635
01:40:03,520 --> 01:40:05,990
gives us now the language to sort of
build on that as one concept that you

5636
01:40:05,990 --> 01:40:06,000
build on that as one concept that you
 

5637
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,149
build on that as one concept that you
then build upon with all kinds of other

5638
01:40:08,149 --> 01:40:08,159
then build upon with all kinds of other
 

5639
01:40:08,159 --> 01:40:10,709
then build upon with all kinds of other
other things so there's this

5640
01:40:10,709 --> 01:40:10,719
other things so there's this
 

5641
01:40:10,719 --> 01:40:13,030
other things so there's this
co-evolution again of ideas and language

5642
01:40:13,030 --> 01:40:13,040
co-evolution again of ideas and language
 

5643
01:40:13,040 --> 01:40:15,669
co-evolution again of ideas and language
but they're not one-to-one uh with each

5644
01:40:15,669 --> 01:40:15,679
but they're not one-to-one uh with each
 

5645
01:40:15,679 --> 01:40:16,390
but they're not one-to-one uh with each
other

5646
01:40:16,390 --> 01:40:16,400
other
 

5647
01:40:16,400 --> 01:40:18,470
other
now let's talk about language itself

5648
01:40:18,470 --> 01:40:18,480
now let's talk about language itself
 

5649
01:40:18,480 --> 01:40:19,990
now let's talk about language itself
words

5650
01:40:19,990 --> 01:40:20,000
words
 

5651
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:24,149
words
sentences this is a very

5652
01:40:24,149 --> 01:40:24,159
sentences this is a very
 

5653
01:40:24,159 --> 01:40:25,990
sentences this is a very
distant construct from where language

5654
01:40:25,990 --> 01:40:26,000
distant construct from where language
 

5655
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:27,510
distant construct from where language
actually begun

5656
01:40:27,510 --> 01:40:27,520
actually begun
 

5657
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:30,870
actually begun
so if you look at how we communicate

5658
01:40:30,870 --> 01:40:30,880
so if you look at how we communicate
 

5659
01:40:30,880 --> 01:40:34,070
so if you look at how we communicate
as i'm speaking my eyes are shining

5660
01:40:34,070 --> 01:40:34,080
as i'm speaking my eyes are shining
 

5661
01:40:34,080 --> 01:40:35,830
as i'm speaking my eyes are shining
and my face is changing through all

5662
01:40:35,830 --> 01:40:35,840
and my face is changing through all
 

5663
01:40:35,840 --> 01:40:37,270
and my face is changing through all
kinds of emotions

5664
01:40:37,270 --> 01:40:37,280
kinds of emotions
 

5665
01:40:37,280 --> 01:40:40,390
kinds of emotions
and my entire body composition posture

5666
01:40:40,390 --> 01:40:40,400
and my entire body composition posture
 

5667
01:40:40,400 --> 01:40:43,750
and my entire body composition posture
is reshaped and my intonation

5668
01:40:43,750 --> 01:40:43,760
is reshaped and my intonation
 

5669
01:40:43,760 --> 01:40:46,470
is reshaped and my intonation
the pauses that i make the softer and

5670
01:40:46,470 --> 01:40:46,480
the pauses that i make the softer and
 

5671
01:40:46,480 --> 01:40:47,270
the pauses that i make the softer and
the louder and

5672
01:40:47,270 --> 01:40:47,280
the louder and
 

5673
01:40:47,280 --> 01:40:50,310
the louder and
this and that are conveying so much more

5674
01:40:50,310 --> 01:40:50,320
this and that are conveying so much more
 

5675
01:40:50,320 --> 01:40:51,830
this and that are conveying so much more
information

5676
01:40:51,830 --> 01:40:51,840
information
 

5677
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:55,189
information
and if you look at early human language

5678
01:40:55,189 --> 01:40:55,199
and if you look at early human language
 

5679
01:40:55,199 --> 01:40:57,669
and if you look at early human language
and if you look at how you know the

5680
01:40:57,669 --> 01:40:57,679
and if you look at how you know the
 

5681
01:40:57,679 --> 01:40:59,430
and if you look at how you know the
great apes communicate with each other

5682
01:40:59,430 --> 01:40:59,440
great apes communicate with each other
 

5683
01:40:59,440 --> 01:41:00,790
great apes communicate with each other
there's a lot of granting there's a lot

5684
01:41:00,790 --> 01:41:00,800
there's a lot of granting there's a lot
 

5685
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:02,310
there's a lot of granting there's a lot
of postering there's a lot of emotions

5686
01:41:02,310 --> 01:41:02,320
of postering there's a lot of emotions
 

5687
01:41:02,320 --> 01:41:04,709
of postering there's a lot of emotions
there's a lot of sort of shrieking etc

5688
01:41:04,709 --> 01:41:04,719
there's a lot of sort of shrieking etc
 

5689
01:41:04,719 --> 01:41:07,830
there's a lot of sort of shrieking etc
they have a lot of components of

5690
01:41:07,830 --> 01:41:07,840
they have a lot of components of
 

5691
01:41:07,840 --> 01:41:12,709
they have a lot of components of
our human language just not the words

5692
01:41:12,709 --> 01:41:12,719
our human language just not the words
 

5693
01:41:12,719 --> 01:41:17,109
our human language just not the words
so i think of human communication

5694
01:41:17,109 --> 01:41:17,119
so i think of human communication
 

5695
01:41:17,119 --> 01:41:20,310
so i think of human communication
as combining the ape

5696
01:41:20,310 --> 01:41:20,320
as combining the ape
 

5697
01:41:20,320 --> 01:41:23,350
as combining the ape
component but also of course the you

5698
01:41:23,350 --> 01:41:23,360
component but also of course the you
 

5699
01:41:23,360 --> 01:41:25,030
component but also of course the you
know gpt3 component

5700
01:41:25,030 --> 01:41:25,040
know gpt3 component
 

5701
01:41:25,040 --> 01:41:27,270
know gpt3 component
so basically there's the cognitive layer

5702
01:41:27,270 --> 01:41:27,280
so basically there's the cognitive layer
 

5703
01:41:27,280 --> 01:41:30,070
so basically there's the cognitive layer
and the reasoning layer that we share

5704
01:41:30,070 --> 01:41:30,080
and the reasoning layer that we share
 

5705
01:41:30,080 --> 01:41:32,550
and the reasoning layer that we share
with different parts of our relatives

5706
01:41:32,550 --> 01:41:32,560
with different parts of our relatives
 

5707
01:41:32,560 --> 01:41:34,149
with different parts of our relatives
there's the ai relatives

5708
01:41:34,149 --> 01:41:34,159
there's the ai relatives
 

5709
01:41:34,159 --> 01:41:36,790
there's the ai relatives
but there's also the grunting relatives

5710
01:41:36,790 --> 01:41:36,800
but there's also the grunting relatives
 

5711
01:41:36,800 --> 01:41:37,590
but there's also the grunting relatives
and

5712
01:41:37,590 --> 01:41:37,600
and
 

5713
01:41:37,600 --> 01:41:39,109
and
what i love about humanity is that we

5714
01:41:39,109 --> 01:41:39,119
what i love about humanity is that we
 

5715
01:41:39,119 --> 01:41:40,709
what i love about humanity is that we
have both we're not just a

5716
01:41:40,709 --> 01:41:40,719
have both we're not just a
 

5717
01:41:40,719 --> 01:41:42,310
have both we're not just a
conversational system

5718
01:41:42,310 --> 01:41:42,320
conversational system
 

5719
01:41:42,320 --> 01:41:45,750
conversational system
we're a grunting emotionally charged

5720
01:41:45,750 --> 01:41:45,760
we're a grunting emotionally charged
 

5721
01:41:45,760 --> 01:41:49,030
we're a grunting emotionally charged
you know weirdly intercon

5722
01:41:49,030 --> 01:41:49,040
you know weirdly intercon
 

5723
01:41:49,040 --> 01:41:51,910
you know weirdly intercon
connected system that also has the

5724
01:41:51,910 --> 01:41:51,920
connected system that also has the
 

5725
01:41:51,920 --> 01:41:53,510
connected system that also has the
ability to reason

5726
01:41:53,510 --> 01:41:53,520
ability to reason
 

5727
01:41:53,520 --> 01:41:55,830
ability to reason
and when when we communicate with each

5728
01:41:55,830 --> 01:41:55,840
and when when we communicate with each
 

5729
01:41:55,840 --> 01:41:56,550
and when when we communicate with each
other

5730
01:41:56,550 --> 01:41:56,560
other
 

5731
01:41:56,560 --> 01:41:58,870
other
there's so much more than just language

5732
01:41:58,870 --> 01:41:58,880
there's so much more than just language
 

5733
01:41:58,880 --> 01:42:01,030
there's so much more than just language
there's so much more than just words

5734
01:42:01,030 --> 01:42:01,040
there's so much more than just words
 

5735
01:42:01,040 --> 01:42:02,629
there's so much more than just words
it does seem like we're able to somehow

5736
01:42:02,629 --> 01:42:02,639
it does seem like we're able to somehow
 

5737
01:42:02,639 --> 01:42:05,189
it does seem like we're able to somehow
transfer even more than the

5738
01:42:05,189 --> 01:42:05,199
transfer even more than the
 

5739
01:42:05,199 --> 01:42:07,830
transfer even more than the
the body language it seems that in the

5740
01:42:07,830 --> 01:42:07,840
the body language it seems that in the
 

5741
01:42:07,840 --> 01:42:08,709
the body language it seems that in the
room with us

5742
01:42:08,709 --> 01:42:08,719
room with us
 

5743
01:42:08,719 --> 01:42:11,750
room with us
is always a giant knowledge base

5744
01:42:11,750 --> 01:42:11,760
is always a giant knowledge base
 

5745
01:42:11,760 --> 01:42:14,870
is always a giant knowledge base
of like shared experiences different

5746
01:42:14,870 --> 01:42:14,880
of like shared experiences different
 

5747
01:42:14,880 --> 01:42:17,590
of like shared experiences different
perspectives on those experiences but

5748
01:42:17,590 --> 01:42:17,600
perspectives on those experiences but
 

5749
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:19,430
perspectives on those experiences but
i don't know the knowledge of who the

5750
01:42:19,430 --> 01:42:19,440
i don't know the knowledge of who the
 

5751

last three four presidents in the united

5752
01:42:21,590 --> 01:42:21,600
last three four presidents in the united
 

5753
01:42:21,600 --> 01:42:22,550
last three four presidents in the united
states was and

just all the you know 911 the tragedies

5756
01:42:25,030 --> 01:42:25,040
just all the you know 911 the tragedies

that happen in the world they're
 

5763
01:42:30,239 --> 01:42:33,669
that happen in the world they're
somehow both in our minds and somehow

5764
01:42:33,669 --> 01:42:33,679
somehow both in our minds and somehow
 

5765
01:42:33,679 --> 01:42:35,830
somehow both in our minds and somehow
enrich the ability to transfer

5766
01:42:35,830 --> 01:42:35,840
enrich the ability to transfer
 

5767
01:42:35,840 --> 01:42:37,109
enrich the ability to transfer
information

5768
01:42:37,109 --> 01:42:37,119
information
 

5769
01:42:37,119 --> 01:42:38,709
information
and what i love about it is i can i can

5770
01:42:38,709 --> 01:42:38,719
and what i love about it is i can i can
 

5771
01:42:38,719 --> 01:42:40,310
and what i love about it is i can i can
talk to you about 2001 audience of space

5772
01:42:40,310 --> 01:42:40,320
talk to you about 2001 audience of space
 

5773
01:42:40,320 --> 01:42:41,910
talk to you about 2001 audience of space
and mention a very specific scene and

5774
01:42:41,910 --> 01:42:41,920
and mention a very specific scene and
 

5775
01:42:41,920 --> 01:42:43,189
and mention a very specific scene and
that evokes

5776
01:42:43,189 --> 01:42:43,199
that evokes
 

5777
01:42:43,199 --> 01:42:44,709
that evokes
all these feelings that you had when you

5778
01:42:44,709 --> 01:42:44,719
all these feelings that you had when you
 

5779
01:42:44,719 --> 01:42:46,470
all these feelings that you had when you
first watched it we're both visualizing

5780
01:42:46,470 --> 01:42:46,480
first watched it we're both visualizing
 

5781
01:42:46,480 --> 01:42:46,950
first watched it we're both visualizing
that

5782
01:42:46,950 --> 01:42:46,960
that
 

5783
01:42:46,960 --> 01:42:49,189
that
maybe in different ways exactly but in

5784
01:42:49,189 --> 01:42:49,199
maybe in different ways exactly but in
 

5785
01:42:49,199 --> 01:42:50,310
maybe in different ways exactly but in
that yeah

5786
01:42:50,310 --> 01:42:50,320
that yeah
 

5787
01:42:50,320 --> 01:42:54,149
that yeah
and not only that but the feeling

5788
01:42:54,149 --> 01:42:54,159
and not only that but the feeling
 

5789
01:42:54,159 --> 01:42:56,550
and not only that but the feeling
uh is brought back up just like you said

5790
01:42:56,550 --> 01:42:56,560
uh is brought back up just like you said
 

5791
01:42:56,560 --> 01:42:58,070
uh is brought back up just like you said
with the dreams

5792
01:42:58,070 --> 01:42:58,080
with the dreams
 

5793
01:42:58,080 --> 01:43:00,310
with the dreams
we both have that feeling arise in some

5794
01:43:00,310 --> 01:43:00,320
we both have that feeling arise in some
 

5795
01:43:00,320 --> 01:43:02,229
we both have that feeling arise in some
form exactly as you bring up the

5796
01:43:02,229 --> 01:43:02,239
form exactly as you bring up the
 

5797
01:43:02,239 --> 01:43:05,510
form exactly as you bring up the
exact you know uh facing his own

5798
01:43:05,510 --> 01:43:05,520
exact you know uh facing his own
 

5799
01:43:05,520 --> 01:43:06,790
exact you know uh facing his own
mortality

5800
01:43:06,790 --> 01:43:06,800
mortality
 

5801
01:43:06,800 --> 01:43:08,709
mortality
yeah it's fascinating that we're able to

5802
01:43:08,709 --> 01:43:08,719
yeah it's fascinating that we're able to
 

5803
01:43:08,719 --> 01:43:10,470
yeah it's fascinating that we're able to
do that but i don't know

5804
01:43:10,470 --> 01:43:10,480
do that but i don't know
 

5805
01:43:10,480 --> 01:43:11,830
do that but i don't know
now let's let's talk about neural link

5806
01:43:11,830 --> 01:43:11,840
now let's let's talk about neural link
 

5807
01:43:11,840 --> 01:43:13,669
now let's let's talk about neural link
for a second so what's the concept of

5808
01:43:13,669 --> 01:43:13,679
for a second so what's the concept of
 

5809
01:43:13,679 --> 01:43:15,590
for a second so what's the concept of
generally the concept of neural link is

5810
01:43:15,590 --> 01:43:15,600
generally the concept of neural link is
 

5811
01:43:15,600 --> 01:43:17,030
generally the concept of neural link is
that i'm going to take

5812
01:43:17,030 --> 01:43:17,040
that i'm going to take
 

5813
01:43:17,040 --> 01:43:18,790
that i'm going to take
whatever knowledge is encoded in my

5814
01:43:18,790 --> 01:43:18,800
whatever knowledge is encoded in my
 

5815
01:43:18,800 --> 01:43:21,189
whatever knowledge is encoded in my
brain directly transfer it into your

5816
01:43:21,189 --> 01:43:21,199
brain directly transfer it into your
 

5817
01:43:21,199 --> 01:43:22,070
brain directly transfer it into your
brain

5818
01:43:22,070 --> 01:43:22,080
brain
 

5819
01:43:22,080 --> 01:43:25,430
brain
so this is a beautiful fascinating and

5820
01:43:25,430 --> 01:43:25,440
so this is a beautiful fascinating and
 

5821
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:28,070
so this is a beautiful fascinating and
extremely sort of you know appealing

5822
01:43:28,070 --> 01:43:28,080
extremely sort of you know appealing
 

5823
01:43:28,080 --> 01:43:29,030
extremely sort of you know appealing
concept

5824
01:43:29,030 --> 01:43:29,040
concept
 

5825
01:43:29,040 --> 01:43:30,709
concept
but i see a lot of challenges

5826
01:43:30,709 --> 01:43:30,719
but i see a lot of challenges
 

5827
01:43:30,719 --> 01:43:32,070
but i see a lot of challenges
surrounding that

5828
01:43:32,070 --> 01:43:32,080
surrounding that
 

5829
01:43:32,080 --> 01:43:35,030
surrounding that
the first one is we have no idea how to

5830
01:43:35,030 --> 01:43:35,040
the first one is we have no idea how to
 

5831
01:43:35,040 --> 01:43:36,709
the first one is we have no idea how to
even begin to understand

5832
01:43:36,709 --> 01:43:36,719
even begin to understand
 

5833
01:43:36,719 --> 01:43:39,109
even begin to understand
how knowledge is encoded in a person's

5834
01:43:39,109 --> 01:43:39,119
how knowledge is encoded in a person's
 

5835
01:43:39,119 --> 01:43:39,910
how knowledge is encoded in a person's
brain

5836
01:43:39,910 --> 01:43:39,920
brain
 

5837
01:43:39,920 --> 01:43:41,189
brain
i mean i told you about this paper that

5838
01:43:41,189 --> 01:43:41,199
i mean i told you about this paper that
 

5839
01:43:41,199 --> 01:43:42,950
i mean i told you about this paper that
we had recently with liquitai

5840
01:43:42,950 --> 01:43:42,960
we had recently with liquitai
 

5841
01:43:42,960 --> 01:43:46,149
we had recently with liquitai
and asaf marco that basically was

5842
01:43:46,149 --> 01:43:46,159
and asaf marco that basically was
 

5843
01:43:46,159 --> 01:43:47,109
and asaf marco that basically was
looking at these

5844
01:43:47,109 --> 01:43:47,119
looking at these
 

5845
01:43:47,119 --> 01:43:49,350
looking at these
engrams that are formed with

5846
01:43:49,350 --> 01:43:49,360
engrams that are formed with
 

5847
01:43:49,360 --> 01:43:51,430
engrams that are formed with
combinations of neurons that co-fire

5848
01:43:51,430 --> 01:43:51,440
combinations of neurons that co-fire
 

5849
01:43:51,440 --> 01:43:52,950
combinations of neurons that co-fire
when a stimulus happens

5850
01:43:52,950 --> 01:43:52,960
when a stimulus happens
 

5851
01:43:52,960 --> 01:43:54,709
when a stimulus happens
where we can go into a mouse and select

5852
01:43:54,709 --> 01:43:54,719
where we can go into a mouse and select
 

5853
01:43:54,719 --> 01:43:56,709
where we can go into a mouse and select
those neurons that fire by marking them

5854
01:43:56,709 --> 01:43:56,719
those neurons that fire by marking them
 

5855
01:43:56,719 --> 01:43:57,830
those neurons that fire by marking them
and then see what happens when they

5856
01:43:57,830 --> 01:43:57,840
and then see what happens when they
 

5857
01:43:57,840 --> 01:44:00,070
and then see what happens when they
first fire and then select the neurons

5858
01:44:00,070 --> 01:44:00,080
first fire and then select the neurons
 

5859
01:44:00,080 --> 01:44:01,669
first fire and then select the neurons
that fire again when the experience is

5860
01:44:01,669 --> 01:44:01,679
that fire again when the experience is
 

5861
01:44:01,679 --> 01:44:02,629
that fire again when the experience is
repeated

5862
01:44:02,629 --> 01:44:02,639
repeated
 

5863
01:44:02,639 --> 01:44:05,030
repeated
these are the recall neurons and then

5864
01:44:05,030 --> 01:44:05,040
these are the recall neurons and then
 

5865
01:44:05,040 --> 01:44:05,990
these are the recall neurons and then
there's the

5866
01:44:05,990 --> 01:44:06,000
there's the
 

5867
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:07,990
there's the
the memory consolidation neurons so

5868
01:44:07,990 --> 01:44:08,000
the memory consolidation neurons so
 

5869
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:09,669
the memory consolidation neurons so
we're starting to understand a little

5870
01:44:09,669 --> 01:44:09,679
we're starting to understand a little
 

5871
01:44:09,679 --> 01:44:11,669
we're starting to understand a little
bit of sort of the distributed

5872
01:44:11,669 --> 01:44:11,679
bit of sort of the distributed
 

5873
01:44:11,679 --> 01:44:14,149
bit of sort of the distributed
nature of knowledge and coding and

5874
01:44:14,149 --> 01:44:14,159
nature of knowledge and coding and

01:44:21,600 --> 01:44:23,750
the concept that we'll understand that
sufficiently one day

5884
01:44:23,750 --> 01:44:23,760
sufficiently one day
 

5885
01:44:23,760 --> 01:44:27,590
sufficiently one day
to be able to take a snapshot of

5886
01:44:27,590 --> 01:44:27,600
to be able to take a snapshot of
 

5887
01:44:27,600 --> 01:44:31,109
to be able to take a snapshot of
what does that seem from dave losing his

5888
01:44:31,109 --> 01:44:31,119
what does that seem from dave losing his
 

5889
01:44:31,119 --> 01:44:31,510
what does that seem from dave losing his
mind

5890
01:44:31,510 --> 01:44:31,520
mind
 

5891
01:44:31,520 --> 01:44:33,830
mind
of how losing his mind and talking to

5892
01:44:33,830 --> 01:44:33,840
of how losing his mind and talking to
 

5893
01:44:33,840 --> 01:44:34,550
of how losing his mind and talking to
dave

5894
01:44:34,550 --> 01:44:34,560
dave
 

5895
01:44:34,560 --> 01:44:38,550
dave
um how is that seen encoded in your

5896
01:44:38,550 --> 01:44:38,560
um how is that seen encoded in your
 

5897
01:44:38,560 --> 01:44:41,430
um how is that seen encoded in your
mind imagine the complexity of that but

5898
01:44:41,430 --> 01:44:41,440
mind imagine the complexity of that but
 

5899
01:44:41,440 --> 01:44:43,270
mind imagine the complexity of that but
now imagine

5900
01:44:43,270 --> 01:44:43,280
now imagine
 

5901
01:44:43,280 --> 01:44:46,629
now imagine
suppose that we solve this problem and

5902
01:44:46,629 --> 01:44:46,639
suppose that we solve this problem and
 

5903
01:44:46,639 --> 01:44:48,550
suppose that we solve this problem and
the next enormous challenge is how do i

5904
01:44:48,550 --> 01:44:48,560
the next enormous challenge is how do i
 

5905
01:44:48,560 --> 01:44:50,950
the next enormous challenge is how do i
go and modify the next person's brain

5906
01:44:50,950 --> 01:44:50,960
go and modify the next person's brain
 

5907
01:44:50,960 --> 01:44:53,109
go and modify the next person's brain
to now create the same exact neural

5908
01:44:53,109 --> 01:44:53,119
to now create the same exact neural
 

5909
01:44:53,119 --> 01:44:54,149
to now create the same exact neural
connections

5910
01:44:54,149 --> 01:44:54,159
connections
 

5911
01:44:54,159 --> 01:44:55,750
connections
so that's an enormous challenge right

5912
01:44:55,750 --> 01:44:55,760
so that's an enormous challenge right
 

5913
01:44:55,760 --> 01:44:57,830
so that's an enormous challenge right
there so basically it's not just reading

5914
01:44:57,830 --> 01:44:57,840
there so basically it's not just reading
 

5915
01:44:57,840 --> 01:45:00,870
there so basically it's not just reading
it's not writing and again

5916
01:45:00,870 --> 01:45:00,880
it's not writing and again
 

5917
01:45:00,880 --> 01:45:02,229
it's not writing and again
what if something goes wrong i don't

5918
01:45:02,229 --> 01:45:02,239
what if something goes wrong i don't
 

5919
01:45:02,239 --> 01:45:03,910
what if something goes wrong i don't
want to even think about that

5920
01:45:03,910 --> 01:45:03,920
want to even think about that
 

5921
01:45:03,920 --> 01:45:07,030
want to even think about that
that's number two and number three who

5922
01:45:07,030 --> 01:45:07,040
that's number two and number three who
 

5923
01:45:07,040 --> 01:45:07,590
that's number two and number three who
says

5924
01:45:07,590 --> 01:45:07,600
says
 

5925
01:45:07,600 --> 01:45:09,910
says
that the way that you encode dave i'm

5926
01:45:09,910 --> 01:45:09,920
that the way that you encode dave i'm
 

5927
01:45:09,920 --> 01:45:11,350
that the way that you encode dave i'm
losing my mind

5928
01:45:11,350 --> 01:45:11,360
losing my mind
 

5929
01:45:11,360 --> 01:45:14,709
losing my mind
and i encode dave i'm losing my mind

5930
01:45:14,709 --> 01:45:14,719
and i encode dave i'm losing my mind
 

5931
01:45:14,719 --> 01:45:17,510
and i encode dave i'm losing my mind
is anywhere near each other basically

5932
01:45:17,510 --> 01:45:17,520
is anywhere near each other basically
 

5933
01:45:17,520 --> 01:45:19,990
is anywhere near each other basically
maybe the way that i'm encoding it

5934
01:45:19,990 --> 01:45:20,000
maybe the way that i'm encoding it
 

5935
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:23,350
maybe the way that i'm encoding it
is twisted with my childhood memories of

you know the pebbles in greece and yours

5940
01:45:27,510 --> 01:45:27,520
you know the pebbles in greece and yours

01:45:33,030 --> 01:45:33,040
growing up in russia and there's no way
 

5945
01:45:33,040 --> 01:45:34,950
growing up in russia and there's no way
that i can take my encoding and put it

5946
01:45:34,950 --> 01:45:34,960
that i can take my encoding and put it
 

5947
01:45:34,960 --> 01:45:36,390
that i can take my encoding and put it
into your brain because it'll

5948
01:45:36,390 --> 01:45:36,400
into your brain because it'll

you're you're reminding us that uh

5958
01:45:49,350 --> 01:45:49,360
you're you're reminding us that uh
 

5959
01:45:49,360 --> 01:45:51,350
you're you're reminding us that uh
there's there's uh two biological

5960
01:45:51,350 --> 01:45:51,360
there's there's uh two biological
 

5961
01:45:51,360 --> 01:45:53,030
there's there's uh two biological
systems on both ends of that

5962
01:45:53,030 --> 01:45:53,040
systems on both ends of that
 

5963
01:45:53,040 --> 01:45:53,750
systems on both ends of that
communication

communication
 

5965
01:45:53,760 --> 01:45:56,709
communication
and the one the easier i guess may be

5966
01:45:56,709 --> 01:45:56,719
and the one the easier i guess may be
 

5967
01:45:56,719 --> 01:45:57,270
and the one the easier i guess may be
half

5968
01:45:57,270 --> 01:45:57,280
half
 

5969
01:45:57,280 --> 01:45:59,990
half
as difficult a thing to do and the hope

5970
01:45:59,990 --> 01:46:00,000
as difficult a thing to do and the hope
 

5971
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:01,830
as difficult a thing to do and the hope
with neural link is that

5972
01:46:01,830 --> 01:46:01,840
with neural link is that
 

5973
01:46:01,840 --> 01:46:04,790
with neural link is that
we can communicate with an ai system so

5974
01:46:04,790 --> 01:46:04,800
we can communicate with an ai system so
 

5975
01:46:04,800 --> 01:46:06,470
we can communicate with an ai system so
yeah where one side of that is a little

5976
01:46:06,470 --> 01:46:06,480
yeah where one side of that is a little
 

5977
01:46:06,480 --> 01:46:06,950
yeah where one side of that is a little
bit

5978
01:46:06,950 --> 01:46:06,960
bit
 

5979
01:46:06,960 --> 01:46:10,470
bit
yeah more controllable but

5980
01:46:10,470 --> 01:46:10,480
yeah more controllable but
 

5981
01:46:10,480 --> 01:46:12,709
yeah more controllable but
but even just that is is exceptionally

5982
01:46:12,709 --> 01:46:12,719
but even just that is is exceptionally
 

5983
01:46:12,719 --> 01:46:14,310
but even just that is is exceptionally
difficult let's talk about

5984
01:46:14,310 --> 01:46:14,320
difficult let's talk about
 

5985
01:46:14,320 --> 01:46:16,390
difficult let's talk about
two two new neuronal systems talking to

01:46:48,880 --> 01:46:50,870
yes create keep talking keep talking
and just re-encode it all together so

6018
01:46:50,870 --> 01:46:50,880
and just re-encode it all together so
 

6019
01:46:50,880 --> 01:46:52,149
and just re-encode it all together so
maybe what language does

6020
01:46:52,149 --> 01:46:52,159
maybe what language does
 

6021
01:46:52,159 --> 01:46:54,550
maybe what language does
is exactly that it's taking one

6022
01:46:54,550 --> 01:46:54,560
is exactly that it's taking one
 

6023
01:46:54,560 --> 01:46:56,709
is exactly that it's taking one
generative cognitive model

6024

generative cognitive model
 

6025
01:46:56,719 --> 01:46:58,870
generative cognitive model
it's running it forward to emit

6026
01:46:58,870 --> 01:46:58,880
it's running it forward to emit
 

6027
01:46:58,880 --> 01:47:00,629
it's running it forward to emit
utterances that kind of make sense in my

and it's re-encoding them into yours

6032
01:47:04,149 --> 01:47:04,159
and it's re-encoding them into yours
 

6033
01:47:04,159 --> 01:47:04,709
and it's re-encoding them into yours
through

through
 

6035
01:47:04,719 --> 01:47:07,430
through
the parsing of that same language and i

6036
01:47:07,430 --> 01:47:07,440
the parsing of that same language and i
 

6037
01:47:07,440 --> 01:47:08,870
the parsing of that same language and i
think the conversation might

6038
01:47:08,870 --> 01:47:08,880
think the conversation might
 

6039
01:47:08,880 --> 01:47:10,790
think the conversation might
might actually be the most efficient way

6040
01:47:10,790 --> 01:47:10,800
might actually be the most efficient way
 

6041
01:47:10,800 --> 01:47:12,070
might actually be the most efficient way
to do it so not just

6042
01:47:12,070 --> 01:47:12,080
to do it so not just
 

6043
01:47:12,080 --> 01:47:14,950
to do it so not just
talking but uh interactive so talking

6044
01:47:14,950 --> 01:47:14,960
talking but uh interactive so talking
 

6045
01:47:14,960 --> 01:47:15,750
talking but uh interactive so talking
back and forth

6046
01:47:15,750 --> 01:47:15,760
back and forth
 

6047
01:47:15,760 --> 01:47:18,430
back and forth
yeah asking questions interrupting so

6048
01:47:18,430 --> 01:47:18,440
yeah asking questions interrupting so
 

6049
01:47:18,440 --> 01:47:26,470
yeah asking questions interrupting so
gpth4 will constantly be interrupted

6050
01:47:26,470 --> 01:47:26,480

 

6051
01:47:26,480 --> 01:47:28,790

is also that as we're interrupting each

6052
01:47:28,790 --> 01:47:28,800
is also that as we're interrupting each
 

6053
01:47:28,800 --> 01:47:29,830
is also that as we're interrupting each
other

6054
01:47:29,830 --> 01:47:29,840
other
 

6055
01:47:29,840 --> 01:47:32,070
other
there's all kinds of misinterpretations

6056
01:47:32,070 --> 01:47:32,080
there's all kinds of misinterpretations
 

6057
01:47:32,080 --> 01:47:33,350
there's all kinds of misinterpretations
that happen

6058
01:47:33,350 --> 01:47:33,360
that happen
 

6059
01:47:33,360 --> 01:47:35,510
that happen
that you know as basically when my

6060
01:47:35,510 --> 01:47:35,520
that you know as basically when my
 

6061
01:47:35,520 --> 01:47:36,550
that you know as basically when my
students speak

6062
01:47:36,550 --> 01:47:36,560
students speak
 

6063
01:47:36,560 --> 01:47:38,310
students speak
i will often know that i'm

6064
01:47:38,310 --> 01:47:38,320
i will often know that i'm
 

6065
01:47:38,320 --> 01:47:40,149
i will often know that i'm
misunderstanding what they're saying

6066
01:47:40,149 --> 01:47:40,159
misunderstanding what they're saying
 

6067
01:47:40,159 --> 01:47:42,149
misunderstanding what they're saying
and i'll be like hold that thought for a

6068
01:47:42,149 --> 01:47:42,159
and i'll be like hold that thought for a
 

6069
01:47:42,159 --> 01:47:44,310
and i'll be like hold that thought for a
second let me tell you what i think i

6070
01:47:44,310 --> 01:47:44,320
second let me tell you what i think i
 

6071
01:47:44,320 --> 01:47:45,669
second let me tell you what i think i
understood which i know is different

6072
01:47:45,669 --> 01:47:45,679
understood which i know is different
 

6073
01:47:45,679 --> 01:47:47,910
understood which i know is different
what you said then i'll say that and

6074
01:47:47,910 --> 01:47:47,920
what you said then i'll say that and
 

6075
01:47:47,920 --> 01:47:48,950
what you said then i'll say that and
then someone else

6076
01:47:48,950 --> 01:47:48,960
then someone else
 

6077
01:47:48,960 --> 01:47:50,950
then someone else
in the same zoom meeting will basically

6078
01:47:50,950 --> 01:47:50,960
in the same zoom meeting will basically
 

6079
01:47:50,960 --> 01:47:52,550
in the same zoom meeting will basically
say well

6080
01:47:52,550 --> 01:47:52,560
say well
 

6081
01:47:52,560 --> 01:47:53,990
say well
you know here's another way to think

6082
01:47:53,990 --> 01:47:54,000
you know here's another way to think
 

6083
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,310
you know here's another way to think
about what you just said and then by the

6084
01:47:56,310 --> 01:47:56,320
about what you just said and then by the
 

6085
01:47:56,320 --> 01:47:57,830
about what you just said and then by the
third iteration we're somewhere

6086
01:47:57,830 --> 01:47:57,840
third iteration we're somewhere
 

6087
01:47:57,840 --> 01:47:59,189
third iteration we're somewhere
completely different

6088
01:47:59,189 --> 01:47:59,199
completely different
 

6089
01:47:59,199 --> 01:48:01,990
completely different
that if we could actually communicate

6090
01:48:01,990 --> 01:48:02,000
that if we could actually communicate
 

6091
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:02,629

6099
01:48:09,119 --> 01:48:12,790
idea and coding
would be far inferior because

would be far inferior because
 

6101
01:48:12,800 --> 01:48:15,750
would be far inferior because

thoughtful and you're connected to a
 

6151
01:49:16,719 --> 01:49:18,390
thoughtful and you're connected to a
bunch like you said students

6152
01:49:18,390 --> 01:49:18,400
bunch like you said students
 

6153
01:49:18,400 --> 01:49:22,709
bunch like you said students
uh your wife your kids what do you

6154
01:49:22,709 --> 01:49:22,719
uh your wife your kids what do you
 

6155
01:49:22,719 --> 01:49:24,950
uh your wife your kids what do you
in your brief time here on earth this is

6156
01:49:24,950 --> 01:49:24,960
in your brief time here on earth this is
 

6157
01:49:24,960 --> 01:49:27,189
in your brief time here on earth this is
a meaning of life episode

6158
01:49:27,189 --> 01:49:27,199
a meaning of life episode
 

6159
01:49:27,199 --> 01:49:30,950
a meaning of life episode
so uh what do you hope this world will

6160
01:49:30,950 --> 01:49:30,960
so uh what do you hope this world will
 

6161
01:49:30,960 --> 01:49:33,270
so uh what do you hope this world will
remember you as what do you hope your

6162
01:49:33,270 --> 01:49:33,280
remember you as what do you hope your
 

6163
01:49:33,280 --> 01:49:36,629
remember you as what do you hope your
legacy will be

6164
01:49:36,629 --> 01:49:36,639

 

6165
01:49:36,639 --> 01:49:39,750

i don't think of legacy as much

6166
01:49:39,750 --> 01:49:39,760
i don't think of legacy as much
 

6167
01:49:39,760 --> 01:49:43,350
i don't think of legacy as much
as maybe most people things

6168
01:49:43,350 --> 01:49:43,360
as maybe most people things
 

6169
01:49:43,360 --> 01:49:45,430
as maybe most people things
legacy oh it's kind of funny i'm

6170
01:49:45,430 --> 01:49:45,440
legacy oh it's kind of funny i'm
 

6171
01:49:45,440 --> 01:49:47,350
legacy oh it's kind of funny i'm
consciously living the present

6172
01:49:47,350 --> 01:49:47,360
consciously living the present
 

6173
01:49:47,360 --> 01:49:49,910
consciously living the present
yes many students tell me you know oh

6174
01:49:49,910 --> 01:49:49,920
yes many students tell me you know oh
 

6175
01:49:49,920 --> 01:49:51,270
yes many students tell me you know oh
give us some career advice i'm like i'm

6176
01:49:51,270 --> 01:49:51,280
give us some career advice i'm like i'm
 

6177
01:49:51,280 --> 01:49:52,310
give us some career advice i'm like i'm
the wrong person

the wrong person
 

6179
01:49:52,320 --> 01:49:54,470
the wrong person
i've never made a career plan i still

6180

us in computational biology

6364
01:53:18,709 --> 01:53:18,719
us in computational biology
 

6365
01:53:18,719 --> 01:53:20,870
us in computational biology
and so forth i'm like i don't know any

6366
01:53:20,870 --> 01:53:20,880
and so forth i'm like i don't know any

cognitive states

6376
01:53:29,189 --> 01:53:29,199
cognitive states
 

6377
01:53:29,199 --> 01:53:32,790
cognitive states
with a wider audience where suddenly

6378
01:53:32,790 --> 01:53:32,800
with a wider audience where suddenly
 

6379
01:53:32,800 --> 01:53:34,390
with a wider audience where suddenly
i'm sort of realizing that wow maybe

6380

basically people you know i'll ask them
a question

was a company where i asked somebody
 

6475
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:07,030
was a company where i asked somebody
question they said

6476
01:55:07,030 --> 01:55:07,040
question they said
 

6477
01:55:07,040 --> 01:55:08,709
question they said
oh in fact this entire project was

6478
01:55:08,709 --> 01:55:08,719
oh in fact this entire project was
 

6479
01:55:08,719 --> 01:55:10,070
oh in fact this entire project was
inspired by your question three years

6480
01:55:10,070 --> 01:55:10,080
inspired by your question three years
 

6481
01:55:10,080 --> 01:55:10,390
inspired by your question three years
ago

6482
01:55:10,390 --> 01:55:10,400
ago
 

6483
01:55:10,400 --> 01:55:13,430

and then on top of that there's also the
 

6487
01:55:14,800 --> 01:55:16,390
and then on top of that there's also the
ripple effects of the years speaking to

6488
01:55:16,390 --> 01:55:16,400
ripple effects of the years speaking to
 

6489
01:55:16,400 --> 01:55:17,109
ripple effects of the years speaking to
the direct

6490
01:55:17,109 --> 01:55:17,119
the direct
 

6491
01:55:17,119 --> 01:55:19,030
the direct
influence of inspiration or education

6492
01:55:19,030 --> 01:55:19,040
influence of inspiration or education
 

6493
01:55:19,040 --> 01:55:20,709
influence of inspiration or education
but there's also like

6494
01:55:20,709 --> 01:55:20,719
but there's also like
 

6495
01:55:20,719 --> 01:55:22,629
but there's also like
the follow-on things that happened to

6496
01:55:22,629 --> 01:55:22,639
the follow-on things that happened to
 

6497
01:55:22,639 --> 01:55:24,149
the follow-on things that happened to
that and there's this ripple that

6498
01:55:24,149 --> 01:55:24,159
that and there's this ripple that
 

6499
01:55:24,159 --> 01:55:24,550

every one of us shares genes
 

6511
01:55:36,560 --> 01:55:38,870
every one of us shares genes
and genetic variants with very recent

6512
01:55:38,870 --> 01:55:38,880
and genetic variants with very recent
 

6513

my genes are still shared through my

6520
01:55:45,990 --> 01:55:46,000
my genes are still shared through my
 

6521
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:47,430
my genes are still shared through my
cousins and through my uncles and

6522
01:55:47,430 --> 01:55:47,440
cousins and through my uncles and
 

6523
01:55:47,440 --> 01:55:48,070
cousins and through my uncles and
through my

6524
01:55:48,070 --> 01:55:48,080
through my
 

6525
01:55:48,080 --> 01:55:50,550
through my
you know immediate family and of course

6526
01:55:50,550 --> 01:55:50,560
you know immediate family and of course
 

6527
01:55:50,560 --> 01:55:52,629
you know immediate family and of course
i'm lucky enough to have my own children

6528
01:55:52,629 --> 01:55:52,639
i'm lucky enough to have my own children
 

6529
01:55:52,639 --> 01:55:54,790
i'm lucky enough to have my own children
but even if you don't your genes are

6530
01:55:54,790 --> 01:55:54,800
but even if you don't your genes are
 

6531
01:55:54,800 --> 01:55:56,229
but even if you don't your genes are
still permeating through

6532
01:55:56,229 --> 01:55:56,239
still permeating through
 

6533
01:55:56,239 --> 01:55:57,750
still permeating through
all of the layers of your family so your

6534
01:55:57,750 --> 01:55:57,760
all of the layers of your family so your
 

6535
01:55:57,760 --> 01:56:00,149
all of the layers of your family so your
genes will have the legacy there yeah or

6536
01:56:00,149 --> 01:56:00,159
genes will have the legacy there yeah or
 

6537
01:56:00,159 --> 01:56:01,830
genes will have the legacy there yeah or
every one of us

6538
01:56:01,830 --> 01:56:01,840
every one of us
 

6539
01:56:01,840 --> 01:56:04,310
every one of us
yeah number two our ideas are constantly

6540
01:56:04,310 --> 01:56:04,320
yeah number two our ideas are constantly
 

6541
01:56:04,320 --> 01:56:05,589
yeah number two our ideas are constantly
intermingling with each other

6542
01:56:05,589 --> 01:56:05,599
intermingling with each other
 

6543
01:56:05,599 --> 01:56:07,350
intermingling with each other
so there's no person living in the

6544
01:56:07,350 --> 01:56:07,360
so there's no person living in the
 

6545
01:56:07,360 --> 01:56:08,629
so there's no person living in the
planet

6546
01:56:08,629 --> 01:56:08,639
planet
 

6547
01:56:08,639 --> 01:56:10,550
planet
100 years from now who will not be

6548
01:56:10,550 --> 01:56:10,560
100 years from now who will not be
 

6549
01:56:10,560 --> 01:56:12,229
100 years from now who will not be
directly impacted by

6550
01:56:12,229 --> 01:56:12,239
directly impacted by
 

6551
01:56:12,239 --> 01:56:13,990
directly impacted by
everyone on the planet living here today

6552
01:56:13,990 --> 01:56:14,000
everyone on the planet living here today
 

6553
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:15,830
everyone on the planet living here today
yeah through genetic inheritance

6554
01:56:15,830 --> 01:56:15,840
yeah through genetic inheritance
 

6555
01:56:15,840 --> 01:56:18,790
yeah through genetic inheritance
and through meme inheritance that's cool

6556
01:56:18,790 --> 01:56:18,800
and through meme inheritance that's cool
 

6557
01:56:18,800 --> 01:56:20,390
and through meme inheritance that's cool
to think that your ideas

6558
01:56:20,390 --> 01:56:20,400
to think that your ideas
 

6559
01:56:20,400 --> 01:56:23,430
to think that your ideas
manolas callus would touch

01:56:26,950 --> 01:56:26,960
this planet
 

6565
01:56:26,960 --> 01:56:28,950
this planet
it's interesting but not just mine joe

his ideas
 

6571
01:56:31,760 --> 01:56:34,149
his ideas
will also touch everybody so there's

6572
01:56:34,149 --> 01:56:34,159
will also touch everybody so there's
 

6573
01:56:34,159 --> 01:56:37,030
will also touch everybody so there's
this interconnectedness of humanity

6574
01:56:37,030 --> 01:56:37,040
this interconnectedness of humanity
 

6575
01:56:37,040 --> 01:56:39,589
this interconnectedness of humanity
and and then i'm also a professor so my

just

6582
01:56:45,030 --> 01:56:45,040
just
 

6583
01:56:45,040 --> 01:56:46,550
just
the thousands of people who watch my

6584
01:56:46,550 --> 01:56:46,560
the thousands of people who watch my
 

6585
01:56:46,560 --> 01:56:48,790
the thousands of people who watch my
videos on the web but the people who are

01:56:48,790 --> 01:56:48,800
videos on the web but the people who are
 

6587
01:56:48,800 --> 01:56:50,870
videos on the web but the people who are
actually in my class who basically come

6588
01:56:50,870 --> 01:56:50,880
actually in my class who basically come
 

6589
01:56:50,880 --> 01:56:51,830
actually in my class who basically come
to mit to

6590
01:56:51,830 --> 01:56:51,840
to mit to
 

6591
01:56:51,840 --> 01:56:54,870
to mit to
learn from a bunch of us

6592
01:56:54,870 --> 01:56:54,880
learn from a bunch of us
 

6593
01:56:54,880 --> 01:56:56,629
learn from a bunch of us
like the cognitive systems that were

6594
01:56:56,629 --> 01:56:56,639
like the cognitive systems that were
 

6595
01:56:56,639 --> 01:56:58,950
like the cognitive systems that were
shipped to this particular location and

6596
01:56:58,950 --> 01:56:58,960
shipped to this particular location and
 

6597
01:56:58,960 --> 01:57:00,950
shipped to this particular location and
who will then disperse back into all of

6598
01:57:00,950 --> 01:57:00,960
who will then disperse back into all of
 

6599
01:57:00,960 --> 01:57:02,070
who will then disperse back into all of
their home countries

6600
01:57:02,070 --> 01:57:02,080
their home countries
 

6601
01:57:02,080 --> 01:57:03,589
their home countries
yeah that's that's what makes america

6602
01:57:03,589 --> 01:57:03,599
yeah that's that's what makes america
 

6603
01:57:03,599 --> 01:57:05,109
yeah that's that's what makes america
the beacon of the world

6604
01:57:05,109 --> 01:57:05,119
the beacon of the world
 

6605
01:57:05,119 --> 01:57:08,229
the beacon of the world
we don't just export you know

6606
01:57:08,229 --> 01:57:08,239
we don't just export you know
 

6607
01:57:08,239 --> 01:57:11,750
we don't just export you know
goods we export people cognitive systems

6608
01:57:11,750 --> 01:57:11,760
goods we export people cognitive systems
 

6609
01:57:11,760 --> 01:57:12,070
goods we export people cognitive systems
we

6610
01:57:12,070 --> 01:57:12,080
we
 

6611
01:57:12,080 --> 01:57:15,189
we
we export people who are born here

6612
01:57:15,189 --> 01:57:15,199
we export people who are born here
 

6613
01:57:15,199 --> 01:57:18,149
we export people who are born here
and we also export training that people

6614
01:57:18,149 --> 01:57:18,159
and we also export training that people
 

6615
01:57:18,159 --> 01:57:20,310
and we also export training that people
born elsewhere will come here to get

6616
01:57:20,310 --> 01:57:20,320
born elsewhere will come here to get
 

6617
01:57:20,320 --> 01:57:22,310
born elsewhere will come here to get
and will then disseminate not just

6618
01:57:22,310 --> 01:57:22,320
and will then disseminate not just
 

6619
01:57:22,320 --> 01:57:24,390
and will then disseminate not just
whatever knowledge they got but whatever

6620
01:57:24,390 --> 01:57:24,400
whatever knowledge they got but whatever
 

6621
01:57:24,400 --> 01:57:25,990
whatever knowledge they got but whatever
ideals they learned

6622
01:57:25,990 --> 01:57:26,000
ideals they learned
 

6623
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:27,270
ideals they learned
and i think that's something that's a

6624
01:57:27,270 --> 01:57:27,280
and i think that's something that's a
 

6625
01:57:27,280 --> 01:57:29,030
and i think that's something that's a
legacy of the us that

6626
01:57:29,030 --> 01:57:29,040
legacy of the us that
 

6627
01:57:29,040 --> 01:57:31,189
legacy of the us that
you cannot stop with political isolation

6628
01:57:31,189 --> 01:57:31,199
you cannot stop with political isolation
 

6629
01:57:31,199 --> 01:57:33,350
you cannot stop with political isolation
you cannot stop with economic isolation

6630
01:57:33,350 --> 01:57:33,360
you cannot stop with economic isolation
 

6631
01:57:33,360 --> 01:57:34,870
you cannot stop with economic isolation
that's something that will continue to

6632
01:57:34,870 --> 01:57:34,880
that's something that will continue to
 

6633
01:57:34,880 --> 01:57:36,550
that's something that will continue to
happen through all the people we've

6634
01:57:36,550 --> 01:57:36,560
happen through all the people we've
 

6635
01:57:36,560 --> 01:57:38,149
happen through all the people we've
touched through our universities

6636
01:57:38,149 --> 01:57:38,159
touched through our universities
 

6637
01:57:38,159 --> 01:57:39,910
touched through our universities
so there's the students who took my

6638
01:57:39,910 --> 01:57:39,920
so there's the students who took my
 

6639
01:57:39,920 --> 01:57:42,550
so there's the students who took my
classes who are basically now going off

6640
01:57:42,550 --> 01:57:42,560
classes who are basically now going off
 

6641
01:57:42,560 --> 01:57:44,070
classes who are basically now going off
and teaching their classes

6642
01:57:44,070 --> 01:57:44,080
and teaching their classes
 

6643
01:57:44,080 --> 01:57:45,430
and teaching their classes
and i've trained generations of

6644
01:57:45,430 --> 01:57:45,440
and i've trained generations of
 

6645
01:57:45,440 --> 01:57:46,709
and i've trained generations of
computational biologists no one in

6646
01:57:46,709 --> 01:57:46,719
computational biologists no one in
 

6647
01:57:46,719 --> 01:57:48,470
computational biologists no one in
genomics who's gone through mit

6648
01:57:48,470 --> 01:57:48,480
genomics who's gone through mit
 

6649
01:57:48,480 --> 01:57:50,390
genomics who's gone through mit
hasn't taken my class so basically

6650
01:57:50,390 --> 01:57:50,400
hasn't taken my class so basically
 

6651
01:57:50,400 --> 01:57:52,149
hasn't taken my class so basically
there's this impact

6652
01:57:52,149 --> 01:57:52,159
there's this impact
 

6653
01:57:52,159 --> 01:57:54,070
there's this impact
through i mean there's so many people in

6654
01:57:54,070 --> 01:57:54,080
through i mean there's so many people in
 

6655
01:57:54,080 --> 01:57:55,910
through i mean there's so many people in
biotech who are like hey i took your

6656
01:57:55,910 --> 01:57:55,920
biotech who are like hey i took your
 

6657
01:57:55,920 --> 01:57:57,189
biotech who are like hey i took your
class that's what got me into the field

6658
01:57:57,189 --> 01:57:57,199
class that's what got me into the field
 

6659
01:57:57,199 --> 01:57:57,589
class that's what got me into the field
like

6660
01:57:57,589 --> 01:57:57,599
like
 

6661
01:57:57,599 --> 01:58:00,070
like
15 years ago it's just so beautiful yes

6662
01:58:00,070 --> 01:58:00,080
15 years ago it's just so beautiful yes

creates now
 

6825
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:37,109
creates now
a legacy which is infinite because

6826
02:00:37,109 --> 02:00:37,119
a legacy which is infinite because
 

6827
02:00:37,119 --> 02:00:40,070
a legacy which is infinite because
they've now gone off on the you know and

6828
02:00:40,070 --> 02:00:40,080
they've now gone off on the you know and
 

6829
02:00:40,080 --> 02:00:42,149
they've now gone off on the you know and
all of that is just humanity

6830
02:00:42,149 --> 02:00:42,159
all of that is just humanity
 

6831
02:00:42,159 --> 02:00:44,950
all of that is just humanity
then of course it's the papers i write

6832
02:00:44,950 --> 02:00:44,960
then of course it's the papers i write
 

6833
02:00:44,960 --> 02:00:45,910
then of course it's the papers i write
because yes

6834
02:00:45,910 --> 02:00:45,920
because yes
 

6835
02:00:45,920 --> 02:00:48,470
because yes
my day job is training students but it's

6836
02:00:48,470 --> 02:00:48,480
my day job is training students but it's
 

6837
02:00:48,480 --> 02:00:50,229
my day job is training students but it's
a research university

6838
02:00:50,229 --> 02:00:50,239
a research university
 

6839
02:00:50,239 --> 02:00:52,709
a research university
the way that they learn is through the

6840
02:00:52,709 --> 02:00:52,719
the way that they learn is through the
 

6841
02:00:52,719 --> 02:00:54,390
the way that they learn is through the
men's and manus

6842
02:00:54,390 --> 02:00:54,400
men's and manus
 

6843
02:00:54,400 --> 02:00:57,030
men's and manus
mind and hand it's the practical

mind and hand it's the practical
 

6845
02:00:57,040 --> 02:00:59,189
mind and hand it's the practical
training of actually doing research

6846
02:00:59,189 --> 02:00:59,199
training of actually doing research
 

6847
02:00:59,199 --> 02:01:02,950
training of actually doing research
and that research is a beneficial side

6848
02:01:02,950 --> 02:01:02,960
and that research is a beneficial side
 

6849
02:01:02,960 --> 02:01:03,830
and that research is a beneficial side

now
 

6855
02:01:08,480 --> 02:01:10,950
now
tell other people how to think there's

6856
02:01:10,950 --> 02:01:10,960
tell other people how to think there's
 

6857
02:01:10,960 --> 02:01:12,470
tell other people how to think there's
this paper we just posted recently on

6858
02:01:12,470 --> 02:01:12,480
this paper we just posted recently on
 

6859
02:01:12,480 --> 02:01:14,629
this paper we just posted recently on
med archive and one of the most generous

6860
02:01:14,629 --> 02:01:14,639
med archive and one of the most generous
 

6861
02:01:14,639 --> 02:01:16,790
med archive and one of the most generous
and eloquent comments about it was like

6862
02:01:16,790 --> 02:01:16,800
and eloquent comments about it was like
 

6863
02:01:16,800 --> 02:01:19,270
and eloquent comments about it was like
wow this is a master class

6864
02:01:19,270 --> 02:01:19,280
wow this is a master class
 

6865
02:01:19,280 --> 02:01:22,629
wow this is a master class
in scientific writing in analysis

6866
02:01:22,629 --> 02:01:22,639
in scientific writing in analysis
 

6867
02:01:22,639 --> 02:01:24,550
in scientific writing in analysis
in biological interpretation and so so

6868
02:01:24,550 --> 02:01:24,560
in biological interpretation and so so
 

6869
02:01:24,560 --> 02:01:26,470
in biological interpretation and so so
forth it's just so fulfilling from a

6870
02:01:26,470 --> 02:01:26,480
forth it's just so fulfilling from a
 

6871
02:01:26,480 --> 02:01:28,149
forth it's just so fulfilling from a
person i've never met or first say the

6872
02:01:28,149 --> 02:01:28,159
person i've never met or first say the
 

6873
02:01:28,159 --> 02:01:30,629
person i've never met or first say the
title of the paper branch

6874
02:01:30,629 --> 02:01:30,639
title of the paper branch
 

6875
02:01:30,639 --> 02:01:32,070
title of the paper branch
i don't remember the title but it's

6876
02:01:32,070 --> 02:01:32,080
i don't remember the title but it's
 

6877
02:01:32,080 --> 02:01:35,510
i don't remember the title but it's
single cell dissection of schizophrenia

6878
02:01:35,510 --> 02:01:35,520
single cell dissection of schizophrenia
 

6879
02:01:35,520 --> 02:01:39,189
single cell dissection of schizophrenia
reveals and so the two the two points

6880
02:01:39,189 --> 02:01:39,199
reveals and so the two the two points
 

6881
02:01:39,199 --> 02:01:40,950
reveals and so the two the two points
that we found was this whole

6882
02:01:40,950 --> 02:01:40,960
that we found was this whole
 

6883
02:01:40,960 --> 02:01:43,109
that we found was this whole
transcriptional resilience like there's

6884
02:01:43,109 --> 02:01:43,119
transcriptional resilience like there's
 

6885
02:01:43,119 --> 02:01:44,470
transcriptional resilience like there's
some individuals

6886
02:01:44,470 --> 02:01:44,480
some individuals
 

6887
02:01:44,480 --> 02:01:48,550
some individuals
who are schizophrenic but whose

6888
02:01:48,550 --> 02:01:48,560
who are schizophrenic but whose
 

6889
02:01:48,560 --> 02:01:50,070
who are schizophrenic but whose
they have an additional cell type or

6890
02:01:50,070 --> 02:01:50,080
they have an additional cell type or
 

6891
02:01:50,080 --> 02:01:52,149
they have an additional cell type or
initial cell state which we believe is

6892
02:01:52,149 --> 02:01:52,159
initial cell state which we believe is
 

6893
02:01:52,159 --> 02:01:53,510
initial cell state which we believe is
protective

6894
02:01:53,510 --> 02:01:53,520
protective
 

6895
02:01:53,520 --> 02:01:55,589
protective
and that cell state when they have it

6896
02:01:55,589 --> 02:01:55,599
and that cell state when they have it
 

6897
02:01:55,599 --> 02:01:57,350
and that cell state when they have it
will cause other cells to have normal

6898
02:01:57,350 --> 02:01:57,360
will cause other cells to have normal
 

6899
02:01:57,360 --> 02:01:58,790
will cause other cells to have normal
gene expression patterns

6900
02:01:58,790 --> 02:01:58,800
gene expression patterns
 

6901
02:01:58,800 --> 02:02:01,830
gene expression patterns
it's beautiful yeah and then that's that

6902
02:02:01,830 --> 02:02:01,840
it's beautiful yeah and then that's that
 

6903
02:02:01,840 --> 02:02:02,550
it's beautiful yeah and then that's that
cell

6904
02:02:02,550 --> 02:02:02,560
cell
 

6905
02:02:02,560 --> 02:02:05,350
cell
is connected with some of the pv

6906
02:02:05,350 --> 02:02:05,360
is connected with some of the pv
 

6907
02:02:05,360 --> 02:02:07,030
is connected with some of the pv
interneurons that are basically sending

6908
02:02:07,030 --> 02:02:07,040
interneurons that are basically sending
 

6909
02:02:07,040 --> 02:02:07,589
interneurons that are basically sending
these

6910
02:02:07,589 --> 02:02:07,599
these
 

6911
02:02:07,599 --> 02:02:10,790
these
inhibitory brain waves through the brain

6912
02:02:10,790 --> 02:02:10,800
inhibitory brain waves through the brain
 

6913
02:02:10,800 --> 02:02:13,109
inhibitory brain waves through the brain
and there basically there's a there's

6914
02:02:13,109 --> 02:02:13,119
and there basically there's a there's
 

6915
02:02:13,119 --> 02:02:14,950
and there basically there's a there's
another component of

6916
02:02:14,950 --> 02:02:14,960
another component of
 

6917
02:02:14,960 --> 02:02:17,109
another component of
there's a set of master regulators that

6918
02:02:17,109 --> 02:02:17,119
there's a set of master regulators that
 

6919
02:02:17,119 --> 02:02:18,390
there's a set of master regulators that
we discovered

6920
02:02:18,390 --> 02:02:18,400
we discovered
 

6921
02:02:18,400 --> 02:02:20,629
we discovered
who are controlling many of the genes

6922
02:02:20,629 --> 02:02:20,639
who are controlling many of the genes
 

6923
02:02:20,639 --> 02:02:22,470
who are controlling many of the genes
that are differentially expressed

6924
02:02:22,470 --> 02:02:22,480
that are differentially expressed
 

6925
02:02:22,480 --> 02:02:23,830
that are differentially expressed
and these master regulators are

6926
02:02:23,830 --> 02:02:23,840
and these master regulators are
 

6927
02:02:23,840 --> 02:02:25,510
and these master regulators are
themselves genetic targets

6928
02:02:25,510 --> 02:02:25,520
themselves genetic targets
 

6929
02:02:25,520 --> 02:02:28,149
themselves genetic targets
of schizophrenia and they are themselves

6930
02:02:28,149 --> 02:02:28,159
of schizophrenia and they are themselves
 

6931
02:02:28,159 --> 02:02:29,270
of schizophrenia and they are themselves
involved in both

6932
02:02:29,270 --> 02:02:29,280
involved in both
 

6933
02:02:29,280 --> 02:02:33,109
involved in both
synaptic connectivity and also in early

6934
02:02:33,109 --> 02:02:33,119
synaptic connectivity and also in early
 

6935
02:02:33,119 --> 02:02:35,669
synaptic connectivity and also in early
brain development so there's this sort

6936
02:02:35,669 --> 02:02:35,679
brain development so there's this sort
 

6937
02:02:35,679 --> 02:02:37,589
brain development so there's this sort
of interconnectedness between

6938
02:02:37,589 --> 02:02:37,599
of interconnectedness between
 

6939
02:02:37,599 --> 02:02:40,629
of interconnectedness between
synaptic development axes and also this

6940
02:02:40,629 --> 02:02:40,639
synaptic development axes and also this
 

6941
02:02:40,639 --> 02:02:41,830
synaptic development axes and also this
transcription resilience so

6942
02:02:41,830 --> 02:02:41,840
transcription resilience so
 

6943
02:02:41,840 --> 02:02:43,109
transcription resilience so
i mean we basically made up a title that

6944
02:02:43,109 --> 02:02:43,119
i mean we basically made up a title that
 

6945
02:02:43,119 --> 02:02:45,109
i mean we basically made up a title that
combines all these concepts you have all

6946
02:02:45,109 --> 02:02:45,119
combines all these concepts you have all
 

6947
02:02:45,119 --> 02:02:45,990
combines all these concepts you have all
these concepts all these

6948
02:02:45,990 --> 02:02:46,000
these concepts all these
 

6949
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:47,669
these concepts all these
people working together and ultimately

6950
02:02:47,669 --> 02:02:47,679
people working together and ultimately
 

6951
02:02:47,679 --> 02:02:49,830
people working together and ultimately
these minds condense it down into a

6952
02:02:49,830 --> 02:02:49,840
these minds condense it down into a
 

6953
02:02:49,840 --> 02:02:50,390
these minds condense it down into a
beautifully

6954
02:02:50,390 --> 02:02:50,400
beautifully
 

6955
02:02:50,400 --> 02:02:52,550
beautifully
exactly little document that lives on

6956
02:02:52,550 --> 02:02:52,560
exactly little document that lives on
 

6957
02:02:52,560 --> 02:02:54,629
exactly little document that lives on
and that document now has its own life

6958
02:02:54,629 --> 02:02:54,639
and that document now has its own life
 

6959
02:02:54,639 --> 02:02:57,030
and that document now has its own life
yeah our work has a hundred and a

6960
02:02:57,030 --> 02:02:57,040
yeah our work has a hundred and a
 

6961
02:02:57,040 --> 02:02:59,910
yeah our work has a hundred and a
hundred and twenty thousand citations i

6962
02:02:59,910 --> 02:02:59,920
hundred and twenty thousand citations i
 

6963
02:02:59,920 --> 02:03:00,310
hundred and twenty thousand citations i
mean

6964
02:03:00,310 --> 02:03:00,320
mean
 

6965
02:03:00,320 --> 02:03:02,229
mean
that's not just people who read it these

6966
02:03:02,229 --> 02:03:02,239
that's not just people who read it these
 

6967
02:03:02,239 --> 02:03:03,669
that's not just people who read it these
are people who used it

6968
02:03:03,669 --> 02:03:03,679
are people who used it
 

6969
02:03:03,679 --> 02:03:05,750
are people who used it
to write something based on it yeah i

6970
02:03:05,750 --> 02:03:05,760
to write something based on it yeah i
 

6971
02:03:05,760 --> 02:03:07,270
to write something based on it yeah i
mean that to me

6972
02:03:07,270 --> 02:03:07,280
mean that to me
 

6973
02:03:07,280 --> 02:03:10,470
mean that to me
is is just so fulfilling

6974
02:03:10,470 --> 02:03:10,480
is is just so fulfilling
 

6975
02:03:10,480 --> 02:03:12,950
is is just so fulfilling
to basically say wow i've touched people

6976
02:03:12,950 --> 02:03:12,960
to basically say wow i've touched people
 

6977
02:03:12,960 --> 02:03:14,870
to basically say wow i've touched people
so

6978
02:03:14,870 --> 02:03:14,880
so
 

6979
02:03:14,880 --> 02:03:17,270
so
i i don't think of my legacy as i live

6980
02:03:17,270 --> 02:03:17,280
i i don't think of my legacy as i live
 

6981
02:03:17,280 --> 02:03:18,950
i i don't think of my legacy as i live
every day i just think of the beauty of

6982
02:03:18,950 --> 02:03:18,960
every day i just think of the beauty of
 

6983
02:03:18,960 --> 02:03:20,229
every day i just think of the beauty of
the present

6984
02:03:20,229 --> 02:03:20,239
the present
 

6985
02:03:20,239 --> 02:03:22,550
the present
and the power of interconnectedness and

6986
02:03:22,550 --> 02:03:22,560
and the power of interconnectedness and
 

6987
02:03:22,560 --> 02:03:24,950
