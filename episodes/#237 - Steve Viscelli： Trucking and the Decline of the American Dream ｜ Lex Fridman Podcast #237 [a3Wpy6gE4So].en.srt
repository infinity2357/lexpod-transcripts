yeah
i i think

344
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:56,240
i i think
 

345
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,150
i i think
it's it doesn't happen in the moment

346
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:58,160
it's it doesn't happen in the moment
 

347
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,189
it's it doesn't happen in the moment
right so

00:05:59,189 --> 00:05:59,199
right so
 

349
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:00,390
right so
i

350
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:00,400

i'm a ruminator you know i i just sit
 

353
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,629
i'm a ruminator you know i i just sit
with the data

354
00:06:04,629 --> 00:06:04,639
with the data
 

355
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:07,110
with the data
you know for years i i sat with the

356
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:07,120
you know for years i i sat with the
 

357
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,230
you know for years i i sat with the
trucking data for almost 10 full years

358
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:10,240
trucking data for almost 10 full years
 

359
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,150
trucking data for almost 10 full years
and just thought it thought about the

360
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:12,160
and just thought it thought about the
 

361
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,830
and just thought it thought about the
problems and the questions

362
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:13,840
problems and the questions
 

363
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,790
problems and the questions
using everything that i possibly could

364
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:16,800
using everything that i possibly could
 

365
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,110
using everything that i possibly could
and so in the moment you know my ideal

366
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:19,120
and so in the moment you know my ideal
 

367
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,469
and so in the moment you know my ideal
interview is

00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:31,360
never
 

381
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,550
never
works out that way because they don't

382
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:32,560
works out that way because they don't
 

383
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,550
works out that way because they don't
know what you're interested in right and

384
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:34,560
know what you're interested in right and
 

385
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,510
know what you're interested in right and
so it's um a lot of it is the

386
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:37,520
so it's um a lot of it is the
 

387
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,270
so it's um a lot of it is the
as you know as a i think you're a great

388
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:39,280
as you know as a i think you're a great
 

389

truck drivers um at this point and
i i should really go back and read the

408
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:00,560
i i should really go back and read the
 

409
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,309
i i should really go back and read the
original ones they're probably terrible

410
00:07:02,309 --> 00:07:02,319
original ones they're probably terrible
 

411
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:03,909
original ones they're probably terrible
what's the process like you're sitting

412
00:07:03,909 --> 00:07:03,919
what's the process like you're sitting
 

413
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:05,670
what's the process like you're sitting
down do you have an audio recorder and

414
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:05,680
down do you have an audio recorder and

i just happen to have a sort of
natural place to go that gave me

430
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:21,680
natural place to go that gave me
 

431
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,430
natural place to go that gave me
essentially the population that i was

432
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:23,440
essentially the population that i was
 

433
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,350
essentially the population that i was
interested in you know so all these

434
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:25,360
interested in you know so all these
 

435
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,029
interested in you know so all these
long-haul truck drivers that i i was

436
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:27,039
long-haul truck drivers that i i was
 

437
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:28,790
long-haul truck drivers that i i was
interested in they have to stop and get

00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:57,030
people think about it it's this big huge
vehicle right it's it's really long it's

822
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:57,040
vehicle right it's it's really long it's
 

823
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,389
vehicle right it's it's really long it's
70 feet long it can weigh 80 000 pounds

824
00:14:00,389 --> 00:14:00,399
70 feet long it can weigh 80 000 pounds
 

825
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:02,629
70 feet long it can weigh 80 000 pounds
you know it does not stop like a car it

826
00:14:02,629 --> 00:14:02,639
you know it does not stop like a car it
 

827
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:05,829
you know it does not stop like a car it
does not turn like a car um

828
00:14:05,829 --> 00:14:05,839
does not turn like a car um
 

829
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:07,910
does not turn like a car um
but at least when i

830
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:07,920
but at least when i
 

831
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,389
but at least when i
started um and this this is changing

832
00:14:10,389 --> 00:14:10,399
started um and this this is changing
 

833
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:11,829
started um and this this is changing
it's part of the technology story of

834
00:14:11,829 --> 00:14:11,839
it's part of the technology story of
 

835
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:12,949
it's part of the technology story of
trucking

836
00:14:12,949 --> 00:14:12,959
trucking
 

837
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:14,150
trucking
the first thing you had to do was learn

838
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:14,160
the first thing you had to do was learn
 

839
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,670
the first thing you had to do was learn
how to shift it

840
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:15,680
how to shift it
 

841
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,389
how to shift it
and

842
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:16,399
and
 

843
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:17,750
and
it doesn't shift

844
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:17,760
it doesn't shift
 

845
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,230
it doesn't shift
like a manual car the clutch isn't

846
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:20,240
like a manual car the clutch isn't
 

847
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,230
like a manual car the clutch isn't
synchronized so you have to do what's

848
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:22,240
synchronized so you have to do what's
 

849
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,829
synchronized so you have to do what's
called double clutch

850
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:23,839
called double clutch
 

851
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:26,230
called double clutch
and it's it's basically the foundational

852
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:26,240
and it's it's basically the foundational
 

853
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,069
and it's it's basically the foundational
skill that a truck driver used to have

854
00:14:28,069 --> 00:14:28,079
skill that a truck driver used to have
 

855
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:29,350
skill that a truck driver used to have
to learn

856
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:29,360
to learn
 

857
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,069
to learn
so you would you know accelerate say

858
00:14:32,069 --> 00:14:32,079
so you would you know accelerate say
 

859
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:33,430
so you would you know accelerate say
you're in first gear

860
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:33,440
you're in first gear
 

861
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,509
you're in first gear
you push in the clutch you pull the

862
00:14:35,509 --> 00:14:35,519
you push in the clutch you pull the
 

863
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,910
you push in the clutch you pull the
shifter out of first gear you let the

864
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:37,920
shifter out of first gear you let the
 

865
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,430
shifter out of first gear you let the
clutch out and then you let the rpms of

866
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:41,440
clutch out and then you let the rpms of
 

867
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,790
clutch out and then you let the rpms of
the engine drop

868
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:42,800
the engine drop
 

869
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,269
the engine drop
an exact amount then you put push the

870
00:14:45,269 --> 00:14:45,279
an exact amount then you put push the
 

871
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:47,269
an exact amount then you put push the
clutch back in and you put it in second

872
00:14:47,269 --> 00:14:47,279
clutch back in and you put it in second
 

873
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:48,150
clutch back in and you put it in second
gear

874
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:48,160
gear
 

875
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,030
gear
if your timing is off those gears aren't

876
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:51,040
if your timing is off those gears aren't
 

877
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,189
if your timing is off those gears aren't
going to go together and so

878
00:14:53,189 --> 00:14:53,199
going to go together and so
 

879
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:54,870
going to go together and so
if you're in an intersection you're just

880
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:54,880
if you're in an intersection you're just
 

881
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,629
if you're in an intersection you're just
going to get this horrible grinding

882
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:56,639
going to get this horrible grinding
 

883
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:59,670
going to get this horrible grinding
sound as you coast you know to a dead

884
00:14:59,670 --> 00:14:59,680
sound as you coast you know to a dead
 

885
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,430
sound as you coast you know to a dead
stop in the you know underneath the

886
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:01,440
stop in the you know underneath the
 

887
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,750
stop in the you know underneath the
stoplight or whatever it is so the first

888
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:03,760
stoplight or whatever it is so the first
 

889
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,430
stoplight or whatever it is so the first
thing you have to do is learn to shift

890
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:05,440
thing you have to do is learn to shift
 

891
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,269
thing you have to do is learn to shift
it and so

892
00:15:07,269 --> 00:15:07,279
it and so
 

893
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:09,509
it and so
at least for me and a lot of drivers who

894
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:09,519
at least for me and a lot of drivers who
 

895
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:10,629
at least for me and a lot of drivers who
are going to

896
00:15:10,629 --> 00:15:10,639
are going to
 

897
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:12,230
are going to
private companies cdl schools what

898
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:12,240
private companies cdl schools what
 

899
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,470
private companies cdl schools what
happens is it's kind of like a boot camp

900
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:14,480
happens is it's kind of like a boot camp
 

901
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,430
happens is it's kind of like a boot camp
they ship me three states away from home

902
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:17,440
they ship me three states away from home
 

903
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,750

send you a bus ticket and say hey we'll

904
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:19,760
send you a bus ticket and say hey we'll
 

905
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,990
send you a bus ticket and say hey we'll
put you up for two weeks you sit in a

906
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:22,000
put you up for two weeks you sit in a
 

907
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,829
put you up for two weeks you sit in a
classroom you sort of learn the theory

908
00:15:23,829 --> 00:15:23,839
classroom you sort of learn the theory
 

909
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,110
classroom you sort of learn the theory
of shifting

910
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:25,120
of shifting
 

911
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,269
of shifting
the you know theory of kind of how you

912
00:15:27,269 --> 00:15:27,279
the you know theory of kind of how you
 

913
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:29,350
the you know theory of kind of how you
fill out your logbook

914
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:29,360
fill out your logbook
 

915
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,870
fill out your logbook
rules of the road

916
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:30,880
rules of the road
 

917
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,470
rules of the road
you know you do that maybe half the day

918
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:32,480
you know you do that maybe half the day
 

919
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,910
you know you do that maybe half the day
and then the other half you're in this

920
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:33,920
and then the other half you're in this
 

921
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,310
and then the other half you're in this
giant parking lot with one of these old

922
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:36,320
giant parking lot with one of these old
 

923
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,710
giant parking lot with one of these old
trucks and just like you know destroying

924
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:38,720
trucks and just like you know destroying
 

925
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,030
trucks and just like you know destroying
what's left of the thing you know just

926
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:41,040
what's left of the thing you know just
 

927
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,430
what's left of the thing you know just
and it's lurching and belching smoke and

928
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:43,440
and it's lurching and belching smoke and
 

929
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,430
and it's lurching and belching smoke and
just making horrible noises and like

930
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:45,440
just making horrible noises and like
 

931
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,870
just making horrible noises and like
rattling i mean in these things like

932
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:46,880
rattling i mean in these things like
 

933
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,310
rattling i mean in these things like
there's a lot of torque

934
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:48,320
there's a lot of torque
 

935
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,470
there's a lot of torque
and so if you do manage to get it into

936
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:50,480
and so if you do manage to get it into
 

937
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,470
and so if you do manage to get it into
gear but the engine's lugging i mean it

938
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:52,480
gear but the engine's lugging i mean it
 

939
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,150
gear but the engine's lugging i mean it
can throw you right out of the seat

940
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:54,160
can throw you right out of the seat
 

941
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,670
can throw you right out of the seat
right so it's this it's like you know

942
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:55,680
right so it's this it's like you know
 

943
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,230
right so it's this it's like you know
this bull you're trying to ride and it's

944
00:15:58,230 --> 00:15:58,240
this bull you're trying to ride and it's
 

945
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,870
this bull you're trying to ride and it's
super intimidating um and the thing

946
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:00,880
super intimidating um and the thing
 

947
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,910
super intimidating um and the thing
about it is that for everybody there

948
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:03,920
about it is that for everybody there
 

949
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:04,710
about it is that for everybody there
it's

950
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:04,720
it's
 

951
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,310
it's
almost everybody there it's super high

952
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:06,320
almost everybody there it's super high
 

953
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,509
almost everybody there it's super high
stakes

954
00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:07,519
stakes
 

955
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:10,310
stakes
so trucking has become a job of last

956
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:10,320
so trucking has become a job of last
 

957
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,629
so trucking has become a job of last
resort for a lot of people

958
00:16:12,629 --> 00:16:12,639
resort for a lot of people
 

959
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,749
resort for a lot of people
and so they you know they lose a job

960
00:16:15,749 --> 00:16:15,759
and so they you know they lose a job
 

961
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:17,509
and so they you know they lose a job
in manufacturing they

962
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:17,519
in manufacturing they
 

963
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,749
in manufacturing they
they get too old to do construction any

964
00:16:19,749 --> 00:16:19,759
they get too old to do construction any
 

965
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:21,509
they get too old to do construction any
longer right the knees can no longer

966
00:16:21,509 --> 00:16:21,519
longer right the knees can no longer
 

967
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:23,829
longer right the knees can no longer
handle it um

968
00:16:23,829 --> 00:16:23,839
handle it um
 

969
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:25,430
handle it um
they get replaced by a machine their job

970
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:25,440
they get replaced by a machine their job
 

971
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,829
they get replaced by a machine their job
gets you know offshored and they end up

972
00:16:27,829 --> 00:16:27,839
gets you know offshored and they end up
 

973
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:29,430
gets you know offshored and they end up
going to trucking because

974
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:29,440
going to trucking because
 

975
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,629
going to trucking because
it's a place where they can maintain

976
00:16:30,629 --> 00:16:30,639
it's a place where they can maintain
 

977
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,710
it's a place where they can maintain
their income and so

978
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:32,720
their income and so
 

979
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,430
their income and so
it's super high stress like they've left

980
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:35,440

the truck is such an imposing part of a

1054
00:17:43,909 --> 00:17:43,919
the truck is such an imposing part of a

1063
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,830
mean the geometry of the problem is so
tricky

1064
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:53,840
tricky
 

1065
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,750
tricky
and so if you combine the fact that they

1066
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:55,760
and so if you combine the fact that they

frustration
 

1075
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,310
frustration
yeah and in that mode you have to then

1076
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:04,320
yeah and in that mode you have to then
 

1077
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,669
yeah and in that mode you have to then
shift gears

1078
00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:05,679
shift gears
 

1079
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:08,950
shift gears

1139
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,430
of experience um was
a it was a giant gulf between us and

1140
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:13,440
a it was a giant gulf between us and
 

1141
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,230
a it was a giant gulf between us and
between that and the really skilled

1142
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:16,240
between that and the really skilled
 

1143
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,070
between that and the really skilled
drivers who've been doing it for 20

1144
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:18,080
drivers who've been doing it for 20
 

1145
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,470
drivers who've been doing it for 20
years um you know is still another step

1146
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:20,480
years um you know is still another step
 

1147
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,549
years um you know is still another step
beyond that so it is highly skilled

1148
00:19:22,549 --> 00:19:22,559
beyond that so it is highly skilled
 

1149
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:24,789
beyond that so it is highly skilled
would it be fair to break trucking into

1150
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:24,799
would it be fair to break trucking into
 

1151
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:27,510
would it be fair to break trucking into
the task of truck of driving a truck to

1152
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:27,520
the task of truck of driving a truck to
 

1153
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,350
the task of truck of driving a truck to
two categories one is like the local

1154
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:29,360
two categories one is like the local
 

1155
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,190
two categories one is like the local
stuff getting out of the parking lot

1156
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:31,200
stuff getting out of the parking lot
 

1157
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,510
stuff getting out of the parking lot
getting into getting into you know

1158
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:33,520
getting into getting into you know
 

1159
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,190
getting into getting into you know
driving down local streets and then

1160
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:35,200
driving down local streets and then
 

1161
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,270
driving down local streets and then
highway driving those two

1162
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:37,280
highway driving those two
 

1163
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,870
highway driving those two
those two tasks

1164
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:38,880
those two tasks
 

1165
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,789
those two tasks
what are the challenges associated with

1166
00:19:40,789 --> 00:19:40,799
what are the challenges associated with
 

1167
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:42,630
what are the challenges associated with
each task you kind of emphasize the

1168
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:42,640
each task you kind of emphasize the
 

1169
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,510
each task you kind of emphasize the
first one uh what about the actual like

1170
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:45,520
first one uh what about the actual like
 

1171
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,710
first one uh what about the actual like
long haul

1172
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:46,720
long haul
 

1173
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,430
long haul
highway driving yeah so i mean they are

1174
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:49,440
highway driving yeah so i mean they are
 

1175
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,549
highway driving yeah so i mean they are
very different right um and and the the

1176
00:19:52,549 --> 00:19:52,559
very different right um and and the the
 

1177
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:56,549
very different right um and and the the
key with the long-haul driving is really

1178
00:19:56,549 --> 00:19:56,559
key with the long-haul driving is really
 

1179
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:59,350
key with the long-haul driving is really
a set of um the way i i came to

1180
00:19:59,350 --> 00:19:59,360
a set of um the way i i came to
 

1181
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,789
a set of um the way i i came to
understand it was

1182
00:20:00,789 --> 00:20:00,799
understand it was
 

1183
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:04,470
understand it was
a set of habits right um we have a sense

1184
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:04,480
a set of habits right um we have a sense
 

1185
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,110
a set of habits right um we have a sense
of driving particularly men i think have

1186
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:07,120
of driving particularly men i think have
 

1187
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,870
of driving particularly men i think have
a sense of driving as like

1188
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:08,880
a sense of driving as like
 

1189
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,950
a sense of driving as like
being really skilled is like the goal

1190
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:10,960
being really skilled is like the goal
 

1191
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,630
being really skilled is like the goal
and you you can kind of maneuver

1192
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:12,640
and you you can kind of maneuver
 

1193
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,710
and you you can kind of maneuver
yourself out of in and out of tight

1194
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:14,720
yourself out of in and out of tight
 

1195
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,430
yourself out of in and out of tight
spaces with great speed and breaking and

1196
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:17,440
spaces with great speed and breaking and
 

1197
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:21,110
spaces with great speed and breaking and
acceleration you know um for a really

1198
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:21,120
acceleration you know um for a really
 

1199
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,270
acceleration you know um for a really
good truck driver it's about

1200
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:23,280
good truck driver it's about
 

1201
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,430

understanding traffic
and traffic patterns and making good

1204

and traffic patterns and making good
 

1205
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,350
and traffic patterns and making good
decisions so you never have to use those

1206
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:29,360
decisions so you never have to use those
 

1207
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,310
decisions so you never have to use those
skills

1208
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:30,320
skills
 

1209
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,190
skills
and the really good drivers

1210
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:33,200
and the really good drivers
 

1211
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,830
and the really good drivers
you know the the mantra is always leave

1212
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:35,840
you know the the mantra is always leave
 

1213
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,270
you know the the mantra is always leave
yourself an out

1214
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:37,280
yourself an out
 

1215
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,430
yourself an out

right so always have that safe place
 

1217
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,149
right so always have that safe place
that you can put that truck in case that

1218
00:20:42,149 --> 00:20:42,159
that you can put that truck in case that
 

1219
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:43,909
that you can put that truck in case that
four-wheeler in front of you who's

1220
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:43,919
four-wheeler in front of you who's
 

1221
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:45,909
four-wheeler in front of you who's
texting loses control

1222
00:20:45,909 --> 00:20:45,919
texting loses control
 

1223
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:48,549
texting loses control
um you know what are you going to do

1224
00:20:48,549 --> 00:20:48,559
um you know what are you going to do
 

1225
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:51,190
um you know what are you going to do
in that in that situation and

1226
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:51,200
in that in that situation and
 

1227
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:51,990
in that in that situation and
what

1228
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:52,000
what
 

1229
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,510
what
really good truck drivers do on the

1230
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:53,520
really good truck drivers do on the
 

1231
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,710
really good truck drivers do on the
highway

1232
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:54,720
highway
 

1233
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,029
highway
is they just keep themselves out of

1234
00:20:57,029 --> 00:20:57,039
is they just keep themselves out of
 

1235
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:59,350
is they just keep themselves out of
those situations entirely

1236
00:20:59,350 --> 00:20:59,360
those situations entirely
 

1237
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,390
those situations entirely
they see it they slow down they you know

1238
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:02,400
they see it they slow down they you know
 

1239
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,669
they see it they slow down they you know
they avoid it

1240
00:21:03,669 --> 00:21:03,679
they avoid it
 

1241
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,070
they avoid it
um and then the local driving is is

1242
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:06,080
um and then the local driving is is
 

1243
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,750
um and then the local driving is is
really something that takes just

1244
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:07,760
really something that takes just
 

1245
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,710
really something that takes just
practice and routine to learn you know

1246
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:10,720
practice and routine to learn you know
 

1247
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,430
practice and routine to learn you know
this quarter turn it feels like the back

1248
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:13,440
this quarter turn it feels like the back
 

1249
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,110
this quarter turn it feels like the back
of the truck sometimes is on sometimes

1250
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:15,120
of the truck sometimes is on sometimes
 

1251
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,549
of the truck sometimes is on sometimes
it's on delay when you're backing it up

1252
00:21:16,549 --> 00:21:16,559
it's on delay when you're backing it up
 

1253
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:17,590
it's on delay when you're backing it up
so it's like all right i'm going to do a

1254
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:17,600
so it's like all right i'm going to do a
 

1255
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,909
so it's like all right i'm going to do a
quarter turn of the wheel now

1256
00:21:19,909 --> 00:21:19,919
quarter turn of the wheel now
 

1257
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:22,230
quarter turn of the wheel now
and to get the effect that i want like

1258
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:22,240
and to get the effect that i want like
 

1259
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,710
and to get the effect that i want like
five seconds from now and where that

1260
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:24,720
five seconds from now and where that
 

1261
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,870
five seconds from now and where that
tail of that trailer is going to be and

1262
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:26,880
tail of that trailer is going to be and
 

1263
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,950
tail of that trailer is going to be and
there's just no i mean some people have

1264
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:28,960
there's just no i mean some people have
 

1265
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,789
there's just no i mean some people have
a natural talent for that you know

1266
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:30,799
a natural talent for that you know
 

1267
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:32,710
a natural talent for that you know
spatial visualization and kind of

1268
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:32,720
spatial visualization and kind of
 

1269
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,950
spatial visualization and kind of
calculating those angles and everything

1270
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:34,960
calculating those angles and everything
 

1271
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,750
calculating those angles and everything
but there's really no escaping the fact

1272
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:37,760
but there's really no escaping the fact
 

1273
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,830
but there's really no escaping the fact
that you've gotta just do it over and

1274
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:39,840
that you've gotta just do it over and
 

1275
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,270
that you've gotta just do it over and
over again before you're gonna learn how

1276
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:41,280
over again before you're gonna learn how
 

1277
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,789
over again before you're gonna learn how
to do it well

1278
00:21:42,789 --> 00:21:42,799
to do it well
 

1279
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:45,350
to do it well
do you mind sharing how much you were uh

1280
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:45,360
do you mind sharing how much you were uh
 

1281
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,510
do you mind sharing how much you were uh
getting paid how much you were making as

1282
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:47,520
getting paid how much you were making as
 

1283
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,669
getting paid how much you were making as
a truck driver in your time as a truck

1284
00:21:49,669 --> 00:21:49,679
a truck driver in your time as a truck
 

1285
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:52,950
a truck driver in your time as a truck
driver yeah i started out at 25 cents a

1286
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:52,960
driver yeah i started out at 25 cents a
 

1287
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:53,990
driver yeah i started out at 25 cents a
mile

1288
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:54,000
mile
 

1289
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,230
mile
uh and then i got bumped up to 26 cents

1290
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:56,240
uh and then i got bumped up to 26 cents
 

1291
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,950
uh and then i got bumped up to 26 cents
a mile so um

1292
00:21:58,950 --> 00:21:58,960
a mile so um
 

1293
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,710
a mile so um
we had a minimum

1294
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:00,720
we had a minimum
 

1295
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,870
we had a minimum
pay which was sort of a new

00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,470
pay which was sort of a new
pay scheme that the industry had started

1298
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:04,480
pay scheme that the industry had started
 

1299
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,830
pay scheme that the industry had started
to introduce

1300
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:05,840
to introduce
 

1301
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,750
to introduce
to you know because there's there's lots

1302
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:07,760
to you know because there's there's lots
 

1303
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,990
to you know because there's there's lots
of unpaid work and time

1304
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:10,000
of unpaid work and time
 

1305
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,990
of unpaid work and time
and so we had a minimum pay of 500 a

1306
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:12,000
and so we had a minimum pay of 500 a
 

1307
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,070
and so we had a minimum pay of 500 a
week that you would you would get if you

1308
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:14,080
week that you would you would get if you
 

1309
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,470
week that you would you would get if you
didn't drive enough miles to exceed that

1310
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:16,480
didn't drive enough miles to exceed that
 

1311
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,430
didn't drive enough miles to exceed that
um you get paid in sort of

1312
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:19,440
um you get paid in sort of
 

1313
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,270
um you get paid in sort of
so you get paid when you turn the bills

1314
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:21,280
so you get paid when you turn the bills
 

1315
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,110
so you get paid when you turn the bills
in which are which is the paperwork that

1316
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:23,120
in which are which is the paperwork that
 

1317
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,909
in which are which is the paperwork that
goes with the load so you know you have

1318
00:22:25,909 --> 00:22:25,919
goes with the load so you know you have
 

1319
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:28,390
goes with the load so you know you have
to get that back to your company and

1320
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:28,400
to get that back to your company and
 

1321
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,230
to get that back to your company and
then that's how they build a customer

1322
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:30,240
then that's how they build a customer
 

1323
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,990
then that's how they build a customer
and so you might get a bunch of those

1324
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:32,000
and so you might get a bunch of those
 

1325
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,390
and so you might get a bunch of those
bills that kind of bunch up in one week

1326
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:34,400
bills that kind of bunch up in one week
 

1327
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,950
bills that kind of bunch up in one week
so you know i might get a paycheck for

1328
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:36,960
so you know i might get a paycheck for
 

1329
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,750
so you know i might get a paycheck for
you know 1200 and i mean i was a poor

1330
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:39,760
you know 1200 and i mean i was a poor
 

1331
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,470
you know 1200 and i mean i was a poor
graduate student so this was real real

1332
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:42,480
graduate student so this was real real
 

1333
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,750
graduate student so this was real real
money to me um and so i i i had this

1334
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:45,760
money to me um and so i i i had this
 

1335
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,909
money to me um and so i i i had this
sort of natural incentive to you know

1336
00:22:47,909 --> 00:22:47,919
sort of natural incentive to you know
 

1337
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:51,270
sort of natural incentive to you know
earn a lot uh or to maximize my pay

1338
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:51,280
earn a lot uh or to maximize my pay
 

1339
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,590
earn a lot uh or to maximize my pay
some weeks were that minimum 500 very

1340
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:53,600
some weeks were that minimum 500 very
 

1341
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,470
some weeks were that minimum 500 very
few

1342
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:54,480
few
 

1343
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:58,149
few
and then some i'd get 1200 1300 bucks

1344
00:22:58,149 --> 00:22:58,159
and then some i'd get 1200 1300 bucks
 

1345
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:00,149
and then some i'd get 1200 1300 bucks
pay has gone up

1346
00:23:00,149 --> 00:23:00,159
pay has gone up
 

1347
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:02,070
pay has gone up
you know typical drivers now starting in

1348
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:02,080
you know typical drivers now starting in
 

1349
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,149
you know typical drivers now starting in
the 30s you know in the kind of job that

1350
00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:04,159
the 30s you know in the kind of job that
 

1351
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:07,270
the 30s you know in the kind of job that
i was in uh 30s you know cents per mile

1352
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:07,280
i was in uh 30s you know cents per mile
 

1353
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,870
i was in uh 30s you know cents per mile
30 to 35.

1354
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:08,880
30 to 35.
 

1355
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,350
30 to 35.
so can we can we try to reverse engineer

1356
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:11,360
so can we can we try to reverse engineer
 

1357
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,390
so can we can we try to reverse engineer
that math how that maps the actual hours

1358
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:14,400
that math how that maps the actual hours
 

1359
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,390
that math how that maps the actual hours
so there's the hours connected to

1360
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:16,400
so there's the hours connected to
 

1361
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,909
so there's the hours connected to
driving are so

1362
00:23:17,909 --> 00:23:17,919
driving are so
 

1363
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:19,750
driving are so
widely dispersed as you said some of

1364
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:19,760
widely dispersed as you said some of
 

1365
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,669
widely dispersed as you said some of
them don't count as actual work some of

1366
00:23:21,669 --> 00:23:21,679
them don't count as actual work some of
 

1367
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:23,590
them don't count as actual work some of
it does that's a very interesting

1368
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:23,600
it does that's a very interesting
 

1369
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,590
it does that's a very interesting
discussion that we'll then continue when

1370
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:25,600
discussion that we'll then continue when
 

1371
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,870
discussion that we'll then continue when
we start talking about autonomous

1372
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:26,880
we start talking about autonomous
 

1373
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:27,909
we start talking about autonomous
trucking

1374
00:23:27,909 --> 00:23:27,919
trucking
 

1375
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:29,110
trucking
but uh

1376
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:29,120
but uh
 

1377
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,549
but uh
you know you're saying all these cents

1378
00:23:30,549 --> 00:23:30,559
you know you're saying all these cents
 

1379
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:32,789
you know you're saying all these cents
per mile kind of thing what

1380
00:23:32,789 --> 00:23:32,799
per mile kind of thing what
 

1381
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:35,669
per mile kind of thing what
uh how does that map to like hourly

1382
00:23:35,669 --> 00:23:35,679
uh how does that map to like hourly
 

1383
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:37,990
uh how does that map to like hourly
average hourly wage

1384
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:38,000
average hourly wage
 

1385
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,950
average hourly wage
yeah so i mean and this is kind of the

1386
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:40,960
yeah so i mean and this is kind of the
 

1387
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,110
yeah so i mean and this is kind of the
this is also an interesting technology

1388
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:43,120
this is also an interesting technology
 

1389
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,950
this is also an interesting technology
story in the end and it's the technology

1390
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:44,960
story in the end and it's the technology
 

1391
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,830
story in the end and it's the technology
story that didn't happen um so pay per

1392
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:47,840
story that didn't happen um so pay per
 

1393
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,549
story that didn't happen um so pay per
mile was you know invented by companies

1394
00:23:50,549 --> 00:23:50,559
mile was you know invented by companies
 

1395
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:52,470
mile was you know invented by companies
when you couldn't surveil drivers you

1396
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:52,480
when you couldn't surveil drivers you
 

1397
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,510
when you couldn't surveil drivers you
didn't know what they were doing right

1398
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:53,520
didn't know what they were doing right
 

1399
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,950
didn't know what they were doing right
and you wanted them to have some skin in

1400
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:54,960
and you wanted them to have some skin in
 

1401
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:55,909
and you wanted them to have some skin in
the game

1402
00:23:55,909 --> 00:23:55,919
the game
 

1403
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:57,830
the game
and so you'd say you know here's the

1404
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:57,840
and so you'd say you know here's the
 

1405
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,669
and so you'd say you know here's the
load it's going from

1406
00:23:59,669 --> 00:23:59,679
load it's going from
 

1407
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:02,070
load it's going from
you know for me i might start in you

1408
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:02,080
you know for me i might start in you
 

1409
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,990
you know for me i might start in you
know the northeast maybe in upstate new

1410
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:04,000
know the northeast maybe in upstate new
 

1411
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,510
know the northeast maybe in upstate new
york with a load of beer

1412
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:05,520
york with a load of beer
 

1413
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,590
york with a load of beer
and say here's this load of beer bring

1414
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:07,600
and say here's this load of beer bring
 

1415
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,430
and say here's this load of beer bring
it to this address in michigan we're

1416
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:09,440
it to this address in michigan we're
 

1417
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,510
it to this address in michigan we're
going to pay you by the mile right if i

1418
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:11,520
going to pay you by the mile right if i
 

1419
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,350
going to pay you by the mile right if i
was being paid by the hour i might just

1420
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:13,360
was being paid by the hour i might just
 

1421
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,350
was being paid by the hour i might just
pull over at the diner and have

1422
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:15,360
pull over at the diner and have
 

1423
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,390
pull over at the diner and have
breakfast

1424
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:16,400
breakfast
 

1425
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,110
breakfast
so

1426
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:17,120
so
 

1427
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,350
so
you're paid by the mile uh but

1428
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:19,360
you're paid by the mile uh but
 

1429
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,269
you're paid by the mile uh but
increasingly

1430
00:24:21,269 --> 00:24:21,279
increasingly
 

1431
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:22,470
increasingly
over time

1432
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:22,480
over time
 

1433
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,669
over time
the

1434
00:24:23,669 --> 00:24:23,679
the
 

1435
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:25,909
the
the typical driver is spending more and

1436
00:24:25,909 --> 00:24:25,919
the typical driver is spending more and
 

1437
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:28,470
the typical driver is spending more and
more time doing non-driving tasks lots

1438
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:28,480
more time doing non-driving tasks lots
 

1439
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,149
more time doing non-driving tasks lots
of reasons for that

1440
00:24:30,149 --> 00:24:30,159
of reasons for that
 

1441
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:32,470
of reasons for that
one of which is railroads captured a lot

1442
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:32,480
one of which is railroads captured a lot
 

1443
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,390
one of which is railroads captured a lot
of freight that goes long distances now

1444
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:34,400
of freight that goes long distances now
 

1445
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,990
of freight that goes long distances now
another one is traffic congest

1446
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:36,000
another one is traffic congest
 

1447
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,070
another one is traffic congest
congestion um and the other one is that

1448
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:38,080
congestion um and the other one is that
 

1449
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,909
congestion um and the other one is that
drivers are pretty cheap and they're

1450
00:24:39,909 --> 00:24:39,919
drivers are pretty cheap and they're
 

1451
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:41,909
drivers are pretty cheap and they're
they're almost always the low people on

1452
00:24:41,909 --> 00:24:41,919
they're almost always the low people on
 

1453
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:44,310
they're almost always the low people on
the totem pole in some segments

1454
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:44,320
the totem pole in some segments
 

1455
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,549
the totem pole in some segments
and so their time is used really

1456
00:24:46,549 --> 00:24:46,559
and so their time is used really
 

1457
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:50,230
and so their time is used really
inefficiently um so i might go to that

1458
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:50,240
inefficiently um so i might go to that
 

1459
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,430
inefficiently um so i might go to that

know what's happening in the truck
 

1481
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,070
know what's happening in the truck
sometimes they're loading it with a

1482
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:12,080
sometimes they're loading it with a
 

1483
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,230
sometimes they're loading it with a
forklift maybe they're throwing 14

1487
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,990

sometimes it'll take them hours

1488
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:18,000
sometimes it'll take them hours
 

1489
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,269
sometimes it'll take them hours
you know and you're sitting in that

1490
00:25:19,269 --> 00:25:19,279
you know and you're sitting in that
 

1491
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:21,510
you know and you're sitting in that
truck and you're you're essentially

you know
 

1497
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:26,070
you know
then you pull out you've got control

1498
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:26,080
then you pull out you've got control
 

1499
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,070
then you pull out you've got control
over what you're gonna get paid based on

1500
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:28,080
over what you're gonna get paid based on
 

1501
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,070
over what you're gonna get paid based on
how you drive that load um and then on

1502
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:30,080
how you drive that load um and then on
 

1503
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,269
how you drive that load um and then on
the other end

1504
00:25:31,269 --> 00:25:31,279
the other end
 

1505
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:33,190
the other end
you got a similar situation of kind of

1506
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:33,200
you got a similar situation of kind of
 

1507
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,750
you got a similar situation of kind of
waiting so so if that's the way truck

1508
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:35,760
waiting so so if that's the way truck
 

1509
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,990
waiting so so if that's the way truck
drivers are paid then there's a low

1510
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:38,000
drivers are paid then there's a low
 

1511
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,549
drivers are paid then there's a low
incentive for the optimization of the

1512
00:25:40,549 --> 00:25:40,559
incentive for the optimization of the
 

1513
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:42,950
incentive for the optimization of the
supply chain to make them more efficient

1514
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:42,960
supply chain to make them more efficient
 

1515
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,750
supply chain to make them more efficient
right to uh to utilize truck labor more

1516
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:45,760
right to uh to utilize truck labor more
 

1517
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,870
right to uh to utilize truck labor more
efficiently

1518
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:46,880
efficiently
 

1519
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,909
efficiently
absolutely

1520
00:25:47,909 --> 00:25:47,919
absolutely
 

1521
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:50,630
absolutely
and so that's the technology uh problem

1522
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:50,640
and so that's the technology uh problem
 

1523
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,029
and so that's the technology uh problem
that uh one of several technology

1524
00:25:53,029 --> 00:25:53,039
that uh one of several technology
 

1525
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:54,830
that uh one of several technology
problems that could be

1526
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:54,840
problems that could be
 

1527
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,190
problems that could be
addressed um

1528
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:57,200
addressed um
 

1529
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,470
addressed um
i mean

1530
00:25:58,470 --> 00:25:58,480
i mean
 

1531
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,630
i mean
what so what did uh

1532
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:00,640
what so what did uh
 

1533
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,549
what so what did uh
if we just linger on it what are we

1534
00:26:02,549 --> 00:26:02,559
if we just linger on it what are we
 

1535
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:04,470
if we just linger on it what are we
talking about in terms of

1536
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:04,480
talking about in terms of
 

1537
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,350
talking about in terms of
uh dollars per hour is it close to

1538
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:07,360
uh dollars per hour is it close to
 

1539
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,510
uh dollars per hour is it close to
minimum wage is it you know there's

1540
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:09,520
minimum wage is it you know there's
 

1541
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,070
minimum wage is it you know there's
something you talk about there was a

1542
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:12,080
something you talk about there was a
 

1543
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,110
something you talk about there was a
uh

1544
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:13,120
uh
 

1545
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,909
uh
a conception or a misconception

1546
00:26:15,909 --> 00:26:15,919
a conception or a misconception
 

1547
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:18,470
a conception or a misconception
that uh truckers get paid a lot

1548
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:18,480
that uh truckers get paid a lot
 

1549
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,549
that uh truckers get paid a lot
for their work do they get paid a lot

1550
00:26:20,549 --> 00:26:20,559
for their work do they get paid a lot
 

1551
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:21,669
for their work do they get paid a lot
for their work

1552
00:26:21,669 --> 00:26:21,679
for their work
 

1553
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:22,789
for their work
some do

1554
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:22,799
some do
 

1555
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:24,870
some do
uh and i think that's

1556
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:24,880
uh and i think that's
 

1557
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,630
uh and i think that's
part of the complexity so you know what

1558
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:26,640
part of the complexity so you know what
 

1559
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,950
part of the complexity so you know what
interested me as an ethnographer about

1560
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:28,960
interested me as an ethnographer about
 

1561
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,269
interested me as an ethnographer about
this was you know i'm interested in the

1562
00:26:31,269 --> 00:26:31,279
this was you know i'm interested in the
 

1563
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:33,110
this was you know i'm interested in the
kind of economic conceptions that people

1564
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:33,120
kind of economic conceptions that people
 

1565
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,669
kind of economic conceptions that people
have in their heads and and how they

1566
00:26:35,669 --> 00:26:35,679
have in their heads and and how they
 

1567
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:37,350
have in their heads and and how they
lead to certain decisions in labor

1568
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:37,360
lead to certain decisions in labor
 

1569
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,510
lead to certain decisions in labor
markets you know why some people become

1570
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:39,520
markets you know why some people become
 

1571
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,909
markets you know why some people become
an entrepreneur and and other people

1572
00:26:41,909 --> 00:26:41,919
an entrepreneur and and other people
 

1573
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:44,470
an entrepreneur and and other people
become a wage laborer or you know why

1574
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:44,480
become a wage laborer or you know why
 

1575
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,830
become a wage laborer or you know why
some people want to be doctors and other

1576

some people want to be doctors and other
 

1577
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,590

people want to be truck drivers

1578
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:47,600
people want to be truck drivers
 

1579
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,149
people want to be truck drivers
that conception right is is getting

1580
00:26:50,149 --> 00:26:50,159
that conception right is is getting
 

1581
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:51,510
that conception right is is getting
shaped in these labor markets is the

1582
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:51,520
shaped in these labor markets is the
 

1583
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,750
shaped in these labor markets is the
argument of of the book

1584
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:53,760
argument of of the book
 

1585
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,710
argument of of the book
and

1586
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:54,720
and
 

1587
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,350
and
the fact that drivers can hear or

1588
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:57,360
the fact that drivers can hear or
 

1589
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,190
the fact that drivers can hear or
potential drivers can hear about these

1590
00:26:59,190 --> 00:26:59,200
potential drivers can hear about these
 

1591
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,870
potential drivers can hear about these
you know workers who make a hundred

1592
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:00,880
you know workers who make a hundred
 

1593
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,549
you know workers who make a hundred
thousand dollars plus which which

1594
00:27:02,549 --> 00:27:02,559
thousand dollars plus which which
 

1595
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:03,990
thousand dollars plus which which
happens regularly in the trucking

1596
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:04,000
happens regularly in the trucking
 

1597
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,190
happens regularly in the trucking
industry there are

1598
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:05,200
industry there are
 

1599
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,789
industry there are
many truck drivers who make more than a

1600
00:27:06,789 --> 00:27:06,799
many truck drivers who make more than a
 

1601
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:09,190
many truck drivers who make more than a
hundred thousand dollars a year um you

1602
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:09,200
hundred thousand dollars a year um you
 

1603
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,909
hundred thousand dollars a year um you
know is an attraction but the industry's

1604
00:27:11,909 --> 00:27:11,919
know is an attraction but the industry's
 

1605
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:14,870
know is an attraction but the industry's
highly segmented um and and so

1606
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:14,880
highly segmented um and and so
 

1607
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,510
highly segmented um and and so
the entry level segment and and we can

1608
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:17,520
the entry level segment and and we can
 

1609
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,669
the entry level segment and and we can
probably get into this but you know the

1610
00:27:19,669 --> 00:27:19,679
probably get into this but you know the
 

1611
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:21,590
probably get into this but you know the
industry is dominated by

1612
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:21,600
industry is dominated by
 

1613
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,310
industry is dominated by

1677
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,909
in a week as a long-haul truck driver
and so you want to drive as many miles

1678
00:28:25,909 --> 00:28:25,919
and so you want to drive as many miles
 

1679
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:28,630
and so you want to drive as many miles
as you can in those 60 hours and so you

1680
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:28,640
as you can in those 60 hours and so you
 

1681
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,630
as you can in those 60 hours and so you
under report them

1682
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:30,640
under report them
 

1683
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,669
under report them
right

1684
00:28:31,669 --> 00:28:31,679

know
 

1967
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,669
know
so yeah so it's not just skill it's like

1968
00:33:35,669 --> 00:33:35,679
so yeah so it's not just skill it's like
 

1969

so yeah so it's not just skill it's like
they were psychologically invested

1970
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:37,440
they were psychologically invested
 

1971
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,190
they were psychologically invested
potentially from months if not years

1972
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:39,200
potentially from months if not years
 

1973
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,909
potentially from months if not years
into this kind of position as perhaps a

1974
00:33:41,909 --> 00:33:41,919
into this kind of position as perhaps a
 

1975
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:44,070
into this kind of position as perhaps a
position that if they lose their current

1976
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:44,080
position that if they lose their current
 

1977
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,070
position that if they lose their current
job they could fall to

1978
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:46,080
job they could fall to
 

1979
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,909
job they could fall to
okay so that's an indication that

1980
00:33:47,909 --> 00:33:47,919
okay so that's an indication that
 

1981
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:49,430
okay so that's an indication that
there's something deeply wrong with the

1982
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:49,440
there's something deeply wrong with the
 

1983

00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:07,360
know again
 

2001
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,669
know again
just so much time that's that's not

2002
00:34:09,669 --> 00:34:09,679
just so much time that's that's not
 

2003
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:11,589
just so much time that's that's not
compensated directly for the amount of

was
 

2015
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:20,389
was
you know

2016

worth
right and like

2022
00:34:25,349 --> 00:34:25,359
right and like
 

2023
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:27,990
right and like
what truck drivers love is

2024
00:34:27,990 --> 00:34:28,000
what truck drivers love is
 

2025
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,310
what truck drivers love is
oftentimes is that tangible

2026
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:30,320
oftentimes is that tangible
 

2027
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:33,190
oftentimes is that tangible
uh outcome-based compensation so they

2028
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:33,200
uh outcome-based compensation so they
 

2029
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:36,230
uh outcome-based compensation so they
say you know what you know honest days

2030
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:36,240
say you know what you know honest days
 

2031

do i drive 500 miles today that's what

2034
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:40,720
do i drive 500 miles today that's what
 

2035
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:42,389
do i drive 500 miles today that's what
i'm gonna get paid for

2036
00:34:42,389 --> 00:34:42,399
i'm gonna get paid for
 

2037
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:44,230
i'm gonna get paid for
and then you get to that dock and they

2038
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:44,240
and then you get to that dock and they
 

2039
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:46,790
and then you get to that dock and they
tell you sorry the load's not ready

2040
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:46,800
tell you sorry the load's not ready
 

2041
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,589
tell you sorry the load's not ready
go sit over there and you stew

2042
00:34:49,589 --> 00:34:49,599
go sit over there and you stew
 

2043
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:50,710
go sit over there and you stew
and that weight can break you

2044
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:50,720
and that weight can break you
 

2045
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:52,389
and that weight can break you
psychologically because your

2046
00:34:52,389 --> 00:34:52,399
psychologically because your
 

2047
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:54,550
psychologically because your
your uh your time

2048
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:54,560
your uh your time
 

2049
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:58,310
your uh your time
every second becomes more worthless yeah

2050
00:34:58,310 --> 00:34:58,320
every second becomes more worthless yeah
 

2051
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,990
every second becomes more worthless yeah
or worth less

2052
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:00,000
or worth less
 

2053
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,150
or worth less
yeah and again the the industry's gonna

2054
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:02,160
yeah and again the the industry's gonna
 

2055
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,190
yeah and again the the industry's gonna
say

2056
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:03,200
say
 

2057
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,390
say
for instance

2058
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:04,400
for instance
 

2059
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,750
for instance
okay well you know they've got skin in

2060
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:05,760
okay well you know they've got skin in
 

2061
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,109
okay well you know they've got skin in
the game right that argument about sort

2062
00:35:07,109 --> 00:35:07,119
the game right that argument about sort
 

2063
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:09,829
the game right that argument about sort
of compensation based on sort of output

2064
00:35:09,829 --> 00:35:09,839
of compensation based on sort of output
 

2065
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:11,750
of compensation based on sort of output
right um but that's a holdover from when

2066
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:11,760
right um but that's a holdover from when
 

2067
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,349
right um but that's a holdover from when
you couldn't observe truckers now they

2068
00:35:13,349 --> 00:35:13,359
you couldn't observe truckers now they
 

2069
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:15,190
you couldn't observe truckers now they
all have you know satellite-linked

2070
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:15,200
all have you know satellite-linked
 

2071
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,950
all have you know satellite-linked
computers in the trucks that tell these

2072
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:16,960
computers in the trucks that tell these
 

2073
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,390
computers in the trucks that tell these
large companies

2074
00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:18,400
large companies
 

2075
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,550
large companies
this driver was you know at this gps

2076
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:20,560
this driver was you know at this gps
 

2077
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,630
this driver was you know at this gps
location for four and a half hours right

2078
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:22,640
location for four and a half hours right
 

2079
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,870
location for four and a half hours right
so if you wanted to compensate them for

2080
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:24,880
so if you wanted to compensate them for
 

2081
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,550
so if you wanted to compensate them for
that time directly and the trucker can't

2082
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:26,560
that time directly and the trucker can't
 

2083
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,230
that time directly and the trucker can't
control what's happening on that

2084
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:28,240
control what's happening on that
 

2085

waiting for that you know firm that

2088
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:31,920
waiting for that you know firm that
 

2089
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,950
waiting for that you know firm that
customer to tell them hey pull in there

2090
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:34,960
customer to tell them hey pull in there
 

2091
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,150
customer to tell them hey pull in there
and so

2092
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:36,160
and so
 

2093
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,069
and so
what it becomes is just a way to shift

2094
00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:38,079
what it becomes is just a way to shift
 

2095
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:40,630
what it becomes is just a way to shift
the inefficiencies and the cost of that

2096
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:40,640
the inefficiencies and the cost of that
 

2097
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:43,430
the inefficiencies and the cost of that
onto that onto that driver

2098
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:43,440
onto that onto that driver
 

2099
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,230
onto that onto that driver
no it's competitive for customers so if

2100
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:46,240
no it's competitive for customers so if
 

2101
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,069
no it's competitive for customers so if
you're walmart you might have your

2102
00:35:48,069 --> 00:35:48,079
you're walmart you might have your
 

2103
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:49,750
you're walmart you might have your
choice of a dozen different

2104
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:49,760
choice of a dozen different
 

2105
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,109
choice of a dozen different
trucking companies that could move your

2106
00:35:51,109 --> 00:35:51,119
trucking companies that could move your
 

2107
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:51,990
trucking companies that could move your
stuff

2108
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:52,000
stuff
 

2109
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,910
stuff
and if one of them tells you hey you're

2110
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:53,920
and if one of them tells you hey you're
 

2111
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,069
and if one of them tells you hey you're
not moving our trucks in and out of your

2112
00:35:56,069 --> 00:35:56,079
not moving our trucks in and out of your
 

2113
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:58,230
not moving our trucks in and out of your
docks fast enough we're going to charge

2114
00:35:58,230 --> 00:35:58,240
docks fast enough we're going to charge
 

2115
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,069
docks fast enough we're going to charge
you for how long our truck is sitting on

2116
00:36:00,069 --> 00:36:00,079
you for how long our truck is sitting on
 

2117
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:01,829
you for how long our truck is sitting on
your lot if you're walmart you're going

2118
00:36:01,829 --> 00:36:01,839
your lot if you're walmart you're going
 

2119
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:03,349
your lot if you're walmart you're going
to say i'll go see what the other guy

2120
00:36:03,349 --> 00:36:03,359
to say i'll go see what the other guy
 

2121
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:04,870
to say i'll go see what the other guy
says right

2122
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:04,880
says right
 

2123
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,510
says right
and so companies are going to allow that

2124
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:07,520
and so companies are going to allow that
 

2125
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,349
and so companies are going to allow that
customer to essentially waste that

2126
00:36:09,349 --> 00:36:09,359
customer to essentially waste that
 

2127
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:11,109
customer to essentially waste that
driver's time

2128
00:36:11,109 --> 00:36:11,119
driver's time
 

2129
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:12,710
driver's time
you know in order to to keep that

2130
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:12,720
you know in order to to keep that
 

2131
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,550
you know in order to to keep that
business

2132
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:14,560
business
 

2133
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,710

can you try to describe the economics

2134
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:16,720
can you try to describe the economics
 

2135
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,390
can you try to describe the economics
the labor market of the situation you

2136
00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:18,400
the labor market of the situation you
 

2137
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,950
the labor market of the situation you
mentioned freight and railroad

2138
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:20,960
mentioned freight and railroad
 

2139
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,030
mentioned freight and railroad
what is the

2140
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:23,040
what is the
 

2141
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,829
what is the
sort of the

2142
00:36:24,829 --> 00:36:24,839
sort of the
 

2143
00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:27,829
sort of the
dynamic uh financials the economics of

2144
00:36:27,829 --> 00:36:27,839
dynamic uh financials the economics of
 

2145
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:29,750
dynamic uh financials the economics of
this that allow for

2146
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:29,760
this that allow for
 

2147
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,190
this that allow for
such

2148
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:31,200
such
 

2149
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,109
such
low

2150
00:36:33,109 --> 00:36:33,119
low
 

2151
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:35,589
low
low salaries to be paid to truckers like

2152
00:36:35,589 --> 00:36:35,599
low salaries to be paid to truckers like
 

2153
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:37,510
low salaries to be paid to truckers like
what what's the competition what's the

2154
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:37,520
what what's the competition what's the
 

2155
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,190
what what's the competition what's the
alternative to

2156
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:39,200
alternative to
 

2157
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,990
alternative to
transporting goods via trucks like what

2158
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:42,000
transporting goods via trucks like what
 

2159
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,510
transporting goods via trucks like what
seems to be broken here from an

2160
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:43,520
seems to be broken here from an
 

2161
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,829
seems to be broken here from an
economics perspective yeah so it's uh

2162
00:36:45,829 --> 00:36:45,839
economics perspective yeah so it's uh
 

2163
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:48,630
economics perspective yeah so it's uh
well nothing it's it's it's a perfect

2164
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:48,640
well nothing it's it's it's a perfect
 

2165
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:49,510
well nothing it's it's it's a perfect
market

2166
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:49,520
market
 

2167
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,670
market
okay right i mean so for economists this

2168
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:51,680
okay right i mean so for economists this
 

2169
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,510
okay right i mean so for economists this
is how it should work right um but the

2170
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:53,520
is how it should work right um but the
 

2171
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,270
is how it should work right um but the
inefficiencies like you said sorry to

2172
00:36:55,270 --> 00:36:55,280
inefficiencies like you said sorry to
 

2173
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:59,270
inefficiencies like you said sorry to
interrupt are pushed to the truck driver

2174
00:36:59,270 --> 00:36:59,280
interrupt are pushed to the truck driver
 

2175
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,589
interrupt are pushed to the truck driver
doesn't that like spiral doesn't that

2176
00:37:01,589 --> 00:37:01,599
doesn't that like spiral doesn't that
 

2177
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:03,589
doesn't that like spiral doesn't that
lead to a poor performance on the part

2178
00:37:03,589 --> 00:37:03,599
lead to a poor performance on the part
 

2179
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:05,430
lead to a poor performance on the part
of the truck driver and just like make

2180
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:05,440
of the truck driver and just like make
 

2181
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,829
of the truck driver and just like make
the whole thing more and more

2182
00:37:06,829 --> 00:37:06,839
the whole thing more and more
 

2183
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:09,829
the whole thing more and more
inefficient in it and it results in

2184
00:37:09,829 --> 00:37:09,839
inefficient in it and it results in
 

2185
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:12,150
inefficient in it and it results in
lower payment to the truck driver and so

2186
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:12,160
lower payment to the truck driver and so
 

2187
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,630
lower payment to the truck driver and so
on it just feels like

2188
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:14,640
on it just feels like
 

2189
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,870
on it just feels like
in capitalism

2190
00:37:16,870 --> 00:37:16,880
in capitalism
 

2191
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:19,670
in capitalism
you should have a competing solution

2192
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:19,680
you should have a competing solution
 

2193
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,750
you should have a competing solution
in terms of uh truck drivers like

2194
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:21,760
in terms of uh truck drivers like
 

2195
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,589
in terms of uh truck drivers like
another company that provides

2196
00:37:23,589 --> 00:37:23,599
another company that provides
 

2197
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:25,910
another company that provides
transportation via trucks that are that

2198
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:25,920
transportation via trucks that are that
 

2199
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,589
transportation via trucks that are that
creates a much better experience for

2200
00:37:27,589 --> 00:37:27,599
creates a much better experience for
 

2201
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:30,390
creates a much better experience for
truck drivers making them more efficient

2202
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:30,400
truck drivers making them more efficient
 

2203
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,829
truck drivers making them more efficient
all those kinds of things

2204
00:37:31,829 --> 00:37:31,839
all those kinds of things
 

2205
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:33,589
all those kinds of things
or how is the competition being

2206
00:37:33,589 --> 00:37:33,599
or how is the competition being
 

2207
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:36,630
or how is the competition being
suppressed here yeah so it is the

2208
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:36,640
suppressed here yeah so it is the
 

2209
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:39,430
suppressed here yeah so it is the
competition is based on who's cheaper um

2210
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:39,440
competition is based on who's cheaper um
 

2211
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,349
competition is based on who's cheaper um
and this is this is the cheapest way to

2212
00:37:41,349 --> 00:37:41,359
and this is this is the cheapest way to
 

2213
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:43,109
and this is this is the cheapest way to
move the freight now you know they're

2214
00:37:43,109 --> 00:37:43,119
move the freight now you know they're
 

2215
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:44,950
move the freight now you know they're
externalities right i mean this so this

2216
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:44,960
externalities right i mean this so this
 

2217
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:45,990
externalities right i mean this so this
is the

2218
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:46,000
is the
 

2219
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,870
is the
explanation that i think is is obvious

2220
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:48,880
explanation that i think is is obvious
 

2221
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,950
explanation that i think is is obvious
for this right there there are lots of

2222
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:50,960
for this right there there are lots of
 

2223
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:51,829
for this right there there are lots of
um

2224
00:37:51,829 --> 00:37:51,839
um
 

2225
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:53,670
um
there are lots of costs that you know

2226
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:53,680
there are lots of costs that you know
 

2227
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,109
there are lots of costs that you know
whether it's that driver's time whether

2228
00:37:55,109 --> 00:37:55,119
whether it's that driver's time whether
 

2229
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:57,430
whether it's that driver's time whether
it's the you know um time without their

2230
00:37:57,430 --> 00:37:57,440
it's the you know um time without their
 

2231
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,829
it's the you know um time without their
family whether it's the you know

2232
00:37:59,829 --> 00:37:59,839
family whether it's the you know
 

2233
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:01,670
family whether it's the you know
the fact that they drive through

2234
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:01,680
the fact that they drive through
 

2235
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,870
the fact that they drive through
congestion and and spew lots of diesel

2236
00:38:04,870 --> 00:38:04,880
congestion and and spew lots of diesel
 

2237
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,390
congestion and and spew lots of diesel
particulates into

2238
00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:06,400
particulates into
 

2239
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,390
particulates into
cities where kids have asthma and make

2240
00:38:08,390 --> 00:38:08,400
cities where kids have asthma and make
 

2241
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,470
cities where kids have asthma and make
our commutes longer rather than more

2242
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:10,480
our commutes longer rather than more
 

2243
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,470
our commutes longer rather than more
efficiently use their time by sort of

2244
00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:12,480
efficiently use their time by sort of
 

2245
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,990
efficiently use their time by sort of
routing them around

2246
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:14,000
routing them around
 

2247
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,829
routing them around
congestion and rush hour and things like

2248
00:38:15,829 --> 00:38:15,839
congestion and rush hour and things like
 

2249

00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:53,030
well before hoffa back to the you know
1800s

2728
00:46:53,030 --> 00:46:53,040
1800s
 

2729
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:54,950
1800s
they understood that

2730
00:46:54,950 --> 00:46:54,960
they understood that
 

2731
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:56,630
they understood that
workers did better if their employers

2732
00:46:56,630 --> 00:46:56,640
workers did better if their employers
 

2733
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:58,309
workers did better if their employers
did better and the only way the

2734
00:46:58,309 --> 00:46:58,319
did better and the only way the
 

2735
00:46:58,319 --> 00:46:59,829
did better and the only way the
employers would do better was if they

2736
00:46:59,829 --> 00:46:59,839
employers would do better was if they
 

2737
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:01,750
employers would do better was if they
controlled the market

2738
00:47:01,750 --> 00:47:01,760
controlled the market
 

2739
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:03,750
controlled the market
and so oftentimes the corruption and

2740
00:47:03,750 --> 00:47:03,760
and so oftentimes the corruption and
 

2741
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:06,309
and so oftentimes the corruption and
trucking was initiated by employers who

2742
00:47:06,309 --> 00:47:06,319
trucking was initiated by employers who
 

2743
00:47:06,319 --> 00:47:07,910
trucking was initiated by employers who
wanted to limit competition and they

2744
00:47:07,910 --> 00:47:07,920
wanted to limit competition and they
 

2745
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:09,510
wanted to limit competition and they
knew they couldn't limit competition

2746
00:47:09,510 --> 00:47:09,520
knew they couldn't limit competition
 

2747
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:11,109
knew they couldn't limit competition
without the support of labor and so

2748
00:47:11,109 --> 00:47:11,119
without the support of labor and so
 

2749
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:12,950
without the support of labor and so
you'd get these collusive arrangements

2750
00:47:12,950 --> 00:47:12,960
you'd get these collusive arrangements
 

2751
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:15,510
you'd get these collusive arrangements
between employers and labor to say no

2752
00:47:15,510 --> 00:47:15,520
between employers and labor to say no
 

2753
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:17,190
between employers and labor to say no
new trucking companies

2754

when there's a shortage of trucks around

2762

too many trucks it's very often that you
 

2767
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:33,990
too many trucks it's very often that you
end up operating at a loss just to keep

2768
00:47:33,990 --> 00:47:34,000
end up operating at a loss just to keep
 

2769

trucking for hire

2820
00:48:27,109 --> 00:48:27,119
trucking for hire
 

2821
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:28,870
trucking for hire
are are the folks who you know offer

their services out to other other
 

2825
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:32,470
their services out to other other
customers so you have private and for

2826
00:48:32,470 --> 00:48:32,480
customers so you have private and for
 

2827
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:36,630
customers so you have private and for
hire in general for hire uh pays pays

2828
00:48:36,630 --> 00:48:36,640
hire in general for hire uh pays pays
 

2829
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:38,150
hire in general for hire uh pays pays
less

2830
00:48:38,150 --> 00:48:38,160
less
 

2831
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:39,750
less
is that because of the something you

2832
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:39,760
is that because of the something you
 

2833
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:41,589
is that because of the something you
talk about what employee versus

2834
00:48:41,589 --> 00:48:41,599
talk about what employee versus
 

2835
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:45,510
talk about what employee versus
contractor situation or are they all

2836
00:48:45,510 --> 00:48:45,520
contractor situation or are they all
 

2837
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:48,870
contractor situation or are they all
tricked or led to become contractors

2838
00:48:48,870 --> 00:48:48,880
tricked or led to become contractors
 

2839
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:51,109
tricked or led to become contractors
that can become a part of it um as a

2840
00:48:51,109 --> 00:48:51,119
that can become a part of it um as a
 

2841
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:53,829
that can become a part of it um as a
strategy but the the fundamental reason

2842
00:48:53,829 --> 00:48:53,839
strategy but the the fundamental reason
 

2843
00:48:53,839 --> 00:48:56,630
strategy but the the fundamental reason
is competition so those private carriers

2844
00:48:56,630 --> 00:48:56,640
is competition so those private carriers
 

2845
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:59,109
is competition so those private carriers
don't um aren't in competition with

2846
00:48:59,109 --> 00:48:59,119
don't um aren't in competition with
 

2847
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:00,549
don't um aren't in competition with
other trucking fleets right for their

2848
00:49:00,549 --> 00:49:00,559
other trucking fleets right for their
 

2849
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:02,870
other trucking fleets right for their
own in-house services yeah so you know

2850
00:49:02,870 --> 00:49:02,880
own in-house services yeah so you know
 

2851
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:05,349
own in-house services yeah so you know
they tend to and and this you know if

2852
00:49:05,349 --> 00:49:05,359
they tend to and and this you know if
 

2853
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:07,589
they tend to and and this you know if
the question of why private versus for

2854
00:49:07,589 --> 00:49:07,599
the question of why private versus for
 

2855
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:09,750
the question of why private versus for
hire because for hire is cheaper right

2856
00:49:09,750 --> 00:49:09,760
hire because for hire is cheaper right
 

2857
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:12,790
hire because for hire is cheaper right
um and so if you need that if that

2858
00:49:12,790 --> 00:49:12,800
um and so if you need that if that
 

2859
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:15,190
um and so if you need that if that
trucking service is central to what you

2860
00:49:15,190 --> 00:49:15,200
trucking service is central to what you
 

2861
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:17,270
trucking service is central to what you
do and you cannot afford disruptions or

2862
00:49:17,270 --> 00:49:17,280
do and you cannot afford disruptions or
 

2863
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:19,109
do and you cannot afford disruptions or
volatility in the price of it you keep

2864
00:49:19,109 --> 00:49:19,119
volatility in the price of it you keep
 

2865
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:20,710
volatility in the price of it you keep
it in-house you should be willing to pay

2866
00:49:20,710 --> 00:49:20,720
it in-house you should be willing to pay
 

2867
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:22,230
it in-house you should be willing to pay
more for that because it's more valuable

2868
00:49:22,230 --> 00:49:22,240
more for that because it's more valuable
 

2869
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:23,829
more for that because it's more valuable
too and you keep it in-house and that so

2870
00:49:23,829 --> 00:49:23,839
too and you keep it in-house and that so
 

2871
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:25,510
too and you keep it in-house and that so
that's an interesting distinction what

2872
00:49:25,510 --> 00:49:25,520
that's an interesting distinction what
 

2873
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:27,349
that's an interesting distinction what
about and this is kind of moving towards

2874
00:49:27,349 --> 00:49:27,359
about and this is kind of moving towards
 

2875
00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:29,349
about and this is kind of moving towards
our conversation what can and can't be

2876
00:49:29,349 --> 00:49:29,359
our conversation what can and can't be
 

2877
00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:30,470
our conversation what can and can't be
automated

2878
00:49:30,470 --> 00:49:30,480
automated
 

2879
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:31,750
automated
um

2880
00:49:31,750 --> 00:49:31,760
um
 

2881
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,670
um
how else does it divide

2882
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:33,680
how else does it divide
 

2883
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:36,150
how else does it divide
yeah the the different trucking jobs so

2884
00:49:36,150 --> 00:49:36,160
yeah the the different trucking jobs so
 

2885
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:38,230
yeah the the different trucking jobs so
it's the next big chunk is kind of how

2886
00:49:38,230 --> 00:49:38,240
it's the next big chunk is kind of how
 

2887
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:40,630
it's the next big chunk is kind of how
much stuff are you moving right

2888
00:49:40,630 --> 00:49:40,640
much stuff are you moving right
 

2889
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:43,670
much stuff are you moving right
and so we have what's called truckload

2890
00:49:43,670 --> 00:49:43,680
and so we have what's called truckload
 

2891
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:44,950
and so we have what's called truckload
and truckload means you know you can

2892
00:49:44,950 --> 00:49:44,960
and truckload means you know you can
 

2893
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:47,750
and truckload means you know you can
fill up a trailer either by volume or by

2894
00:49:47,750 --> 00:49:47,760
fill up a trailer either by volume or by
 

2895
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:50,549
fill up a trailer either by volume or by
weight and then less than truckload less

2896
00:49:50,549 --> 00:49:50,559
weight and then less than truckload less
 

2897
00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:52,470
weight and then less than truckload less
than truckload the official definition

2898
00:49:52,470 --> 00:49:52,480
than truckload the official definition
 

2899
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:55,430
than truckload the official definition
is like less than ten thousand pounds

2900
00:49:55,430 --> 00:49:55,440
is like less than ten thousand pounds
 

2901
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:56,549
is like less than ten thousand pounds
you know this is going to be a couple

2902
00:49:56,549 --> 00:49:56,559
you know this is going to be a couple
 

2903
00:49:56,559 --> 00:49:58,630
you know this is going to be a couple
pallets of this a couple pallets of that

2904
00:49:58,630 --> 00:49:58,640
pallets of this a couple pallets of that
 

2905
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:00,870
pallets of this a couple pallets of that
the process looks really different right

2906
00:50:00,870 --> 00:50:00,880
the process looks really different right
 

2907
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:02,950

the truckers aren't showing up to pick
 

3301
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:17,750
the truckers aren't showing up to pick
up the containers that are there so they

3302
00:57:17,750 --> 00:57:17,760
up the containers that are there so they
 

3303
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:19,190
up the containers that are there so they
can't offload

3304
00:57:19,190 --> 00:57:19,200
can't offload
 

3305
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:22,630

the the ships that are that are waiting

3306
00:57:22,630 --> 00:57:22,640
the the ships that are that are waiting
 

3307
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:24,470
the the ships that are that are waiting
and why aren't the

3308
00:57:24,470 --> 00:57:24,480
and why aren't the
 

3309
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:26,069
and why aren't the
why aren't the truckers picking it up

3310
00:57:26,069 --> 00:57:26,079
why aren't the truckers picking it up
 

3311
00:57:26,079 --> 00:57:27,589
why aren't the truckers picking it up
partly because there's a long history of

3312
00:57:27,589 --> 00:57:27,599
partly because there's a long history of
 

3313
00:57:27,599 --> 00:57:29,349
partly because there's a long history of
inefficiency and maybe making them wait

3314
00:57:29,349 --> 00:57:29,359
inefficiency and maybe making them wait
 

3315
00:57:29,359 --> 00:57:31,910
inefficiency and maybe making them wait
but it's because the warehouses are full

3316
00:57:31,910 --> 00:57:31,920
but it's because the warehouses are full
 

3317
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:32,630
but it's because the warehouses are full
so

so
 

3319
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:35,030
so
and so we've had all these perverse you

3320
00:57:35,030 --> 00:57:35,040
and so we've had all these perverse you
 

3321
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:37,349
and so we've had all these perverse you
know outcomes that no one really

know outcomes that no one really
 

3323
00:57:37,359 --> 00:57:39,430
know outcomes that no one really
expected like in the middle of all these

know the real problem there which is
 

3385
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:45,270
know the real problem there which is
that that lean supply chain sure there

00:59:19,349 --> 00:59:19,359
so that panic buying certainly
 

3419
00:59:19,359 --> 00:59:21,109
so that panic buying certainly
exacerbated some things like toilet

paper and whatever but we saw just a

3422
00:59:23,190 --> 00:59:23,200
paper and whatever but we saw just a
 

3423
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:26,309
paper and whatever but we saw just a
massive change in demand and our supply

right so you know that stuff leaves asia

3428
00:59:31,270 --> 00:59:31,280
right so you know that stuff leaves asia
 

3429
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:33,349
right so you know that stuff leaves asia
you know months before you you want to

3430
00:59:33,349 --> 00:59:33,359
you know months before you you want to
 

3431
00:59:33,359 --> 00:59:34,710
you know months before you you want to
have it on the shelves and you're

3432
00:59:34,710 --> 00:59:34,720
have it on the shelves and you're
 

3433
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:36,870
have it on the shelves and you're
predicting based on last year you know

3434
00:59:36,870 --> 00:59:36,880
predicting based on last year you know
 

3435
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:39,670
predicting based on last year you know
what you want on that that shelf um

3436
00:59:39,670 --> 00:59:39,680
what you want on that that shelf um
 

3437
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:42,710
what you want on that that shelf um
and so it's a it's a you know i guess at

3438
00:59:42,710 --> 00:59:42,720
and so it's a it's a you know i guess at
 

3439
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:45,109
and so it's a it's a you know i guess at
its best it's a beautiful symphony of

00:59:45,109 --> 00:59:45,119
its best it's a beautiful symphony of

lots of moving parts um

3442
00:59:48,470 --> 00:59:48,480
lots of moving parts um
 

3443
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:49,910
lots of moving parts um
but now

3444
00:59:49,910 --> 00:59:49,920
but now
 

3445
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:52,069
but now
everyone can't get on the same page of

music but it's not resilient to changes
 

3449
00:59:54,319 --> 00:59:55,510
music but it's not resilient to changes
in uh

3450
00:59:55,510 --> 00:59:55,520

human behavior so even like um i read

01:00:02,069 --> 01:00:02,079
human behavior so even like um i read
 

3455
01:00:02,079 --> 01:00:03,349
human behavior so even like um i read
somewhere

3456
01:00:03,349 --> 01:00:03,359
somewhere
 

3457
01:00:03,359 --> 01:00:04,789
somewhere
maybe you can tell me if this true in

3458
01:00:04,789 --> 01:00:04,799
maybe you can tell me if this true in
 

3459
01:00:04,799 --> 01:00:06,309
maybe you can tell me if this true in
relation to food

3460
01:00:06,309 --> 01:00:06,319
relation to food
 

3461
01:00:06,319 --> 01:00:08,150
relation to food
it's just the change of human behavior

3462
01:00:08,150 --> 01:00:08,160
it's just the change of human behavior
 

3463

between going out to restaurants versus
 

3465
01:00:10,319 --> 01:00:11,750
between going out to restaurants versus
eating at home

3466
01:00:11,750 --> 01:00:11,760
eating at home
 

3467
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:14,470

as a as a species we consume a lot less

3468
01:00:14,470 --> 01:00:14,480
as a as a species we consume a lot less
 

3469
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:17,030
as a as a species we consume a lot less
food that way apparently what i read in

3470
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:17,040
food that way apparently what i read in
 

3471
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:18,309
food that way apparently what i read in
restaurants

3472
01:00:18,309 --> 01:00:18,319
restaurants
 

3473
01:00:18,319 --> 01:00:19,990
restaurants
like there's a lot of food just thrown

3474
01:00:19,990 --> 01:00:20,000
like there's a lot of food just thrown

yeah and so like you then have to move a

3478
01:00:25,270 --> 01:00:25,280
yeah and so like you then have to move a
 

3479
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:27,109
yeah and so like you then have to move a
lot more food through the whole supply

3480
01:00:27,109 --> 01:00:27,119
lot more food through the whole supply
 

3481
01:00:27,119 --> 01:00:29,270
lot more food through the whole supply
chain and now

chain and now
 

3483
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:30,549
chain and now
because you're

3484
01:00:30,549 --> 01:00:30,559
because you're
 

3485
01:00:30,559 --> 01:00:32,309
because you're

supply side um you know and there are
product categories right where 30 of the

3516
01:01:04,230 --> 01:01:04,240
product categories right where 30 of the
 

3517
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:06,390
product categories right where 30 of the
crop raised does not

3518
01:01:06,390 --> 01:01:06,400
crop raised does not
 

3519
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:08,230
crop raised does not
get used right it just gets plowed under

3520
01:01:08,230 --> 01:01:08,240
get used right it just gets plowed under
 

3521
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:10,470
get used right it just gets plowed under
or or wasted but

3522
01:01:10,470 --> 01:01:10,480
or or wasted but
 

3523
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:12,549
or or wasted but
here's the importance of this in sort of

3524
01:01:12,549 --> 01:01:12,559
here's the importance of this in sort of
 

3525
01:01:12,559 --> 01:01:14,309
here's the importance of this in sort of
getting this right you know like that

3526
01:01:14,309 --> 01:01:14,319
getting this right you know like that
 

3527
01:01:14,319 --> 01:01:16,390
getting this right you know like that
not that like panic buying you know

3528
01:01:16,390 --> 01:01:16,400
not that like panic buying you know
 

3529
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:18,549
not that like panic buying you know
blame the irrational consumer

3530
01:01:18,549 --> 01:01:18,559
blame the irrational consumer
 

3531
01:01:18,559 --> 01:01:21,109
blame the irrational consumer
you know look at the hard sort of truth

3532
01:01:21,109 --> 01:01:21,119
you know look at the hard sort of truth
 

3533
01:01:21,119 --> 01:01:23,349
you know look at the hard sort of truth
of the way we've we've set up our

3534
01:01:23,349 --> 01:01:23,359
of the way we've we've set up our
 

3535
01:01:23,359 --> 01:01:25,030

01:01:25,030 --> 01:01:25,040
economy and
 

3537
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:27,510
economy and
i'll i'll ask you this lex i know

3538

i'll i'll ask you this lex i know
 

3539
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:30,069
i'll i'll ask you this lex i know
um you you're a hopeful optimistic

3543
01:01:33,359 --> 01:01:34,950
person 100 yes yeah i am too i mean i
write about problems all the time and so

3544
01:01:34,950 --> 01:01:34,960
write about problems all the time and so
 

3545
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:37,109
write about problems all the time and so
people think i'm sort of like a just a

3546
01:01:37,109 --> 01:01:37,119
people think i'm sort of like a just a

3553
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:46,390
full kind of guy like i want i want to
identify problems so so we can solve

3554
01:01:46,390 --> 01:01:46,400
identify problems so so we can solve
 

3555
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:47,270
identify problems so so we can solve
them

3556
01:01:47,270 --> 01:01:47,280
them
 

3557
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:48,870
them
so let me ask you this we've got these

3558
01:01:48,870 --> 01:01:48,880
so let me ask you this we've got these
 

3559
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:52,870
so let me ask you this we've got these
long lean supply chains in the

3560
01:01:52,870 --> 01:01:52,880
long lean supply chains in the
 

3561
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:54,230
long lean supply chains in the

do you see

3564
01:01:55,829 --> 01:01:55,839
do you see
 

3565
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:56,870

you know um other

you know um other

01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:12,150
you know um other
institutional failures do those things

3580
01:02:12,150 --> 01:02:12,160
institutional failures do those things
 

3581
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:13,430
institutional failures do those things
seem

3582
01:02:13,430 --> 01:02:13,440
seem
 

3583
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:15,270
seem
you know potentially more likely in the

3584
01:02:15,270 --> 01:02:15,280
you know potentially more likely in the
 

3585
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:16,150
you know potentially more likely in the
future

3586
01:02:16,150 --> 01:02:16,160
future
 

3587
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:17,910
future
than they have been in say the last 20

3588
01:02:17,910 --> 01:02:17,920
than they have been in say the last 20
 

3589
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:19,430
than they have been in say the last 20
years yeah

3590
01:02:19,430 --> 01:02:19,440
years yeah
 

3591
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:21,430
years yeah
it almost absolutely seems to be the

3592
01:02:21,430 --> 01:02:21,440
it almost absolutely seems to be the
 

3593
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:23,109
it almost absolutely seems to be the
case so you then have to ask the

3594
01:02:23,109 --> 01:02:23,119
case so you then have to ask the
 

3595
01:02:23,119 --> 01:02:25,910
case so you then have to ask the
question of uh how do we

3596
01:02:25,910 --> 01:02:25,920
question of uh how do we
 

3597
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:27,349
question of uh how do we
change

3598
01:02:27,349 --> 01:02:27,359
change
 

3599
01:02:27,359 --> 01:02:29,990
change
our supply chains whether it's making

3600
01:02:29,990 --> 01:02:30,000
our supply chains whether it's making
 

3601
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,230
our supply chains whether it's making
more resilient or make them

3602
01:02:32,230 --> 01:02:32,240
more resilient or make them
 

3603
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:34,870
more resilient or make them
less densely connected

3604
01:02:34,870 --> 01:02:34,880
less densely connected
 

3605
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:35,670
less densely connected
um

3606
01:02:35,670 --> 01:02:35,680
um
 

3607
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:38,069
um
you know building uh it's like a what is

3608
01:02:38,069 --> 01:02:38,079
you know building uh it's like a what is
 

3609
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:38,710
you know building uh it's like a what is
it

3610
01:02:38,710 --> 01:02:38,720
it
 

3611
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:39,829
it
you know

3612
01:02:39,829 --> 01:02:39,839
you know
 

3613
01:02:39,839 --> 01:02:42,309
you know
the the tesla model for in the

3614
01:02:42,309 --> 01:02:42,319
the the tesla model for in the
 

3615
01:02:42,319 --> 01:02:44,230
the the tesla model for in the
automotive sector of like trying to

3616
01:02:44,230 --> 01:02:44,240
automotive sector of like trying to
 

3617
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:46,230
automotive sector of like trying to
build every like

3618
01:02:46,230 --> 01:02:46,240
build every like
 

3619
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:47,750
build every like
trying to get the factory to do as much

3620
01:02:47,750 --> 01:02:47,760
trying to get the factory to do as much
 

3621
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:50,789
trying to get the factory to do as much
as possible with as little reliance on

3622
01:02:50,789 --> 01:02:50,799
as possible with as little reliance on
 

3623
01:02:50,799 --> 01:02:52,549
as possible with as little reliance on
widely distributed

3624
01:02:52,549 --> 01:02:52,559
widely distributed
 

3625
01:02:52,559 --> 01:02:54,470
widely distributed
uh sources of the supply chain as

3626
01:02:54,470 --> 01:02:54,480
uh sources of the supply chain as
 

3627
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:55,990
uh sources of the supply chain as
possible so maybe

3628
01:02:55,990 --> 01:02:56,000
possible so maybe
 

3629
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,789
possible so maybe
like rethinking how much we rely on the

3630
01:02:58,789 --> 01:02:58,799
like rethinking how much we rely on the
 

3631
01:02:58,799 --> 01:03:01,750
like rethinking how much we rely on the
infrastructure of the supply chain

3632
01:03:01,750 --> 01:03:01,760
infrastructure of the supply chain
 

3633
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:03,670
infrastructure of the supply chain
yeah i mean you know there's some basic

3634
01:03:03,670 --> 01:03:03,680
yeah i mean you know there's some basic
 

3635
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:06,789
yeah i mean you know there's some basic
and i i assume right that that there are

3636
01:03:06,789 --> 01:03:06,799
and i i assume right that that there are
 

3637
01:03:06,799 --> 01:03:09,430
and i i assume right that that there are
a lot of folks in corporate boardrooms

3638
01:03:09,430 --> 01:03:09,440
a lot of folks in corporate boardrooms
 

3639
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:11,910
a lot of folks in corporate boardrooms
looking at risk and saying that didn't

3640
01:03:11,910 --> 01:03:11,920
looking at risk and saying that didn't
 

3641
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:12,950
looking at risk and saying that didn't
go well

3642
01:03:12,950 --> 01:03:12,960
go well
 

3643
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:15,109
go well
and maybe it could have even gone worse

3644
01:03:15,109 --> 01:03:15,119
and maybe it could have even gone worse
 

3645
01:03:15,119 --> 01:03:16,390
and maybe it could have even gone worse
um

3646
01:03:16,390 --> 01:03:16,400
um
 

3647
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:19,109
um
maybe we need to think about reshoring

3648
01:03:19,109 --> 01:03:19,119
maybe we need to think about reshoring
 

3649
01:03:19,119 --> 01:03:20,549
maybe we need to think about reshoring
right um

3650
01:03:20,549 --> 01:03:20,559
right um
 

3651
01:03:20,559 --> 01:03:21,990
right um
at the very least

3652
01:03:21,990 --> 01:03:22,000
at the very least
 

3653
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,349
at the very least
one of the things that i'm hearing about

3654
01:03:23,349 --> 01:03:23,359
one of the things that i'm hearing about
 

3655
01:03:23,359 --> 01:03:25,109
one of the things that i'm hearing about
anecdotally is that they're storing

3656
01:03:25,109 --> 01:03:25,119
anecdotally is that they're storing
 

3657
01:03:25,119 --> 01:03:27,990
anecdotally is that they're storing
stuff up you know when they can right um

3658
01:03:27,990 --> 01:03:28,000
stuff up you know when they can right um
 

3659
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,230
stuff up you know when they can right um
which is that's not that's probably not

3660
01:03:30,230 --> 01:03:30,240
which is that's not that's probably not
 

3661
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:32,630
which is that's not that's probably not
sustainable right i mean at some point

3662
01:03:32,630 --> 01:03:32,640
sustainable right i mean at some point
 

3663
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:33,990
sustainable right i mean at some point
somebody in that corporate boardroom is

3664
01:03:33,990 --> 01:03:34,000
somebody in that corporate boardroom is
 

3665
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:35,270
somebody in that corporate boardroom is
going to say

3666
01:03:35,270 --> 01:03:35,280
going to say
 

3667
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:36,630
going to say
you know guys inventory is getting kind

3668
01:03:36,630 --> 01:03:36,640
you know guys inventory is getting kind
 

3669
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:38,390
you know guys inventory is getting kind
of heavy the cost of that is like do we

3670
01:03:38,390 --> 01:03:38,400
of heavy the cost of that is like do we
 

3671
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:39,910
of heavy the cost of that is like do we
can we really justify that much longer

3672
01:03:39,910 --> 01:03:39,920
can we really justify that much longer
 

3673
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:42,069
can we really justify that much longer
to the shareholders right um we should

3674
01:03:42,069 --> 01:03:42,079
to the shareholders right um we should
 

3675
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:43,670
to the shareholders right um we should
we can back off and start you know back

3676
01:03:43,670 --> 01:03:43,680
we can back off and start you know back
 

3677
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:45,430
we can back off and start you know back
things are back to normal let's lean out

3678

2016 or so that was that was the sort of
big question out there and that that's

3774
01:05:35,510 --> 01:05:35,520
big question out there and that that's
 

3775
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:36,549
big question out there and that that's
actually how i

3776

actually how i
 

3777
01:05:36,559 --> 01:05:38,789
actually how i
started studying it right i just wrapped

analyses right yeah and reached out to
 

3877
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:12,150
analyses right yeah and reached out to
me and was like what do you think of

3878
01:07:12,150 --> 01:07:12,160
me and was like what do you think of
 

3879
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:13,829
me and was like what do you think of
this and i said the industry's super

3880
01:07:13,829 --> 01:07:13,839
this and i said the industry's super
 

3881
01:07:13,839 --> 01:07:15,349
this and i said the industry's super
diverse you know this is just i haven't

3882
01:07:15,349 --> 01:07:15,359
diverse you know this is just i haven't
 

3883
01:07:15,359 --> 01:07:17,270
diverse you know this is just i haven't
given a ton of thought but it can't be

3884
01:07:17,270 --> 01:07:17,280
given a ton of thought but it can't be
 

3885
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:19,109
given a ton of thought but it can't be
that you know it's not that simple you

3886
01:07:19,109 --> 01:07:19,119
that you know it's not that simple you
 

3887
01:07:19,119 --> 01:07:21,750
that you know it's not that simple you
know it never is um and so she was like

3888
01:07:21,750 --> 01:07:21,760
know it never is um and so she was like
 

3889
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:24,150
know it never is um and so she was like
well you you know will you do this and i

3890
01:07:24,150 --> 01:07:24,160
well you you know will you do this and i
 

3891
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:25,510
well you you know will you do this and i
i was like ready to move on to another

3892
01:07:25,510 --> 01:07:25,520
i was like ready to move on to another
 

3893
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:26,870
i was like ready to move on to another
topic you know i had like been in

3894
01:07:26,870 --> 01:07:26,880
topic you know i had like been in
 

3895
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:29,270
topic you know i had like been in
trucking for 10 years um and that that's

3896
01:07:29,270 --> 01:07:29,280
trucking for 10 years um and that that's
 

3897
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:31,750
trucking for 10 years um and that that's
how it i started looking at it and it is

3898
01:07:31,750 --> 01:07:31,760
how it i started looking at it and it is
 

3899
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:35,430
how it i started looking at it and it is
it's a lot more complicated and the

3900
01:07:35,430 --> 01:07:35,440
it's a lot more complicated and the
 

3901
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:37,349
it's a lot more complicated and the
the initial impacts and here's the

3902
01:07:37,349 --> 01:07:37,359
the initial impacts and here's the
 

3903
01:07:37,359 --> 01:07:39,510
the initial impacts and here's the
challenge i think and it's not just a

3904
01:07:39,510 --> 01:07:39,520
challenge i think and it's not just a
 

3905
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:41,190
challenge i think and it's not just a
research challenge it's it's the

3906
01:07:41,190 --> 01:07:41,200
research challenge it's it's the
 

3907
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:44,470
research challenge it's it's the
fundamental public policy challenge is

3908
01:07:44,470 --> 01:07:44,480
fundamental public policy challenge is
 

3909
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:46,870
fundamental public policy challenge is
we look at the existing industry

3910
01:07:46,870 --> 01:07:46,880
we look at the existing industry
 

3911
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:49,910
we look at the existing industry
and the impacts the potential impacts

3912
01:07:49,910 --> 01:07:49,920
and the impacts the potential impacts
 

3913
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:51,349
and the impacts the potential impacts
they're not

3914
01:07:51,349 --> 01:07:51,359
they're not
 

3915
01:07:51,359 --> 01:07:52,950
they're not
you know nothing

3916
01:07:52,950 --> 01:07:52,960
you know nothing
 

3917
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:55,109
you know nothing
for for some communities and some kinds

3918
01:07:55,109 --> 01:07:55,119
for for some communities and some kinds
 

3919
01:07:55,119 --> 01:07:57,430
for for some communities and some kinds
of drivers they're going to be hard and

3920
01:07:57,430 --> 01:07:57,440
of drivers they're going to be hard and
 

3921
01:07:57,440 --> 01:07:58,870
of drivers they're going to be hard and
there and there are a significant number

3922
01:07:58,870 --> 01:07:58,880
there and there are a significant number
 

3923
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:00,789
there and there are a significant number
of them nowhere near what people thought

3924
01:08:00,789 --> 01:08:00,799
of them nowhere near what people thought
 

3925
01:08:00,799 --> 01:08:03,109
of them nowhere near what people thought
you know i i estimate like around 300

3926
01:08:03,109 --> 01:08:03,119
you know i i estimate like around 300
 

3927
01:08:03,119 --> 01:08:04,069
you know i i estimate like around 300
000

3928
01:08:04,069 --> 01:08:04,079
000
 

3929
01:08:04,079 --> 01:08:05,829
000
but that's a static picture of the

3930
01:08:05,829 --> 01:08:05,839
but that's a static picture of the
 

3931
01:08:05,839 --> 01:08:07,910
but that's a static picture of the
existing industry

3932
01:08:07,910 --> 01:08:07,920
existing industry
 

3933
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:11,430
existing industry
and here's the the key with this is

3934
01:08:11,430 --> 01:08:11,440
and here's the the key with this is
 

3935
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:12,789
and here's the the key with this is
at least in my

3936
01:08:12,789 --> 01:08:12,799
at least in my
 

3937
01:08:12,799 --> 01:08:14,470
at least in my
my conclusion is this is a

3938
01:08:14,470 --> 01:08:14,480
my conclusion is this is a
 

3939
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:17,189
my conclusion is this is a
transformative technology

3940
01:08:17,189 --> 01:08:17,199
transformative technology
 

3941
01:08:17,199 --> 01:08:19,590
transformative technology
we are not going to swap in

3942
01:08:19,590 --> 01:08:19,600
we are not going to swap in
 

3943
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:21,590
we are not going to swap in
self-driving trucks for human-driven

3944
01:08:21,590 --> 01:08:21,600
self-driving trucks for human-driven
 

3945
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:24,309
self-driving trucks for human-driven
trucks and all else stays the same this

3946
01:08:24,309 --> 01:08:24,319
trucks and all else stays the same this
 

3947
01:08:24,319 --> 01:08:27,269
trucks and all else stays the same this
is going to reshape our supply chains

3948
01:08:27,269 --> 01:08:27,279
is going to reshape our supply chains
 

3949
01:08:27,279 --> 01:08:29,430
is going to reshape our supply chains
it's going to reshape landscapes it's

3950
01:08:29,430 --> 01:08:29,440
it's going to reshape landscapes it's
 

3951
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:31,349
it's going to reshape landscapes it's
going to affect our ability to fight

3952
01:08:31,349 --> 01:08:31,359
going to affect our ability to fight
 

3953
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:33,590
going to affect our ability to fight
climate change

3954
01:08:33,590 --> 01:08:33,600
climate change
 

3955
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:36,070
climate change
this is a really important technology in

3956
01:08:36,070 --> 01:08:36,080
this is a really important technology in
 

3957
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:38,709
this is a really important technology in
this space do you think it's possible to

3958
01:08:38,709 --> 01:08:38,719
this space do you think it's possible to
 

3959
01:08:38,719 --> 01:08:41,269
this space do you think it's possible to
predict the future

3960
01:08:41,269 --> 01:08:41,279
predict the future
 

3961
01:08:41,279 --> 01:08:42,070
predict the future
of

3962
01:08:42,070 --> 01:08:42,080
of
 

3963
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:44,309
of
the kind of opportunities it will create

3964
01:08:44,309 --> 01:08:44,319
the kind of opportunities it will create
 

3965
01:08:44,319 --> 01:08:46,630
the kind of opportunities it will create
how it will change the world

3966
01:08:46,630 --> 01:08:46,640
how it will change the world
 

3967
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:50,149
how it will change the world
so like when you have the internet

3968
01:08:50,149 --> 01:08:50,159
so like when you have the internet
 

3969
01:08:50,159 --> 01:08:52,070
so like when you have the internet
you can start saying like all the kind

3970
01:08:52,070 --> 01:08:52,080
you can start saying like all the kind
 

3971
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:54,709
you can start saying like all the kind
of ways that office work all jobs will

3972
01:08:54,709 --> 01:08:54,719
of ways that office work all jobs will
 

3973
01:08:54,719 --> 01:08:57,030
of ways that office work all jobs will
be lost because it's easy to network and

3974
01:08:57,030 --> 01:08:57,040
be lost because it's easy to network and
 

3975
01:08:57,040 --> 01:08:57,910
be lost because it's easy to network and
then

3976
01:08:57,910 --> 01:08:57,920
then
 

3977
01:08:57,920 --> 01:08:59,269
then
software engineering allows you to

3978
01:08:59,269 --> 01:08:59,279
software engineering allows you to
 

3979
01:08:59,279 --> 01:09:01,189
software engineering allows you to
automate a lot of the tasks that

3980
01:09:01,189 --> 01:09:01,199
automate a lot of the tasks that
 

3981
01:09:01,199 --> 01:09:04,709
automate a lot of the tasks that
microsoft excel does you know

3982
01:09:04,709 --> 01:09:04,719
microsoft excel does you know
 

3983
01:09:04,719 --> 01:09:07,910
microsoft excel does you know
but it opened up so many opportunities

3984
01:09:07,910 --> 01:09:07,920
but it opened up so many opportunities
 

3985
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:09,510
but it opened up so many opportunities
even with things that are difficult to

3986
01:09:09,510 --> 01:09:09,520
even with things that are difficult to
 

3987
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:11,269
even with things that are difficult to
imagine like with the internet i don't

3988
01:09:11,269 --> 01:09:11,279
imagine like with the internet i don't
 

3989
01:09:11,279 --> 01:09:13,829
imagine like with the internet i don't
know wikipedia which is widely making

3990
01:09:13,829 --> 01:09:13,839
know wikipedia which is widely making
 

3991
01:09:13,839 --> 01:09:17,669
know wikipedia which is widely making
accessible information and that uh

3992
01:09:17,669 --> 01:09:17,679
accessible information and that uh
 

3993
01:09:17,679 --> 01:09:20,470
accessible information and that uh
increased the general education globally

3994
01:09:20,470 --> 01:09:20,480
increased the general education globally
 

3995
01:09:20,480 --> 01:09:22,789
increased the general education globally
by a lot all those kinds of things like

3996
01:09:22,789 --> 01:09:22,799
by a lot all those kinds of things like
 

3997
01:09:22,799 --> 01:09:25,269
by a lot all those kinds of things like
and then the the ripple effects of that

3998
01:09:25,269 --> 01:09:25,279
and then the the ripple effects of that
 

3999
01:09:25,279 --> 01:09:27,110
and then the the ripple effects of that
in terms of your ability to

4000
01:09:27,110 --> 01:09:27,120
in terms of your ability to
 

4001
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:28,950
in terms of your ability to
find other jobs

4002
01:09:28,950 --> 01:09:28,960
find other jobs
 

4003
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:32,390
find other jobs
is probably immeasurable so is it is it

4004
01:09:32,390 --> 01:09:32,400
is probably immeasurable so is it is it
 

4005
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:34,870
is probably immeasurable so is it is it
just a hopeless pursuit to try to

4006
01:09:34,870 --> 01:09:34,880
just a hopeless pursuit to try to
 

4007
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:36,309
just a hopeless pursuit to try to
predict

4008
01:09:36,309 --> 01:09:36,319
predict
 

4009
01:09:36,319 --> 01:09:38,789
predict
uh if uh you talk about these six

4010
01:09:38,789 --> 01:09:38,799
uh if uh you talk about these six
 

4011
01:09:38,799 --> 01:09:41,590
uh if uh you talk about these six
different uh trajectories that we might

4012
01:09:41,590 --> 01:09:41,600
different uh trajectories that we might
 

4013
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:42,390
different uh trajectories that we might
take

4014
01:09:42,390 --> 01:09:42,400
take
 

4015
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:45,269
take
in automating trucks but like as a

4016
01:09:45,269 --> 01:09:45,279
in automating trucks but like as a
 

4017
01:09:45,279 --> 01:09:47,669
in automating trucks but like as a
result of taking those trajectories is

4018
01:09:47,669 --> 01:09:47,679
result of taking those trajectories is
 

4019
01:09:47,679 --> 01:09:49,189
result of taking those trajectories is
it a hopeless pursuit to predict what

4020
01:09:49,189 --> 01:09:49,199
it a hopeless pursuit to predict what
 

4021
01:09:49,199 --> 01:09:51,590
it a hopeless pursuit to predict what
the future will result in yeah

4022
01:09:51,590 --> 01:09:51,600
the future will result in yeah
 

4023
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:52,950
the future will result in yeah
it is

4024
01:09:52,950 --> 01:09:52,960
it is
 

4025
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:55,430
it is
it absolutely is because it's the wrong

4026
01:09:55,430 --> 01:09:55,440
it absolutely is because it's the wrong
 

4027
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:58,070
it absolutely is because it's the wrong
question yeah the question is

4028
01:09:58,070 --> 01:09:58,080
question yeah the question is
 

4029
01:09:58,080 --> 01:09:59,270
question yeah the question is
what do we want the future to be and

4030
01:09:59,270 --> 01:09:59,280
what do we want the future to be and
 

4031
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:01,030
what do we want the future to be and
let's shape it

4032
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:01,040
let's shape it
 

4033
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:03,990
let's shape it
right um and and i think this is you

4034
01:10:03,990 --> 01:10:04,000
right um and and i think this is you
 

4035
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,149
right um and and i think this is you
know and this is the only point that i

4036
01:10:06,149 --> 01:10:06,159
know and this is the only point that i
 

4037
01:10:06,159 --> 01:10:08,229
know and this is the only point that i
really want to make in my work you know

4038
01:10:08,229 --> 01:10:08,239
really want to make in my work you know
 

4039
01:10:08,239 --> 01:10:10,310
really want to make in my work you know
for the foreseeable future

4040
01:10:10,310 --> 01:10:10,320
for the foreseeable future
 

4041
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:12,229
for the foreseeable future
is that you know

4042
01:10:12,229 --> 01:10:12,239
is that you know
 

4043
01:10:12,239 --> 01:10:15,350
is that you know
we have got to get out of this

4044
01:10:15,350 --> 01:10:15,360
we have got to get out of this
 

4045
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:16,470
we have got to get out of this
mindset

4046
01:10:16,470 --> 01:10:16,480
mindset
 

4047
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:18,790
mindset
that we're just going to let technology

4048
01:10:18,790 --> 01:10:18,800
that we're just going to let technology
 

4049
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:19,910
that we're just going to let technology
kind of

4050
01:10:19,910 --> 01:10:19,920
kind of
 

4051
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:21,510
kind of
go and it's a natural process and

4052
01:10:21,510 --> 01:10:21,520
go and it's a natural process and
 

4053
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:23,350
go and it's a natural process and
whatever pops out will fix the problems

4054
01:10:23,350 --> 01:10:23,360
whatever pops out will fix the problems
 

4055
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:25,830
whatever pops out will fix the problems
on the back side and and and we've got

4056
01:10:25,830 --> 01:10:25,840
on the back side and and and we've got
 

4057
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:28,790
on the back side and and and we've got
to recognize that one that's not what we

4058
01:10:28,790 --> 01:10:28,800
to recognize that one that's not what we
 

4059
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:29,590
to recognize that one that's not what we
do

4060
01:10:29,590 --> 01:10:29,600
do
 

4061
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:32,630
do
right um you know and self-driving

4062
01:10:32,630 --> 01:10:32,640
right um you know and self-driving
 

4063
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:34,709
right um you know and self-driving
vehicles is just such a perfect example

4064
01:10:34,709 --> 01:10:34,719
vehicles is just such a perfect example
 

4065
01:10:34,719 --> 01:10:37,030
vehicles is just such a perfect example
right we would not be sitting here today

4066
01:10:37,030 --> 01:10:37,040
right we would not be sitting here today
 

4067
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:38,630
right we would not be sitting here today
if the defense department right if

4068
01:10:38,630 --> 01:10:38,640
if the defense department right if

congress
 

4071
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:44,229
congress
in 2000 had not written into legislation

4072

01:10:47,030 --> 01:10:47,040
funding for the darpa challenges which
 

4075
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:48,709
funding for the darpa challenges which
followed actually i think the funding

4076
01:10:48,709 --> 01:10:48,719
followed actually i think the funding
 

4077
01:10:48,719 --> 01:10:50,390
followed actually i think the funding
came a couple years later but the

4078
01:10:50,390 --> 01:10:50,400
came a couple years later but the
 

4079
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:52,870
came a couple years later but the
priority that they wrote in 2000 was

4080
01:10:52,870 --> 01:10:52,880
priority that they wrote in 2000 was
 

4081
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:55,430
priority that they wrote in 2000 was
let's get a third of all ground vehicles

4082
01:10:55,430 --> 01:10:55,440
let's get a third of all ground vehicles
 

4083
01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:58,229
let's get a third of all ground vehicles
in our military forces unmanned right

4084
01:10:58,229 --> 01:10:58,239
in our military forces unmanned right
 

4085
01:10:58,239 --> 01:10:59,990
in our military forces unmanned right
and this was before

4086
01:10:59,990 --> 01:11:00,000
and this was before
 

4087
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,990
and this was before
aerial unmanned vehicles had really sort

4088
01:11:01,990 --> 01:11:02,000
aerial unmanned vehicles had really sort
 

4089
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,270
aerial unmanned vehicles had really sort
of proven their worth they would come to

4090
01:11:03,270 --> 01:11:03,280
of proven their worth they would come to
 

4091
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:05,430
of proven their worth they would come to
be incredibly like you know just blow

4092
01:11:05,430 --> 01:11:05,440
be incredibly like you know just blow
 

4093
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:06,709
be incredibly like you know just blow
people out of the

4094

people out of the

people out of the
blow people's minds in terms of their

01:11:12,950 --> 01:11:12,960
you know keeping you know uh soldiers
 

4101
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:14,149
you know keeping you know uh soldiers
out of harm's way now of course they

4102
01:11:14,149 --> 01:11:14,159
out of harm's way now of course they
 

4103
01:11:14,159 --> 01:11:16,310
out of harm's way now of course they
raised other problems and considerations

4104
01:11:16,310 --> 01:11:16,320
raised other problems and considerations
 

4105
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:17,510
raised other problems and considerations
that i think we're still wrestling with

4106
01:11:17,510 --> 01:11:17,520
that i think we're still wrestling with
 

4107
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:18,310
that i think we're still wrestling with
but

4108
01:11:18,310 --> 01:11:18,320
but
 

4109
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:19,910
but
that was even before that they had this

4110
01:11:19,910 --> 01:11:19,920
that was even before that they had this
 

4111
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:21,030
that was even before that they had this
priority

4112
01:11:21,030 --> 01:11:21,040
priority
 

4113
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:22,790
priority
we would not be sitting here today if

4114
01:11:22,790 --> 01:11:22,800
we would not be sitting here today if
 

4115
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:25,030
we would not be sitting here today if
congress in 2000 had not said let's

4116
01:11:25,030 --> 01:11:25,040
congress in 2000 had not said let's
 

4117
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:27,270
congress in 2000 had not said let's
bring this about

4118
01:11:27,270 --> 01:11:27,280
bring this about
 

4119
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:28,950
bring this about
so they already had that vision actually

4120
01:11:28,950 --> 01:11:28,960
so they already had that vision actually
 

4121
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:30,470
so they already had that vision actually
i didn't know about that so for people

4122
01:11:30,470 --> 01:11:30,480
i didn't know about that so for people
 

4123
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:32,630
i didn't know about that so for people
who don't know the upper challenges

4124
01:11:32,630 --> 01:11:32,640
who don't know the upper challenges
 

4125
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:33,750
who don't know the upper challenges
is the

4126
01:11:33,750 --> 01:11:33,760
is the
 

4127
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:36,229
is the
the events that were just kind of like

4128
01:11:36,229 --> 01:11:36,239
the events that were just kind of like
 

4129
01:11:36,239 --> 01:11:37,350
the events that were just kind of like
these

4130
01:11:37,350 --> 01:11:37,360
these
 

4131
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:39,669
these
seemingly small scale challenges that

4132
01:11:39,669 --> 01:11:39,679
seemingly small scale challenges that
 

4133
01:11:39,679 --> 01:11:40,950
seemingly small scale challenges that
brought together some of the smartest

4134
01:11:40,950 --> 01:11:40,960
brought together some of the smartest
 

4135
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:42,790
brought together some of the smartest
roboticists in the world and that

4136
01:11:42,790 --> 01:11:42,800
roboticists in the world and that
 

4137
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:45,430
roboticists in the world and that
somehow created enough of a magic

4138
01:11:45,430 --> 01:11:45,440
somehow created enough of a magic
 

4139
01:11:45,440 --> 01:11:47,030
somehow created enough of a magic
where uh

4140
01:11:47,030 --> 01:11:47,040
where uh
 

4141
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:49,910
where uh
ideas flourished both engineering and

4142
01:11:49,910 --> 01:11:49,920
ideas flourished both engineering and
 

4143
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:51,430
ideas flourished both engineering and

that eventually then
 

4147
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:55,270
that eventually then
uh was the catalyst for creating all

4148
01:11:55,270 --> 01:11:55,280
uh was the catalyst for creating all
 

4149
01:11:55,280 --> 01:11:56,630
uh was the catalyst for creating all
these different companies that took on

yeah i did not know that that's

4190
01:12:36,310 --> 01:12:36,320
yeah i did not know that that's
 

4191
01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:37,910
yeah i did not know that that's
interesting so they had the same kind of

interesting so they had the same kind of
 

4193
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:40,470
interesting so they had the same kind of
vision for the military as we're not

01:12:40,470 --> 01:12:40,480
vision for the military as we're not
 

4195
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:43,189
vision for the military as we're not
talking about a vision for the civilian

4196
01:12:43,189 --> 01:12:43,199
talking about a vision for the civilian

kind of application yeah i mean what an

4202
01:12:49,910 --> 01:12:49,920
kind of application yeah i mean what an
 

4203
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:52,149
kind of application yeah i mean what an
incredible spark right

4204
01:12:52,149 --> 01:12:52,159
incredible spark right
 

4205
01:12:52,159 --> 01:12:52,950
incredible spark right
um

4206
01:12:52,950 --> 01:12:52,960
um
 

4207
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:56,070
um
and and it just the story of

4208
01:12:56,070 --> 01:12:56,080
and and it just the story of
 

4209
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:58,550
and and it just the story of
what it produced right i mean

4210
01:12:58,550 --> 01:12:58,560
what it produced right i mean
 

4211
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:01,110
what it produced right i mean
um your own work on self-driving right i

4212
01:13:01,110 --> 01:13:01,120
um your own work on self-driving right i
 

4213
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:02,870
um your own work on self-driving right i
mean you you've studied it as an

4214
01:13:02,870 --> 01:13:02,880
mean you you've studied it as an
 

4215
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:05,669
mean you you've studied it as an
academic right how many great

4216
01:13:05,669 --> 01:13:05,679
academic right how many great
 

4217
01:13:05,679 --> 01:13:07,270
academic right how many great
researchers and minds have been

4218
01:13:07,270 --> 01:13:07,280
researchers and minds have been
 

4219
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:08,470
researchers and minds have been
harnessed

4220
01:13:08,470 --> 01:13:08,480
harnessed
 

4221
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:11,270
harnessed
by this outcome of that spark right and

4222
01:13:11,270 --> 01:13:11,280
by this outcome of that spark right and
 

4223
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:13,270
by this outcome of that spark right and
i think this is sort of theoretically

4224
01:13:13,270 --> 01:13:13,280
i think this is sort of theoretically
 

4225
01:13:13,280 --> 01:13:14,550
i think this is sort of theoretically
about technology right this is what

4226
01:13:14,550 --> 01:13:14,560
about technology right this is what
 

4227
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:17,030
about technology right this is what
makes it so great is that it's what

4228
01:13:17,030 --> 01:13:17,040
makes it so great is that it's what
 

4229
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:18,470
makes it so great is that it's what
makes us human in my opinion right is

4230
01:13:18,470 --> 01:13:18,480
makes us human in my opinion right is
 

4231
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:19,350
makes us human in my opinion right is
that you

4232
01:13:19,350 --> 01:13:19,360
that you
 

4233
01:13:19,360 --> 01:13:21,189
that you
you conceive of something in your mind

4234
01:13:21,189 --> 01:13:21,199
you conceive of something in your mind
 

4235
01:13:21,199 --> 01:13:23,430
you conceive of something in your mind
and then you bring it into reality right

4236
01:13:23,430 --> 01:13:23,440
and then you bring it into reality right
 

4237
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:25,830
and then you bring it into reality right
i mean that that's what is so great

4238
01:13:25,830 --> 01:13:25,840
i mean that that's what is so great
 

4239
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:28,550
i mean that that's what is so great
about it um sometimes you're too dumb to

4240
01:13:28,550 --> 01:13:28,560
about it um sometimes you're too dumb to
 

4241
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:31,430
about it um sometimes you're too dumb to
realize how difficult it

4242
01:13:31,430 --> 01:13:31,440
realize how difficult it
 

4243
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:33,350
realize how difficult it
right is then eventually you're you're

4244
01:13:33,350 --> 01:13:33,360
right is then eventually you're you're
 

4245
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:34,870
right is then eventually you're you're
too uh

4246
01:13:34,870 --> 01:13:34,880
too uh
 

4247
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:36,630
too uh
you're in too deep

4248
01:13:36,630 --> 01:13:36,640
you're in too deep
 

4249
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:39,110
you're in too deep
you might as well solve the problem well

4250
01:13:39,110 --> 01:13:39,120
you might as well solve the problem well
 

4251
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:40,950
you might as well solve the problem well
and maybe we're in that situation right

4252
01:13:40,950 --> 01:13:40,960
and maybe we're in that situation right
 

4253
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:43,110
and maybe we're in that situation right
now with self-driving but you know and

4254
01:13:43,110 --> 01:13:43,120
now with self-driving but you know and
 

4255
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:44,950
now with self-driving but you know and
so let me throw this out there i i'd be

4256
01:13:44,950 --> 01:13:44,960
so let me throw this out there i i'd be
 

4257
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:46,470
so let me throw this out there i i'd be
curious to hear your thoughts on it but

4258
01:13:46,470 --> 01:13:46,480
curious to hear your thoughts on it but
 

4259
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:48,630
curious to hear your thoughts on it but
uh the truck drivers always always ask

4260
01:13:48,630 --> 01:13:48,640
uh the truck drivers always always ask
 

4261
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:50,390
uh the truck drivers always always ask
me like is this for real like is this

4262
01:13:50,390 --> 01:13:50,400
me like is this for real like is this
 

4263
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:52,390
me like is this for real like is this
really do like it's harder than they

4264
01:13:52,390 --> 01:13:52,400
really do like it's harder than they
 

4265
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:54,149
really do like it's harder than they
think like right and they're they can't

4266
01:13:54,149 --> 01:13:54,159
think like right and they're they can't
 

4267
01:13:54,159 --> 01:13:55,590
think like right and they're they can't
really do this

4268
01:13:55,590 --> 01:13:55,600
really do this
 

4269
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:58,550
really do this
and you know at first i was like look

and you know at first i was like look
you know this is like the defense

4272
01:14:00,630 --> 01:14:00,640
you know this is like the defense
 

4273
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:03,350
you know this is like the defense
department and like basically the top

4274
01:14:03,350 --> 01:14:03,360
department and like basically the top
 

4275

right
and what i tell them is like if the if

4292
01:14:27,510 --> 01:14:27,520
and what i tell them is like if the if
 

4293
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:31,030
and what i tell them is like if the if
if self-driving vehicles don't happen

4294
01:14:31,030 --> 01:14:31,040
if self-driving vehicles don't happen
 

4295
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:33,030
if self-driving vehicles don't happen
i think this will be the biggest

4296
01:14:33,030 --> 01:14:33,040
i think this will be the biggest
 

4297
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:34,950
i think this will be the biggest
technology failure story in human

4298

anything else that is just galvanized i
mean you've had people in garages or

4304
01:14:41,830 --> 01:14:41,840
mean you've had people in garages or
 

4305
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:43,430

weird inventors work on things their

4306
01:14:43,430 --> 01:14:43,440
weird inventors work on things their
 

4307
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:45,110
weird inventors work on things their
whole lives and come really close and it

4308
01:14:45,110 --> 01:14:45,120
whole lives and come really close and it
 

4309
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:46,870
whole lives and come really close and it
never happens and it's a great failure

4310
01:14:46,870 --> 01:14:46,880
never happens and it's a great failure
 

4311
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:49,750
never happens and it's a great failure
story right but never have we had like

4312
01:14:49,750 --> 01:14:49,760
story right but never have we had like
 

4313
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:52,470
story right but never have we had like
whole i mean we're talking about gm

right and these are not you know these
 

4317
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:56,470
right and these are not you know these
are not tech companies right these are

01:14:56,480 --> 01:14:59,189
are not tech companies right these are
industrial giants right what what were

4320
01:14:59,189 --> 01:14:59,199
industrial giants right what what were
 

4321
01:14:59,199 --> 01:15:01,350
industrial giants right what what were
in the 20th century the pinnacle of

4322

in the 20th century the pinnacle of
 

4323
01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:03,189
in the 20th century the pinnacle of
industrial production in the world in

industrial production in the world in
 

4325
01:15:03,199 --> 01:15:04,470
industrial production in the world in
human history

4326
01:15:04,470 --> 01:15:04,480
human history
 

4327
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:07,430
human history
right and they're focused on it now so

4328
01:15:07,430 --> 01:15:07,440
right and they're focused on it now so
 

4329
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:08,149
right and they're focused on it now so
if

4330
01:15:08,149 --> 01:15:08,159
if
 

4331
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:10,550
if
we don't pull this off it's like

4332
01:15:10,550 --> 01:15:10,560
we don't pull this off it's like
 

4333
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:12,550
we don't pull this off it's like
wow it's fascinating to think about i've

4334
01:15:12,550 --> 01:15:12,560
wow it's fascinating to think about i've
 

4335
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:14,709
wow it's fascinating to think about i've
never thought of it that way i there was

4336
01:15:14,709 --> 01:15:14,719
never thought of it that way i there was
 

4337
01:15:14,719 --> 01:15:16,709
never thought of it that way i there was
a mass hysteria

4338
01:15:16,709 --> 01:15:16,719
a mass hysteria
 

4339
01:15:16,719 --> 01:15:19,669
a mass hysteria
oh on a level in terms of excitement and

4340
01:15:19,669 --> 01:15:19,679
oh on a level in terms of excitement and
 

4341
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:21,510
oh on a level in terms of excitement and
hype on a level that's probably

4342
01:15:21,510 --> 01:15:21,520
hype on a level that's probably
 

4343
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:23,750
hype on a level that's probably
unparalleled in technology space like

4344
01:15:23,750 --> 01:15:23,760
unparalleled in technology space like
 

4345
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:25,430
unparalleled in technology space like
i've seen that kind of hysteria just

4346
01:15:25,430 --> 01:15:25,440
i've seen that kind of hysteria just
 

4347
01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:27,189
i've seen that kind of hysteria just
studying history when you talk about

4348
01:15:27,189 --> 01:15:27,199
studying history when you talk about
 

4349
01:15:27,199 --> 01:15:30,550
studying history when you talk about
military conflict so we often wage war

4350
01:15:30,550 --> 01:15:30,560
military conflict so we often wage war
 

4351
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:32,550
military conflict so we often wage war
with a dream of making a better world

4352
01:15:32,550 --> 01:15:32,560
with a dream of making a better world
 

4353
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:34,149
with a dream of making a better world
and then realize it cost trillions of

4354
01:15:34,149 --> 01:15:34,159
and then realize it cost trillions of
 

4355
01:15:34,159 --> 01:15:36,550
and then realize it cost trillions of
dollars and then we step back and like

4356
01:15:36,550 --> 01:15:36,560
dollars and then we step back and like
 

4357
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:38,390
dollars and then we step back and like
and go wait a minute what do we actually

4358
01:15:38,390 --> 01:15:38,400
and go wait a minute what do we actually
 

4359
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:39,110
and go wait a minute what do we actually
get

4360
01:15:39,110 --> 01:15:39,120
get
 

4361
01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:39,990
get
for this

4362
01:15:39,990 --> 01:15:40,000
for this
 

4363
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:41,750
for this
but in the space of technology it seems

4364
01:15:41,750 --> 01:15:41,760
but in the space of technology it seems
 

4365
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:43,990
but in the space of technology it seems
like all these kind of large efforts

4366
01:15:43,990 --> 01:15:44,000
like all these kind of large efforts
 

4367
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:45,510
like all these kind of large efforts
have paid off

4368
01:15:45,510 --> 01:15:45,520
have paid off
 

4369
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:46,950
have paid off
this you're right

4370
01:15:46,950 --> 01:15:46,960
this you're right
 

4371
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:49,669
this you're right
it seems like um

4372
01:15:49,669 --> 01:15:49,679
it seems like um
 

4373
01:15:49,679 --> 01:15:51,430
it seems like um
it seems like giving gm and ford and all

4374
01:15:51,430 --> 01:15:51,440
it seems like giving gm and ford and all
 

4375
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:53,510
it seems like giving gm and ford and all
these companies now are a little bit

4376
01:15:53,510 --> 01:15:53,520
these companies now are a little bit
 

4377
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:54,390
these companies now are a little bit
like

4378
01:15:54,390 --> 01:15:54,400
like
 

4379
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:58,550
like
hey um or toyota and uh even tesla

4380
01:15:58,550 --> 01:15:58,560
hey um or toyota and uh even tesla
 

4381
01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:01,669
hey um or toyota and uh even tesla
like are we uh are we sure about this

4382
01:16:01,669 --> 01:16:01,679
like are we uh are we sure about this
 

4383
01:16:01,679 --> 01:16:02,550
like are we uh are we sure about this
yeah

4384
01:16:02,550 --> 01:16:02,560
yeah
 

4385
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:04,310
yeah
and it's fascinating to think about when

4386
01:16:04,310 --> 01:16:04,320
and it's fascinating to think about when
 

4387
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:06,470
and it's fascinating to think about when
you tell the story of this this could be

4388
01:16:06,470 --> 01:16:06,480
you tell the story of this this could be
 

4389
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:08,470
you tell the story of this this could be
one of the big

4390
01:16:08,470 --> 01:16:08,480
one of the big
 

4391
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:10,229
one of the big
the first perhaps

4392
01:16:10,229 --> 01:16:10,239
the first perhaps
 

4393
01:16:10,239 --> 01:16:13,030
the first perhaps
but by far the biggest failures of the

4394
01:16:13,030 --> 01:16:13,040
but by far the biggest failures of the
 

4395
01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:13,990
but by far the biggest failures of the
dream

4396
01:16:13,990 --> 01:16:14,000
dream
 

4397
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,070
dream
in the space of technology

4398
01:16:16,070 --> 01:16:16,080
in the space of technology
 

4399
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:17,750
in the space of technology
that's really interesting to think about

4400
01:16:17,750 --> 01:16:17,760
that's really interesting to think about
 

4401
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:20,870
that's really interesting to think about
i was a skeptic for a long time

4402
01:16:20,870 --> 01:16:20,880
i was a skeptic for a long time
 

4403
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:22,790
i was a skeptic for a long time
because of the human factor

4404
01:16:22,790 --> 01:16:22,800
because of the human factor
 

4405
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:24,630
because of the human factor
because for business to work in the

4406
01:16:24,630 --> 01:16:24,640
because for business to work in the
 

4407
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:26,229
because for business to work in the
space you have to work with humans and

4408
01:16:26,229 --> 01:16:26,239
space you have to work with humans and
 

4409
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:28,149
space you have to work with humans and
you have to work with humans at ever at

4410
01:16:28,149 --> 01:16:28,159
you have to work with humans at ever at
 

4411
01:16:28,159 --> 01:16:30,070
you have to work with humans at ever at
every level so in the truck driving

4412
01:16:30,070 --> 01:16:30,080
every level so in the truck driving
 

4413
01:16:30,080 --> 01:16:31,510
every level so in the truck driving
space you have to work with the truck

4414
01:16:31,510 --> 01:16:31,520
space you have to work with the truck
 

4415
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:33,430
space you have to work with the truck
driver but you also have to work with a

4416
01:16:33,430 --> 01:16:33,440
driver but you also have to work with a
 

4417
01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:35,430
driver but you also have to work with a
society that has a certain conception of

4418
01:16:35,430 --> 01:16:35,440
society that has a certain conception of
 

4419
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:37,669
society that has a certain conception of
what driving means and also have to have

4420
01:16:37,669 --> 01:16:37,679
what driving means and also have to have
 

4421
01:16:37,679 --> 01:16:39,350
what driving means and also have to have
work with businesses that are not used

4422
01:16:39,350 --> 01:16:39,360
work with businesses that are not used
 

4423
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:40,149
work with businesses that are not used
to

4424
01:16:40,149 --> 01:16:40,159
to
 

4425
01:16:40,159 --> 01:16:42,550
to
this extreme

4426
01:16:42,550 --> 01:16:42,560
this extreme
 

4427
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:45,030
this extreme
level of technology you know

4428
01:16:45,030 --> 01:16:45,040
level of technology you know
 

4429
01:16:45,040 --> 01:16:46,310
level of technology you know
in um

4430
01:16:46,310 --> 01:16:46,320
in um
 

4431
01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:48,390
in um
in the basic operation of their business

4432
01:16:48,390 --> 01:16:48,400
in the basic operation of their business
 

4433
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:49,590
in the basic operation of their business
so i thought it would be really

4434
01:16:49,590 --> 01:16:49,600
so i thought it would be really
 

4435
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:51,510
so i thought it would be really
difficult to uh to move to autonomous

4436
01:16:51,510 --> 01:16:51,520
difficult to uh to move to autonomous
 

4437
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:53,110
difficult to uh to move to autonomous
vehicles in that way

4438
01:16:53,110 --> 01:16:53,120
vehicles in that way
 

4439
01:16:53,120 --> 01:16:53,990
vehicles in that way
but

4440
01:16:53,990 --> 01:16:54,000
but
 

4441
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:55,590
but
then i realized that there's certain

4442
01:16:55,590 --> 01:16:55,600
then i realized that there's certain
 

4443
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:57,510
then i realized that there's certain
companies that are just

4444
01:16:57,510 --> 01:16:57,520
companies that are just
 

4445
01:16:57,520 --> 01:16:59,189
companies that are just
willing to take big risks and really

4446
01:16:59,189 --> 01:16:59,199
willing to take big risks and really
 

4447
01:16:59,199 --> 01:17:00,149
willing to take big risks and really
innovate

4448
01:17:00,149 --> 01:17:00,159
innovate
 

4449
01:17:00,159 --> 01:17:01,590
innovate
i think uh

4450
01:17:01,590 --> 01:17:01,600
i think uh
 

4451
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:03,750
i think uh
the first impressive company to me was

4452
01:17:03,750 --> 01:17:03,760
the first impressive company to me was
 

4453
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:05,750
the first impressive company to me was
waymo or what was used to be the google

4454
01:17:05,750 --> 01:17:05,760
waymo or what was used to be the google
 

4455
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:07,350
waymo or what was used to be the google
self-driving car

4456
01:17:07,350 --> 01:17:07,360
self-driving car
 

4457
01:17:07,360 --> 01:17:09,189
self-driving car
and and i saw

4458
01:17:09,189 --> 01:17:09,199
and and i saw
 

4459
01:17:09,199 --> 01:17:10,070
and and i saw
okay

4460
01:17:10,070 --> 01:17:10,080
okay
 

4461
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:11,910
okay
here's a company that's willing to

4462
01:17:11,910 --> 01:17:11,920
here's a company that's willing to
 

4463
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:14,310
here's a company that's willing to
really think long term and really try to

4464
01:17:14,310 --> 01:17:14,320
really think long term and really try to
 

4465
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:17,669
really think long term and really try to
solve this problem hire great engineers

4466
01:17:17,669 --> 01:17:17,679
solve this problem hire great engineers
 

4467
01:17:17,679 --> 01:17:21,270
solve this problem hire great engineers
uh then i saw tesla with mobile eye when

4468
01:17:21,270 --> 01:17:21,280
uh then i saw tesla with mobile eye when
 

4469
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:23,590
uh then i saw tesla with mobile eye when
they first had i thought would actually

4470
01:17:23,590 --> 01:17:23,600
they first had i thought would actually
 

4471
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:25,590
they first had i thought would actually
mobilize the thing that impressed me

4472
01:17:25,590 --> 01:17:25,600
mobilize the thing that impressed me
 

4473
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:27,350
mobilize the thing that impressed me
when i sat down i thought because i'm a

4474
01:17:27,350 --> 01:17:27,360
when i sat down i thought because i'm a
 

4475
01:17:27,360 --> 01:17:28,790
when i sat down i thought because i'm a
computer vision person i thought there's

4476
01:17:28,790 --> 01:17:28,800
computer vision person i thought there's
 

4477
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:30,630
computer vision person i thought there's
no way

4478
01:17:30,630 --> 01:17:30,640
no way
 

4479
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:33,430
no way
a system could keep me in lane

4480
01:17:33,430 --> 01:17:33,440

keyboard decision

4642
01:20:13,189 --> 01:20:13,199
keyboard decision
 

4643
01:20:13,199 --> 01:20:15,510
keyboard decision
but then you later realize

4644
01:20:15,510 --> 01:20:15,520
but then you later realize
 

4645
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:17,750
but then you later realize
by removing the keyboard

4646
01:20:17,750 --> 01:20:17,760
by removing the keyboard
 

4647
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:21,030
by removing the keyboard
you're enabling a whole ecosystem of

4648
01:20:21,030 --> 01:20:21,040
you're enabling a whole ecosystem of
 

4649
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:23,030
you're enabling a whole ecosystem of
technologies that are inside the phone

4650
01:20:23,030 --> 01:20:23,040
technologies that are inside the phone
 

4651
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:24,310
technologies that are inside the phone
and now you're making the smartphone

4652
01:20:24,310 --> 01:20:24,320
and now you're making the smartphone
 

4653
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:27,270
and now you're making the smartphone
into a computer and that same way

4654
01:20:27,270 --> 01:20:27,280
into a computer and that same way
 

4655
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:29,910
into a computer and that same way
who knows how you can transform trucks

4656
01:20:29,910 --> 01:20:29,920
who knows how you can transform trucks
 

4657
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:31,990
who knows how you can transform trucks
right by like automating some parts of

4658
01:20:31,990 --> 01:20:32,000
right by like automating some parts of
 

4659
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,790
right by like automating some parts of
it maybe uh adding

4660
01:20:34,790 --> 01:20:34,800
it maybe uh adding
 

4661
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:37,590
it maybe uh adding
some uh displays maybe it allows you to

4662
01:20:37,590 --> 01:20:37,600
some uh displays maybe it allows you to
 

4663
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:39,990
some uh displays maybe it allows you to
maybe giving the the truck driver some

4664
01:20:39,990 --> 01:20:40,000
maybe giving the the truck driver some
 

4665
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,470
maybe giving the the truck driver some
control in the supply chain to make

4666
01:20:42,470 --> 01:20:42,480
control in the supply chain to make
 

4667
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:45,350
control in the supply chain to make
decisions all those kinds of things yeah

4668
01:20:45,350 --> 01:20:45,360
decisions all those kinds of things yeah
 

4669
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:48,229
decisions all those kinds of things yeah
uh so i don't know so what's where where

4670
01:20:48,229 --> 01:20:48,239
uh so i don't know so what's where where
 

4671
01:20:48,239 --> 01:20:49,910
uh so i don't know so what's where where
are you on the

4672
01:20:49,910 --> 01:20:49,920
are you on the
 

4673
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:51,590
are you on the
spectrum of hope

4674
01:20:51,590 --> 01:20:51,600
spectrum of hope
 

4675
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:52,629
spectrum of hope
for

4676
01:20:52,629 --> 01:20:52,639
for
 

4677
01:20:52,639 --> 01:20:56,790
for
uh the role of automation in trucking

4678
01:20:56,790 --> 01:20:56,800
uh the role of automation in trucking
 

4679
01:20:56,800 --> 01:20:59,430
uh the role of automation in trucking
i i think automation is is inevitable

4680
01:20:59,430 --> 01:20:59,440
i i think automation is is inevitable
 

4681
01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:02,629
i i think automation is is inevitable
and again i think the this is really

4682
01:21:02,629 --> 01:21:02,639
and again i think the this is really
 

4683
01:21:02,639 --> 01:21:05,030
and again i think the this is really
going to be transformative and it's

4684
01:21:05,030 --> 01:21:05,040
going to be transformative and it's
 

4685
01:21:05,040 --> 01:21:06,229
going to be transformative and it's
going to be

4686
01:21:06,229 --> 01:21:06,239
going to be
 

4687
01:21:06,239 --> 01:21:08,950
going to be
i i've studied the history of trucking

4688
01:21:08,950 --> 01:21:08,960
i i've studied the history of trucking
 

4689
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:10,790
i i've studied the history of trucking
technology as much as i can there you

4690
01:21:10,790 --> 01:21:10,800
technology as much as i can there you
 

4691
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:12,229
technology as much as i can there you
know there's not a lot a lot of great

4692
01:21:12,229 --> 01:21:12,239
know there's not a lot a lot of great
 

4693
01:21:12,239 --> 01:21:13,990
know there's not a lot a lot of great
stuff written and you kind of have to

4694
01:21:13,990 --> 01:21:14,000
stuff written and you kind of have to
 

4695
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:15,990
stuff written and you kind of have to
you know uh there's a lot of data and

4696
01:21:15,990 --> 01:21:16,000
you know uh there's a lot of data and
 

4697
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:17,910
you know uh there's a lot of data and
places to know sort of volumes of stuff

4698
01:21:17,910 --> 01:21:17,920
places to know sort of volumes of stuff
 

4699
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:20,310
places to know sort of volumes of stuff
and how they're changing etc but

4700
01:21:20,310 --> 01:21:20,320
and how they're changing etc but
 

4701
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:21,510
and how they're changing etc but
the big

4702
01:21:21,510 --> 01:21:21,520
the big
 

4703
01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:25,030
the big
revolutionary changes in in trucking are

4704
01:21:25,030 --> 01:21:25,040
revolutionary changes in in trucking are
 

4705
01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:27,910
revolutionary changes in in trucking are
because of constellations of factors

4706
01:21:27,910 --> 01:21:27,920
because of constellations of factors
 

4707
01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:29,750
because of constellations of factors
it's it's not just one thing right so

4708
01:21:29,750 --> 01:21:29,760
it's it's not just one thing right so
 

4709
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:31,669
it's it's not just one thing right so
daimler builds you know a motorized

4710
01:21:31,669 --> 01:21:31,679
daimler builds you know a motorized
 

4711
01:21:31,679 --> 01:21:34,070
daimler builds you know a motorized
truck and i think it's 1896.

4712
01:21:34,070 --> 01:21:34,080
truck and i think it's 1896.
 

4713
01:21:34,080 --> 01:21:35,270
truck and i think it's 1896.
right um

4714
01:21:35,270 --> 01:21:35,280
right um
 

4715
01:21:35,280 --> 01:21:37,270
right um
intercities trucking

4716
01:21:37,270 --> 01:21:37,280
intercities trucking
 

4717
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:38,629
intercities trucking
that so basically what they use that

4718
01:21:38,629 --> 01:21:38,639
that so basically what they use that
 

4719
01:21:38,639 --> 01:21:40,870
that so basically what they use that
truck for is just to swap out horses

4720
01:21:40,870 --> 01:21:40,880
truck for is just to swap out horses
 

4721
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:42,790
truck for is just to swap out horses
right they basically do the same thing

4722
01:21:42,790 --> 01:21:42,800
right they basically do the same thing
 

4723
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:44,790
right they basically do the same thing
the service doesn't really change you

4724
01:21:44,790 --> 01:21:44,800
the service doesn't really change you
 

4725
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:47,669
the service doesn't really change you
know um and then world war one really

4726
01:21:47,669 --> 01:21:47,679
know um and then world war one really
 

4727
01:21:47,679 --> 01:21:49,990
know um and then world war one really
spurs the development of bigger larger

4728
01:21:49,990 --> 01:21:50,000
spurs the development of bigger larger
 

4729
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:53,189
spurs the development of bigger larger
trucks like spreads you know air air

4730
01:21:53,189 --> 01:21:53,199
trucks like spreads you know air air
 

4731
01:21:53,199 --> 01:21:55,590
trucks like spreads you know air air
filled tires and then

4732
01:21:55,590 --> 01:21:55,600
filled tires and then
 

4733
01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:57,430
filled tires and then
we start paving roads

4734
01:21:57,430 --> 01:21:57,440
we start paving roads
 

4735
01:21:57,440 --> 01:21:58,550
we start paving roads
right and

4736
01:21:58,550 --> 01:21:58,560
right and
 

4737
01:21:58,560 --> 01:21:59,910
right and
paved roads

4738
01:21:59,910 --> 01:21:59,920
paved roads
 

4739
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:01,910
paved roads
right air filled tires

4740
01:22:01,910 --> 01:22:01,920
right air filled tires
 

4741
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:04,310
right air filled tires
and the internal combustion engine

4742
01:22:04,310 --> 01:22:04,320
and the internal combustion engine
 

4743
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:07,430
and the internal combustion engine
now you got a winning mix now it met

4744
01:22:07,430 --> 01:22:07,440
now you got a winning mix now it met
 

4745
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:09,110
now you got a winning mix now it met
with demand for people who wanted to get

4746
01:22:09,110 --> 01:22:09,120
with demand for people who wanted to get
 

4747
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:10,310
with demand for people who wanted to get
out from under the thumb of the

4748
01:22:10,310 --> 01:22:10,320
out from under the thumb of the
 

4749
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:11,750
out from under the thumb of the
railroads

4750
01:22:11,750 --> 01:22:11,760
railroads
 

4751
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:14,149
railroads
right so there was all of this pent-up

4752
01:22:14,149 --> 01:22:14,159
right so there was all of this pent-up
 

4753
01:22:14,159 --> 01:22:17,110
right so there was all of this pent-up
demand to get cheaper freight from the

4754
01:22:17,110 --> 01:22:17,120
demand to get cheaper freight from the
 

4755
01:22:17,120 --> 01:22:18,310
demand to get cheaper freight from the
countryside

4756
01:22:18,310 --> 01:22:18,320
countryside
 

4757
01:22:18,320 --> 01:22:20,709
countryside
into cities and between cities

4758
01:22:20,709 --> 01:22:20,719
into cities and between cities
 

4759
01:22:20,719 --> 01:22:23,189
into cities and between cities
that typically had to go by rail and so

4760
01:22:23,189 --> 01:22:23,199
that typically had to go by rail and so
 

4761
01:22:23,199 --> 01:22:24,629
that typically had to go by rail and so
now you know

4762
01:22:24,629 --> 01:22:24,639
now you know
 

4763
01:22:24,639 --> 01:22:25,910
now you know
40 years

4764
01:22:25,910 --> 01:22:25,920
40 years
 

4765
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:28,310
40 years
after that internal combustion engine

4766
01:22:28,310 --> 01:22:28,320
after that internal combustion engine
 

4767
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:30,629
after that internal combustion engine
it becomes this absolutely essential

4768
01:22:30,629 --> 01:22:30,639
it becomes this absolutely essential
 

4769
01:22:30,639 --> 01:22:32,629
it becomes this absolutely essential
right this necessary but not sufficient

4770
01:22:32,629 --> 01:22:32,639
right this necessary but not sufficient
 

4771
01:22:32,639 --> 01:22:35,590
right this necessary but not sufficient
piece of technology to create the modern

4775
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:40,709
trucking industry
in the 1930s and i think self-driving is

4776
01:22:40,709 --> 01:22:40,719
in the 1930s and i think self-driving is
 

4777
01:22:40,719 --> 01:22:42,390
in the 1930s and i think self-driving is
going to be self-driving trucks are

4778
01:22:42,390 --> 01:22:42,400
going to be self-driving trucks are
 

4779
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:44,709
going to be self-driving trucks are
going to be part of that and the idea i

4780
01:22:44,709 --> 01:22:44,719
going to be part of that and the idea i
 

4781
01:22:44,719 --> 01:22:47,590
going to be part of that and the idea i
don't i guess we we credit jeff bezos

4782
01:22:47,590 --> 01:22:47,600
don't i guess we we credit jeff bezos
 

4783
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:49,270
don't i guess we we credit jeff bezos
the idea is

4784
01:22:49,270 --> 01:22:49,280
the idea is
 

4785
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:50,790
the idea is
you know um

4786
01:22:50,790 --> 01:22:50,800
you know um
 

4787
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:53,030
you know um
okay so sam walton if we can do it like

4788
01:22:53,030 --> 01:22:53,040
okay so sam walton if we can do it like
 

4789
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:54,870
okay so sam walton if we can do it like
a slight tangent on sort of the

01:22:54,870 --> 01:22:54,880
a slight tangent on sort of the
 

4791
01:22:54,880 --> 01:22:56,310
a slight tangent on sort of the
importance of trucking to business

was a trucking insight

4806
01:23:12,470 --> 01:23:12,480
was a trucking insight
 

4807
01:23:12,480 --> 01:23:15,750
was a trucking insight
and so if you look at the way that

4808
01:23:15,750 --> 01:23:15,760
and so if you look at the way that
 

4809
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:18,149
and so if you look at the way that
he developed his system you build a

4810
01:23:18,149 --> 01:23:18,159
he developed his system you build a
 

4811
01:23:18,159 --> 01:23:20,870
he developed his system you build a
distribution center and then you ring it

4812
01:23:20,870 --> 01:23:20,880
distribution center and then you ring it
 

4813
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:22,310
distribution center and then you ring it
with stores

4814
01:23:22,310 --> 01:23:22,320
with stores
 

4815
01:23:22,320 --> 01:23:25,030
with stores
those stores are never further out from

4816
01:23:25,030 --> 01:23:25,040
those stores are never further out from
 

4817
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:26,709
those stores are never further out from
that distribution center than a human

4818
01:23:26,709 --> 01:23:26,719
that distribution center than a human

driven truck

4820
01:23:27,990 --> 01:23:28,000

4821
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:31,669
driven truck
can drive back and forth in one day

4822
01:23:31,669 --> 01:23:31,679
can drive back and forth in one day
 

4823
01:23:31,679 --> 01:23:34,229
can drive back and forth in one day
and so rather than the way all of his

4824
01:23:34,229 --> 01:23:34,239
and so rather than the way all of his
 

4825
01:23:34,239 --> 01:23:36,229
and so rather than the way all of his
competitors were doing it with

4826
01:23:36,229 --> 01:23:36,239
competitors were doing it with
 

4827
01:23:36,239 --> 01:23:37,910
competitors were doing it with
sending trucks all over the place and

4828
01:23:37,910 --> 01:23:37,920
sending trucks all over the place and
 

4829
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:40,149
sending trucks all over the place and
having people sleep overnight and sort

4830
01:23:40,149 --> 01:23:40,159

01:23:43,189 --> 01:23:43,199
of making the trucking service fit
 

4833
01:23:43,199 --> 01:23:45,189
of making the trucking service fit
where they had stores

4834
01:23:45,189 --> 01:23:45,199
where they had stores
 

4835
01:23:45,199 --> 01:23:48,550
where they had stores
he designed the layout of the stores

4836
01:23:48,550 --> 01:23:48,560
he designed the layout of the stores
 

4837
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:51,270
he designed the layout of the stores
right to fit what trucks could do

4838
01:23:51,270 --> 01:23:51,280
right to fit what trucks could do
 

4839
01:23:51,280 --> 01:23:53,510
right to fit what trucks could do
and so transportation and logistics

4840
01:23:53,510 --> 01:23:53,520
and so transportation and logistics
 

4841
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:55,030
and so transportation and logistics
right become

4842
01:23:55,030 --> 01:23:55,040

4850
01:24:05,350 --> 01:24:05,360
they've mastered the digital part of it
 

4851
01:24:05,360 --> 01:24:06,790
they've mastered the digital part of it
right and now they got to figure out

4852
01:24:06,790 --> 01:24:06,800
right and now they got to figure out
 

4853
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:08,950
right and now they got to figure out
like how do we you know

but the capabilities of these trucks is

4864
01:24:18,950 --> 01:24:18,960
but the capabilities of these trucks is
 

4865
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:21,270
but the capabilities of these trucks is
completely different than

01:24:21,270 --> 01:24:21,280
completely different than
 

4867
01:24:21,280 --> 01:24:22,790
completely different than
the capability of a human-driven truck

4868

the capability of a human-driven truck
 

4869
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:23,510
the capability of a human-driven truck
so

4870
01:24:23,510 --> 01:24:23,520
so
 

4871
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:25,990
so
if you're smith-packing right and you've

you know you have that trucker probably

4880
01:24:35,189 --> 01:24:35,199
you know you have that trucker probably
 

4881
01:24:35,199 --> 01:24:37,110
you know you have that trucker probably
come in the night before

4882
01:24:37,110 --> 01:24:37,120
come in the night before
 

4883
01:24:37,120 --> 01:24:39,510
come in the night before
and you make him wait so that he has

4884
01:24:39,510 --> 01:24:39,520
and you make him wait so that he has
 

4885
01:24:39,520 --> 01:24:41,590
and you make him wait so that he has
you know a full 10 hour break which is

you know a full 10 hour break which is
 

4887
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:43,910
you know a full 10 hour break which is
what the law requires so that he can get

4888
01:24:43,910 --> 01:24:43,920
what the law requires so that he can get
 

4889
01:24:43,920 --> 01:24:46,390
what the law requires so that he can get
to the furthest reaches that he can of

4890
01:24:46,390 --> 01:24:46,400
to the furthest reaches that he can of
 

4891
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:47,910
to the furthest reaches that he can of
one of those stores

4892
01:24:47,910 --> 01:24:47,920
one of those stores
 

4893
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:50,390
one of those stores
right so he can drive his full 11 hours

4894
01:24:50,390 --> 01:24:50,400
right so he can drive his full 11 hours
 

4895
01:24:50,400 --> 01:24:51,990
right so he can drive his full 11 hours
and and bring that meat so it doesn't

4896
01:24:51,990 --> 01:24:52,000
and and bring that meat so it doesn't
 

4897
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:53,669
and and bring that meat so it doesn't
have to sit overnight in that

4898
01:24:53,669 --> 01:24:53,679
have to sit overnight in that
 

4899
01:24:53,679 --> 01:24:55,830
have to sit overnight in that
refrigerated trailer right and so their

4900
01:24:55,830 --> 01:24:55,840
refrigerated trailer right and so their
 

4901
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:58,790
refrigerated trailer right and so their
system is based on that now what happens

4902
01:24:58,790 --> 01:24:58,800
system is based on that now what happens
 

4903
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:02,070
system is based on that now what happens
when that truck can now travel

4904
01:25:02,070 --> 01:25:02,080

01:25:05,830 --> 01:25:05,840
times as far right three times as far
 

4909
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:07,669
times as far right three times as far
now you don't need the warehouses where

4910
01:25:07,669 --> 01:25:07,679
now you don't need the warehouses where
 

4911
01:25:07,679 --> 01:25:08,790
now you don't need the warehouses where
they were

meat here meet there meet there you can
 

4919
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:17,189
meat here meet there meet there you can
put it all right here and if it's cheap

4920
01:25:17,189 --> 01:25:17,199
put it all right here and if it's cheap
 

4921
01:25:17,199 --> 01:25:18,070
put it all right here and if it's cheap
enough

4922
01:25:18,070 --> 01:25:18,080
enough
 

4923
01:25:18,080 --> 01:25:20,229
enough
substitute those transportation costs

4924
01:25:20,229 --> 01:25:20,239
substitute those transportation costs
 

4925
01:25:20,239 --> 01:25:22,470
substitute those transportation costs
for all that warehousing costs right so

4926

for all that warehousing costs right so
 

4927
01:25:22,480 --> 01:25:24,709
for all that warehousing costs right so
this is going to remake landscapes in

01:25:24,709 --> 01:25:24,719
this is going to remake landscapes in
 

4929
01:25:24,719 --> 01:25:28,550
this is going to remake landscapes in
the same way that big box supply chains

01:25:28,550 --> 01:25:28,560
the same way that big box supply chains
 

4931
01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:30,390
the same way that big box supply chains
did right and then of course the further

01:25:30,390 --> 01:25:30,400
did right and then of course the further
 

4933
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:32,390
did right and then of course the further
complement of that is

4934
01:25:32,390 --> 01:25:32,400
complement of that is
 

4935
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:35,270
complement of that is
you know how do you then get it to

01:26:03,040 --> 01:26:04,790
right and so that is
like that inter-city

4966
01:26:04,790 --> 01:26:04,800
like that inter-city
 

4967
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:07,430
like that inter-city
trucking under the you know in the um

4968
01:26:07,430 --> 01:26:07,440
trucking under the you know in the um
 

4969
01:26:07,440 --> 01:26:10,470
trucking under the you know in the um
era of of railroad monopolies right the

4970
01:26:10,470 --> 01:26:10,480
era of of railroad monopolies right the
 

4971
01:26:10,480 --> 01:26:13,830
era of of railroad monopolies right the
demand for that is potentially enormous

4972
01:26:13,830 --> 01:26:13,840
demand for that is potentially enormous
 

4973
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:16,310
demand for that is potentially enormous
right and and that so there's there's

4974
01:26:16,310 --> 01:26:16,320
right and and that so there's there's
 

4975
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:19,189
right and and that so there's there's
such a so right now i think a lot of the

4976
01:26:19,189 --> 01:26:19,199
such a so right now i think a lot of the
 

4977
01:26:19,199 --> 01:26:21,590
such a so right now i think a lot of the
the business plans for sort of automated

4978
01:26:21,590 --> 01:26:21,600
the business plans for sort of automated
 

4979
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:22,950
the business plans for sort of automated
trucks right and sort of the way that

4980
01:26:22,950 --> 01:26:22,960
trucks right and sort of the way that
 

4981
01:26:22,960 --> 01:26:24,870
trucks right and sort of the way that
the journalistic accounts portray it is

4982
01:26:24,870 --> 01:26:24,880
the journalistic accounts portray it is
 

4983
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:27,510
the journalistic accounts portray it is
like okay if we swap out a human for a

4984
01:26:27,510 --> 01:26:27,520
like okay if we swap out a human for a
 

4985
01:26:27,520 --> 01:26:29,750
like okay if we swap out a human for a
computer what are the labor costs per

4986
01:26:29,750 --> 01:26:29,760
computer what are the labor costs per
 

4987
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:30,870
computer what are the labor costs per
mile and like oh here's the

4988
01:26:30,870 --> 01:26:30,880
mile and like oh here's the
 

4989
01:26:30,880 --> 01:26:33,990
mile and like oh here's the
profitability of self-driving trucks

4990
01:26:33,990 --> 01:26:34,000
profitability of self-driving trucks
 

4991
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,149
profitability of self-driving trucks
like this is transformative technology

4992
01:26:36,149 --> 01:26:36,159
like this is transformative technology
 

4993
01:26:36,159 --> 01:26:38,149
like this is transformative technology
we're going to change the way we get

4994
01:26:38,149 --> 01:26:38,159
we're going to change the way we get
 

4995
01:26:38,159 --> 01:26:40,229
we're going to change the way we get
stuff so we could actually get a lot

4996
01:26:40,229 --> 01:26:40,239
stuff so we could actually get a lot
 

4997
01:26:40,239 --> 01:26:42,149
stuff so we could actually get a lot
more trucks period with like with

4998
01:26:42,149 --> 01:26:42,159
more trucks period with like with
 

4999
01:26:42,159 --> 01:26:43,590
more trucks period with like with
autonomous trucks because they would

5000
01:26:43,590 --> 01:26:43,600
autonomous trucks because they would
 

5001
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:45,750
autonomous trucks because they would
enable if a very different kind of

5002
01:26:45,750 --> 01:26:45,760
enable if a very different kind of
 

5003
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:47,750
enable if a very different kind of
transportation networks you think yeah

5004
01:26:47,750 --> 01:26:47,760
transportation networks you think yeah
 

5005
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:51,189
transportation networks you think yeah
here's and this is where it's like uh oh

5006
01:26:51,189 --> 01:26:51,199
here's and this is where it's like uh oh
 

5007
01:26:51,199 --> 01:26:53,430
here's and this is where it's like uh oh
like yeah so

5008
01:26:53,430 --> 01:26:53,440
like yeah so
 

5009
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:55,030
like yeah so
wait we really thought we were gonna be

5010
01:26:55,030 --> 01:26:55,040
wait we really thought we were gonna be
 

5011
01:26:55,040 --> 01:26:57,270
wait we really thought we were gonna be
electrifying trucks

5012
01:26:57,270 --> 01:26:57,280
electrifying trucks
 

5013
01:26:57,280 --> 01:26:59,270
electrifying trucks
if they're going twice as far if they're

5014
01:26:59,270 --> 01:26:59,280
if they're going twice as far if they're
 

5015
01:26:59,280 --> 01:27:01,590
if they're going twice as far if they're
moving three times as much if they're

5016
01:27:01,590 --> 01:27:01,600
moving three times as much if they're
 

5017
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:03,350
moving three times as much if they're
going three times as far right what does

5018
01:27:03,350 --> 01:27:03,360
going three times as far right what does
 

5019
01:27:03,360 --> 01:27:05,910
going three times as far right what does
that mean for how far we are behind on

5020
01:27:05,910 --> 01:27:05,920
that mean for how far we are behind on
 

5021
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:07,910
that mean for how far we are behind on
batteries right we've got sort of these

5022
01:27:07,910 --> 01:27:07,920
batteries right we've got sort of these
 

5023
01:27:07,920 --> 01:27:09,430
batteries right we've got sort of these
you know ideas about like man we you

5024
01:27:09,430 --> 01:27:09,440
you know ideas about like man we you
 

5025
01:27:09,440 --> 01:27:11,110
you know ideas about like man we you
know here's how far how close we could

5026
01:27:11,110 --> 01:27:11,120
know here's how far how close we could
 

5027
01:27:11,120 --> 01:27:13,270
know here's how far how close we could
get to meet this demand that demand is

5028
01:27:13,270 --> 01:27:13,280
get to meet this demand that demand is
 

5029
01:27:13,280 --> 01:27:15,110
get to meet this demand that demand is
going to radically change right these

5030
01:27:15,110 --> 01:27:15,120
going to radically change right these
 

5031
01:27:15,120 --> 01:27:17,430
going to radically change right these
trucks are you know so then we've got to

5032
01:27:17,430 --> 01:27:17,440
trucks are you know so then we've got to
 

5033
01:27:17,440 --> 01:27:19,510
trucks are you know so then we've got to
think about all right if it's not

5034
01:27:19,510 --> 01:27:19,520
think about all right if it's not
 

5035
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:21,910
think about all right if it's not
battery you know how how are we powering

5036
01:27:21,910 --> 01:27:21,920
battery you know how how are we powering
 

5037
01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:23,990
battery you know how how are we powering
these things and how many of them are

5038
01:27:23,990 --> 01:27:24,000
these things and how many of them are
 

5039
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:25,189
these things and how many of them are
they're going to be

5040
01:27:25,189 --> 01:27:25,199
they're going to be
 

5041
01:27:25,199 --> 01:27:27,430
they're going to be
like right now we've got five million

5042
01:27:27,430 --> 01:27:27,440
like right now we've got five million
 

5043
01:27:27,440 --> 01:27:30,070
like right now we've got five million
containers that move from la and long

5044
01:27:30,070 --> 01:27:30,080
containers that move from la and long
 

5045
01:27:30,080 --> 01:27:32,950
containers that move from la and long
beach to chicago on

5046
01:27:32,950 --> 01:27:32,960
beach to chicago on
 

5047
01:27:32,960 --> 01:27:34,070
beach to chicago on
rail

5048
01:27:34,070 --> 01:27:34,080
rail
 

5049
01:27:34,080 --> 01:27:37,430
rail
rail is three or four times at least

5050
01:27:37,430 --> 01:27:37,440
rail is three or four times at least
 

5051
01:27:37,440 --> 01:27:40,390
rail is three or four times at least
more efficient than trucks in terms of

5052
01:27:40,390 --> 01:27:40,400
more efficient than trucks in terms of
 

5053
01:27:40,400 --> 01:27:42,470
more efficient than trucks in terms of
greenhouse gas emissions

5054
01:27:42,470 --> 01:27:42,480
greenhouse gas emissions
 

5055
01:27:42,480 --> 01:27:44,550
greenhouse gas emissions
and on that lane it varies a lot

5056
01:27:44,550 --> 01:27:44,560
and on that lane it varies a lot
 

5057
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:47,270
and on that lane it varies a lot
depending on demand but maybe rail has a

5058
01:27:47,270 --> 01:27:47,280
depending on demand but maybe rail has a
 

5059
01:27:47,280 --> 01:27:50,229
depending on demand but maybe rail has a
20 advantage in cost maybe 25 but it's a

5060
01:27:50,229 --> 01:27:50,239
20 advantage in cost maybe 25 but it's a
 

5061
01:27:50,239 --> 01:27:51,990
20 advantage in cost maybe 25 but it's a
couple days slower

5062
01:27:51,990 --> 01:27:52,000
couple days slower
 

5063
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,470
couple days slower
so now you cut the cost of that truck

5064
01:27:54,470 --> 01:27:54,480
so now you cut the cost of that truck
 

5065
01:27:54,480 --> 01:27:57,350
so now you cut the cost of that truck
transportation per mile by 30 percent

5066
01:27:57,350 --> 01:27:57,360
transportation per mile by 30 percent
 

5067
01:27:57,360 --> 01:27:59,430
transportation per mile by 30 percent
now it's cheaper than rail and it gets

5068
01:27:59,430 --> 01:27:59,440
now it's cheaper than rail and it gets
 

5069
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:01,669
now it's cheaper than rail and it gets
the stuff there five days faster than

5070
01:28:01,669 --> 01:28:01,679
the stuff there five days faster than
 

5071
01:28:01,679 --> 01:28:04,470
the stuff there five days faster than
rail how many millions of containers are

5072
01:28:04,470 --> 01:28:04,480
rail how many millions of containers are
 

5073
01:28:04,480 --> 01:28:06,550
rail how many millions of containers are
going to leave la and long beach on

5074
01:28:06,550 --> 01:28:06,560
going to leave la and long beach on
 

5075
01:28:06,560 --> 01:28:08,709
going to leave la and long beach on
self-driving trucks and go to chicago

5076
01:28:08,709 --> 01:28:08,719
self-driving trucks and go to chicago
 

5077
01:28:08,719 --> 01:28:10,790
self-driving trucks and go to chicago
and it might look very much like a train

5078
01:28:10,790 --> 01:28:10,800
and it might look very much like a train
 

5079
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:11,669
and it might look very much like a train
if

5080
01:28:11,669 --> 01:28:11,679
if
 

5081
01:28:11,679 --> 01:28:15,270
if
if we go with the platooning solution

5082
01:28:15,270 --> 01:28:15,280
if we go with the platooning solution
 

5083
01:28:15,280 --> 01:28:18,470
if we go with the platooning solution
you have just these rows of like

5084
01:28:18,470 --> 01:28:18,480
you have just these rows of like
 

5085
01:28:18,480 --> 01:28:21,030
you have just these rows of like
imagine like rows of like 10 like dozens

5086
01:28:21,030 --> 01:28:21,040
imagine like rows of like 10 like dozens
 

5087
01:28:21,040 --> 01:28:22,870
imagine like rows of like 10 like dozens
of trucks or like hundreds of trucks

5088
01:28:22,870 --> 01:28:22,880
of trucks or like hundreds of trucks
 

5089
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:26,070
of trucks or like hundreds of trucks
like some absurd situation just going

5090
01:28:26,070 --> 01:28:26,080
like some absurd situation just going
 

5091
01:28:26,080 --> 01:28:29,430
like some absurd situation just going
from la to chicago yeah just this train

5092
01:28:29,430 --> 01:28:29,440
from la to chicago yeah just this train
 

5093
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:31,830
from la to chicago yeah just this train
but taking up a highway

5094
01:28:31,830 --> 01:28:31,840
but taking up a highway
 

5095
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:33,510
but taking up a highway
i mean uh

5096
01:28:33,510 --> 01:28:33,520
i mean uh
 

5097
01:28:33,520 --> 01:28:35,510
i mean uh
this is probably a good place to talk

5098
01:28:35,510 --> 01:28:35,520
this is probably a good place to talk
 

5099
01:28:35,520 --> 01:28:37,990
this is probably a good place to talk
about various scenarios

5100
01:28:37,990 --> 01:28:38,000
about various scenarios
 

5101
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:39,590
about various scenarios
but before we get there can i can i just

5102
01:28:39,590 --> 01:28:39,600
but before we get there can i can i just
 

5103
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:41,590
but before we get there can i can i just
make one one interesting observation

5104
01:28:41,590 --> 01:28:41,600
make one one interesting observation
 

5105
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:43,189
make one one interesting observation
that i made as

5106
01:28:43,189 --> 01:28:43,199
that i made as
 

5107
01:28:43,199 --> 01:28:45,270
that i made as
a driver um when you're in a truck

5108
01:28:45,270 --> 01:28:45,280
a driver um when you're in a truck
 

5109
01:28:45,280 --> 01:28:46,950
a driver um when you're in a truck
you're up higher you know so you can you

5110
01:28:46,950 --> 01:28:46,960
you're up higher you know so you can you
 

5111
01:28:46,960 --> 01:28:48,629
you're up higher you know so you can you
can see further and you can see the

5112
01:28:48,629 --> 01:28:48,639
can see further and you can see the
 

5113
01:28:48,639 --> 01:28:49,990
can see further and you can see the
traffic patterns

5114
01:28:49,990 --> 01:28:50,000
traffic patterns
 

5115
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:51,110
traffic patterns
and

5116
01:28:51,110 --> 01:28:51,120
and
 

5117
01:28:51,120 --> 01:28:54,229
and
um cars move them packs

5118
01:28:54,229 --> 01:28:54,239
um cars move them packs
 

5119
01:28:54,239 --> 01:28:55,750
um cars move them packs
i'm sure there's academic research on

5120
01:28:55,750 --> 01:28:55,760
i'm sure there's academic research on
 

5121
01:28:55,760 --> 01:28:57,270
i'm sure there's academic research on
this right but they move in packs they

5122
01:28:57,270 --> 01:28:57,280
this right but they move in packs they
 

5123
01:28:57,280 --> 01:28:59,669
this right but they move in packs they
kind of bunch up behind a slower car and

5124
01:28:59,669 --> 01:28:59,679
kind of bunch up behind a slower car and
 

5125
01:28:59,679 --> 01:29:01,430
kind of bunch up behind a slower car and
then a bunch of them break free and this

5126
01:29:01,430 --> 01:29:01,440
then a bunch of them break free and this
 

5127
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:03,350
then a bunch of them break free and this
is sort of on almost free-flowing

5128
01:29:03,350 --> 01:29:03,360
is sort of on almost free-flowing
 

5129
01:29:03,360 --> 01:29:05,110
is sort of on almost free-flowing
highways they kind of move in packs and

5130
01:29:05,110 --> 01:29:05,120
highways they kind of move in packs and
 

5131
01:29:05,120 --> 01:29:07,430
highways they kind of move in packs and
you can kind of see them in the truck

5132
01:29:07,430 --> 01:29:07,440
you can kind of see them in the truck
 

5133
01:29:07,440 --> 01:29:09,189
you can kind of see them in the truck
so you know rather than platoons we

5134
01:29:09,189 --> 01:29:09,199
so you know rather than platoons we
 

5135
01:29:09,199 --> 01:29:11,669
so you know rather than platoons we
might have like hives you know of trucks

5136
01:29:11,669 --> 01:29:11,679
might have like hives you know of trucks
 

5137
01:29:11,679 --> 01:29:13,830
might have like hives you know of trucks
right so you have like 20 trucks moving

5138
01:29:13,830 --> 01:29:13,840
right so you have like 20 trucks moving
 

5139
01:29:13,840 --> 01:29:15,910
right so you have like 20 trucks moving
in some coordinated fashion right and

5140
01:29:15,910 --> 01:29:15,920
in some coordinated fashion right and
 

5141
01:29:15,920 --> 01:29:18,149
in some coordinated fashion right and
then maybe the self-driving cars are you

5142
01:29:18,149 --> 01:29:18,159
then maybe the self-driving cars are you
 

5143
01:29:18,159 --> 01:29:19,270
then maybe the self-driving cars are you
know because people don't like to be

5144
01:29:19,270 --> 01:29:19,280
know because people don't like to be
 

5145
01:29:19,280 --> 01:29:21,270
know because people don't like to be
around them or whatever it is right you

5146
01:29:21,270 --> 01:29:21,280
around them or whatever it is right you
 

5147
01:29:21,280 --> 01:29:23,030
around them or whatever it is right you
might have a pod of you know 20

5148
01:29:23,030 --> 01:29:23,040
might have a pod of you know 20
 

5149
01:29:23,040 --> 01:29:24,709
might have a pod of you know 20
self-driving cars sort of moving in a

5150
01:29:24,709 --> 01:29:24,719
self-driving cars sort of moving in a
 

5151
01:29:24,719 --> 01:29:26,950
self-driving cars sort of moving in a
packet behind them you know this is what

5152
01:29:26,950 --> 01:29:26,960
packet behind them you know this is what
 

5153
01:29:26,960 --> 01:29:29,189
packet behind them you know this is what
if the aliens came down or were just

5154
01:29:29,189 --> 01:29:29,199
if the aliens came down or were just
 

5155
01:29:29,199 --> 01:29:30,390
if the aliens came down or were just
observing

5156
01:29:30,390 --> 01:29:30,400
observing
 

5157
01:29:30,400 --> 01:29:32,870
observing
cars which is one of the uh

5158
01:29:32,870 --> 01:29:32,880
cars which is one of the uh
 

5159
01:29:32,880 --> 01:29:34,550
cars which is one of the uh
sort of prevalent characteristics of

5160
01:29:34,550 --> 01:29:34,560
sort of prevalent characteristics of
 

5161
01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:36,390
sort of prevalent characteristics of
human civilization is there seems to be

5162
01:29:36,390 --> 01:29:36,400
human civilization is there seems to be
 

5163
01:29:36,400 --> 01:29:38,470
human civilization is there seems to be
these cars like moving around

5164
01:29:38,470 --> 01:29:38,480
these cars like moving around
 

5165
01:29:38,480 --> 01:29:40,310
these cars like moving around
that would do this kind of analysis of

5166
01:29:40,310 --> 01:29:40,320
that would do this kind of analysis of
 

5167
01:29:40,320 --> 01:29:41,830
that would do this kind of analysis of
like huh what's the interesting

5168
01:29:41,830 --> 01:29:41,840
like huh what's the interesting
 

5169
01:29:41,840 --> 01:29:45,910
like huh what's the interesting
clustering of situations here

5170
01:29:45,910 --> 01:29:45,920

 

5171
01:29:45,920 --> 01:29:47,830

especially with autonomous vehicles i

5172
01:29:47,830 --> 01:29:47,840
especially with autonomous vehicles i
 

5173
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:50,229
especially with autonomous vehicles i
like this okay so

5174
01:29:50,229 --> 01:29:50,239
like this okay so
 

5175
01:29:50,239 --> 01:29:52,790
like this okay so
what technologically speaking do you see

5176
01:29:52,790 --> 01:29:52,800
what technologically speaking do you see
 

5177
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:55,110
what technologically speaking do you see
are the different scenarios

5178
01:29:55,110 --> 01:29:55,120
are the different scenarios
 

5179
01:29:55,120 --> 01:29:57,990
are the different scenarios
of increasing automation in in trucks

5180
01:29:57,990 --> 01:29:58,000
of increasing automation in in trucks
 

5181
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,790
of increasing automation in in trucks
what are some ideas that you think about

5182
01:30:00,790 --> 01:30:00,800
what are some ideas that you think about
 

5183
01:30:00,800 --> 01:30:03,510
what are some ideas that you think about
for the most part i have no

5184
01:30:03,510 --> 01:30:03,520
for the most part i have no
 

5185
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:05,430
for the most part i have no
i i have no influence on sort of what

5186
01:30:05,430 --> 01:30:05,440
i i have no influence on sort of what
 

5187
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:07,510
i i have no influence on sort of what
these ideas were so what the what the

5188
01:30:07,510 --> 01:30:07,520
these ideas were so what the what the
 

5189
01:30:07,520 --> 01:30:10,390
these ideas were so what the what the
project was that i did was um

5190
01:30:10,390 --> 01:30:10,400
project was that i did was um
 

5191
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:12,390
project was that i did was um
i said technology is created by people

5192
01:30:12,390 --> 01:30:12,400
i said technology is created by people
 

5193
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:15,510
i said technology is created by people
they they solve for x and they have some

5194
01:30:15,510 --> 01:30:15,520
they they solve for x and they have some
 

5195
01:30:15,520 --> 01:30:17,510
they they solve for x and they have some
conception of what they want to do

5196
01:30:17,510 --> 01:30:17,520
conception of what they want to do
 

5197
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:19,350
conception of what they want to do
and that's where we should start in sort

5198
01:30:19,350 --> 01:30:19,360
and that's where we should start in sort
 

5199
01:30:19,360 --> 01:30:21,430
and that's where we should start in sort
of thinking about what the you know

5200
01:30:21,430 --> 01:30:21,440
of thinking about what the you know
 

5201
01:30:21,440 --> 01:30:23,270
of thinking about what the you know
impacts might be so i went and i talked

5202
01:30:23,270 --> 01:30:23,280
impacts might be so i went and i talked
 

5203
01:30:23,280 --> 01:30:26,149
impacts might be so i went and i talked
to everybody i could find who was

5204
01:30:26,149 --> 01:30:26,159
to everybody i could find who was
 

5205
01:30:26,159 --> 01:30:27,669
to everybody i could find who was
you know thinking about developing a

5206
01:30:27,669 --> 01:30:27,679
you know thinking about developing a
 

5207
01:30:27,679 --> 01:30:29,669
you know thinking about developing a
self-driving truck and the question was

5208
01:30:29,669 --> 01:30:29,679
self-driving truck and the question was
 

5209
01:30:29,679 --> 01:30:31,990
self-driving truck and the question was
essentially you know what do you what

5210
01:30:31,990 --> 01:30:32,000
essentially you know what do you what
 

5211
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:33,110
essentially you know what do you what
are you trying to build like what do you

5212
01:30:33,110 --> 01:30:33,120
are you trying to build like what do you
 

5213
01:30:33,120 --> 01:30:35,590
are you trying to build like what do you
envision this thing doing

5214
01:30:35,590 --> 01:30:35,600
envision this thing doing
 

5215
01:30:35,600 --> 01:30:37,830
envision this thing doing
it turned out that

5216
01:30:37,830 --> 01:30:37,840
it turned out that
 

5217
01:30:37,840 --> 01:30:39,350
it turned out that
that for a lot of them was an

5218
01:30:39,350 --> 01:30:39,360
that for a lot of them was an
 

5219
01:30:39,360 --> 01:30:41,990
that for a lot of them was an
afterthought they knew the the sort of

5220
01:30:41,990 --> 01:30:42,000
afterthought they knew the the sort of
 

5221
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:43,990
afterthought they knew the the sort of
technological capabilities that a

5222
01:30:43,990 --> 01:30:44,000
technological capabilities that a
 

5223
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:45,350
technological capabilities that a
self-driving vehicle would have and

5224
01:30:45,350 --> 01:30:45,360
self-driving vehicle would have and
 

5225
01:30:45,360 --> 01:30:47,030
self-driving vehicle would have and
those were the problems that they were

5226
01:30:47,030 --> 01:30:47,040
those were the problems that they were
 

5227
01:30:47,040 --> 01:30:48,870
those were the problems that they were
tackling you know they were engineers

5228
01:30:48,870 --> 01:30:48,880
tackling you know they were engineers
 

5229
01:30:48,880 --> 01:30:51,270
tackling you know they were engineers
and computer scientists and oh robotics

5230
01:30:51,270 --> 01:30:51,280
and computer scientists and oh robotics
 

5231
01:30:51,280 --> 01:30:53,430
and computer scientists and oh robotics
people i love you so much

5232
01:30:53,430 --> 01:30:53,440
people i love you so much
 

5233
01:30:53,440 --> 01:30:56,149
people i love you so much
this is i i i could i could talk forever

5234
01:30:56,149 --> 01:30:56,159
this is i i i could i could talk forever
 

5235
01:30:56,159 --> 01:30:57,910
this is i i i could i could talk forever
about this but yes there's a technology

5236
01:30:57,910 --> 01:30:57,920
about this but yes there's a technology
 

5237
01:30:57,920 --> 01:30:59,350
about this but yes there's a technology
problem let's focus on that we'll figure

5238
01:30:59,350 --> 01:30:59,360
problem let's focus on that we'll figure
 

5239
01:30:59,360 --> 01:31:00,790
problem let's focus on that we'll figure
out the actual

5240
01:31:00,790 --> 01:31:00,800
out the actual
 

5241
01:31:00,800 --> 01:31:02,870
out the actual
uh impact on society how it's actually

5242
01:31:02,870 --> 01:31:02,880
uh impact on society how it's actually
 

5243
01:31:02,880 --> 01:31:04,229
uh impact on society how it's actually
going to be applied how it's actually

5244
01:31:04,229 --> 01:31:04,239
going to be applied how it's actually
 

5245
01:31:04,239 --> 01:31:06,870
going to be applied how it's actually
going to be integrated from a policy and

5246
01:31:06,870 --> 01:31:06,880
going to be integrated from a policy and
 

5247
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:08,790
going to be integrated from a policy and
from a human perspective from a business

5248
01:31:08,790 --> 01:31:08,800
from a human perspective from a business
 

5249
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:10,470
from a human perspective from a business
perspective later first let's solve the

5250
01:31:10,470 --> 01:31:10,480
perspective later first let's solve the
 

5251
01:31:10,480 --> 01:31:12,149
perspective later first let's solve the
technology problem that's not how life

5252
01:31:12,149 --> 01:31:12,159
technology problem that's not how life
 

5253
01:31:12,159 --> 01:31:14,470
technology problem that's not how life
works friends but okay i'm sorry yeah

5254
01:31:14,470 --> 01:31:14,480
works friends but okay i'm sorry yeah
 

5255
01:31:14,480 --> 01:31:16,870
works friends but okay i'm sorry yeah
yeah so i mean i mean i'm sure you know

5256
01:31:16,870 --> 01:31:16,880
yeah so i mean i mean i'm sure you know
 

5257
01:31:16,880 --> 01:31:18,629
yeah so i mean i mean i'm sure you know
the division of labor in these companies

5258
01:31:18,629 --> 01:31:18,639
the division of labor in these companies
 

5259
01:31:18,639 --> 01:31:19,750
the division of labor in these companies
right there's sort of a business

5260
01:31:19,750 --> 01:31:19,760
right there's sort of a business
 

5261
01:31:19,760 --> 01:31:21,350
right there's sort of a business
development side you know and then

5262
01:31:21,350 --> 01:31:21,360
development side you know and then
 

5263
01:31:21,360 --> 01:31:22,870
development side you know and then
there's the engineering side right and

5264
01:31:22,870 --> 01:31:22,880
there's the engineering side right and
 

5265
01:31:22,880 --> 01:31:24,390
there's the engineering side right and
the engineers are like oh my god what

5266
01:31:24,390 --> 01:31:24,400
the engineers are like oh my god what
 

5267
01:31:24,400 --> 01:31:25,750
the engineers are like oh my god what
are these business development people

5268
01:31:25,750 --> 01:31:25,760
are these business development people
 

5269
01:31:25,760 --> 01:31:29,189
are these business development people
you know why are they involved

5270
01:31:29,189 --> 01:31:29,199

 

5271
01:31:29,199 --> 01:31:32,390

in this process so i ended up sort of

5272
01:31:32,390 --> 01:31:32,400
in this process so i ended up sort of
 

5273
01:31:32,400 --> 01:31:34,310
in this process so i ended up sort of
coming up with a few different ideas

5274
01:31:34,310 --> 01:31:34,320
coming up with a few different ideas
 

5275
01:31:34,320 --> 01:31:36,870
coming up with a few different ideas
that people seem to be batting around

5276
01:31:36,870 --> 01:31:36,880
that people seem to be batting around
 

5277
01:31:36,880 --> 01:31:40,070
that people seem to be batting around
and then really try to zero in on a

5278
01:31:40,070 --> 01:31:40,080
and then really try to zero in on a
 

5279
01:31:40,080 --> 01:31:41,669
and then really try to zero in on a
layman's understanding of the

5280
01:31:41,669 --> 01:31:41,679
layman's understanding of the
 

5281
01:31:41,679 --> 01:31:43,430
layman's understanding of the
limitations right and

5282
01:31:43,430 --> 01:31:43,440
limitations right and
 

5283
01:31:43,440 --> 01:31:45,750
limitations right and
it it turns out that's really obvious

5284
01:31:45,750 --> 01:31:45,760
it it turns out that's really obvious
 

5285
01:31:45,760 --> 01:31:47,350
it it turns out that's really obvious
and and quite simple

5286
01:31:47,350 --> 01:31:47,360
and and quite simple
 

5287
01:31:47,360 --> 01:31:49,830
and and quite simple
highway driving's a lot simpler right um

5288
01:31:49,830 --> 01:31:49,840
highway driving's a lot simpler right um
 

5289
01:31:49,840 --> 01:31:52,149
highway driving's a lot simpler right um
so you know the the plan is simplify the

5290
01:31:52,149 --> 01:31:52,159
so you know the the plan is simplify the
 

5291
01:31:52,159 --> 01:31:54,790
so you know the the plan is simplify the
problem right um and focus on highways

5292
01:31:54,790 --> 01:31:54,800
problem right um and focus on highways
 

5293
01:31:54,800 --> 01:31:56,870
problem right um and focus on highways
because city driving is

5294
01:31:56,870 --> 01:31:56,880
because city driving is
 

5295
01:31:56,880 --> 01:31:59,750
because city driving is
is so um so much more complicated

5296
01:31:59,750 --> 01:31:59,760
is so um so much more complicated
 

5297
01:31:59,760 --> 01:32:00,790
is so um so much more complicated
so

5298
01:32:00,790 --> 01:32:00,800
so
 

5299
01:32:00,800 --> 01:32:03,110
so
from that i i came up with basically six

5300
01:32:03,110 --> 01:32:03,120
from that i i came up with basically six
 

5301
01:32:03,120 --> 01:32:06,629
from that i i came up with basically six
scenarios actually i came up with five

5302
01:32:06,629 --> 01:32:06,639
scenarios actually i came up with five
 

5303
01:32:06,639 --> 01:32:08,550
scenarios actually i came up with five
that the developers were talking about

5304
01:32:08,550 --> 01:32:08,560
that the developers were talking about
 

5305
01:32:08,560 --> 01:32:10,870
that the developers were talking about
and then one that i thought was a good

5306
01:32:10,870 --> 01:32:10,880
and then one that i thought was a good
 

5307
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:12,870
and then one that i thought was a good
idea that i had read about

5308
01:32:12,870 --> 01:32:12,880
idea that i had read about
 

5309
01:32:12,880 --> 01:32:16,629
idea that i had read about
um i think in like 2013 or 2014

5310
01:32:16,629 --> 01:32:16,639
um i think in like 2013 or 2014
 

5311
01:32:16,639 --> 01:32:18,709
um i think in like 2013 or 2014
which was actually something that the us

5312
01:32:18,709 --> 01:32:18,719
which was actually something that the us
 

5313
01:32:18,719 --> 01:32:21,430
which was actually something that the us
military was looking at i actually first

5314
01:32:21,430 --> 01:32:21,440
military was looking at i actually first
 

5315
01:32:21,440 --> 01:32:23,669
military was looking at i actually first
heard about the idea of this kind of

5316
01:32:23,669 --> 01:32:23,679
heard about the idea of this kind of
 

5317
01:32:23,679 --> 01:32:26,070
heard about the idea of this kind of
automation at least in in um in

5318
01:32:26,070 --> 01:32:26,080
automation at least in in um in
 

5319
01:32:26,080 --> 01:32:29,110
automation at least in in um in
sketched-out form in like 2011 i guess

5320
01:32:29,110 --> 01:32:29,120
sketched-out form in like 2011 i guess
 

5321
01:32:29,120 --> 01:32:31,510
sketched-out form in like 2011 i guess
it was with peloton which was this sort

5322
01:32:31,510 --> 01:32:31,520
it was with peloton which was this sort
 

5323
01:32:31,520 --> 01:32:34,709
it was with peloton which was this sort
of early technology entrant into the

5324
01:32:34,709 --> 01:32:34,719
of early technology entrant into the
 

5325
01:32:34,719 --> 01:32:36,870
of early technology entrant into the
trucking industry which was working on

5326
01:32:36,870 --> 01:32:36,880
trucking industry which was working on
 

5327
01:32:36,880 --> 01:32:39,110
trucking industry which was working on
platooning platooning trucks

5328
01:32:39,110 --> 01:32:39,120
platooning platooning trucks
 

5329
01:32:39,120 --> 01:32:41,110
platooning platooning trucks
and and all they were doing was you know

5330
01:32:41,110 --> 01:32:41,120
and and all they were doing was you know
 

5331
01:32:41,120 --> 01:32:43,110
and and all they were doing was you know
a cooperative adaptive cruise control as

5332
01:32:43,110 --> 01:32:43,120
a cooperative adaptive cruise control as
 

5333
01:32:43,120 --> 01:32:45,669
a cooperative adaptive cruise control as
they they came to call it um

5334
01:32:45,669 --> 01:32:45,679
they they came to call it um
 

5335
01:32:45,679 --> 01:32:48,390
they they came to call it um
and we ended up on a panel together and

5336
01:32:48,390 --> 01:32:48,400
and we ended up on a panel together and
 

5337
01:32:48,400 --> 01:32:50,550
and we ended up on a panel together and
it's it's kind of interesting because i

5338
01:32:50,550 --> 01:32:50,560
it's it's kind of interesting because i
 

5339
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:52,950
it's it's kind of interesting because i
was on that panel because

5340
01:32:52,950 --> 01:32:52,960
was on that panel because
 

5341
01:32:52,960 --> 01:32:55,110
was on that panel because
i was thinking about how we got the best

5342
01:32:55,110 --> 01:32:55,120
i was thinking about how we got the best
 

5343
01:32:55,120 --> 01:32:57,030
i was thinking about how we got the best
return on investment for fuel efficient

5344
01:32:57,030 --> 01:32:57,040
return on investment for fuel efficient
 

5345
01:32:57,040 --> 01:32:58,310
return on investment for fuel efficient
technologies

5346
01:32:58,310 --> 01:32:58,320
technologies
 

5347
01:32:58,320 --> 01:33:00,629
technologies
and if it's cool i'll sort of set set

5348
01:33:00,629 --> 01:33:00,639
and if it's cool i'll sort of set set
 

5349
01:33:00,639 --> 01:33:02,709
and if it's cool i'll sort of set set
this up because it does it comes into

5350
01:33:02,709 --> 01:33:02,719
this up because it does it comes into
 

5351
01:33:02,719 --> 01:33:03,830
this up because it does it comes into
sort of the story of some of these

5352
01:33:03,830 --> 01:33:03,840
sort of the story of some of these
 

5353
01:33:03,840 --> 01:33:05,590
sort of the story of some of these
scenarios

5354
01:33:05,590 --> 01:33:05,600
scenarios
 

5355
01:33:05,600 --> 01:33:07,350
scenarios
so

5356
01:33:07,350 --> 01:33:07,360
so
 

5357
01:33:07,360 --> 01:33:09,189
so
when i studied the drivers

5358
01:33:09,189 --> 01:33:09,199
when i studied the drivers
 

5359
01:33:09,199 --> 01:33:11,270
when i studied the drivers
you had this like

5360
01:33:11,270 --> 01:33:11,280
you had this like
 

5361
01:33:11,280 --> 01:33:13,030
you had this like
complete difference in

5362
01:33:13,030 --> 01:33:13,040
complete difference in
 

5363
01:33:13,040 --> 01:33:14,950
complete difference in
the driving tasks

5364
01:33:14,950 --> 01:33:14,960
the driving tasks
 

5365
01:33:14,960 --> 01:33:16,709
the driving tasks
like we were talking about before with

5366
01:33:16,709 --> 01:33:16,719
like we were talking about before with
 

5367
01:33:16,719 --> 01:33:20,070
like we were talking about before with
long haul and city right and

5368
01:33:20,070 --> 01:33:20,080
long haul and city right and
 

5369
01:33:20,080 --> 01:33:21,750
long haul and city right and
you're not paid in the city you've got

5370
01:33:21,750 --> 01:33:21,760
you're not paid in the city you've got
 

5371
01:33:21,760 --> 01:33:24,709
you're not paid in the city you've got
congestion the turns are tight

5372
01:33:24,709 --> 01:33:24,719
congestion the turns are tight
 

5373
01:33:24,719 --> 01:33:27,590
congestion the turns are tight
um there's lots of you know pedestrians

5374
01:33:27,590 --> 01:33:27,600
um there's lots of you know pedestrians
 

5375
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:28,310
um there's lots of you know pedestrians
you know all the things that

5376
01:33:28,310 --> 01:33:28,320
you know all the things that
 

5377
01:33:28,320 --> 01:33:30,149
you know all the things that
self-driving trucks don't like truckers

5378
01:33:30,149 --> 01:33:30,159
self-driving trucks don't like truckers
 

5379
01:33:30,159 --> 01:33:33,910
self-driving trucks don't like truckers
don't like right and they're not paid

5380
01:33:33,910 --> 01:33:33,920
don't like right and they're not paid
 

5381
01:33:33,920 --> 01:33:35,990
don't like right and they're not paid
there's lots of waiting time and then in

5382
01:33:35,990 --> 01:33:36,000
there's lots of waiting time and then in
 

5383
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:37,910
there's lots of waiting time and then in
the highway they get to cruise they're

5384
01:33:37,910 --> 01:33:37,920
the highway they get to cruise they're
 

5385
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:39,910
the highway they get to cruise they're
getting paid they have control they go

5386
01:33:39,910 --> 01:33:39,920
getting paid they have control they go
 

5387
01:33:39,920 --> 01:33:41,830
getting paid they have control they go
at their own pace they're making money

5388
01:33:41,830 --> 01:33:41,840
at their own pace they're making money
 

5389
01:33:41,840 --> 01:33:43,030
at their own pace they're making money
they're happy

5390
01:33:43,030 --> 01:33:43,040
they're happy
 

5391
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:45,030
they're happy
well it turned out i guess it was around

5392
01:33:45,030 --> 01:33:45,040
well it turned out i guess it was around
 

5393
01:33:45,040 --> 01:33:47,270
well it turned out i guess it was around
2010 this is still when we were thinking

5394
01:33:47,270 --> 01:33:47,280
2010 this is still when we were thinking
 

5395
01:33:47,280 --> 01:33:48,950
2010 this is still when we were thinking
about regenerative braking you know and

5396
01:33:48,950 --> 01:33:48,960
about regenerative braking you know and
 

5397
01:33:48,960 --> 01:33:50,550
about regenerative braking you know and
hybrid trucks being sort of like the

5398
01:33:50,550 --> 01:33:50,560
hybrid trucks being sort of like the
 

5399
01:33:50,560 --> 01:33:51,590
hybrid trucks being sort of like the
solution

5400
01:33:51,590 --> 01:33:51,600
solution
 

5401
01:33:51,600 --> 01:33:53,270
solution
um

5402
01:33:53,270 --> 01:33:53,280
um
 

5403
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:54,229
um
the

5404
01:33:54,229 --> 01:33:54,239
the
 

5405
01:33:54,239 --> 01:33:56,390
the
problems with them sort of and the

5406
01:33:56,390 --> 01:33:56,400
problems with them sort of and the
 

5407
01:33:56,400 --> 01:33:58,709
problems with them sort of and the
advantages you know also split on what i

5408
01:33:58,709 --> 01:33:58,719
advantages you know also split on what i
 

5409
01:33:58,719 --> 01:34:00,390
advantages you know also split on what i
was thinking of kind of the rural urban

5410
01:34:00,390 --> 01:34:00,400
was thinking of kind of the rural urban
 

5411
01:34:00,400 --> 01:34:02,470
was thinking of kind of the rural urban
divide at that time right so like you

5412
01:34:02,470 --> 01:34:02,480
divide at that time right so like you
 

5413
01:34:02,480 --> 01:34:04,950
divide at that time right so like you
got the regenerative braking right um

5414
01:34:04,950 --> 01:34:04,960
got the regenerative braking right um
 

5415
01:34:04,960 --> 01:34:06,629
got the regenerative braking right um
you can make the truck lighter you can

5416
01:34:06,629 --> 01:34:06,639
you can make the truck lighter you can
 

5417
01:34:06,639 --> 01:34:09,030
you can make the truck lighter you can
keep it local right um you don't get any

5418
01:34:09,030 --> 01:34:09,040
keep it local right um you don't get any
 

5419
01:34:09,040 --> 01:34:11,030
keep it local right um you don't get any
benefit from that you know hybrid

5420
01:34:11,030 --> 01:34:11,040
benefit from that you know hybrid
 

5421
01:34:11,040 --> 01:34:13,110
benefit from that you know hybrid
electric in the

5422
01:34:13,110 --> 01:34:13,120
electric in the
 

5423
01:34:13,120 --> 01:34:13,910
electric in the
uh

5424
01:34:13,910 --> 01:34:13,920
uh
 

5425
01:34:13,920 --> 01:34:15,910
uh
on the rural highway you want

5426
01:34:15,910 --> 01:34:15,920
on the rural highway you want
 

5427
01:34:15,920 --> 01:34:17,830
on the rural highway you want
aerodynamics right

5428
01:34:17,830 --> 01:34:17,840
aerodynamics right
 

5429
01:34:17,840 --> 01:34:19,830
aerodynamics right
there you want low rolling resistance

5430
01:34:19,830 --> 01:34:19,840
there you want low rolling resistance
 

5431
01:34:19,840 --> 01:34:21,990
there you want low rolling resistance
tires and these super aerodynamic sleek

5432
01:34:21,990 --> 01:34:22,000
tires and these super aerodynamic sleek
 

5433
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:23,990
tires and these super aerodynamic sleek
trucks right where we know with

5434
01:34:23,990 --> 01:34:24,000
trucks right where we know with
 

5435
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,550
trucks right where we know with
off-the-shelf technology today we could

5436
01:34:26,550 --> 01:34:26,560
off-the-shelf technology today we could
 

5437
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:28,310
off-the-shelf technology today we could
double the fuel economy more than double

5438
01:34:28,310 --> 01:34:28,320
double the fuel economy more than double
 

5439

the fuel economy of the typical truck in
 

5441
01:34:30,480 --> 01:34:33,189
the fuel economy of the typical truck in
that highway segment if we segmented the

5442
01:34:33,189 --> 01:34:33,199
that highway segment if we segmented the
 

5443
01:34:33,199 --> 01:34:35,910
that highway segment if we segmented the
duty cycle right and so in the urban

5444
01:34:35,910 --> 01:34:35,920
duty cycle right and so in the urban
 

5445
01:34:35,920 --> 01:34:37,350

01:34:53,030 --> 01:34:53,040
in the long haul you want that super
 

5463
01:34:53,040 --> 01:34:54,550
in the long haul you want that super
aerodynamic stuff now that doesn't get

aerodynamic stuff now that doesn't get
 

5465
01:34:54,560 --> 01:34:56,070
aerodynamic stuff now that doesn't get
you anything in the city and in fact it

5466
01:34:56,070 --> 01:34:56,080
you anything in the city and in fact it
 

5467
01:34:56,080 --> 01:34:57,669
you anything in the city and in fact it
causes all kinds of problems because you

5468
01:34:57,669 --> 01:34:57,679
causes all kinds of problems because you
 

5469
01:34:57,679 --> 01:34:59,189
causes all kinds of problems because you
turn too tight you crunch up all the

5470
01:34:59,189 --> 01:34:59,199
turn too tight you crunch up all the
 

5471
01:34:59,199 --> 01:35:01,350
turn too tight you crunch up all the

the idea that i had was like okay what

5476
01:35:05,830 --> 01:35:05,840
the idea that i had was like okay what
 

5477
01:35:05,840 --> 01:35:08,070
the idea that i had was like okay what
if we deliberately segmented it like

5478
01:35:08,070 --> 01:35:08,080
if we deliberately segmented it like
 

5479
01:35:08,080 --> 01:35:10,390
if we deliberately segmented it like
what if we created these drop lots

5480
01:35:10,390 --> 01:35:10,400
what if we created these drop lots
 

5481
01:35:10,400 --> 01:35:12,390
what if we created these drop lots
outside cities

5482
01:35:12,390 --> 01:35:12,400
outside cities
 

5483
01:35:12,400 --> 01:35:13,270

01:35:17,750 --> 01:35:17,760
by the hour kind of runs these trailers
 

5489
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:19,030
by the hour kind of runs these trailers
out once they're loaded you know it

5490
01:35:19,030 --> 01:35:19,040
out once they're loaded you know it
 

5491
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:20,229
out once they're loaded you know it
doesn't sit there and wait while it's

5492
01:35:20,229 --> 01:35:20,239
doesn't sit there and wait while it's
 

5493
01:35:20,239 --> 01:35:21,669
doesn't sit there and wait while it's
being loaded they drop off a trailer

5494
01:35:21,669 --> 01:35:21,679
being loaded they drop off a trailer
 

5495
01:35:21,679 --> 01:35:23,030
being loaded they drop off a trailer
they go pick up one that's loaded they

5496
01:35:23,030 --> 01:35:23,040
they go pick up one that's loaded they
 

5497
01:35:23,040 --> 01:35:24,550
they go pick up one that's loaded they
run it out when it's loaded they call

5498
01:35:24,550 --> 01:35:24,560
run it out when it's loaded they call
 

5499
01:35:24,560 --> 01:35:25,910
run it out when it's loaded they call
them and they just run them out there

5500
01:35:25,910 --> 01:35:25,920
them and they just run them out there
 

5501
01:35:25,920 --> 01:35:28,310
them and they just run them out there
and stage them it's like an uber driver

5502
01:35:28,310 --> 01:35:28,320
and stage them it's like an uber driver
 

5503
01:35:28,320 --> 01:35:31,030
and stage them it's like an uber driver
but for uh truckloads yeah we have like

5504
01:35:31,030 --> 01:35:31,040
but for uh truckloads yeah we have like
 

5505
01:35:31,040 --> 01:35:33,109
but for uh truckloads yeah we have like
intermodal we have like we have

5506
01:35:33,109 --> 01:35:33,119
intermodal we have like we have
 

5507
01:35:33,119 --> 01:35:34,550
intermodal we have like we have
basically this would be the equivalent

5508
01:35:34,550 --> 01:35:34,560
basically this would be the equivalent
 

5509
01:35:34,560 --> 01:35:36,950
basically this would be the equivalent
of like rail to truck inner motor right

5510
01:35:36,950 --> 01:35:36,960
of like rail to truck inner motor right
 

5511
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:38,470
of like rail to truck inner motor right
so you put it on the rail and then you

5512
01:35:38,470 --> 01:35:38,480
so you put it on the rail and then you
 

5513
01:35:38,480 --> 01:35:39,830
so you put it on the rail and then you
know a truck trucker picks it up and

5514
01:35:39,830 --> 01:35:39,840
know a truck trucker picks it up and
 

5515
01:35:39,840 --> 01:35:41,350
know a truck trucker picks it up and
delivers it right so instead of having

5516
01:35:41,350 --> 01:35:41,360
delivers it right so instead of having
 

5517
01:35:41,360 --> 01:35:42,870
delivers it right so instead of having
the rail you'd have these super

5518
01:35:42,870 --> 01:35:42,880
the rail you'd have these super
 

5519
01:35:42,880 --> 01:35:45,910
the rail you'd have these super
aerodynamic hopefully platoons or or

5520
01:35:45,910 --> 01:35:45,920
aerodynamic hopefully platoons or or
 

5521
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:47,590
aerodynamic hopefully platoons or or
what was at the time was called long

5522
01:35:47,590 --> 01:35:47,600
what was at the time was called long
 

5523
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:49,350
what was at the time was called long
combination vehicles which is basically

5524
01:35:49,350 --> 01:35:49,360
combination vehicles which is basically
 

5525
01:35:49,360 --> 01:35:50,870
combination vehicles which is basically
two trailers connected together right

5526
01:35:50,870 --> 01:35:50,880
two trailers connected together right
 

5527
01:35:50,880 --> 01:35:52,550
two trailers connected together right
because this is like a huge productivity

5528
01:35:52,550 --> 01:35:52,560
because this is like a huge productivity
 

5529
01:35:52,560 --> 01:35:55,109
because this is like a huge productivity
gain right um and then instead of that

5530
01:35:55,109 --> 01:35:55,119
gain right um and then instead of that
 

5531
01:35:55,119 --> 01:35:56,870
gain right um and then instead of that
driver like me i would pick up something

going back right and be home every night
 

5553
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:17,510
going back right and be home every night
now the problem with that at the time or

5554
01:36:17,510 --> 01:36:17,520
now the problem with that at the time or
 

5555
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:19,430
now the problem with that at the time or
one of them was you know

5556
01:36:19,430 --> 01:36:19,440
one of them was you know
 

5557
01:36:19,440 --> 01:36:21,510
one of them was you know
bridge weights so you can't not all

5558
01:36:21,510 --> 01:36:21,520
bridge weights so you can't not all
 

5559
01:36:21,520 --> 01:36:23,030
bridge weights so you can't not all
bridges can handle

5560
01:36:23,030 --> 01:36:23,040
bridges can handle
 

5561
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:25,510
bridges can handle
that that much weight on them they can't

5562
01:36:25,510 --> 01:36:25,520
that that much weight on them they can't
 

5563
01:36:25,520 --> 01:36:26,709
that that much weight on them they can't
handle these doubles right and some

5564
01:36:26,709 --> 01:36:26,719
handle these doubles right and some
 

5565
01:36:26,719 --> 01:36:28,870
handle these doubles right and some
places can some places can't so this

5566
01:36:28,870 --> 01:36:28,880
places can some places can't so this
 

5567
01:36:28,880 --> 01:36:30,629
places can some places can't so this
platooning idea was happening at the

5568
01:36:30,629 --> 01:36:30,639
platooning idea was happening at the
 

5569
01:36:30,639 --> 01:36:32,470
platooning idea was happening at the
same time and we ended up on the same

5570
01:36:32,470 --> 01:36:32,480
same time and we ended up on the same
 

5571
01:36:32,480 --> 01:36:35,910
same time and we ended up on the same
panel and the founders were like hey so

5572
01:36:35,910 --> 01:36:35,920
panel and the founders were like hey so
 

5573
01:36:35,920 --> 01:36:37,990
panel and the founders were like hey so
what's it like to follow really close

5574
01:36:37,990 --> 01:36:38,000
what's it like to follow really close
 

5575
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:39,510
what's it like to follow really close
behind another truck which was kind of

5576
01:36:39,510 --> 01:36:39,520
behind another truck which was kind of
 

5577
01:36:39,520 --> 01:36:41,109
behind another truck which was kind of
the the stage that they were at was like

5578
01:36:41,109 --> 01:36:41,119
the the stage that they were at was like
 

5579
01:36:41,119 --> 01:36:42,629
the the stage that they were at was like
you know what's that experience gonna be

5580
01:36:42,629 --> 01:36:42,639
you know what's that experience gonna be
 

5581
01:36:42,639 --> 01:36:44,709
you know what's that experience gonna be
like and i was like it truckers aren't

5582
01:36:44,709 --> 01:36:44,719
like and i was like it truckers aren't
 

5583
01:36:44,719 --> 01:36:46,629
like and i was like it truckers aren't
gonna like it you know i mean that

5584
01:36:46,629 --> 01:36:46,639
gonna like it you know i mean that
 

5585
01:36:46,639 --> 01:36:48,790
gonna like it you know i mean that
that's just like the cardinal rule is

5586
01:36:48,790 --> 01:36:48,800
that's just like the cardinal rule is
 

5587
01:36:48,800 --> 01:36:50,629
that's just like the cardinal rule is
following distance like that's the one

5588
01:36:50,629 --> 01:36:50,639
following distance like that's the one
 

5589
01:36:50,639 --> 01:36:52,790
following distance like that's the one
you really shouldn't violate right um

5590
01:36:52,790 --> 01:36:52,800
you really shouldn't violate right um
 

5591
01:36:52,800 --> 01:36:54,070
you really shouldn't violate right um
and and when you're out on the road like

5592
01:36:54,070 --> 01:36:54,080
and and when you're out on the road like
 

5593
01:36:54,080 --> 01:36:55,510
and and when you're out on the road like
you have that trucker like right on your

5594
01:36:55,510 --> 01:36:55,520
you have that trucker like right on your
 

5595
01:36:55,520 --> 01:36:58,229
you have that trucker like right on your
ass you know people remember that they

5596
01:36:58,229 --> 01:36:58,239
ass you know people remember that they
 

5597
01:36:58,239 --> 01:37:00,709
ass you know people remember that they
don't remember the 99.9

5598
01:37:00,709 --> 01:37:00,719
don't remember the 99.9
 

5599
01:37:00,719 --> 01:37:02,709
don't remember the 99.9
of truckers that are not on their ass

5600
01:37:02,709 --> 01:37:02,719
of truckers that are not on their ass
 

5601
01:37:02,719 --> 01:37:04,550
of truckers that are not on their ass
you know like they they they're very

5602
01:37:04,550 --> 01:37:04,560
you know like they they they're very
 

5603
01:37:04,560 --> 01:37:05,990
you know like they they they're very
careful about that but when you're when

5604
01:37:05,990 --> 01:37:06,000
careful about that but when you're when
 

5605
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:07,430
careful about that but when you're when
the trucks are really close together

5606
01:37:07,430 --> 01:37:07,440
the trucks are really close together
 

5607
01:37:07,440 --> 01:37:08,709
the trucks are really close together
there's benefits in terms of

5608
01:37:08,709 --> 01:37:08,719
there's benefits in terms of
 

5609
01:37:08,719 --> 01:37:11,590
there's benefits in terms of
aerodynamics so that's the the idea so

5610
01:37:11,590 --> 01:37:11,600
aerodynamics so that's the the idea so
 

5611
01:37:11,600 --> 01:37:12,870
aerodynamics so that's the the idea so
like if you

5612
01:37:12,870 --> 01:37:12,880
like if you
 

5613
01:37:12,880 --> 01:37:15,510
like if you
want to get some benefits of uh a

5614
01:37:15,510 --> 01:37:15,520
want to get some benefits of uh a
 

5615
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:17,350
want to get some benefits of uh a
platoon you want that to be close

5616
01:37:17,350 --> 01:37:17,360
platoon you want that to be close
 

5617
01:37:17,360 --> 01:37:18,629
platoon you want that to be close
together but you're saying that's very

5618
01:37:18,629 --> 01:37:18,639
together but you're saying that's very
 

5619
01:37:18,639 --> 01:37:20,709
together but you're saying that's very
uncomfortable for truckers yeah so i

5620
01:37:20,709 --> 01:37:20,719
uncomfortable for truckers yeah so i
 

5621
01:37:20,719 --> 01:37:22,470
uncomfortable for truckers yeah so i
mean i think that ended up at the i mean

5622
01:37:22,470 --> 01:37:22,480
mean i think that ended up at the i mean
 

5623
01:37:22,480 --> 01:37:24,229
mean i think that ended up at the i mean
peloton i think is is sort of winding

5624
01:37:24,229 --> 01:37:24,239
peloton i think is is sort of winding
 

5625
01:37:24,239 --> 01:37:28,229
peloton i think is is sort of winding
down um their their work on this um and

5626
01:37:28,229 --> 01:37:28,239
down um their their work on this um and
 

5627
01:37:28,239 --> 01:37:29,990
down um their their work on this um and
i think that ended up being still an

5628
01:37:29,990 --> 01:37:30,000
i think that ended up being still an
 

5629
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,229
i think that ended up being still an
open question like and i had a chance to

5630
01:37:32,229 --> 01:37:32,239
open question like and i had a chance to
 

5631
01:37:32,239 --> 01:37:34,470
open question like and i had a chance to
interview a couple drivers who um at

5632
01:37:34,470 --> 01:37:34,480
interview a couple drivers who um at
 

5633
01:37:34,480 --> 01:37:36,070
interview a couple drivers who um at
least one maybe two of which had

5634
01:37:36,070 --> 01:37:36,080
least one maybe two of which had
 

5635
01:37:36,080 --> 01:37:38,709
least one maybe two of which had
actually driven in their platoons um and

5636
01:37:38,709 --> 01:37:38,719
actually driven in their platoons um and
 

5637
01:37:38,719 --> 01:37:41,109
actually driven in their platoons um and
i got completely different experiences

5638
01:37:41,109 --> 01:37:41,119
i got completely different experiences
 

5639
01:37:41,119 --> 01:37:43,189
i got completely different experiences
some of them were like it's really cool

5640
01:37:43,189 --> 01:37:43,199
some of them were like it's really cool
 

5641
01:37:43,199 --> 01:37:44,550
some of them were like it's really cool
you know i'm like in communication with

5642
01:37:44,550 --> 01:37:44,560
you know i'm like in communication with
 

5643
01:37:44,560 --> 01:37:47,270
you know i'm like in communication with
that other driver um you know i can see

5644
01:37:47,270 --> 01:37:47,280
that other driver um you know i can see
 

5645
01:37:47,280 --> 01:37:49,830
that other driver um you know i can see
on a screen what what's out out you know

5646
01:37:49,830 --> 01:37:49,840
on a screen what what's out out you know
 

5647
01:37:49,840 --> 01:37:51,750
on a screen what what's out out you know
the front of his truck um and then

5648
01:37:51,750 --> 01:37:51,760
the front of his truck um and then
 

5649
01:37:51,760 --> 01:37:53,910
the front of his truck um and then
somewhere like it's too close um and it

5650
01:37:53,910 --> 01:37:53,920
somewhere like it's too close um and it
 

5651
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:55,109
somewhere like it's too close um and it
might be one of those things that's just

5652
01:37:55,109 --> 01:37:55,119
might be one of those things that's just
 

5653
01:37:55,119 --> 01:37:56,709
might be one of those things that's just
you know takes an adjustment to to sort

5654
01:37:56,709 --> 01:37:56,719
you know takes an adjustment to to sort
 

5655
01:37:56,719 --> 01:37:57,750
you know takes an adjustment to to sort
of get there

5656
01:37:57,750 --> 01:37:57,760
of get there
 

5657
01:37:57,760 --> 01:37:59,350
of get there
so you get the aerodynamic advantage

5658
01:37:59,350 --> 01:37:59,360
so you get the aerodynamic advantage
 

5659
01:37:59,360 --> 01:38:01,750
so you get the aerodynamic advantage
which which you know saves fuel um

5660
01:38:01,750 --> 01:38:01,760
which which you know saves fuel um
 

5661
01:38:01,760 --> 01:38:03,669
which which you know saves fuel um
there's some problems though right so

5662
01:38:03,669 --> 01:38:03,679
there's some problems though right so
 

5663
01:38:03,679 --> 01:38:06,310
there's some problems though right so
you know you're getting that aerodynamic

5664
01:38:06,310 --> 01:38:06,320
you know you're getting that aerodynamic
 

5665
01:38:06,320 --> 01:38:07,830
you know you're getting that aerodynamic
advantage because there's a low pressure

5666
01:38:07,830 --> 01:38:07,840
advantage because there's a low pressure
 

5667
01:38:07,840 --> 01:38:10,310
advantage because there's a low pressure
system in front of that following truck

5668
01:38:10,310 --> 01:38:10,320
system in front of that following truck
 

5669
01:38:10,320 --> 01:38:12,870
system in front of that following truck
but the the engine is designed with

5670
01:38:12,870 --> 01:38:12,880
but the the engine is designed with
 

5671
01:38:12,880 --> 01:38:15,590
but the the engine is designed with
higher pressure um feeding that engine

5672
01:38:15,590 --> 01:38:15,600
higher pressure um feeding that engine
 

5673
01:38:15,600 --> 01:38:17,270
higher pressure um feeding that engine
right so there are sort of adjustments

5674
01:38:17,270 --> 01:38:17,280
right so there are sort of adjustments
 

5675
01:38:17,280 --> 01:38:19,510
right so there are sort of adjustments
that you need to make and you know still

5676
01:38:19,510 --> 01:38:19,520
that you need to make and you know still
 

5677
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:21,669
that you need to make and you know still
the benefits are are there

5678
01:38:21,669 --> 01:38:21,679
the benefits are are there
 

5679
01:38:21,679 --> 01:38:23,430
the benefits are are there
that's one scenario and that's just the

5680
01:38:23,430 --> 01:38:23,440
that's one scenario and that's just the
 

5681
01:38:23,440 --> 01:38:25,750
that's one scenario and that's just the
automation of that acceleration and

5682
01:38:25,750 --> 01:38:25,760
automation of that acceleration and
 

5683
01:38:25,760 --> 01:38:26,790
automation of that acceleration and
braking

5684
01:38:26,790 --> 01:38:26,800
braking
 

5685
01:38:26,800 --> 01:38:29,430
braking
starsky which um you know

5686
01:38:29,430 --> 01:38:29,440
starsky which um you know
 

5687
01:38:29,440 --> 01:38:31,430
starsky which um you know
probably a lot of your listeners heard

5688
01:38:31,430 --> 01:38:31,440
probably a lot of your listeners heard
 

5689
01:38:31,440 --> 01:38:32,550
probably a lot of your listeners heard
heard about

5690
01:38:32,550 --> 01:38:32,560
heard about
 

5691
01:38:32,560 --> 01:38:34,870
heard about
um was working on another scenario which

5692
01:38:34,870 --> 01:38:34,880
um was working on another scenario which
 

5693
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:36,310
um was working on another scenario which
was

5694
01:38:36,310 --> 01:38:36,320
was
 

5695
01:38:36,320 --> 01:38:38,229
was
you know to solve that local problem was

5696
01:38:38,229 --> 01:38:38,239
you know to solve that local problem was
 

5697
01:38:38,239 --> 01:38:40,629
you know to solve that local problem was
going to do tele operation right sort of

5698
01:38:40,629 --> 01:38:40,639
going to do tele operation right sort of
 

5699
01:38:40,639 --> 01:38:43,669
going to do tele operation right sort of
remote piloting um i had a chance to you

5700
01:38:43,669 --> 01:38:43,679
remote piloting um i had a chance to you
 

5701
01:38:43,679 --> 01:38:45,350
remote piloting um i had a chance to you
know sort of watch

5702
01:38:45,350 --> 01:38:45,360
know sort of watch
 

5703
01:38:45,360 --> 01:38:47,189
know sort of watch
watch them do that it was you know they

5704
01:38:47,189 --> 01:38:47,199
watch them do that it was you know they
 

5705
01:38:47,199 --> 01:38:50,550
watch them do that it was you know they
they drove a truck in florida from um

5706
01:38:50,550 --> 01:38:50,560
they drove a truck in florida from um
 

5707
01:38:50,560 --> 01:38:52,310
they drove a truck in florida from um
from san francisco in in one of their

5708
01:38:52,310 --> 01:38:52,320
from san francisco in in one of their
 

5709
01:38:52,320 --> 01:38:54,070
from san francisco in in one of their
office offices uh that was that was

5710
01:38:54,070 --> 01:38:54,080
office offices uh that was that was
 

5711
01:38:54,080 --> 01:38:55,669
office offices uh that was that was
really interesting and then in case it's

5712
01:38:55,669 --> 01:38:55,679
really interesting and then in case it's
 

5713
01:38:55,679 --> 01:38:57,430
really interesting and then in case it's
not clear tele operation means you're

5714
01:38:57,430 --> 01:38:57,440
not clear tele operation means you're
 

5715
01:38:57,440 --> 01:38:58,390
not clear tele operation means you're
controlling

5716
01:38:58,390 --> 01:38:58,400
controlling
 

5717
01:38:58,400 --> 01:39:00,229
controlling
the truck remotely like it's a video

5718
01:39:00,229 --> 01:39:00,239
the truck remotely like it's a video
 

5719
01:39:00,239 --> 01:39:01,750
the truck remotely like it's a video
game

5720
01:39:01,750 --> 01:39:01,760
game
 

5721
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:03,430
game
so uh

5722
01:39:03,430 --> 01:39:03,440
so uh
 

5723
01:39:03,440 --> 01:39:05,109
so uh
you got the chance to witness it does it

5724
01:39:05,109 --> 01:39:05,119
you got the chance to witness it does it
 

5725
01:39:05,119 --> 01:39:06,790
you got the chance to witness it does it
actually work

5726
01:39:06,790 --> 01:39:06,800
actually work
 

5727
01:39:06,800 --> 01:39:09,270
actually work
yeah i mean so it's uh what are the pros

5728
01:39:09,270 --> 01:39:09,280
yeah i mean so it's uh what are the pros
 

5729
01:39:09,280 --> 01:39:10,870
yeah i mean so it's uh what are the pros
and cons you know one of the problems

5730
01:39:10,870 --> 01:39:10,880
and cons you know one of the problems
 

5731
01:39:10,880 --> 01:39:12,950
and cons you know one of the problems
with with doing research like this with

5732
01:39:12,950 --> 01:39:12,960
with with doing research like this with
 

5733
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:14,709
with with doing research like this with
all these with all these silicon valley

5734
01:39:14,709 --> 01:39:14,719
all these with all these silicon valley
 

5735
01:39:14,719 --> 01:39:16,390
all these with all these silicon valley
folks are the ndas

5736
01:39:16,390 --> 01:39:16,400
folks are the ndas
 

5737
01:39:16,400 --> 01:39:17,430
folks are the ndas
all right

5738
01:39:17,430 --> 01:39:17,440
all right
 

5739
01:39:17,440 --> 01:39:18,950
all right
right so so i don't you know i don't

5740
01:39:18,950 --> 01:39:18,960
right so so i don't you know i don't
 

5741
01:39:18,960 --> 01:39:20,950
right so so i don't you know i don't
know what i'm able to say uh about sort

5742
01:39:20,950 --> 01:39:20,960
know what i'm able to say uh about sort
 

5743
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:23,109
know what i'm able to say uh about sort
of watching it but obviously the their

5744
01:39:23,109 --> 01:39:23,119
of watching it but obviously the their
 

5745
01:39:23,119 --> 01:39:24,709
of watching it but obviously the their
public statements about sort of what the

5746
01:39:24,709 --> 01:39:24,719
public statements about sort of what the
 

5747
01:39:24,719 --> 01:39:26,229
public statements about sort of what the
challenges are right and it's about the

5748
01:39:26,229 --> 01:39:26,239
challenges are right and it's about the
 

5749
01:39:26,239 --> 01:39:27,750
challenges are right and it's about the
the latency

5750
01:39:27,750 --> 01:39:27,760
the latency

this point i have a sense that driving
is

5880
01:41:43,109 --> 01:41:43,119
is
 

5881
01:41:43,119 --> 01:41:45,270
is
really difficult

01:41:45,270 --> 01:41:45,280
really difficult
 

5883
01:41:45,280 --> 01:41:46,950

01:42:14,390 --> 01:42:14,400
just have to get everything into a
 

5913
01:42:14,400 --> 01:42:17,109
just have to get everything into a
pocket yeah to me there seems to be some

5914
01:42:17,109 --> 01:42:17,119
pocket yeah to me there seems to be some
 

5915
01:42:17,119 --> 01:42:18,870
pocket yeah to me there seems to be some
game theoretic dance

5916
01:42:18,870 --> 01:42:18,880
game theoretic dance
 

5917
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:20,550
game theoretic dance
uh combined with the fact that people's

5918
01:42:20,550 --> 01:42:20,560
uh combined with the fact that people's
 

5919
01:42:20,560 --> 01:42:23,030
uh combined with the fact that people's
life is at stake and then when people

5920
01:42:23,030 --> 01:42:23,040
life is at stake and then when people
 

5921
01:42:23,040 --> 01:42:24,870
life is at stake and then when people
die at the hands of a robot the reaction

5922
01:42:24,870 --> 01:42:24,880
die at the hands of a robot the reaction
 

5923
01:42:24,880 --> 01:42:26,629
die at the hands of a robot the reaction
is going to be much more complicated so

5924
01:42:26,629 --> 01:42:26,639
is going to be much more complicated so
 

5925
01:42:26,639 --> 01:42:28,229
is going to be much more complicated so
all of that but that's still an open

5926
01:42:28,229 --> 01:42:28,239
all of that but that's still an open
 

5927
01:42:28,239 --> 01:42:29,990
all of that but that's still an open
question and the cool thing is all of

5928
01:42:29,990 --> 01:42:30,000
question and the cool thing is all of
 

5929
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:31,830
question and the cool thing is all of
these companies

5930
01:42:31,830 --> 01:42:31,840
these companies
 

5931
01:42:31,840 --> 01:42:34,070
these companies
are struggling with this question

5932
01:42:34,070 --> 01:42:34,080
are struggling with this question
 

5933
01:42:34,080 --> 01:42:36,550
are struggling with this question
of how difficult is it to solve this

5934
01:42:36,550 --> 01:42:36,560
of how difficult is it to solve this
 

5935
01:42:36,560 --> 01:42:38,470
of how difficult is it to solve this
problem sufficiently such that we can

5936
01:42:38,470 --> 01:42:38,480
problem sufficiently such that we can
 

5937
01:42:38,480 --> 01:42:39,990
problem sufficiently such that we can
build the business on top of it and have

5938
01:42:39,990 --> 01:42:40,000
build the business on top of it and have
 

5939
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:41,910
build the business on top of it and have
a product that's going to make a huge

5940
01:42:41,910 --> 01:42:41,920
a product that's going to make a huge
 

5941
01:42:41,920 --> 01:42:43,669
a product that's going to make a huge
amount of money and compete with the

5942
01:42:43,669 --> 01:42:43,679
amount of money and compete with the
 

5943
01:42:43,679 --> 01:42:45,830
amount of money and compete with the
manually driven uh

5944
01:42:45,830 --> 01:42:45,840
manually driven uh
 

5945
01:42:45,840 --> 01:42:48,629
manually driven uh
vehicles and so their tele operation

5946
01:42:48,629 --> 01:42:48,639
vehicles and so their tele operation
 

5947
01:42:48,639 --> 01:42:50,310
vehicles and so their tele operation
from starsky's is a really interesting

5948
01:42:50,310 --> 01:42:50,320
from starsky's is a really interesting
 

5949
01:42:50,320 --> 01:42:52,229
from starsky's is a really interesting
idea how much

5950
01:42:52,229 --> 01:42:52,239
idea how much
 

5951
01:42:52,239 --> 01:42:54,470
idea how much
can uh i mean there's a few autonomous

5952
01:42:54,470 --> 01:42:54,480
can uh i mean there's a few autonomous
 

5953
01:42:54,480 --> 01:42:56,470
can uh i mean there's a few autonomous
vehicle companies that tried to

5954
01:42:56,470 --> 01:42:56,480
vehicle companies that tried to
 

5955
01:42:56,480 --> 01:42:58,870
vehicle companies that tried to
integrate tele operation in the picture

5956
01:42:58,870 --> 01:42:58,880
integrate tele operation in the picture
 

5957
01:42:58,880 --> 01:42:59,910
integrate tele operation in the picture
can we

5958
01:42:59,910 --> 01:42:59,920
can we
 

5959
01:42:59,920 --> 01:43:02,149
can we
reduce some of the costs

5960
01:43:02,149 --> 01:43:02,159
reduce some of the costs
 

5961
01:43:02,159 --> 01:43:04,550
reduce some of the costs
while still having reliability

5962
01:43:04,550 --> 01:43:04,560
while still having reliability
 

5963
01:43:04,560 --> 01:43:07,510
while still having reliability
like uh

5964
01:43:07,510 --> 01:43:07,520

 

5965
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:09,270

catch when the vehicle

5966
01:43:09,270 --> 01:43:09,280
catch when the vehicle
 

5967
01:43:09,280 --> 01:43:11,830
catch when the vehicle
fails by having tele operation it's an

5968
01:43:11,830 --> 01:43:11,840
fails by having tele operation it's an
 

5969
01:43:11,840 --> 01:43:13,669
fails by having tele operation it's an
open question

5970
01:43:13,669 --> 01:43:13,679
open question
 

5971
01:43:13,679 --> 01:43:14,550
open question
so

5972
01:43:14,550 --> 01:43:14,560
so
 

5973
01:43:14,560 --> 01:43:16,470
so
that's that's for you scenario number

5974
01:43:16,470 --> 01:43:16,480
that's that's for you scenario number
 

5975
01:43:16,480 --> 01:43:19,189
that's that's for you scenario number
two is to uh use teleoperation as part

5976
01:43:19,189 --> 01:43:19,199
two is to uh use teleoperation as part
 

5977
01:43:19,199 --> 01:43:21,270
two is to uh use teleoperation as part
of the picture yeah let me let me follow

5978
01:43:21,270 --> 01:43:21,280
of the picture yeah let me let me follow
 

5979
01:43:21,280 --> 01:43:23,030
of the picture yeah let me let me follow
up on that question of how hard driving

5980
01:43:23,030 --> 01:43:23,040
up on that question of how hard driving
 

5981
01:43:23,040 --> 01:43:25,430
up on that question of how hard driving
is because this this becomes a big

5982
01:43:25,430 --> 01:43:25,440
is because this this becomes a big
 

5983
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:26,629
is because this this becomes a big
question for researchers who are

5984
01:43:26,629 --> 01:43:26,639
question for researchers who are
 

5985
01:43:26,639 --> 01:43:28,149
question for researchers who are
thinking about labor market impacts

5986
01:43:28,149 --> 01:43:28,159
thinking about labor market impacts
 

5987
01:43:28,159 --> 01:43:29,590
thinking about labor market impacts
right because

5988
01:43:29,590 --> 01:43:29,600
right because
 

5989
01:43:29,600 --> 01:43:32,070
right because
we start from a perspective of what's

5990
01:43:32,070 --> 01:43:32,080
we start from a perspective of what's
 

5991
01:43:32,080 --> 01:43:35,990
we start from a perspective of what's
hard or easy for humans right um and so

5992
01:43:35,990 --> 01:43:36,000
hard or easy for humans right um and so
 

5993
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,149
hard or easy for humans right um and so
you know if you were to look at truck

5994
01:43:38,149 --> 01:43:38,159
you know if you were to look at truck
 

5995
01:43:38,159 --> 01:43:40,070
you know if you were to look at truck
driving prior to a lot i mean there's

5996
01:43:40,070 --> 01:43:40,080
driving prior to a lot i mean there's
 

5997
01:43:40,080 --> 01:43:42,870
driving prior to a lot i mean there's
been a lot of thinking and debate in um

5998
01:43:42,870 --> 01:43:42,880
been a lot of thinking and debate in um
 

5999
01:43:42,880 --> 01:43:44,950
been a lot of thinking and debate in um
in academic you know research circles

6000
01:43:44,950 --> 01:43:44,960
in academic you know research circles
 

6001
01:43:44,960 --> 01:43:47,030
in academic you know research circles
around sort of how you estimate labor

6002
01:43:47,030 --> 01:43:47,040
around sort of how you estimate labor
 

6003
01:43:47,040 --> 01:43:48,390
around sort of how you estimate labor
impacts right what these models look

6004
01:43:48,390 --> 01:43:48,400
impacts right what these models look
 

6005
01:43:48,400 --> 01:43:50,390
impacts right what these models look
like and a lot of it is about how

6006
01:43:50,390 --> 01:43:50,400
like and a lot of it is about how
 

6007
01:43:50,400 --> 01:43:53,270
like and a lot of it is about how
automatable is a job object recognition

6008
01:43:53,270 --> 01:43:53,280
automatable is a job object recognition
 

6009
01:43:53,280 --> 01:43:55,270
automatable is a job object recognition
really easy for people right really hard

6010
01:43:55,270 --> 01:43:55,280
really easy for people right really hard
 

6011
01:43:55,280 --> 01:43:57,430
really easy for people right really hard
for computers and so there's a whole

6012
01:43:57,430 --> 01:43:57,440
for computers and so there's a whole
 

6013
01:43:57,440 --> 01:43:59,270
for computers and so there's a whole
bunch of things that you know truck

6014
01:43:59,270 --> 01:43:59,280
bunch of things that you know truck
 

6015
01:43:59,280 --> 01:44:00,470
bunch of things that you know truck
drivers do

6016
01:44:00,470 --> 01:44:00,480
drivers do
 

6017
01:44:00,480 --> 01:44:03,990
drivers do
that we see as you know super easy and

6018
01:44:03,990 --> 01:44:04,000
that we see as you know super easy and
 

6019
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,229
that we see as you know super easy and
as it would have been characterized 10

6020
01:44:06,229 --> 01:44:06,239
as it would have been characterized 10
 

6021
01:44:06,239 --> 01:44:09,270
as it would have been characterized 10
years ago routine and it's not for a

6022
01:44:09,270 --> 01:44:09,280
years ago routine and it's not for a
 

6023
01:44:09,280 --> 01:44:11,830
years ago routine and it's not for a
computer right it's a it's it turns out

6024
01:44:11,830 --> 01:44:11,840
computer right it's a it's it turns out
 

6025
01:44:11,840 --> 01:44:13,430
computer right it's a it's it turns out
to be something that we do naturally

6026
01:44:13,430 --> 01:44:13,440
to be something that we do naturally
 

6027
01:44:13,440 --> 01:44:15,030
to be something that we do naturally
that is that is you know sort of cutting

6028
01:44:15,030 --> 01:44:15,040
that is that is you know sort of cutting
 

6029
01:44:15,040 --> 01:44:17,750
that is that is you know sort of cutting
edge right um computer science

6030
01:44:17,750 --> 01:44:17,760
edge right um computer science
 

6031
01:44:17,760 --> 01:44:20,149
edge right um computer science
so on the tele operation question i

6032
01:44:20,149 --> 01:44:20,159
so on the tele operation question i
 

6033
01:44:20,159 --> 01:44:22,229
so on the tele operation question i
think this is um

6034
01:44:22,229 --> 01:44:22,239
think this is um
 

6035
01:44:22,239 --> 01:44:24,629
think this is um
this is a more interesting one than than

6036
01:44:24,629 --> 01:44:24,639
this is a more interesting one than than
 

6037
01:44:24,639 --> 01:44:26,870
this is a more interesting one than than
people would like to sort of let on i

6038
01:44:26,870 --> 01:44:26,880
people would like to sort of let on i
 

6039
01:44:26,880 --> 01:44:28,229
people would like to sort of let on i
think publicly

6040
01:44:28,229 --> 01:44:28,239
think publicly
 

6041
01:44:28,239 --> 01:44:29,669
think publicly
um

6042
01:44:29,669 --> 01:44:29,679
um
 

6043
01:44:29,679 --> 01:44:31,990
um
they're going to be problems right um

6044
01:44:31,990 --> 01:44:32,000
they're going to be problems right um
 

6045
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:33,590
they're going to be problems right um
and this is one of the complexities of

6046
01:44:33,590 --> 01:44:33,600
and this is one of the complexities of
 

6047
01:44:33,600 --> 01:44:35,030
and this is one of the complexities of
sort of putting these things out in the

6048
01:44:35,030 --> 01:44:35,040
sort of putting these things out in the
 

6049
01:44:35,040 --> 01:44:36,950
sort of putting these things out in the
world and if you see the real world of

6050
01:44:36,950 --> 01:44:36,960
world and if you see the real world of
 

6051
01:44:36,960 --> 01:44:38,950
world and if you see the real world of
trucking you realize

6052
01:44:38,950 --> 01:44:38,960
trucking you realize
 

6053
01:44:38,960 --> 01:44:41,270
trucking you realize
wow it's rough you know there are dirt

6054
01:44:41,270 --> 01:44:41,280
wow it's rough you know there are dirt
 

6055
01:44:41,280 --> 01:44:43,750
wow it's rough you know there are dirt
lots there's gravel there's salt and ice

6056
01:44:43,750 --> 01:44:43,760
lots there's gravel there's salt and ice
 

6057
01:44:43,760 --> 01:44:45,510
lots there's gravel there's salt and ice
and cold weather and there's equipment

6058
01:44:45,510 --> 01:44:45,520
and cold weather and there's equipment
 

6059
01:44:45,520 --> 01:44:47,030
and cold weather and there's equipment
that just gets left out in the middle of

6060
01:44:47,030 --> 01:44:47,040
that just gets left out in the middle of
 

6061
01:44:47,040 --> 01:44:48,709
that just gets left out in the middle of
nowhere and the brakes don't get

6062
01:44:48,709 --> 01:44:48,719
nowhere and the brakes don't get
 

6063
01:44:48,719 --> 01:44:50,629
nowhere and the brakes don't get
maintained and somebody was supposed to

6064
01:44:50,629 --> 01:44:50,639
maintained and somebody was supposed to
 

6065
01:44:50,639 --> 01:44:52,229
maintained and somebody was supposed to
service something and they didn't you

6066
01:44:52,229 --> 01:44:52,239
service something and they didn't you
 

6067
01:44:52,239 --> 01:44:53,189
service something and they didn't you
know

6068
01:44:53,189 --> 01:44:53,199
know
 

6069
01:44:53,199 --> 01:44:55,510
know
and so you imagine okay we've got this

6070
01:44:55,510 --> 01:44:55,520
and so you imagine okay we've got this
 

6071
01:44:55,520 --> 01:44:57,270
and so you imagine okay we've got this
vehicle that can drive itself which is

6072
01:44:57,270 --> 01:44:57,280
vehicle that can drive itself which is
 

6073
01:44:57,280 --> 01:44:58,870
vehicle that can drive itself which is
going to require a whole lot of sensors

6074
01:44:58,870 --> 01:44:58,880
going to require a whole lot of sensors
 

6075
01:44:58,880 --> 01:45:01,430
going to require a whole lot of sensors
to tell it that like the doors are still

6076
01:45:01,430 --> 01:45:01,440
to tell it that like the doors are still
 

6077
01:45:01,440 --> 01:45:03,430
to tell it that like the doors are still
closed and the trailer's still hooked up

6078
01:45:03,430 --> 01:45:03,440
closed and the trailer's still hooked up
 

6079
01:45:03,440 --> 01:45:05,189
closed and the trailer's still hooked up
and each of the tires has adequate

6080
01:45:05,189 --> 01:45:05,199
and each of the tires has adequate
 

6081
01:45:05,199 --> 01:45:07,430
and each of the tires has adequate
pressure and you know any number of you

6082
01:45:07,430 --> 01:45:07,440
pressure and you know any number of you
 

6083
01:45:07,440 --> 01:45:09,109
pressure and you know any number of you
know probably hundreds of sensors that

6084
01:45:09,109 --> 01:45:09,119
know probably hundreds of sensors that
 

6085
01:45:09,119 --> 01:45:10,390
know probably hundreds of sensors that
are going to be sort of relaying

6086
01:45:10,390 --> 01:45:10,400
are going to be sort of relaying
 

6087
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:11,750
are going to be sort of relaying
information

6088
01:45:11,750 --> 01:45:11,760
information
 

6089
01:45:11,760 --> 01:45:13,189
information
and one of them

6090
01:45:13,189 --> 01:45:13,199
and one of them
 

6091
01:45:13,199 --> 01:45:15,669
and one of them
you know after 500 000 miles or whatever

6092
01:45:15,669 --> 01:45:15,679
you know after 500 000 miles or whatever
 

6093
01:45:15,679 --> 01:45:16,950
you know after 500 000 miles or whatever
goes out

6094
01:45:16,950 --> 01:45:16,960
goes out
 

6095
01:45:16,960 --> 01:45:19,510
goes out
now you know do we have some fleet of

6096
01:45:19,510 --> 01:45:19,520
now you know do we have some fleet of
 

6097
01:45:19,520 --> 01:45:21,590
now you know do we have some fleet of
technicians sort of continually cruising

6098
01:45:21,590 --> 01:45:21,600
technicians sort of continually cruising
 

6099
01:45:21,600 --> 01:45:23,510
technicians sort of continually cruising
the highways and sort of servicing these

6100
01:45:23,510 --> 01:45:23,520
the highways and sort of servicing these
 

6101
01:45:23,520 --> 01:45:25,669
the highways and sort of servicing these
things as they do what pull themselves

6102
01:45:25,669 --> 01:45:25,679
things as they do what pull themselves
 

6103
01:45:25,679 --> 01:45:27,430
things as they do what pull themselves
off to the side of the road and say i've

6104
01:45:27,430 --> 01:45:27,440
off to the side of the road and say i've
 

6105
01:45:27,440 --> 01:45:29,669
off to the side of the road and say i've
got a sensor fault i'm pulling over you

6106
01:45:29,669 --> 01:45:29,679
got a sensor fault i'm pulling over you
 

6107
01:45:29,679 --> 01:45:31,189
got a sensor fault i'm pulling over you
know or maybe there's some level of like

6108
01:45:31,189 --> 01:45:31,199
know or maybe there's some level of like
 

6109
01:45:31,199 --> 01:45:33,430
know or maybe there's some level of like
critical safety critical faults or or

6110
01:45:33,430 --> 01:45:33,440
critical safety critical faults or or
 

6111
01:45:33,440 --> 01:45:35,189
critical safety critical faults or or
whatever um

6112
01:45:35,189 --> 01:45:35,199
whatever um
 

6113
01:45:35,199 --> 01:45:36,229
whatever um
it might be

6114
01:45:36,229 --> 01:45:36,239
it might be
 

6115
01:45:36,239 --> 01:45:38,629
it might be
so you know that

6116
01:45:38,629 --> 01:45:38,639
so you know that
 

6117
01:45:38,639 --> 01:45:41,109
so you know that
suggests that there might be a role for

6118
01:45:41,109 --> 01:45:41,119
suggests that there might be a role for
 

6119
01:45:41,119 --> 01:45:43,669
suggests that there might be a role for
tele operation even with self-driving

6120
01:45:43,669 --> 01:45:43,679
tele operation even with self-driving
 

6121
01:45:43,679 --> 01:45:46,709
tele operation even with self-driving
and when i push people on it in in the

6122
01:45:46,709 --> 01:45:46,719
and when i push people on it in in the
 

6123
01:45:46,719 --> 01:45:49,430
and when i push people on it in in the
conversations they all are like yeah we

6124
01:45:49,430 --> 01:45:49,440
conversations they all are like yeah we
 

6125
01:45:49,440 --> 01:45:51,109
conversations they all are like yeah we
kind of have that on the like bottom of

6126
01:45:51,109 --> 01:45:51,119
kind of have that on the like bottom of
 

6127
01:45:51,119 --> 01:45:51,990
kind of have that on the like bottom of
the list

figure out how to rescue truck you know
 

6131
01:45:54,400 --> 01:45:55,270
figure out how to rescue truck you know
it gets

6132
01:45:55,270 --> 01:45:55,280
it gets
 

6133
01:45:55,280 --> 01:45:57,510
it gets
on the to-do list right after solving

6134
01:45:57,510 --> 01:45:57,520
on the to-do list right after solving
 

6135
01:45:57,520 --> 01:45:59,430
on the to-do list right after solving
the self-driving you know question is

6136
01:45:59,430 --> 01:45:59,440
the self-driving you know question is
 

6137
01:45:59,440 --> 01:46:01,590
the self-driving you know question is
like yeah what do we do with the

6138
01:46:01,590 --> 01:46:01,600
like yeah what do we do with the
 

6139
01:46:01,600 --> 01:46:03,669
like yeah what do we do with the
problems right i mean now we could we

6140
01:46:03,669 --> 01:46:03,679
problems right i mean now we could we
 

6141
01:46:03,679 --> 01:46:05,430
problems right i mean now we could we
can imagine like all right we have some

6142
01:46:05,430 --> 01:46:05,440
can imagine like all right we have some
 

6143
01:46:05,440 --> 01:46:07,669
can imagine like all right we have some
you know protocol that the truck is not

6144
01:46:07,669 --> 01:46:07,679
you know protocol that the truck is not
 

6145
01:46:07,679 --> 01:46:10,310
you know protocol that the truck is not
you know realizes the system says not

6146
01:46:10,310 --> 01:46:10,320
you know realizes the system says not

6149
01:46:12,960 --> 01:46:14,790
safe for operation pull to the side
good you have a crash but now you got a

6150
01:46:14,790 --> 01:46:14,800
good you have a crash but now you got a
 

6151
01:46:14,800 --> 01:46:16,950
good you have a crash but now you got a
truck stranded on the side of the road

6152
01:46:16,950 --> 01:46:16,960
truck stranded on the side of the road
 

6153

you're gonna send out somebody to like

6154
01:46:18,629 --> 01:46:18,639
you're gonna send out somebody to like
 

6155
01:46:18,639 --> 01:46:20,550
you're gonna send out somebody to like
calibrate things and check out what's

6156
01:46:20,550 --> 01:46:20,560
calibrate things and check out what's
 

6157
01:46:20,560 --> 01:46:22,629
calibrate things and check out what's
going on or that sounds like expensive

6158
01:46:22,629 --> 01:46:22,639
going on or that sounds like expensive
 

6159
01:46:22,639 --> 01:46:25,189
going on or that sounds like expensive
labor it sounds like downtime it sounds

6160
01:46:25,189 --> 01:46:25,199
labor it sounds like downtime it sounds
 

6161
01:46:25,199 --> 01:46:26,709
labor it sounds like downtime it sounds
like the kind of things that shippers

6162
01:46:26,709 --> 01:46:26,719
like the kind of things that shippers
 

6163
01:46:26,719 --> 01:46:28,629
like the kind of things that shippers
don't like to happen to their freight

6164
01:46:28,629 --> 01:46:28,639
don't like to happen to their freight
 

6165
01:46:28,639 --> 01:46:30,790
don't like to happen to their freight
you know in a in a just-in-time world

6166
01:46:30,790 --> 01:46:30,800
you know in a in a just-in-time world
 

6167
01:46:30,800 --> 01:46:32,310
you know in a in a just-in-time world
and so wouldn't it be great if you could

6168
01:46:32,310 --> 01:46:32,320
and so wouldn't it be great if you could
 

6169
01:46:32,320 --> 01:46:35,109
and so wouldn't it be great if you could
just sort of you know loop your way into

6170
01:46:35,109 --> 01:46:35,119
just sort of you know loop your way into
 

6171
01:46:35,119 --> 01:46:35,830
just sort of you know loop your way into
the

6172

we've got a sensor out says me that says

6176
01:46:39,669 --> 01:46:39,679
we've got a sensor out says me that says
 

6177
01:46:39,679 --> 01:46:41,030
we've got a sensor out says me that says
that the tire is bad but i can see

that the tire is bad but i can see
 

6179
01:46:41,040 --> 01:46:43,270
that the tire is bad but i can see
visually from the camera looks fine i'm

going to drive it to our next depot you
 

6183
01:46:45,520 --> 01:46:47,350
going to drive it to our next depot you
know maybe the next rider or penske

6184
01:46:47,350 --> 01:46:47,360
know maybe the next rider or penske
 

6185
01:46:47,360 --> 01:46:49,189

tally operation often gets this you know

6192
01:46:56,310 --> 01:46:56,320
tally operation often gets this you know
 

6193
01:46:56,320 --> 01:46:57,109
tally operation often gets this you know
um

6194
01:46:57,109 --> 01:46:57,119
um
 

6195
01:46:57,119 --> 01:46:58,470
um
dismissive

6196
01:46:58,470 --> 01:46:58,480
dismissive

um
you know commentary from from other

6200
01:47:01,669 --> 01:47:01,679
you know commentary from from other
 

6201
01:47:01,679 --> 01:47:03,910
you know commentary from from other
folks working on other other scenarios

6202
01:47:03,910 --> 01:47:03,920
folks working on other other scenarios
 

6203
01:47:03,920 --> 01:47:06,390
folks working on other other scenarios
but i think it's it's potentially more

6204
01:47:06,390 --> 01:47:06,400
but i think it's it's potentially more
 

6205
01:47:06,400 --> 01:47:09,750
but i think it's it's potentially more
relevant than than than we hear publicly

6206
01:47:09,750 --> 01:47:09,760
relevant than than than we hear publicly
 

6207
01:47:09,760 --> 01:47:11,669
relevant than than than we hear publicly
but it's a hard problem

6208
01:47:11,669 --> 01:47:11,679
but it's a hard problem
 

6209
01:47:11,679 --> 01:47:14,709
but it's a hard problem
and uh

6210
01:47:14,709 --> 01:47:14,719

 

6211
01:47:14,719 --> 01:47:16,390

you know for me

6212
01:47:16,390 --> 01:47:16,400
you know for me
 

6213
01:47:16,400 --> 01:47:18,149
you know for me
i've gotten a chance to interact with

6214
01:47:18,149 --> 01:47:18,159
i've gotten a chance to interact with
 

6215
01:47:18,159 --> 01:47:19,669
i've gotten a chance to interact with
people that take on hard problems and

6216
01:47:19,669 --> 01:47:19,679
people that take on hard problems and
 

6217
01:47:19,679 --> 01:47:21,910
people that take on hard problems and
solve them and they're rare what tesla

6218
01:47:21,910 --> 01:47:21,920
solve them and they're rare what tesla
 

6219
01:47:21,920 --> 01:47:22,870
solve them and they're rare what tesla
has done

6220
01:47:22,870 --> 01:47:22,880
has done
 

6221
01:47:22,880 --> 01:47:25,510
has done
with their data engine

6222
01:47:25,510 --> 01:47:25,520
with their data engine
 

6223
01:47:25,520 --> 01:47:27,750
with their data engine
so i thought autonomous driving cannot

6224
01:47:27,750 --> 01:47:27,760
so i thought autonomous driving cannot
 

6225
01:47:27,760 --> 01:47:29,270
so i thought autonomous driving cannot
be solved

6226
01:47:29,270 --> 01:47:29,280
be solved
 

6227
01:47:29,280 --> 01:47:31,189
be solved
without collecting a huge amount of data

6228
01:47:31,189 --> 01:47:31,199
without collecting a huge amount of data
 

6229
01:47:31,199 --> 01:47:32,470
without collecting a huge amount of data
and organizing the wall not just

6230
01:47:32,470 --> 01:47:32,480
and organizing the wall not just
 

6231
01:47:32,480 --> 01:47:34,709
and organizing the wall not just
collecting but organizing it

6232
01:47:34,709 --> 01:47:34,719
collecting but organizing it
 

6233
01:47:34,719 --> 01:47:37,350
collecting but organizing it
and exactly what tesla is doing now is

6234
01:47:37,350 --> 01:47:37,360
and exactly what tesla is doing now is
 

6235
01:47:37,360 --> 01:47:38,790
and exactly what tesla is doing now is
what i thought it would be like i

6236
01:47:38,790 --> 01:47:38,800
what i thought it would be like i
 

6237
01:47:38,800 --> 01:47:40,470
what i thought it would be like i
couldn't see car companies doing that

6238
01:47:40,470 --> 01:47:40,480
couldn't see car companies doing that
 

6239
01:47:40,480 --> 01:47:41,990
couldn't see car companies doing that
including tesla

6240
01:47:41,990 --> 01:47:42,000
including tesla
 

6241
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:43,270
including tesla
and now that they're doing that it's

6242
01:47:43,270 --> 01:47:43,280
and now that they're doing that it's
 

6243
01:47:43,280 --> 01:47:46,149
and now that they're doing that it's
like oh okay so it's possible to take on

6244
01:47:46,149 --> 01:47:46,159
like oh okay so it's possible to take on
 

6245
01:47:46,159 --> 01:47:48,310
like oh okay so it's possible to take on
this huge effort seriously to me

6246
01:47:48,310 --> 01:47:48,320
this huge effort seriously to me
 

6247
01:47:48,320 --> 01:47:50,790
this huge effort seriously to me
teleoperation is another huge effort

6248
01:47:50,790 --> 01:47:50,800
teleoperation is another huge effort
 

6249
01:47:50,800 --> 01:47:51,750
teleoperation is another huge effort
like that

6250
01:47:51,750 --> 01:47:51,760
like that
 

6251
01:47:51,760 --> 01:47:54,149
like that
it's like taking seriously

6252
01:47:54,149 --> 01:47:54,159
it's like taking seriously
 

6253
01:47:54,159 --> 01:47:56,870
it's like taking seriously
what happens when it fails

6254
01:47:56,870 --> 01:47:56,880
what happens when it fails
 

6255
01:47:56,880 --> 01:47:59,910
what happens when it fails
what's the in the case of waymo for um

6256
01:47:59,910 --> 01:47:59,920
what's the in the case of waymo for um
 

6257
01:47:59,920 --> 01:48:01,910
what's the in the case of waymo for um
for the consumer like ride sharing

6258
01:48:01,910 --> 01:48:01,920
for the consumer like ride sharing
 

6259
01:48:01,920 --> 01:48:04,149
for the consumer like ride sharing
what's the customer experience like

6260
01:48:04,149 --> 01:48:04,159
what's the customer experience like
 

6261
01:48:04,159 --> 01:48:05,830
what's the customer experience like
there's a bunch of videos online now

6262
01:48:05,830 --> 01:48:05,840
there's a bunch of videos online now
 

6263
01:48:05,840 --> 01:48:07,910
there's a bunch of videos online now
where people are like the car

6264
01:48:07,910 --> 01:48:07,920
where people are like the car
 

6265
01:48:07,920 --> 01:48:09,990

fails and it pulls off to the side and

6266
01:48:09,990 --> 01:48:10,000
fails and it pulls off to the side and
 

6267
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:11,510
fails and it pulls off to the side and
you call like customer service and

6268
01:48:11,510 --> 01:48:11,520
you call like customer service and
 

6269
01:48:11,520 --> 01:48:12,870
you call like customer service and
you're basically sitting there for a

6270
01:48:12,870 --> 01:48:12,880
you're basically sitting there for a
 

6271
01:48:12,880 --> 01:48:15,510
you're basically sitting there for a
long time and there's confusion and then

6272
01:48:15,510 --> 01:48:15,520
long time and there's confusion and then
 

6273
01:48:15,520 --> 01:48:17,109
long time and there's confusion and then
there's a rescue that comes and they

6274
01:48:17,109 --> 01:48:17,119
there's a rescue that comes and they
 

6275
01:48:17,119 --> 01:48:18,310
there's a rescue that comes and they
start to i mean just the whole

6276
01:48:18,310 --> 01:48:18,320
start to i mean just the whole
 

6277
01:48:18,320 --> 01:48:20,550
start to i mean just the whole
experience is a mess that has a ripple

6278
01:48:20,550 --> 01:48:20,560
experience is a mess that has a ripple
 

6279
01:48:20,560 --> 01:48:21,590
experience is a mess that has a ripple
effect

6280
01:48:21,590 --> 01:48:21,600
effect
 

6281
01:48:21,600 --> 01:48:24,310
effect
to how you trust in in the entirety of

6282
01:48:24,310 --> 01:48:24,320
to how you trust in in the entirety of
 

6283
01:48:24,320 --> 01:48:26,870
to how you trust in in the entirety of
the experience but like actually taking

6284
01:48:26,870 --> 01:48:26,880
the experience but like actually taking
 

6285
01:48:26,880 --> 01:48:29,350
the experience but like actually taking
on the problem of that failure case

6286
01:48:29,350 --> 01:48:29,360
on the problem of that failure case
 

6287
01:48:29,360 --> 01:48:32,149
on the problem of that failure case
and revolutionizing that experience both

6288
01:48:32,149 --> 01:48:32,159
and revolutionizing that experience both
 

6289
01:48:32,159 --> 01:48:34,550
and revolutionizing that experience both
for trucking and for ride sharing that's

6290
01:48:34,550 --> 01:48:34,560
for trucking and for ride sharing that's
 

6291
01:48:34,560 --> 01:48:36,229
for trucking and for ride sharing that's
an amazing opportunity there because

6292
01:48:36,229 --> 01:48:36,239
an amazing opportunity there because
 

6293
01:48:36,239 --> 01:48:37,189
an amazing opportunity there because
that

6294
01:48:37,189 --> 01:48:37,199
that
 

6295
01:48:37,199 --> 01:48:39,990
that
feels like it would change everything

6296
01:48:39,990 --> 01:48:40,000
feels like it would change everything
 

6297
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:41,750
feels like it would change everything
if you can reliably know when the

6298
01:48:41,750 --> 01:48:41,760
if you can reliably know when the
 

6299
01:48:41,760 --> 01:48:44,070
if you can reliably know when the
failures happen which they will you have

6300
01:48:44,070 --> 01:48:44,080
failures happen which they will you have
 

6301
01:48:44,080 --> 01:48:46,790
failures happen which they will you have
a clear plan that doesn't significantly

6302
01:48:46,790 --> 01:48:46,800
a clear plan that doesn't significantly
 

6303
01:48:46,800 --> 01:48:47,990
a clear plan that doesn't significantly
affect the efficiency of the whole

6304
01:48:47,990 --> 01:48:48,000
affect the efficiency of the whole
 

6305
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:49,189
affect the efficiency of the whole
process

6306
01:48:49,189 --> 01:48:49,199
process
 

6307
01:48:49,199 --> 01:48:51,590
process
that that could be the game changer

6308
01:48:51,590 --> 01:48:51,600
that that could be the game changer
 

6309
01:48:51,600 --> 01:48:53,189
that that could be the game changer
and if tele operation is part of that it

6310
01:48:53,189 --> 01:48:53,199
and if tele operation is part of that it
 

6311
01:48:53,199 --> 01:48:54,870
and if tele operation is part of that it
could be just like you're saying it

6312
01:48:54,870 --> 01:48:54,880
could be just like you're saying it
 

6313
01:48:54,880 --> 01:48:56,870
could be just like you're saying it
could be tele operation or it could be

6314
01:48:56,870 --> 01:48:56,880
could be tele operation or it could be
 

6315
01:48:56,880 --> 01:48:59,510
could be tele operation or it could be
like a fleet of rescuers that can come

6316
01:48:59,510 --> 01:48:59,520
like a fleet of rescuers that can come
 

6317
01:48:59,520 --> 01:49:01,750
like a fleet of rescuers that can come
in which is a similar idea but tell the

6318
01:49:01,750 --> 01:49:01,760
in which is a similar idea but tell the
 

6319
01:49:01,760 --> 01:49:03,510
in which is a similar idea but tell the
operation obviously

6320
01:49:03,510 --> 01:49:03,520
operation obviously
 

6321
01:49:03,520 --> 01:49:05,109
operation obviously
that allows you to

6322
01:49:05,109 --> 01:49:05,119
that allows you to
 

6323
01:49:05,119 --> 01:49:07,350
that allows you to
to just have a network of monitors of

6324
01:49:07,350 --> 01:49:07,360
to just have a network of monitors of
 

6325
01:49:07,360 --> 01:49:09,990
to just have a network of monitors of
people monitoring this giant fleet of

6326
01:49:09,990 --> 01:49:10,000
people monitoring this giant fleet of
 

6327
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,870
people monitoring this giant fleet of
trucks and taking over when needed it's

6328
01:49:12,870 --> 01:49:12,880
trucks and taking over when needed it's
 

6329
01:49:12,880 --> 01:49:15,350
trucks and taking over when needed it's
a beautiful vision of the future where

6330
01:49:15,350 --> 01:49:15,360
a beautiful vision of the future where
 

6331
01:49:15,360 --> 01:49:18,149
a beautiful vision of the future where
there's millions of robots

6332
01:49:18,149 --> 01:49:18,159
there's millions of robots
 

6333
01:49:18,159 --> 01:49:20,790
there's millions of robots
and only thousands of humans monitoring

6334
01:49:20,790 --> 01:49:20,800
and only thousands of humans monitoring
 

6335
01:49:20,800 --> 01:49:22,550
and only thousands of humans monitoring
those millions of robots

6336
01:49:22,550 --> 01:49:22,560
those millions of robots
 

6337
01:49:22,560 --> 01:49:24,950
those millions of robots
that seems like

6338
01:49:24,950 --> 01:49:24,960
that seems like
 

6339
01:49:24,960 --> 01:49:27,189
that seems like
that seems like a perfect dance

6340
01:49:27,189 --> 01:49:27,199
that seems like a perfect dance
 

6341
01:49:27,199 --> 01:49:29,030
that seems like a perfect dance
of allowing humans to do what they do

6342
01:49:29,030 --> 01:49:29,040
of allowing humans to do what they do
 

6343
01:49:29,040 --> 01:49:30,790
of allowing humans to do what they do
best and allowing robots to do what they

6344
01:49:30,790 --> 01:49:30,800
best and allowing robots to do what they
 

6345
01:49:30,800 --> 01:49:31,830
best and allowing robots to do what they
do best

6346
01:49:31,830 --> 01:49:31,840
do best
 

6347
01:49:31,840 --> 01:49:34,629
do best
yeah yeah so i mean i think there are um

6348
01:49:34,629 --> 01:49:34,639
yeah yeah so i mean i think there are um
 

6349
01:49:34,639 --> 01:49:36,709
yeah yeah so i mean i think there are um
and we just applied for an nsf we didn't

6350
01:49:36,709 --> 01:49:36,719
and we just applied for an nsf we didn't
 

6351
01:49:36,719 --> 01:49:37,669
and we just applied for an nsf we didn't
get

6352

anybody's watching

6354
01:49:39,990 --> 01:49:40,000
anybody's watching
 

6355
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:41,510
anybody's watching
but with some folks from wisconsin who

6356
01:49:41,510 --> 01:49:41,520
but with some folks from wisconsin who
 

6357
01:49:41,520 --> 01:49:44,149
but with some folks from wisconsin who
do teleoperation right and and you know

6358
01:49:44,149 --> 01:49:44,159
do teleoperation right and and you know
 

6359
01:49:44,159 --> 01:49:46,070
do teleoperation right and and you know
some of this is used for like rovers and

6360
01:49:46,070 --> 01:49:46,080
some of this is used for like rovers and
 

6361
01:49:46,080 --> 01:49:48,149
some of this is used for like rovers and
you know i mean really you know high

6362
01:49:48,149 --> 01:49:48,159
you know i mean really you know high
 

6363
01:49:48,159 --> 01:49:51,030
you know i mean really you know high
stakes difficult problems but one of the

6364
01:49:51,030 --> 01:49:51,040
stakes difficult problems but one of the
 

6365
01:49:51,040 --> 01:49:52,550
stakes difficult problems but one of the
things we wanted to study were these

6366
01:49:52,550 --> 01:49:52,560
things we wanted to study were these
 

6367
01:49:52,560 --> 01:49:54,709
things we wanted to study were these
mines in these rio tinto mines in

6368
01:49:54,709 --> 01:49:54,719
mines in these rio tinto mines in
 

6369
01:49:54,719 --> 01:49:59,030
mines in these rio tinto mines in
australia where they remotely pilot the

6370
01:49:59,030 --> 01:49:59,040
australia where they remotely pilot the
 

6371
01:49:59,040 --> 01:50:00,870
australia where they remotely pilot the
trucks and there's some autonomy i guess

6372
01:50:00,870 --> 01:50:00,880
trucks and there's some autonomy i guess
 

6373
01:50:00,880 --> 01:50:03,270
trucks and there's some autonomy i guess
and then some but it's overseen by

6374
01:50:03,270 --> 01:50:03,280
and then some but it's overseen by
 

6375
01:50:03,280 --> 01:50:05,990
and then some but it's overseen by
um a remote operator and they

6376
01:50:05,990 --> 01:50:06,000
um a remote operator and they
 

6377
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,149
um a remote operator and they
you know it's a it's a it's near perth

6378
01:50:08,149 --> 01:50:08,159
you know it's a it's a it's near perth
 

6379
01:50:08,159 --> 01:50:11,589
you know it's a it's a it's near perth
it's quite remote and um

6380
01:50:11,589 --> 01:50:11,599
it's quite remote and um
 

6381
01:50:11,599 --> 01:50:13,750
it's quite remote and um
they retrained the truck drivers to be

6382
01:50:13,750 --> 01:50:13,760
they retrained the truck drivers to be
 

6383
01:50:13,760 --> 01:50:16,070
they retrained the truck drivers to be
the remote operators right um there's

6384
01:50:16,070 --> 01:50:16,080
the remote operators right um there's
 

6385
01:50:16,080 --> 01:50:18,310
the remote operators right um there's
autonomy in in the port of rotterdam and

6386
01:50:18,310 --> 01:50:18,320
autonomy in in the port of rotterdam and
 

6387
01:50:18,320 --> 01:50:20,229
autonomy in in the port of rotterdam and
places like that where there are jobs

6388
01:50:20,229 --> 01:50:20,239
places like that where there are jobs
 

6389
01:50:20,239 --> 01:50:22,470
places like that where there are jobs
there and so there i think

6390
01:50:22,470 --> 01:50:22,480
there and so there i think
 

6391
01:50:22,480 --> 01:50:23,830
there and so there i think
you know maybe we'll get to this later

6392
01:50:23,830 --> 01:50:23,840
you know maybe we'll get to this later
 

6393
01:50:23,840 --> 01:50:24,950
you know maybe we'll get to this later
but you know there's a real policy

6394
01:50:24,950 --> 01:50:24,960
but you know there's a real policy
 

6395
01:50:24,960 --> 01:50:26,950
but you know there's a real policy
question about sort of

6396
01:50:26,950 --> 01:50:26,960
question about sort of
 

6397
01:50:26,960 --> 01:50:28,629
question about sort of
who's gonna lose and what we do about it

6398
01:50:28,629 --> 01:50:28,639
who's gonna lose and what we do about it
 

6399
01:50:28,639 --> 01:50:30,229
who's gonna lose and what we do about it
and you know whether or not we there are

6400
01:50:30,229 --> 01:50:30,239
and you know whether or not we there are
 

6401
01:50:30,239 --> 01:50:31,990
and you know whether or not we there are
opportunities there that you know maybe

6402
01:50:31,990 --> 01:50:32,000
opportunities there that you know maybe
 

6403
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:33,750
opportunities there that you know maybe
we need to put our thumb on the scale a

6404
01:50:33,750 --> 01:50:33,760
we need to put our thumb on the scale a
 

6405
01:50:33,760 --> 01:50:36,470
we need to put our thumb on the scale a
little bit to to make sure that you know

6406
01:50:36,470 --> 01:50:36,480
little bit to to make sure that you know
 

6407
01:50:36,480 --> 01:50:38,709
little bit to to make sure that you know
there there's some give back to the

6408
01:50:38,709 --> 01:50:38,719
there there's some give back to the
 

6409
01:50:38,719 --> 01:50:40,790
there there's some give back to the
community that's that's taking the hit

6410
01:50:40,790 --> 01:50:40,800
community that's that's taking the hit
 

6411
01:50:40,800 --> 01:50:42,790
community that's that's taking the hit
you know um so for instance if there

6412
01:50:42,790 --> 01:50:42,800
you know um so for instance if there
 

6413
01:50:42,800 --> 01:50:45,030
you know um so for instance if there
were tally operation centers you know

6414
01:50:45,030 --> 01:50:45,040
were tally operation centers you know
 

6415
01:50:45,040 --> 01:50:47,350
were tally operation centers you know
maybe they go in these communities that

6416
01:50:47,350 --> 01:50:47,360
maybe they go in these communities that
 

6417
01:50:47,360 --> 01:50:49,109
maybe they go in these communities that
we disproportionately source truck

6418
01:50:49,109 --> 01:50:49,119
we disproportionately source truck
 

6419
01:50:49,119 --> 01:50:51,270
we disproportionately source truck
drivers from today now i mean what does

6420
01:50:51,270 --> 01:50:51,280
drivers from today now i mean what does
 

6421
01:50:51,280 --> 01:50:52,870
drivers from today now i mean what does
that mean it may not be the cheapest

6422
01:50:52,870 --> 01:50:52,880
that mean it may not be the cheapest
 

6423
01:50:52,880 --> 01:50:54,229
that mean it may not be the cheapest
place to do it if they don't have great

6424
01:50:54,229 --> 01:50:54,239
place to do it if they don't have great
 

6425
01:50:54,239 --> 01:50:56,550
place to do it if they don't have great
connectivity and it may not be where the

6426
01:50:56,550 --> 01:50:56,560
connectivity and it may not be where the
 

6427
01:50:56,560 --> 01:50:58,550
connectivity and it may not be where the
upper level managers want to be and you

6428
01:50:58,550 --> 01:50:58,560
upper level managers want to be and you
 

6429
01:50:58,560 --> 01:51:00,229
upper level managers want to be and you
know places like that you know issues

6430
01:51:00,229 --> 01:51:00,239
know places like that you know issues
 

6431
01:51:00,239 --> 01:51:01,669
know places like that you know issues
like that right so

6432
01:51:01,669 --> 01:51:01,679
like that right so
 

6433
01:51:01,679 --> 01:51:03,750
like that right so
um i do think it's an interesting

6434
01:51:03,750 --> 01:51:03,760
um i do think it's an interesting
 

6435
01:51:03,760 --> 01:51:06,310
um i do think it's an interesting
question you know both from sort of a

6436
01:51:06,310 --> 01:51:06,320
question you know both from sort of a
 

6437
01:51:06,320 --> 01:51:07,830
question you know both from sort of a
practical

6438
01:51:07,830 --> 01:51:07,840
practical
 

6439
01:51:07,840 --> 01:51:10,070
practical
uh scenario situation of how it's going

6440
01:51:10,070 --> 01:51:10,080
uh scenario situation of how it's going
 

6441
01:51:10,080 --> 01:51:12,709
uh scenario situation of how it's going
to work but also from a policy

6442
01:51:12,709 --> 01:51:12,719
to work but also from a policy
 

6443
01:51:12,719 --> 01:51:15,109
to work but also from a policy
perspective so there's platoons there's

6444
01:51:15,109 --> 01:51:15,119
perspective so there's platoons there's
 

6445
01:51:15,119 --> 01:51:16,870
perspective so there's platoons there's
tele operation

6446
01:51:16,870 --> 01:51:16,880
tele operation
 

6447
01:51:16,880 --> 01:51:17,830
tele operation
and this is

6448
01:51:17,830 --> 01:51:17,840
and this is
 

6449
01:51:17,840 --> 01:51:19,350
and this is
taking care of some of the highway

6450
01:51:19,350 --> 01:51:19,360
taking care of some of the highway
 

6451
01:51:19,360 --> 01:51:21,189
taking care of some of the highway
driving that we're talking about is

6452
01:51:21,189 --> 01:51:21,199
driving that we're talking about is
 

6453
01:51:21,199 --> 01:51:23,669
driving that we're talking about is
there other ideas like

6454
01:51:23,669 --> 01:51:23,679
there other ideas like
 

6455
01:51:23,679 --> 01:51:24,790
there other ideas like
um

6456
01:51:24,790 --> 01:51:24,800
um
 

6457
01:51:24,800 --> 01:51:26,950
um
is there other ideas scenarios that you

6458
01:51:26,950 --> 01:51:26,960
is there other ideas scenarios that you
 

6459
01:51:26,960 --> 01:51:29,270
is there other ideas scenarios that you
have for autonomous trucks yeah so i

6460
01:51:29,270 --> 01:51:29,280
have for autonomous trucks yeah so i
 

6461
01:51:29,280 --> 01:51:31,430
have for autonomous trucks yeah so i
mean the the most obvious one actually

6462
01:51:31,430 --> 01:51:31,440
mean the the most obvious one actually
 

6463
01:51:31,440 --> 01:51:33,830
mean the the most obvious one actually
is is just you know uh facility to

6464
01:51:33,830 --> 01:51:33,840
is is just you know uh facility to
 

6465
01:51:33,840 --> 01:51:36,310
is is just you know uh facility to
facility right the sort of you know um

6466
01:51:36,310 --> 01:51:36,320
facility right the sort of you know um
 

6467
01:51:36,320 --> 01:51:39,189
facility right the sort of you know um
it can't go everywhere but a lot of

6468
01:51:39,189 --> 01:51:39,199
it can't go everywhere but a lot of
 

6469
01:51:39,199 --> 01:51:41,510
it can't go everywhere but a lot of
logistics facilities are very close to

6470
01:51:41,510 --> 01:51:41,520
logistics facilities are very close to
 

6471
01:51:41,520 --> 01:51:43,750
logistics facilities are very close to
interstates and they're and they're on

6472
01:51:43,750 --> 01:51:43,760
interstates and they're and they're on
 

6473
01:51:43,760 --> 01:51:46,470
interstates and they're and they're on
big commercial roads without you know

6474
01:51:46,470 --> 01:51:46,480
big commercial roads without you know
 

6475
01:51:46,480 --> 01:51:48,790
big commercial roads without you know
bikes and parked cars and all that stuff

6476
01:51:48,790 --> 01:51:48,800
bikes and parked cars and all that stuff
 

6477
01:51:48,800 --> 01:51:50,790
bikes and parked cars and all that stuff
and some of the jobs that i think are

6478
01:51:50,790 --> 01:51:50,800
and some of the jobs that i think are
 

6479
01:51:50,800 --> 01:51:53,109
and some of the jobs that i think are
really first on the chopping block

6480
01:51:53,109 --> 01:51:53,119
really first on the chopping block
 

6481
01:51:53,119 --> 01:51:55,510
really first on the chopping block
are these ltl that less than truckload

6482
01:51:55,510 --> 01:51:55,520
are these ltl that less than truckload
 

6483
01:51:55,520 --> 01:51:57,430
are these ltl that less than truckload
what's called line haul right so these

6484
01:51:57,430 --> 01:51:57,440
what's called line haul right so these
 

6485
01:51:57,440 --> 01:51:59,270
what's called line haul right so these
are the drivers who go from terminal to

6486
01:51:59,270 --> 01:51:59,280
are the drivers who go from terminal to
 

6487
01:51:59,280 --> 01:52:02,149
are the drivers who go from terminal to
terminal with those full trailers

6488
01:52:02,149 --> 01:52:02,159
terminal with those full trailers
 

6489
01:52:02,159 --> 01:52:04,229
terminal with those full trailers
and those facilities are often located

6490
01:52:04,229 --> 01:52:04,239
and those facilities are often located
 

6491
01:52:04,239 --> 01:52:06,629
and those facilities are often located
strategically to avoid congestion

6492
01:52:06,629 --> 01:52:06,639
strategically to avoid congestion
 

6493
01:52:06,639 --> 01:52:08,870
strategically to avoid congestion
right and to be in big you know

6494
01:52:08,870 --> 01:52:08,880
right and to be in big you know
 

6495
01:52:08,880 --> 01:52:10,790
right and to be in big you know
industrial facilities so

6496
01:52:10,790 --> 01:52:10,800
industrial facilities so
 

6497
01:52:10,800 --> 01:52:13,350
industrial facilities so
you could imagine that being you know

6498
01:52:13,350 --> 01:52:13,360
you could imagine that being you know
 

6499
01:52:13,360 --> 01:52:15,350
you could imagine that being you know
the first place you see a waymo

6500
01:52:15,350 --> 01:52:15,360
the first place you see a waymo
 

6501
01:52:15,360 --> 01:52:17,510
the first place you see a waymo
self-driving you know truck roll out

6502
01:52:17,510 --> 01:52:17,520
self-driving you know truck roll out
 

6503
01:52:17,520 --> 01:52:20,229
self-driving you know truck roll out
might be you know um sort of direct

6504
01:52:20,229 --> 01:52:20,239
might be you know um sort of direct
 

6505
01:52:20,239 --> 01:52:24,229
might be you know um sort of direct
facility to facility for ups or fedex or

6506
01:52:24,229 --> 01:52:24,239
facility to facility for ups or fedex or
 

6507
01:52:24,239 --> 01:52:25,990
facility to facility for ups or fedex or
less than truckload care and the idea

6508
01:52:25,990 --> 01:52:26,000
less than truckload care and the idea
 

6509
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:27,750
less than truckload care and the idea
there is fully driverless so potentially

6510
01:52:27,750 --> 01:52:27,760
there is fully driverless so potentially
 

6511
01:52:27,760 --> 01:52:30,390
there is fully driverless so potentially
not even a driver in the truck it's just

6512
01:52:30,390 --> 01:52:30,400
not even a driver in the truck it's just
 

6513
01:52:30,400 --> 01:52:32,550
not even a driver in the truck it's just
going from facility to facility

6514
01:52:32,550 --> 01:52:32,560
going from facility to facility
 

6515
01:52:32,560 --> 01:52:35,510
going from facility to facility
empty zero occupancy yeah and those

6516
01:52:35,510 --> 01:52:35,520
empty zero occupancy yeah and those
 

6517
01:52:35,520 --> 01:52:37,589
empty zero occupancy yeah and those
because that labor is expensive uh you

6518
01:52:37,589 --> 01:52:37,599
because that labor is expensive uh you
 

6519
01:52:37,599 --> 01:52:39,030
because that labor is expensive uh you
know they don't keep those drivers out

6520
01:52:39,030 --> 01:52:39,040
know they don't keep those drivers out
 

6521
01:52:39,040 --> 01:52:41,030
know they don't keep those drivers out
overnight those drivers do do a run back

6522
01:52:41,030 --> 01:52:41,040
overnight those drivers do do a run back
 

6523
01:52:41,040 --> 01:52:43,750
overnight those drivers do do a run back
and forth typically um or in a team go

6524
01:52:43,750 --> 01:52:43,760
and forth typically um or in a team go
 

6525
01:52:43,760 --> 01:52:46,870
and forth typically um or in a team go
back and forth in in one day

6526
01:52:46,870 --> 01:52:46,880
back and forth in in one day
 

6527
01:52:46,880 --> 01:52:49,189
back and forth in in one day
so from the people you've spoken with uh

6528
01:52:49,189 --> 01:52:49,199
so from the people you've spoken with uh
 

6529
01:52:49,199 --> 01:52:51,350
so from the people you've spoken with uh
so far what's your sense how far are we

6530
01:52:51,350 --> 01:52:51,360
so far what's your sense how far are we
 

6531
01:52:51,360 --> 01:52:53,830
so far what's your sense how far are we
away from which scenarios closest and

6532
01:52:53,830 --> 01:52:53,840
away from which scenarios closest and
 

6533
01:52:53,840 --> 01:52:56,790
away from which scenarios closest and
how far away are we from that scenario

6534
01:52:56,790 --> 01:52:56,800
how far away are we from that scenario
 

6535
01:52:56,800 --> 01:52:59,189
how far away are we from that scenario
of autonomy

6536
01:52:59,189 --> 01:52:59,199
of autonomy
 

6537
01:52:59,199 --> 01:53:02,070
of autonomy
being a big part of our trucking fleet

6538
01:53:02,070 --> 01:53:02,080
being a big part of our trucking fleet
 

6539
01:53:02,080 --> 01:53:04,870
being a big part of our trucking fleet
most folks are are focused on another

6540
01:53:04,870 --> 01:53:04,880
most folks are are focused on another
 

6541
01:53:04,880 --> 01:53:07,270
most folks are are focused on another
scenario which is the exit to exit right

6542
01:53:07,270 --> 01:53:07,280
scenario which is the exit to exit right
 

6543
01:53:07,280 --> 01:53:09,030
scenario which is the exit to exit right
um which looks like that urban truck

6544
01:53:09,030 --> 01:53:09,040
um which looks like that urban truck
 

6545
01:53:09,040 --> 01:53:10,550
um which looks like that urban truck
ports um

6546
01:53:10,550 --> 01:53:10,560
ports um
 

6547
01:53:10,560 --> 01:53:12,629
ports um
thing that i laid out earlier you know

6548
01:53:12,629 --> 01:53:12,639
thing that i laid out earlier you know
 

6549
01:53:12,639 --> 01:53:14,310
thing that i laid out earlier you know
so you have a human driven truck that

6550
01:53:14,310 --> 01:53:14,320
so you have a human driven truck that
 

6551
01:53:14,320 --> 01:53:17,669
so you have a human driven truck that
comes out to um a drop lot it meets up

6552
01:53:17,669 --> 01:53:17,679
comes out to um a drop lot it meets up
 

6553
01:53:17,679 --> 01:53:19,669
comes out to um a drop lot it meets up
with an autonomous truck the

6554
01:53:19,669 --> 01:53:19,679
with an autonomous truck the
 

6555
01:53:19,679 --> 01:53:21,750
with an autonomous truck the
that truck then you know drives it on

6556
01:53:21,750 --> 01:53:21,760
that truck then you know drives it on
 

6557
01:53:21,760 --> 01:53:23,750
that truck then you know drives it on
the interstate to another lot

6558
01:53:23,750 --> 01:53:23,760
the interstate to another lot
 

6559
01:53:23,760 --> 01:53:26,390
the interstate to another lot
and then a human driver

6560
01:53:26,390 --> 01:53:26,400
and then a human driver
 

6561
01:53:26,400 --> 01:53:27,990
and then a human driver
you know picks it up

6562
01:53:27,990 --> 01:53:28,000
you know picks it up
 

6563
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:30,550
you know picks it up
there are a couple variations maybe on

6564
01:53:30,550 --> 01:53:30,560
there are a couple variations maybe on
 

6565
01:53:30,560 --> 01:53:32,310
there are a couple variations maybe on
that um

6566
01:53:32,310 --> 01:53:32,320
that um
 

6567
01:53:32,320 --> 01:53:33,430
that um
so

6568
01:53:33,430 --> 01:53:33,440
so
 

6569
01:53:33,440 --> 01:53:35,350
so
or let me just run through the last two

6570
01:53:35,350 --> 01:53:35,360
or let me just run through the last two
 

6571
01:53:35,360 --> 01:53:37,910
or let me just run through the last two
scenarios sure

6572
01:53:37,910 --> 01:53:37,920
scenarios sure
 

6573
01:53:37,920 --> 01:53:40,470
scenarios sure
the other thing you could do right is to

6574
01:53:40,470 --> 01:53:40,480
the other thing you could do right is to
 

6575
01:53:40,480 --> 01:53:42,229
the other thing you could do right is to
say all right i've got a truck that can

6576
01:53:42,229 --> 01:53:42,239
say all right i've got a truck that can
 

6577
01:53:42,239 --> 01:53:44,870
say all right i've got a truck that can
drive itself um and i i refer to this

6578
01:53:44,870 --> 01:53:44,880
drive itself um and i i refer to this
 

6579
01:53:44,880 --> 01:53:47,430
drive itself um and i i refer to this
one as autopilot but um

6580
01:53:47,430 --> 01:53:47,440
one as autopilot but um
 

6581
01:53:47,440 --> 01:53:49,109
one as autopilot but um
you know you have a human drive it out

6582
01:53:49,109 --> 01:53:49,119
you know you have a human drive it out
 

6583
01:53:49,119 --> 01:53:50,950
you know you have a human drive it out
to the interstate but rather than have

6584
01:53:50,950 --> 01:53:50,960
to the interstate but rather than have
 

6585
01:53:50,960 --> 01:53:51,669
to the interstate but rather than have
that

6586
01:53:51,669 --> 01:53:51,679
that
 

6587
01:53:51,679 --> 01:53:54,070
that
transaction where where the human driven

6588
01:53:54,070 --> 01:53:54,080
transaction where where the human driven
 

6589
01:53:54,080 --> 01:53:56,470
transaction where where the human driven
truck detaches the trailer and it gets

6590
01:53:56,470 --> 01:53:56,480
truck detaches the trailer and it gets
 

6591
01:53:56,480 --> 01:53:58,629
truck detaches the trailer and it gets
coupled up to a self-driving truck

6592
01:53:58,629 --> 01:53:58,639
coupled up to a self-driving truck
 

6593
01:53:58,639 --> 01:54:01,189
coupled up to a self-driving truck
they just that human driver just hops on

6594
01:54:01,189 --> 01:54:01,199
they just that human driver just hops on
 

6595
01:54:01,199 --> 01:54:03,189
they just that human driver just hops on
the interstate with that truck and goes

6596
01:54:03,189 --> 01:54:03,199
the interstate with that truck and goes
 

6597
01:54:03,199 --> 01:54:05,430
the interstate with that truck and goes
in back and goes off duty

6598
01:54:05,430 --> 01:54:05,440
in back and goes off duty
 

6599
01:54:05,440 --> 01:54:07,750
in back and goes off duty
while the truck drives itself and and so

6600
01:54:07,750 --> 01:54:07,760
while the truck drives itself and and so
 

6601
01:54:07,760 --> 01:54:09,510
while the truck drives itself and and so
you have a self-driving truck that's not

6602
01:54:09,510 --> 01:54:09,520
you have a self-driving truck that's not
 

6603
01:54:09,520 --> 01:54:12,310
you have a self-driving truck that's not
driverless right um and just to clarify

6604
01:54:12,310 --> 01:54:12,320
driverless right um and just to clarify
 

6605
01:54:12,320 --> 01:54:14,470
driverless right um and just to clarify
because tesla uses the term autopilot so

6606
01:54:14,470 --> 01:54:14,480
because tesla uses the term autopilot so
 

6607
01:54:14,480 --> 01:54:16,310
because tesla uses the term autopilot so
the airplanes and so everybody uses the

6608
01:54:16,310 --> 01:54:16,320
the airplanes and so everybody uses the
 

6609
01:54:16,320 --> 01:54:18,550
the airplanes and so everybody uses the
word autopilot we're referring to

6610
01:54:18,550 --> 01:54:18,560
word autopilot we're referring to
 

6611
01:54:18,560 --> 01:54:20,950
word autopilot we're referring to
essentially full autonomy but because

6612
01:54:20,950 --> 01:54:20,960
essentially full autonomy but because
 

6613
01:54:20,960 --> 01:54:23,510
essentially full autonomy but because
it's exit to exit the truck driver is

6614
01:54:23,510 --> 01:54:23,520
it's exit to exit the truck driver is
 

6615
01:54:23,520 --> 01:54:25,189
it's exit to exit the truck driver is
on board the truck but they're sleeping

6616
01:54:25,189 --> 01:54:25,199
on board the truck but they're sleeping
 

6617
01:54:25,199 --> 01:54:27,350
on board the truck but they're sleeping
in the back or whatever yeah and this

6618
01:54:27,350 --> 01:54:27,360
in the back or whatever yeah and this
 

6619
01:54:27,360 --> 01:54:29,990
in the back or whatever yeah and this
this gets to the really weedy policy

6620
01:54:29,990 --> 01:54:30,000
this gets to the really weedy policy
 

6621
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,950
this gets to the really weedy policy
questions right so basically for the

6622
01:54:32,950 --> 01:54:32,960
questions right so basically for the
 

6623
01:54:32,960 --> 01:54:34,390
questions right so basically for the
department of transportation for you to

6624
01:54:34,390 --> 01:54:34,400
department of transportation for you to
 

6625
01:54:34,400 --> 01:54:36,470
department of transportation for you to
be off duty for safety reasons you have

6626
01:54:36,470 --> 01:54:36,480
be off duty for safety reasons you have
 

6627
01:54:36,480 --> 01:54:37,830
be off duty for safety reasons you have
to be completely relieved of all

6628
01:54:37,830 --> 01:54:37,840
to be completely relieved of all
 

6629
01:54:37,840 --> 01:54:39,270
to be completely relieved of all
responsibility

6630
01:54:39,270 --> 01:54:39,280
responsibility
 

6631
01:54:39,280 --> 01:54:41,830
responsibility
so that truck has to not you know

6632
01:54:41,830 --> 01:54:41,840
so that truck has to not you know
 

6633
01:54:41,840 --> 01:54:43,990
so that truck has to not you know
encounter a construction

6634
01:54:43,990 --> 01:54:44,000
encounter a construction
 

6635
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,390
encounter a construction
site or what inclement weather or

6636
01:54:46,390 --> 01:54:46,400
site or what inclement weather or
 

6637
01:54:46,400 --> 01:54:47,910
site or what inclement weather or
whatever it might be

6638
01:54:47,910 --> 01:54:47,920
whatever it might be
 

6639
01:54:47,920 --> 01:54:50,070
whatever it might be
and and call to you and say hey you know

6640
01:54:50,070 --> 01:54:50,080
and and call to you and say hey you know
 

6641
01:54:50,080 --> 01:54:51,510
and and call to you and say hey you know
or i mean obviously right we're

6642
01:54:51,510 --> 01:54:51,520
or i mean obviously right we're
 

6643
01:54:51,520 --> 01:54:53,350
or i mean obviously right we're
imagining connected vehicles as well

6644
01:54:53,350 --> 01:54:53,360
imagining connected vehicles as well
 

6645
01:54:53,360 --> 01:54:54,470
imagining connected vehicles as well
right so

6646
01:54:54,470 --> 01:54:54,480
right so
 

6647
01:54:54,480 --> 01:54:56,070
right so
you're in a self-driving truck you're in

6648
01:54:56,070 --> 01:54:56,080
you're in a self-driving truck you're in
 

6649
01:54:56,080 --> 01:54:59,109
you're in a self-driving truck you're in
the back and trucks 20 miles ahead

6650
01:54:59,109 --> 01:54:59,119
the back and trucks 20 miles ahead
 

6651
01:54:59,119 --> 01:55:02,070
the back and trucks 20 miles ahead
experience some problem right um that

6652
01:55:02,070 --> 01:55:02,080
experience some problem right um that
 

6653
01:55:02,080 --> 01:55:03,669
experience some problem right um that
may require tele operation or whatever

6654
01:55:03,669 --> 01:55:03,679
may require tele operation or whatever
 

6655
01:55:03,679 --> 01:55:05,750
may require tele operation or whatever
it is right and it signals to your truck

6656
01:55:05,750 --> 01:55:05,760
it is right and it signals to your truck
 

6657
01:55:05,760 --> 01:55:08,229
it is right and it signals to your truck
hey you know tell the driver 20 miles

6658
01:55:08,229 --> 01:55:08,239
hey you know tell the driver 20 miles
 

6659
01:55:08,239 --> 01:55:10,790
hey you know tell the driver 20 miles
ahead he's he's got to hop in the seat

6660
01:55:10,790 --> 01:55:10,800
ahead he's he's got to hop in the seat
 

6661
01:55:10,800 --> 01:55:12,229
ahead he's he's got to hop in the seat
that would mean that they're on duty

6662
01:55:12,229 --> 01:55:12,239
that would mean that they're on duty
 

6663
01:55:12,239 --> 01:55:13,430
that would mean that they're on duty
according to the way that the current

6664
01:55:13,430 --> 01:55:13,440
according to the way that the current
 

6665
01:55:13,440 --> 01:55:15,030
according to the way that the current
rules are written they have some

6666
01:55:15,030 --> 01:55:15,040
rules are written they have some
 

6667
01:55:15,040 --> 01:55:16,870
rules are written they have some
responsibility and part of that is you

6668
01:55:16,870 --> 01:55:16,880
responsibility and part of that is you
 

6669
01:55:16,880 --> 01:55:18,950
responsibility and part of that is you
know we need we need them get rest right

6670
01:55:18,950 --> 01:55:18,960
know we need we need them get rest right
 

6671
01:55:18,960 --> 01:55:21,830
know we need we need them get rest right
um they need to have uninterrupted

6672
01:55:21,830 --> 01:55:21,840
um they need to have uninterrupted
 

6673
01:55:21,840 --> 01:55:23,430
um they need to have uninterrupted
sleep so

6674
01:55:23,430 --> 01:55:23,440
sleep so
 

6675
01:55:23,440 --> 01:55:26,070
sleep so
that's what i call autopilot the the

6676
01:55:26,070 --> 01:55:26,080
that's what i call autopilot the the
 

6677
01:55:26,080 --> 01:55:27,350
that's what i call autopilot the the
final

6678
01:55:27,350 --> 01:55:27,360
final
 

6679
01:55:27,360 --> 01:55:28,470
final
scenario

6680
01:55:28,470 --> 01:55:28,480
scenario
 

6681
01:55:28,480 --> 01:55:30,790
scenario
is one that i i thought was actually the

6682
01:55:30,790 --> 01:55:30,800
is one that i i thought was actually the
 

6683
01:55:30,800 --> 01:55:33,109
is one that i i thought was actually the
one scenario that was good for labor

6684
01:55:33,109 --> 01:55:33,119
one scenario that was good for labor
 

6685
01:55:33,119 --> 01:55:36,229
one scenario that was good for labor
um you know uh which i which i i i

6686
01:55:36,229 --> 01:55:36,239
um you know uh which i which i i i
 

6687
01:55:36,239 --> 01:55:37,510
um you know uh which i which i i i
proposed because i'm like well here's

6688
01:55:37,510 --> 01:55:37,520
proposed because i'm like well here's
 

6689
01:55:37,520 --> 01:55:38,870
proposed because i'm like well here's
here's an idea you know that would be

6690
01:55:38,870 --> 01:55:38,880
here's an idea you know that would be
 

6691
01:55:38,880 --> 01:55:41,990
here's an idea you know that would be
like actually good for workers um and

6692
01:55:41,990 --> 01:55:42,000
like actually good for workers um and
 

6693
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:42,790
like actually good for workers um and
just

6694
01:55:42,790 --> 01:55:42,800
just
 

6695
01:55:42,800 --> 01:55:44,310

brief aside here um
 

6699
01:55:46,880 --> 01:55:49,669
brief aside here um
the history of trucking over the last

6700
01:55:49,669 --> 01:55:49,679
the history of trucking over the last
 

6701
01:55:49,679 --> 01:55:51,990
the history of trucking over the last
you know 40 years there's been a lot of

6702
01:55:51,990 --> 01:55:52,000
you know 40 years there's been a lot of
 

6703
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:54,709
you know 40 years there's been a lot of
technological change so when i

6704
01:55:54,709 --> 01:55:54,719
technological change so when i
 

6705
01:55:54,719 --> 01:55:55,910
technological change so when i
learned to drive the truck i had to

6706
01:55:55,910 --> 01:55:55,920
learned to drive the truck i had to
 

6707
01:55:55,920 --> 01:55:57,270
learned to drive the truck i had to
learn to manually shift it like i was

6708
01:55:57,270 --> 01:55:57,280
learn to manually shift it like i was
 

6709
01:55:57,280 --> 01:55:59,430
learn to manually shift it like i was
describing you had to read these fairly

6710
01:55:59,430 --> 01:55:59,440
describing you had to read these fairly
 

6711
01:55:59,440 --> 01:56:01,270
describing you had to read these fairly
complicated you know big sets of

6712
01:56:01,270 --> 01:56:01,280
complicated you know big sets of
 

6713
01:56:01,280 --> 01:56:03,109
complicated you know big sets of
laminated maps to figure out where the

6714
01:56:03,109 --> 01:56:03,119
laminated maps to figure out where the
 

6715
01:56:03,119 --> 01:56:05,030
laminated maps to figure out where the
truck can go and where it couldn't which

6716
01:56:05,030 --> 01:56:05,040
truck can go and where it couldn't which
 

6717
01:56:05,040 --> 01:56:06,470
truck can go and where it couldn't which
is a big deal you know when you take

6718
01:56:06,470 --> 01:56:06,480
is a big deal you know when you take
 

6719
01:56:06,480 --> 01:56:08,149
is a big deal you know when you take
these trucks on the wrong road and

6720
01:56:08,149 --> 01:56:08,159
these trucks on the wrong road and
 

6721
01:56:08,159 --> 01:56:09,510
these trucks on the wrong road and
you're destroying a bridge or you're

6722
01:56:09,510 --> 01:56:09,520
you're destroying a bridge or you're
 

6723
01:56:09,520 --> 01:56:10,870
you're destroying a bridge or you're
doing a can opener which is where you

6724
01:56:10,870 --> 01:56:10,880
doing a can opener which is where you
 

6725
01:56:10,880 --> 01:56:12,709
doing a can opener which is where you
try to drive it under about too low

6726
01:56:12,709 --> 01:56:12,719
try to drive it under about too low
 

6727
01:56:12,719 --> 01:56:14,310
try to drive it under about too low
you've probably seen that on on youtube

6728
01:56:14,310 --> 01:56:14,320
you've probably seen that on on youtube
 

6729
01:56:14,320 --> 01:56:16,470
you've probably seen that on on youtube
if not you know check it out you know

truck can opener um you know there's
 

6733
01:56:19,040 --> 01:56:20,550
truck can opener um you know there's
some bridges that are famous for it

6734
01:56:20,550 --> 01:56:20,560
some bridges that are famous for it
 

6735
01:56:20,560 --> 01:56:22,070
some bridges that are famous for it
right and there's one i think called the

6736
01:56:22,070 --> 01:56:22,080
right and there's one i think called the
 

6737
01:56:22,080 --> 01:56:23,510
right and there's one i think called the
can opener

um
 

6743
01:56:26,560 --> 01:56:29,109
um
and you know you had to log those hours

6744
01:56:29,109 --> 01:56:29,119
and you know you had to log those hours
 

6745
01:56:29,119 --> 01:56:31,669
and you know you had to log those hours
like manually and sort of do do the math

6746
01:56:31,669 --> 01:56:31,679
like manually and sort of do do the math
 

6747
01:56:31,679 --> 01:56:34,149
like manually and sort of do do the math
and and plan your work routine

6748
01:56:34,149 --> 01:56:34,159
and and plan your work routine
 

6749
01:56:34,159 --> 01:56:35,430
and and plan your work routine
and i would do this every day i'd say

6750
01:56:35,430 --> 01:56:35,440
and i would do this every day i'd say
 

6751
01:56:35,440 --> 01:56:37,350
and i would do this every day i'd say
like okay i'm going to get up at 5. i

6752
01:56:37,350 --> 01:56:37,360
like okay i'm going to get up at 5. i
 

6753
01:56:37,360 --> 01:56:38,950
like okay i'm going to get up at 5. i
got to think about buffalo and there's

6754
01:56:38,950 --> 01:56:38,960
got to think about buffalo and there's
 

6755
01:56:38,960 --> 01:56:40,790
got to think about buffalo and there's
traffic there so i want to be through

6756
01:56:40,790 --> 01:56:40,800
traffic there so i want to be through
 

6757
01:56:40,800 --> 01:56:43,589
traffic there so i want to be through
buffalo by 6 30 you know and then

6758
01:56:43,589 --> 01:56:43,599
buffalo by 6 30 you know and then
 

6759
01:56:43,599 --> 01:56:46,790
buffalo by 6 30 you know and then
that'll put me you know in in cleveland

6760
01:56:46,790 --> 01:56:46,800
that'll put me you know in in cleveland
 

6761
01:56:46,800 --> 01:56:49,430
that'll put me you know in in cleveland
at you know 9 30

6762
01:56:49,430 --> 01:56:49,440
at you know 9 30
 

6763
01:56:49,440 --> 01:56:51,510
at you know 9 30
which means i'll miss that rush hour

6764
01:56:51,510 --> 01:56:51,520
which means i'll miss that rush hour
 

6765
01:56:51,520 --> 01:56:52,550
which means i'll miss that rush hour
right which is going to put me in

6766
01:56:52,550 --> 01:56:52,560
right which is going to put me in
 

6767
01:56:52,560 --> 01:56:54,870
right which is going to put me in
chicago you know and and so you do this

6768
01:56:54,870 --> 01:56:54,880
chicago you know and and so you do this
 

6769
01:56:54,880 --> 01:56:55,669
chicago you know and and so you do this
and

6770
01:56:55,669 --> 01:56:55,679
and
 

6771
01:56:55,679 --> 01:56:59,350
and
now today you know 15 years later truck

6772
01:56:59,350 --> 01:56:59,360
now today you know 15 years later truck
 

6773
01:56:59,360 --> 01:57:01,510
now today you know 15 years later truck
drivers don't have to do any of that um

6774
01:57:01,510 --> 01:57:01,520
drivers don't have to do any of that um
 

6775
01:57:01,520 --> 01:57:03,270
drivers don't have to do any of that um
you know you don't have to shift the

6776
01:57:03,270 --> 01:57:03,280
you know you don't have to shift the
 

6777
01:57:03,280 --> 01:57:05,910
you know you don't have to shift the
truck you don't have to map um you know

6778
01:57:05,910 --> 01:57:05,920
truck you don't have to map um you know
 

6779
01:57:05,920 --> 01:57:08,550
truck you don't have to map um you know
you can figure out the least congested

6780
01:57:08,550 --> 01:57:08,560
you can figure out the least congested
 

6781
01:57:08,560 --> 01:57:11,189
you can figure out the least congested
route to go on and your hours of service

6782
01:57:11,189 --> 01:57:11,199
route to go on and your hours of service
 

6783
01:57:11,199 --> 01:57:13,589
route to go on and your hours of service
are recorded or a good portion of them

6784
01:57:13,589 --> 01:57:13,599
are recorded or a good portion of them
 

6785
01:57:13,599 --> 01:57:15,830
are recorded or a good portion of them
are reported

6786
01:57:15,830 --> 01:57:15,840
are reported
 

6787
01:57:15,840 --> 01:57:17,030
are reported
automatically

6788
01:57:17,030 --> 01:57:17,040
automatically
 

6789
01:57:17,040 --> 01:57:18,870
automatically
all of that has been a substantial

6790
01:57:18,870 --> 01:57:18,880
all of that has been a substantial
 

6791
01:57:18,880 --> 01:57:21,350
all of that has been a substantial
de-skilling that has you know put

6792
01:57:21,350 --> 01:57:21,360
de-skilling that has you know put
 

6793
01:57:21,360 --> 01:57:23,430
de-skilling that has you know put
downward pressure on rage wages and

6794
01:57:23,430 --> 01:57:23,440
downward pressure on rage wages and
 

6795
01:57:23,440 --> 01:57:25,669
downward pressure on rage wages and
allowed companies to kind of speed up

6796
01:57:25,669 --> 01:57:25,679
allowed companies to kind of speed up
 

6797
01:57:25,679 --> 01:57:28,470
allowed companies to kind of speed up
monitor and direct i mean the the key

6798
01:57:28,470 --> 01:57:28,480
monitor and direct i mean the the key
 

6799
01:57:28,480 --> 01:57:30,470
monitor and direct i mean the the key
technology you know that i did work

6800
01:57:30,470 --> 01:57:30,480
technology you know that i did work
 

6801
01:57:30,480 --> 01:57:32,629
technology you know that i did work
under is satellite linked computers so

6802
01:57:32,629 --> 01:57:32,639
under is satellite linked computers so
 

6803
01:57:32,639 --> 01:57:34,149
under is satellite linked computers so
before you could kind of go out and plan

6804
01:57:34,149 --> 01:57:34,159
before you could kind of go out and plan
 

6805
01:57:34,159 --> 01:57:35,750
before you could kind of go out and plan
your own work and the boss really

6806
01:57:35,750 --> 01:57:35,760
your own work and the boss really
 

6807
01:57:35,760 --> 01:57:37,030
your own work and the boss really
couldn't see what you were doing and

6808
01:57:37,030 --> 01:57:37,040
couldn't see what you were doing and
 

6809
01:57:37,040 --> 01:57:39,189
couldn't see what you were doing and
push you and say you know you've been on

6810
01:57:39,189 --> 01:57:39,199
push you and say you know you've been on
 

6811
01:57:39,199 --> 01:57:41,109
push you and say you know you've been on
break for 10 hours why aren't you moving

6812
01:57:41,109 --> 01:57:41,119
break for 10 hours why aren't you moving
 

6813
01:57:41,119 --> 01:57:43,350
break for 10 hours why aren't you moving
you know um and you might tell them

6814
01:57:43,350 --> 01:57:43,360
you know um and you might tell them
 

6815
01:57:43,360 --> 01:57:45,030
you know um and you might tell them
you know because i'm tired you know like

6816
01:57:45,030 --> 01:57:45,040
you know because i'm tired you know like
 

6817
01:57:45,040 --> 01:57:46,310
you know because i'm tired you know like
i didn't sleep well i've got to get a

6818
01:57:46,310 --> 01:57:46,320
i didn't sleep well i've got to get a
 

6819
01:57:46,320 --> 01:57:48,550
i didn't sleep well i've got to get a
couple more hours you know they're only

6820
01:57:48,550 --> 01:57:48,560
couple more hours you know they're only
 

6821
01:57:48,560 --> 01:57:50,390
couple more hours you know they're only
going to accept that so many times or at

6822
01:57:50,390 --> 01:57:50,400
going to accept that so many times or at
 

6823
01:57:50,400 --> 01:57:53,109
going to accept that so many times or at
least some of those dispatchers are so

6824
01:57:53,109 --> 01:57:53,119
least some of those dispatchers are so
 

6825
01:57:53,119 --> 01:57:55,030
least some of those dispatchers are so
all this technology has has made the job

6826
01:57:55,030 --> 01:57:55,040
all this technology has has made the job
 

6827
01:57:55,040 --> 01:57:57,350
all this technology has has made the job
sort of you know de-skilled the job you

6828
01:57:57,350 --> 01:57:57,360
sort of you know de-skilled the job you
 

6829
01:57:57,360 --> 01:57:59,510
sort of you know de-skilled the job you
know hurt drivers in the labor market

6830
01:57:59,510 --> 01:57:59,520
know hurt drivers in the labor market
 

6831
01:57:59,520 --> 01:58:01,669
know hurt drivers in the labor market
made the work worse

6832
01:58:01,669 --> 01:58:01,679
made the work worse
 

6833
01:58:01,679 --> 01:58:02,709
made the work worse
so

6834
01:58:02,709 --> 01:58:02,719
so
 

6835
01:58:02,719 --> 01:58:05,669
so
i think the burden is really on

6836
01:58:05,669 --> 01:58:05,679
i think the burden is really on
 

6837
01:58:05,679 --> 01:58:08,070
i think the burden is really on
the technologists who are like oh this

6838
01:58:08,070 --> 01:58:08,080
the technologists who are like oh this
 

6839
01:58:08,080 --> 01:58:09,910
the technologists who are like oh this
will make truck driver jobs better and

6840
01:58:09,910 --> 01:58:09,920
will make truck driver jobs better and
 

6841
01:58:09,920 --> 01:58:11,589
will make truck driver jobs better and
sort of envision ways that it would it's

6842
01:58:11,589 --> 01:58:11,599
sort of envision ways that it would it's
 

6843
01:58:11,599 --> 01:58:12,390
sort of envision ways that it would it's
like

6844
01:58:12,390 --> 01:58:12,400
like
 

6845
01:58:12,400 --> 01:58:14,470
like
the burden's really a proof is really on

6846
01:58:14,470 --> 01:58:14,480
the burden's really a proof is really on
 

6847
01:58:14,480 --> 01:58:16,790
the burden's really a proof is really on
you to sort of really clearly lay out

6848
01:58:16,790 --> 01:58:16,800
you to sort of really clearly lay out
 

6849
01:58:16,800 --> 01:58:19,589
you to sort of really clearly lay out
what that is going to look like because

6850
01:58:19,589 --> 01:58:19,599
what that is going to look like because
 

6851
01:58:19,599 --> 01:58:22,229
what that is going to look like because
it's 30 or 40 years of history suggests

6852
01:58:22,229 --> 01:58:22,239
it's 30 or 40 years of history suggests
 

6853
01:58:22,239 --> 01:58:25,109
it's 30 or 40 years of history suggests
that that technology into labor markets

6854
01:58:25,109 --> 01:58:25,119
that that technology into labor markets
 

6855
01:58:25,119 --> 01:58:27,270
that that technology into labor markets
where workers are really weak

6856
01:58:27,270 --> 01:58:27,280
where workers are really weak
 

6857
01:58:27,280 --> 01:58:29,510
where workers are really weak
and cheap is what wins

6858
01:58:29,510 --> 01:58:29,520
and cheap is what wins
 

6859
01:58:29,520 --> 01:58:31,589
and cheap is what wins
that new technology doesn't help workers

6860
01:58:31,589 --> 01:58:31,599
that new technology doesn't help workers
 

6861
01:58:31,599 --> 01:58:33,750
that new technology doesn't help workers
or raise their wages

6862
01:58:33,750 --> 01:58:33,760
or raise their wages
 

6863
01:58:33,760 --> 01:58:35,830
or raise their wages
so lowers the bar of entry in terms of

6864
01:58:35,830 --> 01:58:35,840
so lowers the bar of entry in terms of
 

6865
01:58:35,840 --> 01:58:37,990
so lowers the bar of entry in terms of
skill yeah

6866
01:58:37,990 --> 01:58:38,000
skill yeah
 

6867
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:38,870
skill yeah
so

6868
01:58:38,870 --> 01:58:38,880
so
 

6869
01:58:38,880 --> 01:58:42,790
so
that's that's really interest that's um

6870
01:58:42,790 --> 01:58:42,800
that's that's really interest that's um
 

6871
01:58:42,800 --> 01:58:45,109
that's that's really interest that's um
that's tough that's tough to know to do

6872
01:58:45,109 --> 01:58:45,119
that's tough that's tough to know to do
 

6873
01:58:45,119 --> 01:58:47,109
that's tough that's tough to know to do
with because yeah from a technology

6874
01:58:47,109 --> 01:58:47,119
with because yeah from a technology
 

6875
01:58:47,119 --> 01:58:49,030
with because yeah from a technology
perspective you want to make the life of

6876
01:58:49,030 --> 01:58:49,040
perspective you want to make the life of
 

6877
01:58:49,040 --> 01:58:51,830
perspective you want to make the life of
the people doing the job today easier is

6878
01:58:51,830 --> 01:58:51,840
the people doing the job today easier is
 

6879
01:58:51,840 --> 01:58:52,629
the people doing the job today easier is
it

6880
01:58:52,629 --> 01:58:52,639
it
 

6881
01:58:52,639 --> 01:58:55,350
it
is that what you want no but that like

6882
01:58:55,350 --> 01:58:55,360
is that what you want no but that like
 

6883
01:58:55,360 --> 01:58:57,589
is that what you want no but that like
when you think about like what

6884
01:58:57,589 --> 01:58:57,599
when you think about like what
 

6885
01:58:57,599 --> 01:59:00,229
when you think about like what
exactly because the reality is

6886
01:59:00,229 --> 01:59:00,239
exactly because the reality is
 

6887
01:59:00,239 --> 01:59:02,310
exactly because the reality is
you will make the their life potentially

6888
01:59:02,310 --> 01:59:02,320
you will make the their life potentially
 

6889
01:59:02,320 --> 01:59:03,990
you will make the their life potentially
a little bit easier

6890
01:59:03,990 --> 01:59:04,000
a little bit easier
 

6891
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,229
a little bit easier
but that will allow the companies to

6892
01:59:06,229 --> 01:59:06,239
but that will allow the companies to
 

6893
01:59:06,239 --> 01:59:08,709
but that will allow the companies to
then hire people that are less skilled

6894
01:59:08,709 --> 01:59:08,719
then hire people that are less skilled
 

6895
01:59:08,719 --> 01:59:10,229
then hire people that are less skilled
it will get those people that are

6896
01:59:10,229 --> 01:59:10,239
it will get those people that are
 

6897
01:59:10,239 --> 01:59:12,550
it will get those people that are
previously working there fired or lower

6898
01:59:12,550 --> 01:59:12,560
previously working there fired or lower
 

6899
01:59:12,560 --> 01:59:17,030
previously working there fired or lower
wages and so the result of this easier

6900
01:59:17,030 --> 01:59:17,040
wages and so the result of this easier
 

6901
01:59:17,040 --> 01:59:20,070
wages and so the result of this easier
is a lower quality of life yeah that's

6902
01:59:20,070 --> 01:59:20,080
is a lower quality of life yeah that's
 

6903
01:59:20,080 --> 01:59:23,109
is a lower quality of life yeah that's
dark actually i know i'm sorry

6904
01:59:23,109 --> 01:59:23,119
dark actually i know i'm sorry
 

6905
01:59:23,119 --> 01:59:24,870
dark actually i know i'm sorry
but you're you were saying that was for

6906
01:59:24,870 --> 01:59:24,880
but you're you were saying that was for
 

6907
01:59:24,880 --> 01:59:27,030
but you're you were saying that was for
you initially the hopeful

6908
01:59:27,030 --> 01:59:27,040
you initially the hopeful
 

6909
01:59:27,040 --> 01:59:29,030
you initially the hopeful
oh no so i'll i'll get to that but one

6910
01:59:29,030 --> 01:59:29,040
oh no so i'll i'll get to that but one
 

6911
01:59:29,040 --> 01:59:30,470
oh no so i'll i'll get to that but one
more thing because this this is not

6912
01:59:30,470 --> 01:59:30,480
more thing because this this is not
 

6913
01:59:30,480 --> 01:59:31,990
more thing because this this is not
stopping right and this is another

6914
01:59:31,990 --> 01:59:32,000
stopping right and this is another
 

6915
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:33,430
stopping right and this is another
interesting question about the sort of

6916
01:59:33,430 --> 01:59:33,440
interesting question about the sort of
 

6917
01:59:33,440 --> 01:59:35,669
interesting question about the sort of
automation and i think uber

6918
01:59:35,669 --> 01:59:35,679
automation and i think uber
 

6919
01:59:35,679 --> 01:59:37,830
automation and i think uber
right is is a is an interesting example

6920
01:59:37,830 --> 01:59:37,840
right is is a is an interesting example
 

6921
01:59:37,840 --> 01:59:39,109
right is is a is an interesting example
here right where it's like okay if we

6922
01:59:39,109 --> 01:59:39,119
here right where it's like okay if we
 

6923
01:59:39,119 --> 01:59:41,510
here right where it's like okay if we
had self-driving trucks or self-driving

6924
01:59:41,510 --> 01:59:41,520
had self-driving trucks or self-driving
 

6925
01:59:41,520 --> 01:59:43,270
had self-driving trucks or self-driving
cars right we could we could automate

6926
01:59:43,270 --> 01:59:43,280
cars right we could we could automate
 

6927
01:59:43,280 --> 01:59:44,950
cars right we could we could automate
you know what what used to be taxi

6928
01:59:44,950 --> 01:59:44,960
you know what what used to be taxi
 

6929
01:59:44,960 --> 01:59:45,990
you know what what used to be taxi
service

6930
01:59:45,990 --> 01:59:46,000
service
 

6931
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:47,030
service
there's a whole bunch of stuff that's

6932
01:59:47,030 --> 01:59:47,040
there's a whole bunch of stuff that's
 

6933
01:59:47,040 --> 01:59:48,550
there's a whole bunch of stuff that's
already been automated like the

6934
01:59:48,550 --> 01:59:48,560
already been automated like the
 

6935
01:59:48,560 --> 01:59:50,310
already been automated like the
dispatching so the dispatchers are

6936
01:59:50,310 --> 01:59:50,320
dispatching so the dispatchers are
 

6937
01:59:50,320 --> 01:59:53,030
dispatching so the dispatchers are
already out of work in in rideshare and

6938
01:59:53,030 --> 01:59:53,040
already out of work in in rideshare and
 

6939
01:59:53,040 --> 01:59:54,709
already out of work in in rideshare and
the payment is already automated right

6940
01:59:54,709 --> 01:59:54,719
the payment is already automated right
 

6941
01:59:54,719 --> 01:59:56,870
the payment is already automated right
so so you have to automate steps like

6942
01:59:56,870 --> 01:59:56,880
so so you have to automate steps like
 

6943
01:59:56,880 --> 01:59:58,950
so so you have to automate steps like
this so you have to have you know that

6944
01:59:58,950 --> 01:59:58,960
this so you have to have you know that
 

6945
01:59:58,960 --> 02:00:00,950
this so you have to have you know that
initial link to dispatch the truck you

6946
02:00:00,950 --> 02:00:00,960
initial link to dispatch the truck you
 

6947
02:00:00,960 --> 02:00:03,189
initial link to dispatch the truck you
have to have the you know the automated

6948
02:00:03,189 --> 02:00:03,199
have to have the you know the automated
 

6949
02:00:03,199 --> 02:00:04,870
have to have the you know the automated
mapping and all so we've sort of done

6950
02:00:04,870 --> 02:00:04,880
mapping and all so we've sort of done
 

6951
02:00:04,880 --> 02:00:07,430
mapping and all so we've sort of done
all this you know incremental automation

6952
02:00:07,430 --> 02:00:07,440
all this you know incremental automation
 

6953
02:00:07,440 --> 02:00:09,830
all this you know incremental automation
right that could make the truck um

6954
02:00:09,830 --> 02:00:09,840
right that could make the truck um
 

6955
02:00:09,840 --> 02:00:11,430
right that could make the truck um
completely driverless

6956
02:00:11,430 --> 02:00:11,440
completely driverless
 

6957
02:00:11,440 --> 02:00:13,030
completely driverless
there's some important things happening

6958
02:00:13,030 --> 02:00:13,040
there's some important things happening
 

6959
02:00:13,040 --> 02:00:15,189
there's some important things happening
right now with the remaining good jobs

6960
02:00:15,189 --> 02:00:15,199
right now with the remaining good jobs
 

6961
02:00:15,199 --> 02:00:15,910
right now with the remaining good jobs
so

6962
02:00:15,910 --> 02:00:15,920
so
 

6963
02:00:15,920 --> 02:00:17,669
so
what you're really paying for when you

6964
02:00:17,669 --> 02:00:17,679
what you're really paying for when you
 

6965
02:00:17,679 --> 02:00:19,990
what you're really paying for when you
get a good truck driver is you know like

6966
02:00:19,990 --> 02:00:20,000
get a good truck driver is you know like
 

6967
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:21,510
get a good truck driver is you know like
i said you get those kind of local

6968
02:00:21,510 --> 02:00:21,520
i said you get those kind of local
 

6969
02:00:21,520 --> 02:00:25,109
i said you get those kind of local
skills of like backing and congested

6970
02:00:25,109 --> 02:00:25,119
skills of like backing and congested
 

6971
02:00:25,119 --> 02:00:27,109
skills of like backing and congested
traffic those

6972
02:00:27,109 --> 02:00:27,119
traffic those
 

6973
02:00:27,119 --> 02:00:28,629
traffic those
it's really impressive to watch and

6974
02:00:28,629 --> 02:00:28,639
it's really impressive to watch and
 

6975
02:00:28,639 --> 02:00:30,629
it's really impressive to watch and
there's some value on it certainly but

6976
02:00:30,629 --> 02:00:30,639
there's some value on it certainly but
 

6977
02:00:30,639 --> 02:00:34,149
there's some value on it certainly but
it's relatively low value um in in the

6978
02:00:34,149 --> 02:00:34,159
it's relatively low value um in in the
 

6979
02:00:34,159 --> 02:00:36,550
it's relatively low value um in in the
actual driving technique right so

6980
02:00:36,550 --> 02:00:36,560
actual driving technique right so
 

6981
02:00:36,560 --> 02:00:38,550
actual driving technique right so
you bump something you know back into

6982
02:00:38,550 --> 02:00:38,560
you bump something you know back into
 

6983
02:00:38,560 --> 02:00:40,229
you bump something you know back into
the dock it's you know it might be a

6984
02:00:40,229 --> 02:00:40,239
the dock it's you know it might be a
 

6985
02:00:40,239 --> 02:00:41,910
the dock it's you know it might be a
couple thousand dollars because you ruin

6986
02:00:41,910 --> 02:00:41,920
couple thousand dollars because you ruin
 

6987
02:00:41,920 --> 02:00:43,510
couple thousand dollars because you ruin
a canopy or something over a dock or

6988
02:00:43,510 --> 02:00:43,520
a canopy or something over a dock or
 

6989
02:00:43,520 --> 02:00:45,350
a canopy or something over a dock or
tear up a trailer

6990
02:00:45,350 --> 02:00:45,360
tear up a trailer
 

6991
02:00:45,360 --> 02:00:47,750
tear up a trailer
what you really want those those highly

6992
02:00:47,750 --> 02:00:47,760
what you really want those those highly
 

6993
02:00:47,760 --> 02:00:48,950
what you really want those those highly
skilled

6994
02:00:48,950 --> 02:00:48,960
skilled
 

6995
02:00:48,960 --> 02:00:50,950
skilled
conscientious drivers and that's really

6996
02:00:50,950 --> 02:00:50,960
conscientious drivers and that's really
 

6997
02:00:50,960 --> 02:00:52,629
conscientious drivers and that's really
what it what it is and that's what

6998
02:00:52,629 --> 02:00:52,639
what it what it is and that's what
 

6999
02:00:52,639 --> 02:00:54,310
what it what it is and that's what
computers are really good at is about

7000
02:00:54,310 --> 02:00:54,320
computers are really good at is about
 

7001
02:00:54,320 --> 02:00:56,149
computers are really good at is about
being conscientious right in the sense

7002
02:00:56,149 --> 02:00:56,159
being conscientious right in the sense
 

7003
02:00:56,159 --> 02:00:58,629
being conscientious right in the sense
of like they pay attention continually

7004
02:00:58,629 --> 02:00:58,639
of like they pay attention continually
 

7005
02:00:58,639 --> 02:01:00,390
of like they pay attention continually
right and and how it was describing

7006
02:01:00,390 --> 02:01:00,400
right and and how it was describing
 

7007
02:01:00,400 --> 02:01:02,390
right and and how it was describing
those those long-haul segments where the

7008
02:01:02,390 --> 02:01:02,400
those those long-haul segments where the
 

7009
02:01:02,400 --> 02:01:05,669
those those long-haul segments where the
driver you know just keeps out of the

7010
02:01:05,669 --> 02:01:05,679
driver you know just keeps out of the
 

7011
02:01:05,679 --> 02:01:07,430
driver you know just keeps out of the
the situations that could become

7012
02:01:07,430 --> 02:01:07,440
the situations that could become
 

7013
02:01:07,440 --> 02:01:09,669
the situations that could become
problematic right and just they don't

7014
02:01:09,669 --> 02:01:09,679
problematic right and just they don't
 

7015
02:01:09,679 --> 02:01:11,430
problematic right and just they don't
look at their phone and they take the

7016
02:01:11,430 --> 02:01:11,440
look at their phone and they take the
 

7017
02:01:11,440 --> 02:01:13,750
look at their phone and they take the

safe driver is two years without an
 

7033
02:01:28,320 --> 02:01:30,550
safe driver is two years without an
accident right because that means that

7034
02:01:30,550 --> 02:01:30,560
accident right because that means that
 

7035
02:01:30,560 --> 02:01:33,270
accident right because that means that
day after day hour after hour mile after

7036

day after day hour after hour mile after
 

7037
02:01:33,280 --> 02:01:36,709
day after day hour after hour mile after
mile you did the right thing right um

consistently over time kept yourself out
 

7045
02:01:42,159 --> 02:01:44,310
consistently over time kept yourself out
of accident situations and you can see

7046
02:01:44,310 --> 02:01:44,320
of accident situations and you can see
 

7047
02:01:44,320 --> 02:01:45,669
of accident situations and you can see
this with drivers who are you know a

7048
02:01:45,669 --> 02:01:45,679
this with drivers who are you know a
 

7049
02:01:45,679 --> 02:01:47,910
this with drivers who are you know a
million or two million safe miles

7050

the value of those drivers for walmart

7052
02:01:50,229 --> 02:01:50,239
the value of those drivers for walmart
 

7053
02:01:50,239 --> 02:01:52,550

over minivans on a regular basis so you
 

7059
02:01:57,599 --> 02:01:59,030
over minivans on a regular basis so you
know when i when i was trained they said

okay that's just part of the business
model now

7080
02:02:21,589 --> 02:02:21,599
model now
 

7081
02:02:21,599 --> 02:02:25,189
model now
um forward collision avoidance

7082
02:02:25,189 --> 02:02:25,199
um forward collision avoidance
 

7083
02:02:25,199 --> 02:02:26,629
um forward collision avoidance
can

7084
02:02:26,629 --> 02:02:26,639
can
 

7085
02:02:26,639 --> 02:02:28,790
can
you know basically eliminate the vast

7086
02:02:28,790 --> 02:02:28,800
you know basically eliminate the vast
 

7087
02:02:28,800 --> 02:02:30,870
you know basically eliminate the vast
majority of those accidents

7088

majority of those accidents
 

7089
02:02:30,880 --> 02:02:32,550
majority of those accidents
that's what the value of a really

7090
02:02:32,550 --> 02:02:32,560
that's what the value of a really
 

7091
02:02:32,560 --> 02:02:34,550
that's what the value of a really
expensive conscientious driver is based

automated collision avoidance systems
 

7115
02:02:55,119 --> 02:02:57,669
automated collision avoidance systems
are they good or bad for society

7116
02:02:57,669 --> 02:02:57,679
are they good or bad for society
 

7117

right they're good but
 

7125
02:03:04,159 --> 02:03:07,510
right they're good but
in uh what do we do about the pain

7126
02:03:07,510 --> 02:03:07,520
in uh what do we do about the pain
 

7127
02:03:07,520 --> 02:03:10,310
in uh what do we do about the pain
of a workforce in the short term

7128
02:03:10,310 --> 02:03:10,320
of a workforce in the short term
 

7129
02:03:10,320 --> 02:03:12,790
of a workforce in the short term
because their their wages are going to

7130
02:03:12,790 --> 02:03:12,800
because their their wages are going to
 

7131
02:03:12,800 --> 02:03:15,669
because their their wages are going to
go down because the job starts requiring

7132
02:03:15,669 --> 02:03:15,679
go down because the job starts requiring
 

7133
02:03:15,679 --> 02:03:18,390
go down because the job starts requiring
less and less skill

7134
02:03:18,390 --> 02:03:18,400
less and less skill
 

7135
02:03:18,400 --> 02:03:20,470
less and less skill
is is it is there a hopeful message here

7136
02:03:20,470 --> 02:03:20,480
is is it is there a hopeful message here
 

7137
02:03:20,480 --> 02:03:22,870
is is it is there a hopeful message here
where other jobs are created

7138
02:03:22,870 --> 02:03:22,880
where other jobs are created
 

7139

so i'm you know i'm a sociologist right

7140
02:03:24,870 --> 02:03:24,880
so i'm you know i'm a sociologist right
 

7141
02:03:24,880 --> 02:03:26,950
so i'm you know i'm a sociologist right
so you know so i'm going to think about

7142
02:03:26,950 --> 02:03:26,960
so you know so i'm going to think about
 

7143
02:03:26,960 --> 02:03:28,550
so you know so i'm going to think about
what's what's the structure behind that

7144
02:03:28,550 --> 02:03:28,560
what's what's the structure behind that
 

7145
02:03:28,560 --> 02:03:30,070
what's what's the structure behind that
that creates that pain

7146
02:03:30,070 --> 02:03:30,080
that creates that pain
 

7147
02:03:30,080 --> 02:03:31,669
that creates that pain
right and it's ownership

7148
02:03:31,669 --> 02:03:31,679
right and it's ownership
 

7149
02:03:31,679 --> 02:03:33,669
right and it's ownership
right um you know we don't call it

7150
02:03:33,669 --> 02:03:33,679
right um you know we don't call it
 

7151
02:03:33,679 --> 02:03:35,430
right um you know we don't call it
capitalism for nothing

7152
02:03:35,430 --> 02:03:35,440
capitalism for nothing
 

7153
02:03:35,440 --> 02:03:37,750
capitalism for nothing
you know what capitalists do is they

you know what capitalists do is they
 

7155
02:03:37,760 --> 02:03:39,990
you know what capitalists do is they
figure out cheaper more efficient ways

7156
02:03:39,990 --> 02:03:40,000
figure out cheaper more efficient ways
 

7157
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:41,990
figure out cheaper more efficient ways
to do stuff and they use technology to

7158
02:03:41,990 --> 02:03:42,000
to do stuff and they use technology to
 

7159
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,229
to do stuff and they use technology to
do that oftentimes right this is

7160
02:03:44,229 --> 02:03:44,239
do that oftentimes right this is
 

7161
02:03:44,239 --> 02:03:46,550
do that oftentimes right this is
the remarkable history of the last

7162
02:03:46,550 --> 02:03:46,560
the remarkable history of the last
 

7163
02:03:46,560 --> 02:03:48,229
the remarkable history of the last
couple centuries and and all the

couple centuries and and all the
 

7165
02:03:48,239 --> 02:03:50,310
couple centuries and and all the
productivity gains is

7166
02:03:50,310 --> 02:03:50,320
productivity gains is
 

7167

7181
02:04:05,679 --> 02:04:08,149
i don't have a choice i've got to invest
in this technology to you know make it

7182
02:04:08,149 --> 02:04:08,159
in this technology to you know make it
 

7183
02:04:08,159 --> 02:04:10,790
in this technology to you know make it
more more efficient to make it cheaper

7184
02:04:10,790 --> 02:04:10,800
more more efficient to make it cheaper
 

7185
02:04:10,800 --> 02:04:13,430
more more efficient to make it cheaper
and what do you look for you look for

7186
02:04:13,430 --> 02:04:13,440
and what do you look for you look for
 

7187
02:04:13,440 --> 02:04:15,669
and what do you look for you look for
oftentimes you look for labor costs

7188
02:04:15,669 --> 02:04:15,679
oftentimes you look for labor costs
 

7189
02:04:15,679 --> 02:04:17,589
oftentimes you look for labor costs
right you look for high value labor if i

7190
02:04:17,589 --> 02:04:17,599
right you look for high value labor if i
 

7191
02:04:17,599 --> 02:04:19,109
right you look for high value labor if i
can take a hundred and

7192
02:04:19,109 --> 02:04:19,119
can take a hundred and
 

7193
02:04:19,119 --> 02:04:20,149
can take a hundred and
you know these a lot of these truck

if i can replace them with a 35 000
worker when i'm competing with maybe a

7204
02:04:30,069 --> 02:04:30,079
worker when i'm competing with maybe a
 

7205
02:04:30,079 --> 02:04:32,950
worker when i'm competing with maybe a
low-wage retail employer rather than

7206
02:04:32,950 --> 02:04:32,960
low-wage retail employer rather than
 

7207
02:04:32,960 --> 02:04:35,189
low-wage retail employer rather than
some other more expensive employers for

7208
02:04:35,189 --> 02:04:35,199
some other more expensive employers for
 

7209
02:04:35,199 --> 02:04:37,589
some other more expensive employers for
you know skilled blue collar workers i'm

7210
02:04:37,589 --> 02:04:37,599
you know skilled blue collar workers i'm
 

7211
02:04:37,599 --> 02:04:38,950
you know skilled blue collar workers i'm
gonna do that

7212
02:04:38,950 --> 02:04:38,960
gonna do that
 

7213
02:04:38,960 --> 02:04:41,669
gonna do that
um and that's just that's what we do

7214
02:04:41,669 --> 02:04:41,679
um and that's just that's what we do
 

7215
02:04:41,679 --> 02:04:44,069
um and that's just that's what we do
and so i think

7216
02:04:44,069 --> 02:04:44,079
and so i think
 

7217
02:04:44,079 --> 02:04:45,589
and so i think
those those are the bigger questions

7218
02:04:45,589 --> 02:04:45,599
those those are the bigger questions
 

7219
02:04:45,599 --> 02:04:47,669
those those are the bigger questions
around this technology right is like

7220
02:04:47,669 --> 02:04:47,679
around this technology right is like
 

7221
02:04:47,679 --> 02:04:49,669
around this technology right is like
you know are workers gonna get screwed

7222
02:04:49,669 --> 02:04:49,679
you know are workers gonna get screwed
 

7223
02:04:49,679 --> 02:04:51,669
you know are workers gonna get screwed
by this like yeah most likely like

7224
02:04:51,669 --> 02:04:51,679
by this like yeah most likely like
 

7225
02:04:51,679 --> 02:04:53,910
by this like yeah most likely like
that's that's what we do

7226
02:04:53,910 --> 02:04:53,920
that's that's what we do
 

7227
02:04:53,920 --> 02:04:55,430
that's that's what we do
so one of the things you say is i mean

7228
02:04:55,430 --> 02:04:55,440
so one of the things you say is i mean
 

7229
02:04:55,440 --> 02:04:57,030
so one of the things you say is i mean
first of all the numbers of workers that

7230
02:04:57,030 --> 02:04:57,040
first of all the numbers of workers that
 

7231
02:04:57,040 --> 02:04:59,030
first of all the numbers of workers that
will be that will feel this pain is not

7232
02:04:59,030 --> 02:04:59,040
will be that will feel this pain is not
 

7233
02:04:59,040 --> 02:05:00,950
will be that will feel this pain is not
perhaps as large as the journalists kind

7234
02:05:00,950 --> 02:05:00,960
perhaps as large as the journalists kind
 

7235
02:05:00,960 --> 02:05:03,830
perhaps as large as the journalists kind
of articulate but nevertheless the pain

7236
02:05:03,830 --> 02:05:03,840
of articulate but nevertheless the pain
 

7237
02:05:03,840 --> 02:05:05,270
of articulate but nevertheless the pain
is real

7238
02:05:05,270 --> 02:05:05,280
is real
 

7239
02:05:05,280 --> 02:05:07,350
is real
and

7240
02:05:07,350 --> 02:05:07,360
and
 

7241
02:05:07,360 --> 02:05:08,709
and
i guess

7242
02:05:08,709 --> 02:05:08,719
i guess
 

7243
02:05:08,719 --> 02:05:11,350
i guess
my question here is um

7244
02:05:11,350 --> 02:05:11,360
my question here is um
 

7245
02:05:11,360 --> 02:05:12,950
my question here is um
do you have an optimistic vision about

7246
02:05:12,950 --> 02:05:12,960
do you have an optimistic vision about
 

7247
02:05:12,960 --> 02:05:14,950
do you have an optimistic vision about
the transformative effects of autonomous

7248
02:05:14,950 --> 02:05:14,960
the transformative effects of autonomous
 

7249
02:05:14,960 --> 02:05:17,270
the transformative effects of autonomous
trucks on society

7250
02:05:17,270 --> 02:05:17,280
trucks on society
 

7251
02:05:17,280 --> 02:05:18,550
trucks on society
like

7252
02:05:18,550 --> 02:05:18,560
like
 

7253
02:05:18,560 --> 02:05:21,270
like
if you look 20 years from now

7254
02:05:21,270 --> 02:05:21,280
if you look 20 years from now
 

7255
02:05:21,280 --> 02:05:22,950
if you look 20 years from now
and perhaps see

7256
02:05:22,950 --> 02:05:22,960
and perhaps see
 

7257
02:05:22,960 --> 02:05:25,109
and perhaps see
maybe 30 years from now perhaps see

7258
02:05:25,109 --> 02:05:25,119
maybe 30 years from now perhaps see
 

7259
02:05:25,119 --> 02:05:26,950
maybe 30 years from now perhaps see
these autonomous trucks doing the

7260
02:05:26,950 --> 02:05:26,960
these autonomous trucks doing the
 

7261
02:05:26,960 --> 02:05:27,990
these autonomous trucks doing the
various

7262
02:05:27,990 --> 02:05:28,000
various
 

7263

02:05:30,310 --> 02:05:30,320
parts of the scenarios you listed and
 

7265
02:05:30,320 --> 02:05:32,470
parts of the scenarios you listed and
there's just hundreds of thousands of

on the interstate system
 

7275
02:05:41,760 --> 02:05:43,589
on the interstate system
um

7276
02:05:43,589 --> 02:05:43,599
um
 

7277
02:05:43,599 --> 02:05:45,669
um
what kind of world do you see that's a

7278
02:05:45,669 --> 02:05:45,679
what kind of world do you see that's a
 

7279
02:05:45,679 --> 02:05:47,430
what kind of world do you see that's a
better world than today that involves

7280
02:05:47,430 --> 02:05:47,440
better world than today that involves
 

7281
02:05:47,440 --> 02:05:50,550

his trucks yeah um can i defend myself

7282
02:05:50,550 --> 02:05:50,560
his trucks yeah um can i defend myself
 

7283
02:05:50,560 --> 02:05:52,149

you're a commenter

7290
02:05:57,430 --> 02:05:57,440
you're a commenter
 

7291
02:05:57,440 --> 02:06:01,830
you're a commenter
dear phd economics yes um yes d dear phd

dear phd economics yes um yes d dear phd
 

7293
02:06:01,840 --> 02:06:04,390
dear phd economics yes um yes d dear phd
in economics i know that that higher

7294
02:06:04,390 --> 02:06:04,400
in economics i know that that higher
 

7295
02:06:04,400 --> 02:06:07,510
in economics i know that that higher
skilled jobs are created you know by by

7296
02:06:07,510 --> 02:06:07,520
skilled jobs are created you know by by
 

7297
02:06:07,520 --> 02:06:09,109
skilled jobs are created you know by by
technological advancement right i mean

7298
02:06:09,109 --> 02:06:09,119
technological advancement right i mean
 

7299
02:06:09,119 --> 02:06:11,030
technological advancement right i mean
there are big questions about how many

7300
02:06:11,030 --> 02:06:11,040
there are big questions about how many
 

7301
02:06:11,040 --> 02:06:13,510
there are big questions about how many
of them right so the idea that we would

7302
02:06:13,510 --> 02:06:13,520
of them right so the idea that we would
 

7303
02:06:13,520 --> 02:06:15,030
of them right so the idea that we would
create more

7304
02:06:15,030 --> 02:06:15,040
create more
 

7305
02:06:15,040 --> 02:06:18,229
create more
um ex you know expensive labor

7306
02:06:18,229 --> 02:06:18,239
um ex you know expensive labor
 

7307
02:06:18,239 --> 02:06:20,390
um ex you know expensive labor
positions right with a new technology

7308
02:06:20,390 --> 02:06:20,400
positions right with a new technology
 

7309
02:06:20,400 --> 02:06:21,910
positions right with a new technology
right you better check your business

7310
02:06:21,910 --> 02:06:21,920
right you better check your business
 

7311
02:06:21,920 --> 02:06:24,229
right you better check your business
plan if your idea is to take you know a

7312
02:06:24,229 --> 02:06:24,239
plan if your idea is to take you know a
 

7313
02:06:24,239 --> 02:06:26,470
plan if your idea is to take you know a
bunch of low um low wage labor and

7314
02:06:26,470 --> 02:06:26,480
bunch of low um low wage labor and
 

7315
02:06:26,480 --> 02:06:28,229
bunch of low um low wage labor and
replace it with the same amount of high

7316
02:06:28,229 --> 02:06:28,239
replace it with the same amount of high
 

7317
02:06:28,239 --> 02:06:29,669
replace it with the same amount of high
wage labor right so we there's a

7318
02:06:29,669 --> 02:06:29,679
wage labor right so we there's a
 

7319
02:06:29,679 --> 02:06:31,669
wage labor right so we there's a
question about how many of those jobs

7320
02:06:31,669 --> 02:06:31,679
question about how many of those jobs
 

7321
02:06:31,679 --> 02:06:33,990
question about how many of those jobs
and there's the really important social

7322
02:06:33,990 --> 02:06:34,000
and there's the really important social
 

7323
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:36,310
and there's the really important social
and political question of

7324
02:06:36,310 --> 02:06:36,320
and political question of
 

7325
02:06:36,320 --> 02:06:38,310
and political question of
are they the same people right and do

7326
02:06:38,310 --> 02:06:38,320
are they the same people right and do
 

7327
02:06:38,320 --> 02:06:40,069
are they the same people right and do
they live in the same places and i think

7328
02:06:40,069 --> 02:06:40,079
they live in the same places and i think
 

7329
02:06:40,079 --> 02:06:42,709
they live in the same places and i think
that kind of you know geography is a

7330
02:06:42,709 --> 02:06:42,719
that kind of you know geography is a
 

7331
02:06:42,719 --> 02:06:45,430
that kind of you know geography is a
huge issue here with the impacts right

7332
02:06:45,430 --> 02:06:45,440
huge issue here with the impacts right
 

7333
02:06:45,440 --> 02:06:47,990
huge issue here with the impacts right
lots of rural workers um interesting

7334
02:06:47,990 --> 02:06:48,000
lots of rural workers um interesting
 

7335
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:49,669
lots of rural workers um interesting
politically lots of red state workers

7336
02:06:49,669 --> 02:06:49,679
politically lots of red state workers
 

7337
02:06:49,679 --> 02:06:51,589
politically lots of red state workers
right lots of blue state maybe union

tragically flawed the field is not
 

7379
02:07:33,440 --> 02:07:35,270
tragically flawed the field is not
because of lack of trying but just how

difficult the problems are you had to do
 

7383
02:07:37,920 --> 02:07:40,390

7457
02:08:57,280 --> 02:08:59,350
construction job to just aging right
so what you know what can we do right

7458
02:08:59,350 --> 02:08:59,360
so what you know what can we do right
 

7459
02:08:59,360 --> 02:09:01,030
so what you know what can we do right
what's sort of the positive vision

7460
02:09:01,030 --> 02:09:01,040
what's sort of the positive vision
 

7461
02:09:01,040 --> 02:09:02,149
what's sort of the positive vision
because

7462
02:09:02,149 --> 02:09:02,159
because
 

7463
02:09:02,159 --> 02:09:04,069
because
like we've got tons of highway deaths

7464
02:09:04,069 --> 02:09:04,079
like we've got tons of highway deaths
 

7465
02:09:04,079 --> 02:09:07,030
like we've got tons of highway deaths
we've got um and just to you know

7466
02:09:07,030 --> 02:09:07,040
we've got um and just to you know
 

7467
02:09:07,040 --> 02:09:08,470
we've got um and just to you know
the big picture

7468
02:09:08,470 --> 02:09:08,480
the big picture
 

7469
02:09:08,480 --> 02:09:10,629
the big picture
is and this is the opportunity i guess

7470
02:09:10,629 --> 02:09:10,639
is and this is the opportunity i guess
 

7471
02:09:10,639 --> 02:09:12,870
is and this is the opportunity i guess
for investors um

7472
02:09:12,870 --> 02:09:12,880
for investors um
 

7473
02:09:12,880 --> 02:09:15,510
for investors um
it's a hugely inefficient system

7474
02:09:15,510 --> 02:09:15,520
it's a hugely inefficient system
 

7475
02:09:15,520 --> 02:09:17,589
it's a hugely inefficient system
so we buy this truck there's this

7476
02:09:17,589 --> 02:09:17,599
so we buy this truck there's this
 

7477
02:09:17,599 --> 02:09:19,830
so we buy this truck there's this
low-wage worker in it oftentimes and

7478
02:09:19,830 --> 02:09:19,840
low-wage worker in it oftentimes and
 

7479
02:09:19,840 --> 02:09:21,270
low-wage worker in it oftentimes and
again i'm setting aside those really

7480
02:09:21,270 --> 02:09:21,280
again i'm setting aside those really
 

7481
02:09:21,280 --> 02:09:23,430
again i'm setting aside those really
good line haul jobs in ltl those are

7482
02:09:23,430 --> 02:09:23,440
good line haul jobs in ltl those are
 

7483
02:09:23,440 --> 02:09:26,069
good line haul jobs in ltl those are
those are a different case um

7484
02:09:26,069 --> 02:09:26,079
those are a different case um
 

7485
02:09:26,079 --> 02:09:28,550
those are a different case um
that low-wage worker is driving a truck

7486
02:09:28,550 --> 02:09:28,560
that low-wage worker is driving a truck
 

7487
02:09:28,560 --> 02:09:31,109
that low-wage worker is driving a truck
that they they might the wheels might

7488
02:09:31,109 --> 02:09:31,119
that they they might the wheels might
 

7489
02:09:31,119 --> 02:09:32,550
that they they might the wheels might
roll seven to eight hours a day that's

7490
02:09:32,550 --> 02:09:32,560
roll seven to eight hours a day that's
 

7491
02:09:32,560 --> 02:09:33,910
roll seven to eight hours a day that's
what the truck is designed to do and

7492
02:09:33,910 --> 02:09:33,920
what the truck is designed to do and
 

7493
02:09:33,920 --> 02:09:35,030
what the truck is designed to do and
that's what makes the money for the

7494
02:09:35,030 --> 02:09:35,040
that's what makes the money for the
 

7495
02:09:35,040 --> 02:09:36,149
that's what makes the money for the
company

7496
02:09:36,149 --> 02:09:36,159
company
 

7497
02:09:36,159 --> 02:09:37,990
company
in other seven eight hours a day the

7498
02:09:37,990 --> 02:09:38,000
in other seven eight hours a day the
 

7499
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:40,310
in other seven eight hours a day the
driver's doing other kinds of work that

7500
02:09:40,310 --> 02:09:40,320
driver's doing other kinds of work that
 

7501
02:09:40,320 --> 02:09:42,149
driver's doing other kinds of work that
you know is not driving and then the

7502
02:09:42,149 --> 02:09:42,159
you know is not driving and then the
 

7503
02:09:42,159 --> 02:09:43,750
you know is not driving and then the
rest of the day they're basically living

7504
02:09:43,750 --> 02:09:43,760
rest of the day they're basically living
 

7505
02:09:43,760 --> 02:09:44,950
rest of the day they're basically living
out of the truck

7506
02:09:44,950 --> 02:09:44,960
out of the truck
 

7507
02:09:44,960 --> 02:09:46,870
out of the truck
like you really can't find a more

7508
02:09:46,870 --> 02:09:46,880
like you really can't find a more
 

7509
02:09:46,880 --> 02:09:49,750
like you really can't find a more
inefficient use of an asset than than

7510
02:09:49,750 --> 02:09:49,760
inefficient use of an asset than than
 

7511
02:09:49,760 --> 02:09:50,950
inefficient use of an asset than than
that right

7512
02:09:50,950 --> 02:09:50,960
that right
 

7513
02:09:50,960 --> 02:09:52,470
that right
now a big part of that is we pay for the

7514
02:09:52,470 --> 02:09:52,480
now a big part of that is we pay for the
 

7515
02:09:52,480 --> 02:09:54,550
now a big part of that is we pay for the
roads and we pay for the rest areas and

7516
02:09:54,550 --> 02:09:54,560
roads and we pay for the rest areas and
 

7517
02:09:54,560 --> 02:09:56,390
roads and we pay for the rest areas and
all that all this other stuff so

7518
02:09:56,390 --> 02:09:56,400
all that all this other stuff so
 

7519
02:09:56,400 --> 02:09:58,390
all that all this other stuff so
so the way that i work and the way that

7520
02:09:58,390 --> 02:09:58,400
so the way that i work and the way that
 

7521
02:09:58,400 --> 02:09:59,830
so the way that i work and the way that
you know i think about these problems is

7522
02:09:59,830 --> 02:09:59,840
you know i think about these problems is
 

7523
02:09:59,840 --> 02:10:01,510
you know i think about these problems is
i try to find analogies right sort of

7524
02:10:01,510 --> 02:10:01,520
i try to find analogies right sort of
 

7525
02:10:01,520 --> 02:10:03,430
i try to find analogies right sort of
labor processes and things that that

7526
02:10:03,430 --> 02:10:03,440
labor processes and things that that
 

7527
02:10:03,440 --> 02:10:06,149
labor processes and things that that
make economic sense you know that

7528
02:10:06,149 --> 02:10:06,159
make economic sense you know that
 

7529
02:10:06,159 --> 02:10:08,709
make economic sense you know that
that seem you know in in this in the

7530
02:10:08,709 --> 02:10:08,719
that seem you know in in this in the
 

7531
02:10:08,719 --> 02:10:11,990
that seem you know in in this in the
same area of of the economy but have

7532
02:10:11,990 --> 02:10:12,000
same area of of the economy but have
 

7533
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:13,910
same area of of the economy but have
some some different characteristics for

7534
02:10:13,910 --> 02:10:13,920
some some different characteristics for
 

7535
02:10:13,920 --> 02:10:16,229
some some different characteristics for
for workers right and and sort of try to

7536
02:10:16,229 --> 02:10:16,239
for workers right and and sort of try to
 

7537
02:10:16,239 --> 02:10:18,149
for workers right and and sort of try to
figure out why does the economics work

7538
02:10:18,149 --> 02:10:18,159
figure out why does the economics work
 

7539
02:10:18,159 --> 02:10:19,189
figure out why does the economics work
there

7540
02:10:19,189 --> 02:10:19,199
there
 

7541
02:10:19,199 --> 02:10:20,550
there
right and so

7542
02:10:20,550 --> 02:10:20,560
right and so
 

7543
02:10:20,560 --> 02:10:23,109
right and so
if you look at those really good

7544
02:10:23,109 --> 02:10:23,119
if you look at those really good
 

7545
02:10:23,119 --> 02:10:24,629
if you look at those really good
jobs

7546
02:10:24,629 --> 02:10:24,639
jobs
 

7547
02:10:24,639 --> 02:10:27,030
jobs
the mo the most likely way that you as a

7548
02:10:27,030 --> 02:10:27,040
the mo the most likely way that you as a
 

7549
02:10:27,040 --> 02:10:29,430
the mo the most likely way that you as a
as a passenger car driver would know

7550
02:10:29,430 --> 02:10:29,440
as a passenger car driver would know
 

7551
02:10:29,440 --> 02:10:30,950
as a passenger car driver would know
that it's one of those drivers is that

7552
02:10:30,950 --> 02:10:30,960
that it's one of those drivers is that
 

7553
02:10:30,960 --> 02:10:32,709
that it's one of those drivers is that
they're multiple trailers

7554
02:10:32,709 --> 02:10:32,719
they're multiple trailers
 

7555
02:10:32,719 --> 02:10:34,470
they're multiple trailers
right so you see these like maybe maybe

7556
02:10:34,470 --> 02:10:34,480
right so you see these like maybe maybe
 

7557
02:10:34,480 --> 02:10:36,390
right so you see these like maybe maybe
it's three small trailers maybe it's two

7558
02:10:36,390 --> 02:10:36,400
it's three small trailers maybe it's two
 

7559
02:10:36,400 --> 02:10:38,069
it's three small trailers maybe it's two
sort of medium-sized trailers some

7560
02:10:38,069 --> 02:10:38,079
sort of medium-sized trailers some
 

7561
02:10:38,079 --> 02:10:39,669
sort of medium-sized trailers some
places you might even see two really big

7562
02:10:39,669 --> 02:10:39,679
places you might even see two really big
 

7563
02:10:39,679 --> 02:10:42,149
places you might even see two really big
trailers together

7564
02:10:42,149 --> 02:10:42,159
trailers together
 

7565
02:10:42,159 --> 02:10:44,069
trailers together
you do that because labor's expensive

7566
02:10:44,069 --> 02:10:44,079
you do that because labor's expensive
 

7567
02:10:44,079 --> 02:10:46,229
you do that because labor's expensive
right and it's highly skilled and so you

7568
02:10:46,229 --> 02:10:46,239
right and it's highly skilled and so you
 

7569
02:10:46,239 --> 02:10:48,310
right and it's highly skilled and so you
use it efficiently and you say all right

7570
02:10:48,310 --> 02:10:48,320
use it efficiently and you say all right
 

7571
02:10:48,320 --> 02:10:50,149
use it efficiently and you say all right
you know rather than having you you know

7572
02:10:50,149 --> 02:10:50,159
you know rather than having you you know
 

7573
02:10:50,159 --> 02:10:51,589
you know rather than having you you know
haul that little trailer out of the

7574
02:10:51,589 --> 02:10:51,599
haul that little trailer out of the
 

7575
02:10:51,599 --> 02:10:53,189
haul that little trailer out of the
ports you know that sort of half size

7576
02:10:53,189 --> 02:10:53,199
ports you know that sort of half size
 

7577
02:10:53,199 --> 02:10:54,550
ports you know that sort of half size
container we're going to wait till we

7578
02:10:54,550 --> 02:10:54,560
container we're going to wait till we
 

7579
02:10:54,560 --> 02:10:56,069
container we're going to wait till we
get three or we're gonna coordinate the

7580
02:10:56,069 --> 02:10:56,079
get three or we're gonna coordinate the
 

7581
02:10:56,079 --> 02:10:57,830
get three or we're gonna coordinate the
movement so that they're three ready you

7582
02:10:57,830 --> 02:10:57,840
movement so that they're three ready you
 

7583
02:10:57,840 --> 02:11:00,470
movement so that they're three ready you
go do what truckers call make a set you

7584
02:11:00,470 --> 02:11:00,480
go do what truckers call make a set you
 

7585
02:11:00,480 --> 02:11:02,629
go do what truckers call make a set you
put them together right and you and you

7586
02:11:02,629 --> 02:11:02,639
put them together right and you and you
 

7587
02:11:02,639 --> 02:11:05,669
put them together right and you and you
go um that's a massive productivity gain

7588
02:11:05,669 --> 02:11:05,679
go um that's a massive productivity gain
 

7589
02:11:05,679 --> 02:11:07,669
go um that's a massive productivity gain
right because you know you're hauling

7590
02:11:07,669 --> 02:11:07,679
right because you know you're hauling
 

7591
02:11:07,679 --> 02:11:10,550
right because you know you're hauling
two three times as much freight so the

7592
02:11:10,550 --> 02:11:10,560
two three times as much freight so the
 

7593
02:11:10,560 --> 02:11:12,149
two three times as much freight so the
the positive scenario that i threw out

7594
02:11:12,149 --> 02:11:12,159
the positive scenario that i threw out
 

7595
02:11:12,159 --> 02:11:13,830
the positive scenario that i threw out
in in 2018

7596
02:11:13,830 --> 02:11:13,840
in in 2018
 

7597
02:11:13,840 --> 02:11:16,709
in in 2018
was why not have

7598
02:11:16,709 --> 02:11:16,719
was why not have
 

7599
02:11:16,719 --> 02:11:18,629
was why not have
a human-driven truck

7600
02:11:18,629 --> 02:11:18,639
a human-driven truck
 

7601
02:11:18,639 --> 02:11:20,229
a human-driven truck
with a self-driving truck that follows

7602
02:11:20,229 --> 02:11:20,239
with a self-driving truck that follows
 

7603
02:11:20,239 --> 02:11:23,109
with a self-driving truck that follows
it right just a drone unit um

7604
02:11:23,109 --> 02:11:23,119
it right just a drone unit um
 

7605
02:11:23,119 --> 02:11:24,709
it right just a drone unit um
and

7606
02:11:24,709 --> 02:11:24,719
and
 

7607
02:11:24,719 --> 02:11:26,229
and
it was you know

7608
02:11:26,229 --> 02:11:26,239
it was you know
 

7609
02:11:26,239 --> 02:11:28,069
it was you know
to me this seemed as a you know

7610
02:11:28,069 --> 02:11:28,079
to me this seemed as a you know
 

7611
02:11:28,079 --> 02:11:30,550
to me this seemed as a you know
non-computer scientist as a sociologist

7612
02:11:30,550 --> 02:11:30,560
non-computer scientist as a sociologist
 

7613
02:11:30,560 --> 02:11:32,390
non-computer scientist as a sociologist
right this made a lot of sense because

7614
02:11:32,390 --> 02:11:32,400
right this made a lot of sense because
 

7615
02:11:32,400 --> 02:11:34,390
right this made a lot of sense because
when i got done talking to the you know

7616
02:11:34,390 --> 02:11:34,400
when i got done talking to the you know
 

7617
02:11:34,400 --> 02:11:36,069
when i got done talking to the you know
the computer scientists and and the

7618
02:11:36,069 --> 02:11:36,079
the computer scientists and and the
 

7619
02:11:36,079 --> 02:11:37,350
the computer scientists and and the
engineers they were like well you know

7620
02:11:37,350 --> 02:11:37,360
engineers they were like well you know
 

7621
02:11:37,360 --> 02:11:39,109
engineers they were like well you know
it's like object recognition decision

7622
02:11:39,109 --> 02:11:39,119
it's like object recognition decision
 

7623
02:11:39,119 --> 02:11:40,709
it's like object recognition decision
making algorithm all this stuff it's

7624
02:11:40,709 --> 02:11:40,719
making algorithm all this stuff it's
 

7625
02:11:40,719 --> 02:11:43,189
making algorithm all this stuff it's
like all right so why don't you leave

7626
02:11:43,189 --> 02:11:43,199
like all right so why don't you leave
 

7627
02:11:43,199 --> 02:11:44,629
like all right so why don't you leave
the human brain

7628
02:11:44,629 --> 02:11:44,639
the human brain
 

7629
02:11:44,639 --> 02:11:45,750
the human brain
in the lead

7630
02:11:45,750 --> 02:11:45,760
in the lead
 

7631
02:11:45,760 --> 02:11:47,430
in the lead
vehicle right you got all that

7632
02:11:47,430 --> 02:11:47,440
vehicle right you got all that
 

7633
02:11:47,440 --> 02:11:49,189
vehicle right you got all that
processing and then

7634
02:11:49,189 --> 02:11:49,199
processing and then
 

7635
02:11:49,199 --> 02:11:51,030
processing and then
all that following now again this is

7636
02:11:51,030 --> 02:11:51,040
all that following now again this is
 

7637
02:11:51,040 --> 02:11:54,229
all that following now again this is
sort of me being a um a lay person you

7638
02:11:54,229 --> 02:11:54,239
sort of me being a um a lay person you
 

7639
02:11:54,239 --> 02:11:55,910
sort of me being a um a lay person you
know i said why don't you know then that

7640
02:11:55,910 --> 02:11:55,920
know i said why don't you know then that
 

7641
02:11:55,920 --> 02:11:57,589
know i said why don't you know then that
following truck right takes direction

7642
02:11:57,589 --> 02:11:57,599
following truck right takes direction
 

7643
02:11:57,599 --> 02:11:59,189
following truck right takes direction
from the front it uses the rear of the

7644
02:11:59,189 --> 02:11:59,199
from the front it uses the rear of the
 

7645
02:11:59,199 --> 02:12:01,030
from the front it uses the rear of the
trailer as a reference point it

7646
02:12:01,030 --> 02:12:01,040
trailer as a reference point it
 

7647
02:12:01,040 --> 02:12:02,470
trailer as a reference point it
maintains the lane you've got

7648
02:12:02,470 --> 02:12:02,480
maintains the lane you've got
 

7649
02:12:02,480 --> 02:12:05,910
maintains the lane you've got
cooperative adaptive cruise control and

7650
02:12:05,910 --> 02:12:05,920
cooperative adaptive cruise control and
 

7651
02:12:05,920 --> 02:12:07,669
cooperative adaptive cruise control and
that you double the productivity of that

7652
02:12:07,669 --> 02:12:07,679
that you double the productivity of that
 

7653
02:12:07,679 --> 02:12:10,229
that you double the productivity of that
driver you solved that problem that i

7654
02:12:10,229 --> 02:12:10,239
driver you solved that problem that i
 

7655
02:12:10,239 --> 02:12:13,109
driver you solved that problem that i

bridges you know the the two trucks can
 

7663
02:12:18,960 --> 02:12:20,470
bridges you know the the two trucks can
just spread out just enough to make the

7664
02:12:20,470 --> 02:12:20,480
just spread out just enough to make the
 

7665
02:12:20,480 --> 02:12:21,750
just spread out just enough to make the
bridge weight right and you can just

7666
02:12:21,750 --> 02:12:21,760
bridge weight right and you can just
 

7667
02:12:21,760 --> 02:12:23,589
bridge weight right and you can just
program that in and you know they're 50

7668
02:12:23,589 --> 02:12:23,599
program that in and you know they're 50
 

7669

further apart um
 

7673
02:12:28,239 --> 02:12:31,430
further apart um
so interesting sort of i think uh

7674
02:12:31,430 --> 02:12:31,440
so interesting sort of i think uh
 

7675
02:12:31,440 --> 02:12:33,350
so interesting sort of i think uh
story about this that that leads to kind

7677
02:12:33,360 --> 02:12:36,550
story about this that that leads to kind
of i think the policy questions

7678
02:12:36,550 --> 02:12:36,560
of i think the policy questions
 

7679
02:12:36,560 --> 02:12:37,669
of i think the policy questions
in

7680
02:12:37,669 --> 02:12:37,679
in
 

7681
02:12:37,679 --> 02:12:42,069
in
i guess 2017 jack reed and susan collins

7682
02:12:42,069 --> 02:12:42,079
i guess 2017 jack reed and susan collins
 

7683
02:12:42,079 --> 02:12:44,310

02:12:46,480 --> 02:12:47,990
the senate requested research on what
the impacts of self-driving trucks would

7688
02:12:47,990 --> 02:12:48,000
the impacts of self-driving trucks would
 

7689
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:50,790
the impacts of self-driving trucks would
be and the first stage of that was for

7690
02:12:50,790 --> 02:12:50,800
be and the first stage of that was for
 

7691
02:12:50,800 --> 02:12:53,990
be and the first stage of that was for
the gao to um

and
 

7703
02:13:07,119 --> 02:13:08,790
and
you know i had the six scenarios right

7704
02:13:08,790 --> 02:13:08,800
you know i had the six scenarios right
 

7705
02:13:08,800 --> 02:13:10,310
you know i had the six scenarios right
i'm like okay you know here's here's

7706
02:13:10,310 --> 02:13:10,320
i'm like okay you know here's here's
 

7707
02:13:10,320 --> 02:13:12,310
i'm like okay you know here's here's
what starsky's doing you know here's

7708
02:13:12,310 --> 02:13:12,320
what starsky's doing you know here's
 

7709
02:13:12,320 --> 02:13:15,189
what starsky's doing you know here's
what embark and and uber are doing you

7710
02:13:15,189 --> 02:13:15,199
what embark and and uber are doing you
 

7711
02:13:15,199 --> 02:13:18,390
what embark and and uber are doing you
know here's what waymo might be doing no

7712
02:13:18,390 --> 02:13:18,400
know here's what waymo might be doing no
 

7713
02:13:18,400 --> 02:13:20,950
know here's what waymo might be doing no
nobody really knows right um here's what

7714
02:13:20,950 --> 02:13:20,960
nobody really knows right um here's what
 

7715
02:13:20,960 --> 02:13:22,470
nobody really knows right um here's what
peloton's doing

7716
02:13:22,470 --> 02:13:22,480
peloton's doing
 

7717
02:13:22,480 --> 02:13:24,229
peloton's doing
um you know here's the autopilot

7718
02:13:24,229 --> 02:13:24,239
um you know here's the autopilot
 

7719
02:13:24,239 --> 02:13:26,470
um you know here's the autopilot
scenario and then here's this one that i

7720
02:13:26,470 --> 02:13:26,480
scenario and then here's this one that i
 

7721
02:13:26,480 --> 02:13:27,189
scenario and then here's this one that i
think

7722
02:13:27,189 --> 02:13:27,199
think
 

7723
02:13:27,199 --> 02:13:29,589
think
actually could be good for drivers so

7724
02:13:29,589 --> 02:13:29,599
actually could be good for drivers so
 

7725
02:13:29,599 --> 02:13:32,390
actually could be good for drivers so
now you've got that driver who's got two

7726
02:13:32,390 --> 02:13:32,400
now you've got that driver who's got two
 

7727
02:13:32,400 --> 02:13:34,069
now you've got that driver who's got two
you know two times the freight

7728
02:13:34,069 --> 02:13:34,079
you know two times the freight
 

7729
02:13:34,079 --> 02:13:35,589
you know two times the freight
um their decisions are more important

7730
02:13:35,589 --> 02:13:35,599
um their decisions are more important
 

7731
02:13:35,599 --> 02:13:37,350
um their decisions are more important
they're managing a more complex system

7732
02:13:37,350 --> 02:13:37,360
they're managing a more complex system
 

7733
02:13:37,360 --> 02:13:38,390
they're managing a more complex system
right they're probably gonna have to

7734
02:13:38,390 --> 02:13:38,400
right they're probably gonna have to
 

7735
02:13:38,400 --> 02:13:40,310
right they're probably gonna have to
have some global understanding of how to

7736
02:13:40,310 --> 02:13:40,320
have some global understanding of how to
 

7737
02:13:40,320 --> 02:13:41,430
have some global understanding of how to
you know the environments in which you

7738
02:13:41,430 --> 02:13:41,440
you know the environments in which you
 

7739
02:13:41,440 --> 02:13:42,709
you know the environments in which you
can operate safely right now we're

7740
02:13:42,709 --> 02:13:42,719
can operate safely right now we're
 

7741
02:13:42,719 --> 02:13:45,990
can operate safely right now we're
talking upskilling right

7742
02:13:45,990 --> 02:13:46,000
talking upskilling right
 

7743
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:46,950
talking upskilling right
and so

7744
02:13:46,950 --> 02:13:46,960
and so
 

7745
02:13:46,960 --> 02:13:47,750
and so
you know

7746
02:13:47,750 --> 02:13:47,760
you know
 

7747
02:13:47,760 --> 02:13:50,069
you know
that um the gao

7748
02:13:50,069 --> 02:13:50,079
that um the gao
 

7749
02:13:50,079 --> 02:13:51,270
that um the gao
you know sort of writes up these

7750
02:13:51,270 --> 02:13:51,280
you know sort of writes up these
 

7751
02:13:51,280 --> 02:13:53,350
you know sort of writes up these
different scenarios and and the idea is

7752
02:13:53,350 --> 02:13:53,360
different scenarios and and the idea is
 

7753
02:13:53,360 --> 02:13:54,709
different scenarios and and the idea is
that it's going to prepare for this

7754
02:13:54,709 --> 02:13:54,719
that it's going to prepare for this
 

7755
02:13:54,719 --> 02:13:56,390
that it's going to prepare for this
department of transportation department

7756
02:13:56,390 --> 02:13:56,400
department of transportation department
 

7757
02:13:56,400 --> 02:13:57,510
department of transportation department
of labor

7758
02:13:57,510 --> 02:13:57,520
of labor
 

7759
02:13:57,520 --> 02:14:00,629
of labor
set of processes to engage stakeholders

7760
02:14:00,629 --> 02:14:00,639
set of processes to engage stakeholders
 

7761
02:14:00,639 --> 02:14:02,709
set of processes to engage stakeholders
and um

7762
02:14:02,709 --> 02:14:02,719
and um
 

7763
02:14:02,719 --> 02:14:04,550
and um
and sort of get you know get industry

7764
02:14:04,550 --> 02:14:04,560
and sort of get you know get industry
 

7765
02:14:04,560 --> 02:14:06,310
and sort of get you know get industry
perspectives and then do a study on the

7766
02:14:06,310 --> 02:14:06,320
perspectives and then do a study on the
 

7767
02:14:06,320 --> 02:14:07,669
perspectives and then do a study on the
labor impacts

7768
02:14:07,669 --> 02:14:07,679
labor impacts
 

7769
02:14:07,679 --> 02:14:08,870
labor impacts
so

7770
02:14:08,870 --> 02:14:08,880
so
 

7771
02:14:08,880 --> 02:14:10,629
so
you know that dot

7772
02:14:10,629 --> 02:14:10,639
you know that dot
 

7773
02:14:10,639 --> 02:14:14,149
you know that dot
dol process starts to happen and

7774
02:14:14,149 --> 02:14:14,159
dol process starts to happen and
 

7775
02:14:14,159 --> 02:14:14,950
dol process starts to happen and
you know

7776
02:14:14,950 --> 02:14:14,960
you know
 

7777
02:14:14,960 --> 02:14:16,950
you know
i get to the workshop

7778
02:14:16,950 --> 02:14:16,960
i get to the workshop
 

7779
02:14:16,960 --> 02:14:18,950
i get to the workshop
and a friend was sitting at the table

7780
02:14:18,950 --> 02:14:18,960
and a friend was sitting at the table
 

7781
02:14:18,960 --> 02:14:20,229
and a friend was sitting at the table
next to me

7782
02:14:20,229 --> 02:14:20,239
next to me
 

7783
02:14:20,239 --> 02:14:23,109
next to me
and he holds up the the scenarios that

7784
02:14:23,109 --> 02:14:23,119
and he holds up the the scenarios that
 

7785
02:14:23,119 --> 02:14:24,550
and he holds up the the scenarios that
that they're going to have us discuss at

7786
02:14:24,550 --> 02:14:24,560
that they're going to have us discuss at
 

7787
02:14:24,560 --> 02:14:25,990
that they're going to have us discuss at
this workshop and he's like hey these

7788
02:14:25,990 --> 02:14:26,000
this workshop and he's like hey these
 

7789
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:28,229
this workshop and he's like hey these
look really familiar right because they

7790
02:14:28,229 --> 02:14:28,239
look really familiar right because they
 

7791
02:14:28,239 --> 02:14:30,310
look really familiar right because they
were the you know scenarios from from

7792
02:14:30,310 --> 02:14:30,320
were the you know scenarios from from
 

7793
02:14:30,320 --> 02:14:32,790
were the you know scenarios from from
the report but there were only five

7794
02:14:32,790 --> 02:14:32,800
the report but there were only five
 

7795
02:14:32,800 --> 02:14:35,030
the report but there were only five
instead of six interesting

7796
02:14:35,030 --> 02:14:35,040
instead of six interesting
 

7797
02:14:35,040 --> 02:14:37,030
instead of six interesting
the sixth scenario which was the

7798
02:14:37,030 --> 02:14:37,040
the sixth scenario which was the
 

7799
02:14:37,040 --> 02:14:38,870
the sixth scenario which was the
upskilling labor good for good for

7800
02:14:38,870 --> 02:14:38,880
upskilling labor good for good for
 

7801
02:14:38,880 --> 02:14:40,950
upskilling labor good for good for
worker scenario

7802
02:14:40,950 --> 02:14:40,960
worker scenario
 

7803
02:14:40,960 --> 02:14:43,350
worker scenario
wasn't wasn't discussed so to clarify

7804
02:14:43,350 --> 02:14:43,360
wasn't wasn't discussed so to clarify
 

7805
02:14:43,360 --> 02:14:45,589
wasn't wasn't discussed so to clarify
that the integral piece of technology

7806
02:14:45,589 --> 02:14:45,599
that the integral piece of technology
 

7807
02:14:45,599 --> 02:14:47,350
that the integral piece of technology
there is platooning

7808
02:14:47,350 --> 02:14:47,360
there is platooning
 

7809
02:14:47,360 --> 02:14:48,950
there is platooning
yeah i mean in a sense it's it's

7810
02:14:48,950 --> 02:14:48,960
yeah i mean in a sense it's it's
 

7811
02:14:48,960 --> 02:14:52,229
yeah i mean in a sense it's it's
platooning but and i and in fairness

7812
02:14:52,229 --> 02:14:52,239
platooning but and i and in fairness
 

7813
02:14:52,239 --> 02:14:53,430
platooning but and i and in fairness
right the

7814
02:14:53,430 --> 02:14:53,440
right the
 

7815
02:14:53,440 --> 02:14:55,430
right the
as i pitched that idea or sort of ran

7816
02:14:55,430 --> 02:14:55,440
as i pitched that idea or sort of ran
 

7817
02:14:55,440 --> 02:14:57,189
as i pitched that idea or sort of ran
that idea by

7818
02:14:57,189 --> 02:14:57,199
that idea by
 

7819
02:14:57,199 --> 02:14:59,189
that idea by
the computer scientists and engineers

7820
02:14:59,189 --> 02:14:59,199
the computer scientists and engineers
 

7821
02:14:59,199 --> 02:15:00,629
the computer scientists and engineers
that i would and product managers that i

7822
02:15:00,629 --> 02:15:00,639
that i would and product managers that i
 

7823
02:15:00,639 --> 02:15:02,550
that i would and product managers that i
would talk to they would say

7824
02:15:02,550 --> 02:15:02,560
would talk to they would say
 

7825
02:15:02,560 --> 02:15:03,510
would talk to they would say
you know

7826
02:15:03,510 --> 02:15:03,520
you know
 

7827
02:15:03,520 --> 02:15:06,069
you know
you know we thought about that but that

7828
02:15:06,069 --> 02:15:06,079
you know we thought about that but that
 

7829
02:15:06,079 --> 02:15:07,589
you know we thought about that but that
following truck

7830
02:15:07,589 --> 02:15:07,599
following truck
 

7831
02:15:07,599 --> 02:15:10,550
following truck
it's not that simple you know that thing

7832
02:15:10,550 --> 02:15:10,560
it's not that simple you know that thing
 

7833
02:15:10,560 --> 02:15:13,189
it's not that simple you know that thing
basically we had to engineer that to be

7834
02:15:13,189 --> 02:15:13,199
basically we had to engineer that to be
 

7835
02:15:13,199 --> 02:15:14,629
basically we had to engineer that to be
capable of

7836
02:15:14,629 --> 02:15:14,639
capable of
 

7837
02:15:14,639 --> 02:15:16,310
capable of
independent self-driving because what if

7838
02:15:16,310 --> 02:15:16,320
independent self-driving because what if
 

7839
02:15:16,320 --> 02:15:18,470
independent self-driving because what if
there was a cut in or you know any

7840
02:15:18,470 --> 02:15:18,480
there was a cut in or you know any
 

7841
02:15:18,480 --> 02:15:21,589
there was a cut in or you know any
number of scenarios in which it lost

7842
02:15:21,589 --> 02:15:21,599
number of scenarios in which it lost
 

7843
02:15:21,599 --> 02:15:23,910
number of scenarios in which it lost
that connection to the lead truck for

7844
02:15:23,910 --> 02:15:23,920
that connection to the lead truck for
 

7845
02:15:23,920 --> 02:15:27,030
that connection to the lead truck for
whatever reason now i mean i don't

7846
02:15:27,030 --> 02:15:27,040
whatever reason now i mean i don't
 

7847
02:15:27,040 --> 02:15:29,589
whatever reason now i mean i don't
platooning is hard

7848
02:15:29,589 --> 02:15:29,599
platooning is hard
 

7849
02:15:29,599 --> 02:15:31,589
platooning is hard
there's edge cases i guarantee the

7850
02:15:31,589 --> 02:15:31,599
there's edge cases i guarantee the
 

7851
02:15:31,599 --> 02:15:33,910
there's edge cases i guarantee the
number of edge cases and platooning is

7852
02:15:33,910 --> 02:15:33,920
number of edge cases and platooning is
 

7853
02:15:33,920 --> 02:15:35,589
number of edge cases and platooning is
orders of magnitude lower than the

7854
02:15:35,589 --> 02:15:35,599
orders of magnitude lower than the
 

7855
02:15:35,599 --> 02:15:37,350
orders of magnitude lower than the
number of edge cases

7856
02:15:37,350 --> 02:15:37,360
number of edge cases
 

7857
02:15:37,360 --> 02:15:39,270
number of edge cases
in the general

7858
02:15:39,270 --> 02:15:39,280
in the general
 

7859
02:15:39,280 --> 02:15:41,510
in the general
solo full self drive you do not need to

7860
02:15:41,510 --> 02:15:41,520
solo full self drive you do not need to
 

7861
02:15:41,520 --> 02:15:43,669
solo full self drive you do not need to
solve the full self-driving problem

7862
02:15:43,669 --> 02:15:43,679
solve the full self-driving problem
 

7863
02:15:43,679 --> 02:15:45,750
solve the full self-driving problem
i mean if you're talking about

7864
02:15:45,750 --> 02:15:45,760
i mean if you're talking about
 

7865
02:15:45,760 --> 02:15:49,189
i mean if you're talking about
uh probability of dangerous events yeah

7866
02:15:49,189 --> 02:15:49,199
uh probability of dangerous events yeah
 

7867
02:15:49,199 --> 02:15:51,990
uh probability of dangerous events yeah
it just seems with platooning then

7868
02:15:51,990 --> 02:15:52,000
it just seems with platooning then
 

7869
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:54,629
it just seems with platooning then
like you can deal with cut-ins

7870
02:15:54,629 --> 02:15:54,639
like you can deal with cut-ins
 

7871
02:15:54,639 --> 02:15:56,390
like you can deal with cut-ins
yeah so this is you know this is beyond

7872
02:15:56,390 --> 02:15:56,400
yeah so this is you know this is beyond
 

7873
02:15:56,400 --> 02:15:57,750
yeah so this is you know this is beyond
uh this is one of the challenges

7874
02:15:57,750 --> 02:15:57,760
uh this is one of the challenges
 

7875
02:15:57,760 --> 02:15:59,589
uh this is one of the challenges
obviously of being a researcher who you

7876
02:15:59,589 --> 02:15:59,599
obviously of being a researcher who you
 

7877
02:15:59,599 --> 02:16:01,510
obviously of being a researcher who you
know uh doesn't doesn't really have any

7878
02:16:01,510 --> 02:16:01,520
know uh doesn't doesn't really have any
 

7879
02:16:01,520 --> 02:16:04,310
know uh doesn't doesn't really have any
background in in the technology right um

7880
02:16:04,310 --> 02:16:04,320
background in in the technology right um
 

7881
02:16:04,320 --> 02:16:05,990
background in in the technology right um
so i can i can dream this up i don't you

7882
02:16:05,990 --> 02:16:06,000
so i can i can dream this up i don't you
 

7883
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:08,149
so i can i can dream this up i don't you
know no idea if it's feasible um well

7884
02:16:08,149 --> 02:16:08,159
know no idea if it's feasible um well
 

7885
02:16:08,159 --> 02:16:10,149
know no idea if it's feasible um well
let me speak you spoke to the phds in

7886
02:16:10,149 --> 02:16:10,159
let me speak you spoke to the phds in
 

7887
02:16:10,159 --> 02:16:11,830
let me speak you spoke to the phds in
economics let me speak to the pgs of

7888
02:16:11,830 --> 02:16:11,840
economics let me speak to the pgs of
 

7889
02:16:11,840 --> 02:16:13,910
economics let me speak to the pgs of
computer science if you think platooning

7890
02:16:13,910 --> 02:16:13,920
computer science if you think platooning
 

7891
02:16:13,920 --> 02:16:15,510
computer science if you think platooning
is as hard as the full self-driving

7892
02:16:15,510 --> 02:16:15,520
is as hard as the full self-driving
 

7893
02:16:15,520 --> 02:16:16,390
is as hard as the full self-driving
problem

7894
02:16:16,390 --> 02:16:16,400
problem
 

7895
02:16:16,400 --> 02:16:17,589
problem
um

7896
02:16:17,589 --> 02:16:17,599
um
 

7897
02:16:17,599 --> 02:16:19,589
um
well we need to talk because i think

7898
02:16:19,589 --> 02:16:19,599
well we need to talk because i think
 

7899
02:16:19,599 --> 02:16:21,910
well we need to talk because i think
that's ridiculous i think platooning

7900
02:16:21,910 --> 02:16:21,920
that's ridiculous i think platooning
 

7901
02:16:21,920 --> 02:16:23,589
that's ridiculous i think platooning
and in fact i think platooning is an

7902
02:16:23,589 --> 02:16:23,599
and in fact i think platooning is an
 

7903
02:16:23,599 --> 02:16:25,109
and in fact i think platooning is an
interesting idea for

7904
02:16:25,109 --> 02:16:25,119
interesting idea for
 

7905
02:16:25,119 --> 02:16:27,189
interesting idea for
ride sharing as well for the general

7906
02:16:27,189 --> 02:16:27,199
ride sharing as well for the general
 

7907
02:16:27,199 --> 02:16:28,709
ride sharing as well for the general
autonomous driving problem not just

7908
02:16:28,709 --> 02:16:28,719
autonomous driving problem not just
 

7909
02:16:28,719 --> 02:16:30,470
autonomous driving problem not just
trucking but obviously trucking is the

7910
02:16:30,470 --> 02:16:30,480
trucking but obviously trucking is the
 

7911
02:16:30,480 --> 02:16:33,349
trucking but obviously trucking is the
big big benefit because the number of a

7912
02:16:33,349 --> 02:16:33,359
big big benefit because the number of a
 

7913
02:16:33,359 --> 02:16:35,910
big big benefit because the number of a
to b points in trucking is much much

7914
02:16:35,910 --> 02:16:35,920
to b points in trucking is much much
 

7915
02:16:35,920 --> 02:16:37,429
to b points in trucking is much much
lower than the general ride sharing

7916
02:16:37,429 --> 02:16:37,439
lower than the general ride sharing
 

7917
02:16:37,439 --> 02:16:40,070
lower than the general ride sharing
problem but anyway i think it's a great

7918
02:16:40,070 --> 02:16:40,080
problem but anyway i think it's a great
 

7919
02:16:40,080 --> 02:16:42,629
problem but anyway i think it's a great
idea but you're saying it was removed

7920
02:16:42,629 --> 02:16:42,639
idea but you're saying it was removed
 

7921
02:16:42,639 --> 02:16:44,870
idea but you're saying it was removed
yeah and and so you you can go you know

7922
02:16:44,870 --> 02:16:44,880
yeah and and so you you can go you know
 

7923
02:16:44,880 --> 02:16:46,629
yeah and and so you you can go you know
and you know listeners could go to these

7924
02:16:46,629 --> 02:16:46,639
and you know listeners could go to these
 

7925
02:16:46,639 --> 02:16:48,230
and you know listeners could go to these
reports they're they're they're publicly

7926
02:16:48,230 --> 02:16:48,240
reports they're they're they're publicly
 

7927
02:16:48,240 --> 02:16:50,150
reports they're they're they're publicly
available and they explain why in the in

7928
02:16:50,150 --> 02:16:50,160
available and they explain why in the in
 

7929
02:16:50,160 --> 02:16:51,429
available and they explain why in the in
the footnote

7930
02:16:51,429 --> 02:16:51,439
the footnote
 

7931
02:16:51,439 --> 02:16:53,030
the footnote
and you know they they note that there

7932
02:16:53,030 --> 02:16:53,040
and you know they they note that there
 

7933
02:16:53,040 --> 02:16:55,509
and you know they they note that there
was this other scenario um suggested by

7934
02:16:55,509 --> 02:16:55,519
was this other scenario um suggested by
 

7935
02:16:55,519 --> 02:16:57,190
was this other scenario um suggested by
at least me and i remember if they said

7936
02:16:57,190 --> 02:16:57,200
at least me and i remember if they said
 

7937
02:16:57,200 --> 02:16:58,870
at least me and i remember if they said
someone else did too

7938
02:16:58,870 --> 02:16:58,880
someone else did too
 

7939
02:16:58,880 --> 02:17:01,509
someone else did too
but they said you know we didn't include

7940
02:17:01,509 --> 02:17:01,519
but they said you know we didn't include
 

7941
02:17:01,519 --> 02:17:03,750
but they said you know we didn't include
it because no developers

7942
02:17:03,750 --> 02:17:03,760
it because no developers
 

7943
02:17:03,760 --> 02:17:05,990
it because no developers
were working on it interesting full

7944
02:17:05,990 --> 02:17:06,000
were working on it interesting full
 

7945
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:07,429
were working on it interesting full
disclosure

7946
02:17:07,429 --> 02:17:07,439
disclosure
 

7947
02:17:07,439 --> 02:17:09,910
disclosure
that was the approach that i took in my

7948
02:17:09,910 --> 02:17:09,920
that was the approach that i took in my
 

7949
02:17:09,920 --> 02:17:12,070
that was the approach that i took in my
research right which was to go to the

7950
02:17:12,070 --> 02:17:12,080
research right which was to go to the
 

7951
02:17:12,080 --> 02:17:14,549
research right which was to go to the
developers and say what's your vision

7952
02:17:14,549 --> 02:17:14,559
developers and say what's your vision
 

7953
02:17:14,559 --> 02:17:17,669
developers and say what's your vision
right what are you trying to develop

7954
02:17:17,669 --> 02:17:17,679
right what are you trying to develop
 

7955
02:17:17,679 --> 02:17:19,830
right what are you trying to develop
that's what i was trying to do and maybe

7956
02:17:19,830 --> 02:17:19,840
that's what i was trying to do and maybe
 

7957
02:17:19,840 --> 02:17:20,870
that's what i was trying to do and maybe
you know and then i tried to think

7958
02:17:20,870 --> 02:17:20,880
you know and then i tried to think
 

7959
02:17:20,880 --> 02:17:22,629
you know and then i tried to think
outside the box at the end by adding

7960
02:17:22,629 --> 02:17:22,639
outside the box at the end by adding
 

7961
02:17:22,639 --> 02:17:23,910
outside the box at the end by adding
that one right like here's one that i

7962
02:17:23,910 --> 02:17:23,920
that one right like here's one that i
 

7963
02:17:23,920 --> 02:17:25,030
that one right like here's one that i
have you know people aren't talking

7964
02:17:25,030 --> 02:17:25,040
have you know people aren't talking
 

7965
02:17:25,040 --> 02:17:26,629
have you know people aren't talking
about that could be cool now again it

7966
02:17:26,629 --> 02:17:26,639
about that could be cool now again it
 

7967
02:17:26,639 --> 02:17:29,349
about that could be cool now again it
had been proposed like 2014 for like

7968
02:17:29,349 --> 02:17:29,359
had been proposed like 2014 for like
 

7969
02:17:29,359 --> 02:17:31,750
had been proposed like 2014 for like
fuel convoys um so you could just have

7970
02:17:31,750 --> 02:17:31,760
fuel convoys um so you could just have
 

7971
02:17:31,760 --> 02:17:34,950
fuel convoys um so you could just have
like one super armored lead fuel

7972
02:17:34,950 --> 02:17:34,960
like one super armored lead fuel
 

7973
02:17:34,960 --> 02:17:36,790
like one super armored lead fuel
truck right in a you know bringing fuel

7974
02:17:36,790 --> 02:17:36,800
truck right in a you know bringing fuel
 

7975
02:17:36,800 --> 02:17:38,150
truck right in a you know bringing fuel
to forward operating bases in

7976
02:17:38,150 --> 02:17:38,160
to forward operating bases in
 

7977
02:17:38,160 --> 02:17:40,469
to forward operating bases in
afghanistan and then you wouldn't need

7978
02:17:40,469 --> 02:17:40,479
afghanistan and then you wouldn't need
 

7979
02:17:40,479 --> 02:17:41,990
afghanistan and then you wouldn't need
you know the the super heavy you know

7980
02:17:41,990 --> 02:17:42,000
you know the the super heavy you know
 

7981
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:42,950
you know the the super heavy you know
you wouldn't have to protect the human

7982
02:17:42,950 --> 02:17:42,960
you wouldn't have to protect the human
 

7983
02:17:42,960 --> 02:17:44,230
you wouldn't have to protect the human
life in the following trials so that's

7984
02:17:44,230 --> 02:17:44,240
life in the following trials so that's
 

7985
02:17:44,240 --> 02:17:45,669
life in the following trials so that's
interesting you're saying like when you

7986
02:17:45,669 --> 02:17:45,679
interesting you're saying like when you
 

7987
02:17:45,679 --> 02:17:47,110
interesting you're saying like when you
talk to waymo when you talk to these

7988
02:17:47,110 --> 02:17:47,120
talk to waymo when you talk to these
 

7989
02:17:47,120 --> 02:17:49,990
talk to waymo when you talk to these
kinds of companies they weren't at least

7990
02:17:49,990 --> 02:17:50,000
kinds of companies they weren't at least
 

7991
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:52,150
kinds of companies they weren't at least
openly saying they're working on this so

7992
02:17:52,150 --> 02:17:52,160
openly saying they're working on this so
 

7993
02:17:52,160 --> 02:17:54,549
openly saying they're working on this so
then it doesn't make sense to um

7994
02:17:54,549 --> 02:17:54,559
then it doesn't make sense to um
 

7995
02:17:54,559 --> 02:17:57,349
then it doesn't make sense to um
to include in the list yeah and so but

7996
02:17:57,349 --> 02:17:57,359
to include in the list yeah and so but
 

7997
02:17:57,359 --> 02:17:58,870
to include in the list yeah and so but
here's the thing right this is the

7998
02:17:58,870 --> 02:17:58,880
here's the thing right this is the
 

7999
02:17:58,880 --> 02:18:01,030
here's the thing right this is the
department of transportation right and

8000
02:18:01,030 --> 02:18:01,040
department of transportation right and
 

8001
02:18:01,040 --> 02:18:02,950
department of transportation right and
the department of labor

8002
02:18:02,950 --> 02:18:02,960
the department of labor
 

8003
02:18:02,960 --> 02:18:04,629
the department of labor
maybe they could consider some scenarios

8004
02:18:04,629 --> 02:18:04,639
maybe they could consider some scenarios
 

8005
02:18:04,639 --> 02:18:07,349
maybe they could consider some scenarios
like maybe we could say you know this we

8006
02:18:07,349 --> 02:18:07,359
like maybe we could say you know this we
 

8007
02:18:07,359 --> 02:18:08,790
like maybe we could say you know this we
this technology's got a lot of potential

8008
02:18:08,790 --> 02:18:08,800
this technology's got a lot of potential
 

8009
02:18:08,800 --> 02:18:10,469
this technology's got a lot of potential
here's what we'd like it to do

8010
02:18:10,469 --> 02:18:10,479
here's what we'd like it to do
 

8011
02:18:10,479 --> 02:18:12,150
here's what we'd like it to do
you know we'd like it to reduce highway

8012
02:18:12,150 --> 02:18:12,160
you know we'd like it to reduce highway
 

8013
02:18:12,160 --> 02:18:13,830
you know we'd like it to reduce highway
deaths help us fight climate change

8014
02:18:13,830 --> 02:18:13,840
deaths help us fight climate change
 

8015
02:18:13,840 --> 02:18:15,349
deaths help us fight climate change
reduce congestion you know all these

8016
02:18:15,349 --> 02:18:15,359
reduce congestion you know all these
 

8017
02:18:15,359 --> 02:18:16,150
reduce congestion you know all these
other

8018
02:18:16,150 --> 02:18:16,160
other
 

8019
02:18:16,160 --> 02:18:17,990
other
other things but that's not how our

8020
02:18:17,990 --> 02:18:18,000
other things but that's not how our
 

8021
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:19,830
other things but that's not how our
policy conversation our own technology

8022
02:18:19,830 --> 02:18:19,840
policy conversation our own technology
 

8023
02:18:19,840 --> 02:18:21,429
policy conversation our own technology
is happening we're not

8024
02:18:21,429 --> 02:18:21,439
is happening we're not
 

8025
02:18:21,439 --> 02:18:24,469
is happening we're not
and people don't think that we should

8026
02:18:24,469 --> 02:18:24,479
and people don't think that we should
 

8027
02:18:24,479 --> 02:18:26,309
and people don't think that we should
and i think that's the fundamental shift

8028
02:18:26,309 --> 02:18:26,319
and i think that's the fundamental shift
 

8029
02:18:26,319 --> 02:18:27,990
and i think that's the fundamental shift
that we need to have right i've been

8030
02:18:27,990 --> 02:18:28,000
that we need to have right i've been
 

8031
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:29,110
that we need to have right i've been
involved with this a little bit like

8032
02:18:29,110 --> 02:18:29,120
involved with this a little bit like
 

8033
02:18:29,120 --> 02:18:31,750
involved with this a little bit like
nitsa and d.o.t

8034
02:18:31,750 --> 02:18:31,760
nitsa and d.o.t
 

8035
02:18:31,760 --> 02:18:33,349
nitsa and d.o.t
the approach they took is saying we

8036
02:18:33,349 --> 02:18:33,359
the approach they took is saying we
 

8037
02:18:33,359 --> 02:18:34,950
the approach they took is saying we
don't know what the heck we're doing so

8038
02:18:34,950 --> 02:18:34,960
don't know what the heck we're doing so
 

8039
02:18:34,960 --> 02:18:37,349
don't know what the heck we're doing so
we're going to just let the innovators

8040
02:18:37,349 --> 02:18:37,359
we're going to just let the innovators
 

8041
02:18:37,359 --> 02:18:39,509
we're going to just let the innovators
do their thing and not regulate it for a

8042
02:18:39,509 --> 02:18:39,519
do their thing and not regulate it for a
 

8043
02:18:39,519 --> 02:18:41,190
do their thing and not regulate it for a
while just to see

8044
02:18:41,190 --> 02:18:41,200
while just to see
 

8045
02:18:41,200 --> 02:18:43,509
while just to see
you don't you think that's um

8046
02:18:43,509 --> 02:18:43,519
you don't you think that's um
 

8047
02:18:43,519 --> 02:18:45,429
you don't you think that's um
you think dot should provide ideas

8048
02:18:45,429 --> 02:18:45,439
you think dot should provide ideas
 

8049
02:18:45,439 --> 02:18:48,309
you think dot should provide ideas
themselves well so this is the um

8050
02:18:48,309 --> 02:18:48,319
themselves well so this is the um
 

8051
02:18:48,319 --> 02:18:49,990
themselves well so this is the um
this is the great trick

8052
02:18:49,990 --> 02:18:50,000
this is the great trick
 

8053
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:53,589
this is the great trick
in policy of um of private actors

8054
02:18:53,589 --> 02:18:53,599
in policy of um of private actors
 

8055
02:18:53,599 --> 02:18:57,349
in policy of um of private actors
is you you get narrow mandates for

8056
02:18:57,349 --> 02:18:57,359
is you you get narrow mandates for
 

8057
02:18:57,359 --> 02:18:59,589
is you you get narrow mandates for
government agencies right so you know

8058
02:18:59,589 --> 02:18:59,599
government agencies right so you know
 

8059
02:18:59,599 --> 02:19:01,990
government agencies right so you know
this the safety case will be handled by

8060
02:19:01,990 --> 02:19:02,000
this the safety case will be handled by
 

8061
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:05,270
this the safety case will be handled by
organizations whose mandate is safety so

8062
02:19:05,270 --> 02:19:05,280
organizations whose mandate is safety so
 

8063

actually determining which

02:19:16,389 --> 02:19:16,399
actually determining which
 

8075
02:19:16,399 --> 02:19:18,309
actually determining which
scenario is most profitable by setting

not restrict technology not stand in the
 

8103
02:19:44,719 --> 02:19:46,469
not restrict technology not stand in the
way of things we need to harness it

right not whatever comes out the end of
 

8109
02:19:51,040 --> 02:19:52,870
right not whatever comes out the end of
the pipeline because it's the easiest

8110
02:19:52,870 --> 02:19:52,880
the pipeline because it's the easiest
 

8111
02:19:52,880 --> 02:19:55,030
the pipeline because it's the easiest
thing to develop or whatever is most

profitable for the first actor or
 

8115
02:19:57,040 --> 02:19:58,950
profitable for the first actor or
whatever but you know and we do the

8116

whatever but you know and we do the
 

8117
02:19:58,960 --> 02:20:01,270
whatever but you know and we do the
thing is we do that right i mean like

8118

when we when we sent people to the moon
you know we we did that we you know and

02:20:06,150 --> 02:20:06,160
you know we we did that we you know and
 

8123
02:20:06,160 --> 02:20:08,230
you know we we did that we you know and
there were tremendous benefits that that

8124
02:20:08,230 --> 02:20:08,240
there were tremendous benefits that that
 

8125
02:20:08,240 --> 02:20:09,830
there were tremendous benefits that that
followed from it right and and we do

8126
02:20:09,830 --> 02:20:09,840
followed from it right and and we do
 

8127
02:20:09,840 --> 02:20:11,830
followed from it right and and we do
this all the time in you know trying to

8128
02:20:11,830 --> 02:20:11,840
this all the time in you know trying to
 

8129
02:20:11,840 --> 02:20:13,590
this all the time in you know trying to
cure cancer or whatever it is right i

supporting a skilled driver um

8766
02:31:08,710 --> 02:31:08,720
supporting a skilled driver um
 

8767
02:31:08,720 --> 02:31:09,990
supporting a skilled driver um
but you're not going to be able to pull

8768
02:31:09,990 --> 02:31:10,000
but you're not going to be able to pull
 

8769
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:12,150
but you're not going to be able to pull
that driver out for long stretches the

8770
02:31:12,150 --> 02:31:12,160
that driver out for long stretches the
 

8771
02:31:12,160 --> 02:31:14,230
that driver out for long stretches the
way that you are with driverless trucks

8772
02:31:14,230 --> 02:31:14,240
way that you are with driverless trucks
 

8773
02:31:14,240 --> 02:31:15,590
way that you are with driverless trucks
so

8774
02:31:15,590 --> 02:31:15,600
so
 

8775
02:31:15,600 --> 02:31:17,429
so
do you think

8776
02:31:17,429 --> 02:31:17,439
do you think
 

8777
02:31:17,439 --> 02:31:19,670
do you think
i mean the reason so yeah the

8778
02:31:19,670 --> 02:31:19,680
i mean the reason so yeah the
 

8779
02:31:19,680 --> 02:31:22,230
i mean the reason so yeah the
electrification

8780
02:31:22,230 --> 02:31:22,240
electrification
 

8781
02:31:22,240 --> 02:31:23,750
electrification

so it's very interesting whether that

8868
02:32:49,510 --> 02:32:49,520
so it's very interesting whether that

02:33:55,270 --> 02:33:55,280
know toward a more efficient system so i
 

8931
02:33:55,280 --> 02:33:57,429
know toward a more efficient system so i
want to see those tesla electric trucks

8932
02:33:57,429 --> 02:33:57,439
want to see those tesla electric trucks
 

8933
02:33:57,439 --> 02:33:59,270
want to see those tesla electric trucks
running out to those truck ports where

8934
02:33:59,270 --> 02:33:59,280
running out to those truck ports where
 

8935
02:33:59,280 --> 02:34:01,349
running out to those truck ports where
you're where you've got those two you

8936
02:34:01,349 --> 02:34:01,359
you're where you've got those two you
 

8937
02:34:01,359 --> 02:34:03,830
you're where you've got those two you
know um two trucks with a human driver

8938
02:34:03,830 --> 02:34:03,840
know um two trucks with a human driver
 

8939
02:34:03,840 --> 02:34:06,309
know um two trucks with a human driver
in front yeah right um you know i think

8940
02:34:06,309 --> 02:34:06,319
in front yeah right um you know i think
 

8941
02:34:06,319 --> 02:34:08,630
in front yeah right um you know i think
that's now what's powering those is that

8942
02:34:08,630 --> 02:34:08,640
that's now what's powering those is that
 

8943
02:34:08,640 --> 02:34:10,469
that's now what's powering those is that
hydrogen you know i mean i don't you

8944
02:34:10,469 --> 02:34:10,479
hydrogen you know i mean i don't you
 

8945
02:34:10,479 --> 02:34:11,110
hydrogen you know i mean i don't you
know

8946
02:34:11,110 --> 02:34:11,120
know
 

8947
02:34:11,120 --> 02:34:12,309
know
again it's very interesting as a

8948
02:34:12,309 --> 02:34:12,319
again it's very interesting as a
 

8949
02:34:12,319 --> 02:34:13,510
again it's very interesting as a
researcher who does not have a

8950
02:34:13,510 --> 02:34:13,520
researcher who does not have a
 

8951
02:34:13,520 --> 02:34:15,030
researcher who does not have a
background in technology it doesn't have

8952
02:34:15,030 --> 02:34:15,040
background in technology it doesn't have
 

8953
02:34:15,040 --> 02:34:17,910
background in technology it doesn't have
a have a horse you know in this in this

8954
02:34:17,910 --> 02:34:17,920
a have a horse you know in this in this
 

8955
02:34:17,920 --> 02:34:20,550
a have a horse you know in this in this
race i mean you know for all i know

8956
02:34:20,550 --> 02:34:20,560
race i mean you know for all i know
 

8957
02:34:20,560 --> 02:34:22,230
race i mean you know for all i know
self-driving trucks will ultimately be

8958
02:34:22,230 --> 02:34:22,240
self-driving trucks will ultimately be
 

8959
02:34:22,240 --> 02:34:25,030
self-driving trucks will ultimately be
achieved by some biomechanical sensor

8960
02:34:25,030 --> 02:34:25,040
achieved by some biomechanical sensor
 

8961
02:34:25,040 --> 02:34:27,110
achieved by some biomechanical sensor
that uses echolocation because we took

8962
02:34:27,110 --> 02:34:27,120
that uses echolocation because we took
 

8963
02:34:27,120 --> 02:34:29,030
that uses echolocation because we took
stem cells of bats right you know i mean

8964
02:34:29,030 --> 02:34:29,040
stem cells of bats right you know i mean
 

8965
02:34:29,040 --> 02:34:31,349
stem cells of bats right you know i mean
i know you know i i don't i am

8966
02:34:31,349 --> 02:34:31,359
i know you know i i don't i am
 

8967
02:34:31,359 --> 02:34:33,510
i know you know i i don't i am
completely um

8968
02:34:33,510 --> 02:34:33,520
completely um
 

8969
02:34:33,520 --> 02:34:35,510
completely um
unable to assess who's you know who's

8970
02:34:35,510 --> 02:34:35,520
unable to assess who's you know who's
 

8971
02:34:35,520 --> 02:34:37,270
unable to assess who's you know who's
that or who's behind her who makes sense

8972
02:34:37,270 --> 02:34:37,280
that or who's behind her who makes sense
 

8973
02:34:37,280 --> 02:34:39,750
that or who's behind her who makes sense
but but i think one key component there

8974
02:34:39,750 --> 02:34:39,760
but but i think one key component there
 

8975
02:34:39,760 --> 02:34:42,469
but but i think one key component there
and this is what i see with tesla often

8976
02:34:42,469 --> 02:34:42,479
and this is what i see with tesla often
 

8977
02:34:42,479 --> 02:34:45,030
and this is what i see with tesla often
and it's it's quite sad to me that other

8978
02:34:45,030 --> 02:34:45,040
and it's it's quite sad to me that other
 

8979
02:34:45,040 --> 02:34:46,870
and it's it's quite sad to me that other
companies don't do this enough

8980
02:34:46,870 --> 02:34:46,880
companies don't do this enough
 

8981
02:34:46,880 --> 02:34:49,349
companies don't do this enough
is is that first principles thinking

8982
02:34:49,349 --> 02:34:49,359
is is that first principles thinking
 

8983
02:34:49,359 --> 02:34:51,670
is is that first principles thinking
like wait wait okay it's looking at the

8984
02:34:51,670 --> 02:34:51,680
like wait wait okay it's looking at the
 

8985
02:34:51,680 --> 02:34:53,510
like wait wait okay it's looking at the
inefficiencies as opposed to

8986
02:34:53,510 --> 02:34:53,520
inefficiencies as opposed to
 

8987
02:34:53,520 --> 02:34:56,870
inefficiencies as opposed to
i worked with quite a few car companies

8988
02:34:56,870 --> 02:34:56,880
i worked with quite a few car companies
 

8989
02:34:56,880 --> 02:34:59,270
i worked with quite a few car companies
and they basically have a lot of

8990
02:34:59,270 --> 02:34:59,280
and they basically have a lot of
 

8991
02:34:59,280 --> 02:35:01,750
and they basically have a lot of
meetings there's a lot of meetings

8992
02:35:01,750 --> 02:35:01,760
meetings there's a lot of meetings
 

8993
02:35:01,760 --> 02:35:03,830
meetings there's a lot of meetings
and uh the discussion is like how can we

8994
02:35:03,830 --> 02:35:03,840
and uh the discussion is like how can we
 

8995
02:35:03,840 --> 02:35:05,190
and uh the discussion is like how can we
make this cheaper this cheaper this

8996
02:35:05,190 --> 02:35:05,200
make this cheaper this cheaper this
 

8997
02:35:05,200 --> 02:35:06,309
make this cheaper this cheaper this
cheaper this component cheaper this

8998
02:35:06,309 --> 02:35:06,319
cheaper this component cheaper this
 

8999
02:35:06,319 --> 02:35:07,270
cheaper this component cheaper this
cheaper

9000
02:35:07,270 --> 02:35:07,280
cheaper
 

9001
02:35:07,280 --> 02:35:08,710
cheaper
the cheapification of everything just

9002
02:35:08,710 --> 02:35:08,720
the cheapification of everything just
 

9003
02:35:08,720 --> 02:35:10,070
the cheapification of everything just
like you said

9004
02:35:10,070 --> 02:35:10,080
like you said
 

9005
02:35:10,080 --> 02:35:11,670
like you said
as opposed to saying wait a minute let's

9006
02:35:11,670 --> 02:35:11,680
as opposed to saying wait a minute let's
 

9007
02:35:11,680 --> 02:35:13,110
as opposed to saying wait a minute let's
step back

9008
02:35:13,110 --> 02:35:13,120
step back
 

9009
02:35:13,120 --> 02:35:14,950
step back
let's look at the entirety of the

9010
02:35:14,950 --> 02:35:14,960
let's look at the entirety of the
 

9011
02:35:14,960 --> 02:35:17,110
let's look at the entirety of the
inefficiencies in the system

9012
02:35:17,110 --> 02:35:17,120
inefficiencies in the system
 

9013
02:35:17,120 --> 02:35:18,870
inefficiencies in the system
like why have we been doing this like

9014
02:35:18,870 --> 02:35:18,880
like why have we been doing this like
 

9015
02:35:18,880 --> 02:35:20,790
like why have we been doing this like
this for the last few decades

9016
02:35:20,790 --> 02:35:20,800
this for the last few decades
 

9017
02:35:20,800 --> 02:35:24,230
this for the last few decades
like start from scratch can this be 10x

9018
02:35:24,230 --> 02:35:24,240
like start from scratch can this be 10x
 

9019
02:35:24,240 --> 02:35:26,389
like start from scratch can this be 10x
100x cheaper like if we

9020
02:35:26,389 --> 02:35:26,399
100x cheaper like if we
 

9021
02:35:26,399 --> 02:35:27,429
100x cheaper like if we
not just

9022
02:35:27,429 --> 02:35:27,439
not just
 

9023
02:35:27,439 --> 02:35:31,030
not just
decrease the the cost of one component

9024
02:35:31,030 --> 02:35:31,040
decrease the the cost of one component
 

9025
02:35:31,040 --> 02:35:32,389
decrease the the cost of one component
here or this component here or this

9026
02:35:32,389 --> 02:35:32,399
here or this component here or this
 

9027
02:35:32,399 --> 02:35:35,110
here or this component here or this
component here but like

9028
02:35:35,110 --> 02:35:35,120
component here but like
 

9029
02:35:35,120 --> 02:35:39,670
component here but like
let's like redesign everything let's uh

9030
02:35:39,670 --> 02:35:39,680
let's like redesign everything let's uh
 

9031
02:35:39,680 --> 02:35:42,790
let's like redesign everything let's uh
infrastructure let's have special lanes

9032
02:35:42,790 --> 02:35:42,800
infrastructure let's have special lanes
 

9033
02:35:42,800 --> 02:35:45,510
infrastructure let's have special lanes
or in terms of truck ports as opposed to

9034
02:35:45,510 --> 02:35:45,520
or in terms of truck ports as opposed to
 

9035
02:35:45,520 --> 02:35:47,429
or in terms of truck ports as opposed to
having regular human control truck ports

9036
02:35:47,429 --> 02:35:47,439
having regular human control truck ports
 

9037
02:35:47,439 --> 02:35:49,670
having regular human control truck ports
have some kind of weird

9038
02:35:49,670 --> 02:35:49,680
have some kind of weird
 

9039
02:35:49,680 --> 02:35:53,190
have some kind of weird
like like sensors like where everything

9040
02:35:53,190 --> 02:35:53,200
like like sensors like where everything
 

9041
02:35:53,200 --> 02:35:54,550
like like sensors like where everything
about the truck

9042
02:35:54,550 --> 02:35:54,560
about the truck
 

9043
02:35:54,560 --> 02:35:55,349
about the truck
uh

9044
02:35:55,349 --> 02:35:55,359
uh
 

9045
02:35:55,359 --> 02:35:57,349
uh
connecting at that final destination is

9046
02:35:57,349 --> 02:35:57,359
connecting at that final destination is
 

9047
02:35:57,359 --> 02:35:59,750
connecting at that final destination is
automated fully from the ground up you

9048
02:35:59,750 --> 02:35:59,760
automated fully from the ground up you
 

9049
02:35:59,760 --> 02:36:01,429
automated fully from the ground up you
build the facility from the ground up

9050
02:36:01,429 --> 02:36:01,439
build the facility from the ground up
 

9051
02:36:01,439 --> 02:36:04,150
build the facility from the ground up
for the autonomous truck um all all

9052
02:36:04,150 --> 02:36:04,160
for the autonomous truck um all all
 

9053
02:36:04,160 --> 02:36:05,830
for the autonomous truck um all all
those kinds of sort of questions or

9054
02:36:05,830 --> 02:36:05,840
those kinds of sort of questions or
 

9055
02:36:05,840 --> 02:36:08,870
those kinds of sort of questions or
platooning let's say wait a minute okay

9056
02:36:08,870 --> 02:36:08,880
platooning let's say wait a minute okay
 

9057
02:36:08,880 --> 02:36:11,349
platooning let's say wait a minute okay
i know we think platooning is hard but

9058
02:36:11,349 --> 02:36:11,359
i know we think platooning is hard but
 

9059
02:36:11,359 --> 02:36:13,910
i know we think platooning is hard but
can we think through exactly why it's

9060
02:36:13,910 --> 02:36:13,920
can we think through exactly why it's
 

9061
02:36:13,920 --> 02:36:16,150
can we think through exactly why it's
hard and can we actually solve it like

9062
02:36:16,150 --> 02:36:16,160
hard and can we actually solve it like
 

9063
02:36:16,160 --> 02:36:18,230
hard and can we actually solve it like
if we collect a huge amount of data can

9064
02:36:18,230 --> 02:36:18,240
if we collect a huge amount of data can
 

9065
02:36:18,240 --> 02:36:20,309
if we collect a huge amount of data can
we solve it

9066
02:36:20,309 --> 02:36:20,319
we solve it
 

9067
02:36:20,319 --> 02:36:22,230
we solve it
and then tell teleoperation

9068
02:36:22,230 --> 02:36:22,240
and then tell teleoperation
 

9069
02:36:22,240 --> 02:36:23,830
and then tell teleoperation
like okay yeah yeah it's difficult to

9070
02:36:23,830 --> 02:36:23,840
like okay yeah yeah it's difficult to
 

9071
02:36:23,840 --> 02:36:26,870
like okay yeah yeah it's difficult to
have good signal but can we actually can

9072
02:36:26,870 --> 02:36:26,880
have good signal but can we actually can
 

9073
02:36:26,880 --> 02:36:29,270
have good signal but can we actually can
we have can we consider the the the

9074
02:36:29,270 --> 02:36:29,280
we have can we consider the the the
 

9075
02:36:29,280 --> 02:36:31,429
we have can we consider the the the
probability of those edge cases and what

9076
02:36:31,429 --> 02:36:31,439
probability of those edge cases and what
 

9077
02:36:31,439 --> 02:36:32,790
probability of those edge cases and what
to do in the edge cases when the tail

9078
02:36:32,790 --> 02:36:32,800
to do in the edge cases when the tail
 

9079
02:36:32,800 --> 02:36:35,030
to do in the edge cases when the tail
operation fails like how difficult is

9080
02:36:35,030 --> 02:36:35,040
operation fails like how difficult is
 

9081
02:36:35,040 --> 02:36:36,710
operation fails like how difficult is
this what are the costs how do we

9082
02:36:36,710 --> 02:36:36,720
this what are the costs how do we
 

9083
02:36:36,720 --> 02:36:39,190
this what are the costs how do we
actually construct a uh teleoperation

9084
02:36:39,190 --> 02:36:39,200
actually construct a uh teleoperation
 

9085
02:36:39,200 --> 02:36:41,030
actually construct a uh teleoperation
center full of humans that are able to

that's incredible but then
 

9149

when it comes to hiring software people
 

9151
02:37:48,720 --> 02:37:51,830
when it comes to hiring software people
they're horrible so

9152

it's it's culture and then it's such a
difficult thing for them to sort of

9156
02:37:56,070 --> 02:37:56,080
difficult thing for them to sort of
 

9157
02:37:56,080 --> 02:37:58,870
difficult thing for them to sort of
embrace but greatness requires that they

for infrastructure projects like
 

9601
02:45:55,439 --> 02:45:58,389
for infrastructure projects like
there's we should really

9602
02:45:58,389 --> 02:45:58,399
there's we should really
 

9603
02:45:58,399 --> 02:45:59,190
there's we should really
have

have
 

9605
02:45:59,200 --> 02:46:02,070
have
large moonshot projects that uh are

at least guided by i mean i think there
 

9613
02:46:06,720 --> 02:46:08,309
at least guided by i mean i think there
are ways to finance them and you know

9614
02:46:08,309 --> 02:46:08,319
are ways to finance them and you know
 

9615
02:46:08,319 --> 02:46:10,550
are ways to finance them and you know
other things but we got to be careful

9616
02:46:10,550 --> 02:46:10,560
other things but we got to be careful
 

9617
02:46:10,560 --> 02:46:11,590
other things but we got to be careful
right because that that's where you get

9618
02:46:11,590 --> 02:46:11,600
right because that that's where you get
 

9619
02:46:11,600 --> 02:46:13,429
right because that that's where you get
all these sort of perverse you know

9620
02:46:13,429 --> 02:46:13,439
all these sort of perverse you know
 

9621
02:46:13,439 --> 02:46:15,349
all these sort of perverse you know
unintended consequences and whatnot but

9622
02:46:15,349 --> 02:46:15,359
unintended consequences and whatnot but
 

9623
02:46:15,359 --> 02:46:17,349
unintended consequences and whatnot but
if you look at transportation

9624
02:46:17,349 --> 02:46:17,359
if you look at transportation
 

9625
02:46:17,359 --> 02:46:18,950
if you look at transportation
in the united states and it is the

9626
02:46:18,950 --> 02:46:18,960
in the united states and it is the
 

9627
02:46:18,960 --> 02:46:21,830
in the united states and it is the
foundation of of the the you know

9628
02:46:21,830 --> 02:46:21,840
foundation of of the the you know
 

9629
02:46:21,840 --> 02:46:24,469

manifest destiny economic growth
 

9631
02:46:24,479 --> 02:46:26,630
manifest destiny economic growth
right that that built the united states

9632
02:46:26,630 --> 02:46:26,640
right that that built the united states
 

9633
02:46:26,640 --> 02:46:29,190
right that that built the united states
into the the world superpower that it

9634
02:46:29,190 --> 02:46:29,200
into the the world superpower that it
 

9635
02:46:29,200 --> 02:46:30,630
into the the world superpower that it
became and the industrial power that it

9636

became and the industrial power that it
 

9637
02:46:30,640 --> 02:46:33,429
became and the industrial power that it
became it rested on transportation right

9638
02:46:33,429 --> 02:46:33,439
became it rested on transportation right
 

9639
02:46:33,439 --> 02:46:36,469
became it rested on transportation right
it was like you know the erie canal i i

the highway system the the eisenhower
 

9665
02:47:03,680 --> 02:47:06,630
the highway system the the eisenhower
the the payback that the u.s economy got

electrification dams water you know

9674
02:47:17,269 --> 02:47:17,279
electrification dams water you know
 

9675
02:47:17,279 --> 02:47:18,150

we
 

9677
02:47:18,160 --> 02:47:20,389
we
we need to do this infrastructure

9678
02:47:20,389 --> 02:47:20,399
we need to do this infrastructure
 

9679
02:47:20,399 --> 02:47:22,309
we need to do this infrastructure
yeah infrastructure and now more than

9680
02:47:22,309 --> 02:47:22,319
yeah infrastructure and now more than
 

9681
02:47:22,319 --> 02:47:24,550
yeah infrastructure and now more than
ever it's been really upsetting to me on

9682
02:47:24,550 --> 02:47:24,560
ever it's been really upsetting to me on
 

9683
02:47:24,560 --> 02:47:26,550

the covet front

9684
02:47:26,550 --> 02:47:26,560
the covet front
 

9685
02:47:26,560 --> 02:47:28,070
the covet front
um there's

9686
02:47:28,070 --> 02:47:28,080
um there's
 

9687
02:47:28,080 --> 02:47:29,670
um there's
one of the solutions to kovit which

9688
02:47:29,670 --> 02:47:29,680
one of the solutions to kovit which
 

9689
02:47:29,680 --> 02:47:31,190
one of the solutions to kovit which
seems obvious to me

9690
02:47:31,190 --> 02:47:31,200
seems obvious to me
 

9691
02:47:31,200 --> 02:47:33,510
seems obvious to me
from the very beginning that nobody is

9692
02:47:33,510 --> 02:47:33,520
from the very beginning that nobody is
 

9693
02:47:33,520 --> 02:47:34,790
from the very beginning that nobody is
supposed to

9694
02:47:34,790 --> 02:47:34,800
supposed to
 

9695
02:47:34,800 --> 02:47:37,030
supposed to
it's one of the only bipartisan things

9696
02:47:37,030 --> 02:47:37,040
it's one of the only bipartisan things
 

9697
02:47:37,040 --> 02:47:38,710
it's one of the only bipartisan things
is

9698
02:47:38,710 --> 02:47:38,720
is
 

9699
02:47:38,720 --> 02:47:41,429
is
at home testing rapid home testing

9700
02:47:41,429 --> 02:47:41,439
at home testing rapid home testing
 

9701
02:47:41,439 --> 02:47:43,349
at home testing rapid home testing
there's no reason

9702
02:47:43,349 --> 02:47:43,359
there's no reason
 

9703
02:47:43,359 --> 02:47:45,590
there's no reason
why at the government level we couldn't

9704
02:47:45,590 --> 02:47:45,600
why at the government level we couldn't
 

9705
02:47:45,600 --> 02:47:47,110
why at the government level we couldn't
manufacture hundreds of millions of

9706
02:47:47,110 --> 02:47:47,120
manufacture hundreds of millions of
 

9707
02:47:47,120 --> 02:47:49,510
manufacture hundreds of millions of
tests a month there's no reason starting

9708
02:47:49,510 --> 02:47:49,520
tests a month there's no reason starting
 

9709
02:47:49,520 --> 02:47:51,190
tests a month there's no reason starting
in may 2020

9710
02:47:51,190 --> 02:47:51,200
in may 2020
 

9711
02:47:51,200 --> 02:47:53,429
in may 2020
and that gives power

9712
02:47:53,429 --> 02:47:53,439
and that gives power
 

9713
02:47:53,439 --> 02:47:55,190
and that gives power
to a country that values freedom that

9714
02:47:55,190 --> 02:47:55,200
to a country that values freedom that
 

9715
02:47:55,200 --> 02:47:56,469
to a country that values freedom that
gives power information to each

9716
02:47:56,469 --> 02:47:56,479
gives power information to each
 

9717
02:47:56,479 --> 02:47:57,830
gives power information to each
individual to know whether they have

9718
02:47:57,830 --> 02:47:57,840
individual to know whether they have
 

9719
02:47:57,840 --> 02:47:59,110
individual to know whether they have
covert or not

9720
02:47:59,110 --> 02:47:59,120
covert or not
 

9721
02:47:59,120 --> 02:48:01,110
covert or not
so

9722
02:48:01,110 --> 02:48:01,120
so
 

9723
02:48:01,120 --> 02:48:02,710
so

and so on
it's not just a technology problem

10096
02:54:30,870 --> 02:54:30,880
it's not just a technology problem
 

10097
02:54:30,880 --> 02:54:33,670
it's not just a technology problem
it's it's this um

it's the uh
the robot essentially silencing the

because it's lowering their wage making
 

10109
02:54:43,279 --> 02:54:45,830
because it's lowering their wage making
themselves more and giving them no tools

10110
02:54:45,830 --> 02:54:45,840
themselves more and giving them no tools
 

10111
02:54:45,840 --> 02:54:48,870
themselves more and giving them no tools
of how to escape that suffering

10112
02:54:48,870 --> 02:54:48,880
of how to escape that suffering
 

10113
02:54:48,880 --> 02:54:52,309
of how to escape that suffering
is there something um

is there something um
i mean it even gets into the question of

10116
02:54:54,150 --> 02:54:54,160
i mean it even gets into the question of
 

10117
02:54:54,160 --> 02:54:58,309
i mean it even gets into the question of
meaning you know so money is one thing

10118

what makes us happy in life you know a
lot of those

10124

lot of those
 

10125
02:55:02,800 --> 02:55:04,469
lot of those
uh

10126
02:55:04,469 --> 02:55:04,479
uh
 

10127
02:55:04,479 --> 02:55:06,230
uh
truckers

10128
02:55:06,230 --> 02:55:06,240
truckers
 

10129
02:55:06,240 --> 02:55:07,910
truckers
the set of jobs they've had in their

10130
02:55:07,910 --> 02:55:07,920
the set of jobs they've had in their
 

10131
02:55:07,920 --> 02:55:10,070
the set of jobs they've had in their
life were defining to them as human

10132
02:55:10,070 --> 02:55:10,080
life were defining to them as human
 

10133
02:55:10,080 --> 02:55:12,230
life were defining to them as human
beings

10134
02:55:12,230 --> 02:55:12,240
beings
 

10135
02:55:12,240 --> 02:55:14,710
beings
and so and the question with automation

10136
02:55:14,710 --> 02:55:14,720
and so and the question with automation
 

10137
02:55:14,720 --> 02:55:17,510
and so and the question with automation
is is not just how do we have a

10138
02:55:17,510 --> 02:55:17,520
is is not just how do we have a

and
for me

10152
02:55:30,790 --> 02:55:30,800
for me
 

10153
02:55:30,800 --> 02:55:34,230
for me
the hope the hope is that

10154
02:55:34,230 --> 02:55:34,240
the hope the hope is that
 

10155
02:55:34,240 --> 02:55:35,750
the hope the hope is that
ai

10156
02:55:35,750 --> 02:55:35,760
ai
 

10157
02:55:35,760 --> 02:55:38,550
ai
and automation will provide other jobs

10158
02:55:38,550 --> 02:55:38,560
and automation will provide other jobs
 

10159
02:55:38,560 --> 02:55:42,830
and automation will provide other jobs
will be that will be a source of meaning

10160
02:55:42,830 --> 02:55:42,840

 

10161
02:55:42,840 --> 02:55:44,870

um but

10162
02:55:44,870 --> 02:55:44,880
um but
 

10163
02:55:44,880 --> 02:55:46,550
um but
coupled with that hope is that there

10164
02:55:46,550 --> 02:55:46,560
coupled with that hope is that there
 

10165
02:55:46,560 --> 02:55:48,070
coupled with that hope is that there
will not be too much suffering in the

10166
02:55:48,070 --> 02:55:48,080
will not be too much suffering in the
 

10167
02:55:48,080 --> 02:55:49,190
will not be too much suffering in the
transition

10168
02:55:49,190 --> 02:55:49,200
transition
 

10169
02:55:49,200 --> 02:55:51,269
transition
and that's not obvious from as from the

10170
02:55:51,269 --> 02:55:51,279
and that's not obvious from as from the
 

10171
02:55:51,279 --> 02:55:53,269
and that's not obvious from as from the
people you've spoken with

10172
02:55:53,269 --> 02:55:53,279
people you've spoken with
 

10173
02:55:53,279 --> 02:55:55,429
people you've spoken with
i mean i think we need to differentiate

10174
02:55:55,429 --> 02:55:55,439
i mean i think we need to differentiate
 

10175
02:55:55,439 --> 02:55:56,950
i mean i think we need to differentiate
between the effects of technology and

10176
02:55:56,950 --> 02:55:56,960
between the effects of technology and
 

10177
02:55:56,960 --> 02:55:58,790
between the effects of technology and
the effects of capitalism right and and

10178
02:55:58,790 --> 02:55:58,800
the effects of capitalism right and and
 

10179
02:55:58,800 --> 02:56:02,070
the effects of capitalism right and and
they are you know um the the fact that

10180
02:56:02,070 --> 02:56:02,080
they are you know um the the fact that
 

10181
02:56:02,080 --> 02:56:04,469
they are you know um the the fact that
workers don't have a lot of power right

10182
02:56:04,469 --> 02:56:04,479
workers don't have a lot of power right
 

10183
02:56:04,479 --> 02:56:07,269
workers don't have a lot of power right
um in this system matters now we had a

10184
02:56:07,269 --> 02:56:07,279
um in this system matters now we had a
 

10185
02:56:07,279 --> 02:56:09,030
um in this system matters now we had a
system right and that's why i would say

10186
02:56:09,030 --> 02:56:09,040
system right and that's why i would say
 

10187
02:56:09,040 --> 02:56:10,309
system right and that's why i would say
you know go to that

10188
02:56:10,309 --> 02:56:10,319
you know go to that
 

10189
02:56:10,319 --> 02:56:12,469
you know go to that

to trucks at all
 

10749
03:06:00,640 --> 03:06:02,070
to trucks at all
there's uh

10750

there's uh
 

10751
03:06:02,080 --> 03:06:04,630
there's uh
at a certain point autonomous trucks

10752
03:06:04,630 --> 03:06:04,640
at a certain point autonomous trucks
 

10753
03:06:04,640 --> 03:06:06,469
at a certain point autonomous trucks
are just robots

10754

are just robots
 

10755
03:06:06,479 --> 03:06:07,910
are just robots
and then it starts getting into a

10756
03:06:07,910 --> 03:06:07,920
and then it starts getting into a
 

10757
03:06:07,920 --> 03:06:10,469
and then it starts getting into a
conversation about the roles of robots

10758
03:06:10,469 --> 03:06:10,479
conversation about the roles of robots
 

10759

humans and have somehow found themselves
 

10771
03:06:23,680 --> 03:06:26,150
humans and have somehow found themselves
studying robots yeah no it's crazy i

10772
03:06:26,150 --> 03:06:26,160
studying robots yeah no it's crazy i
 

10773
03:06:26,160 --> 03:06:29,190
studying robots yeah no it's crazy i
mean even four four or five years ago i

10774
03:06:29,190 --> 03:06:29,200
mean even four four or five years ago i
 

10775
03:06:29,200 --> 03:06:30,630
mean even four four or five years ago i
i would if you had asked me if i was

10776
03:06:30,630 --> 03:06:30,640
i would if you had asked me if i was
 

10777
03:06:30,640 --> 03:06:32,070
i would if you had asked me if i was
going to be studying trucking still i

10778
03:06:32,070 --> 03:06:32,080
going to be studying trucking still i
 

10779
03:06:32,080 --> 03:06:33,349
going to be studying trucking still i
would have said no

10780
03:06:33,349 --> 03:06:33,359
would have said no
 

10781
03:06:33,359 --> 03:06:35,670
would have said no
and so my advice is i think if i was

10782
03:06:35,670 --> 03:06:35,680
and so my advice is i think if i was
 

10783
03:06:35,680 --> 03:06:38,230
and so my advice is i think if i was
gonna give advice you know um is you

10784
03:06:38,230 --> 03:06:38,240
gonna give advice you know um is you
 

10785
03:06:38,240 --> 03:06:40,070
gonna give advice you know um is you
know you can't connect the dots looking

10786
03:06:40,070 --> 03:06:40,080
know you can't connect the dots looking
 

10787
03:06:40,080 --> 03:06:42,070
know you can't connect the dots looking
forward you just gotta follow what

10788
03:06:42,070 --> 03:06:42,080
forward you just gotta follow what
 

10789
03:06:42,080 --> 03:06:43,990
forward you just gotta follow what
interests you you know and

10790
03:06:43,990 --> 03:06:44,000
interests you you know and
 

10791
03:06:44,000 --> 03:06:47,670
interests you you know and
and i think we we we downplay right that

language right to learn robotics um
 

10807
03:07:00,800 --> 03:07:02,790
