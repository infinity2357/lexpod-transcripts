this what people are doing in research
 

111
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,100
this what people are doing in research
and scale it to what Google has in terms

112
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:19,110
and scale it to what Google has in terms
 

113
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:23,360
and scale it to what Google has in terms
of the compute power and also put that

114
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:23,370
of the compute power and also put that
 

115
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:24,860
of the compute power and also put that
kind of data together what does it mean

116
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:24,870
kind of data together what does it mean
 

117
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:26,750
kind of data together what does it mean
and so far the results had been if you

118
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:26,760
and so far the results had been if you
 

119
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,539
and so far the results had been if you
scale the compute scale the data it does

120
00:02:29,539 --> 00:02:29,549
scale the compute scale the data it does
 

121
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:31,759
scale the compute scale the data it does
better and would that work and so that

122
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:31,769
better and would that work and so that
 

123
00:02:31,769 --> 00:02:33,650
better and would that work and so that
that was the first year or two can we

that was the first year or two can we
 

125
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,810
that was the first year or two can we
prove that outright and with disbelief

126
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:35,820
prove that outright and with disbelief
 

127
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,789
prove that outright and with disbelief
and we started the first year we got

128

and we started the first year we got
 

129
00:02:37,799 --> 00:02:39,860
and we started the first year we got
some early wins which which is always

00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:20,640
dream of what this could become like
 

165
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,250
dream of what this could become like
what were there echoes of this

166
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:22,260
what were there echoes of this
 

167
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,470
what were there echoes of this
open-source tensorflow community that

168
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:24,480
open-source tensorflow community that
 

169
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,380
open-source tensorflow community that
might be brought in was there a sense of

170
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:27,390
might be brought in was there a sense of
 

171
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:30,770
might be brought in was there a sense of
TP use was there a sense of like machine

172
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:30,780
TP use was there a sense of like machine
 

173
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,240
TP use was there a sense of like machine
learning is not going to be at the core

174
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:32,250
learning is not going to be at the core
 

175
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:34,940
learning is not going to be at the core
the entire company is going to grow into

176
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:34,950
the entire company is going to grow into
 

177
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:35,600
the entire company is going to grow into
that direction

178
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:35,610
that direction
 

179
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:38,390
that direction
yeah I think so that was interesting in

180
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:38,400
yeah I think so that was interesting in
 

181
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,059
yeah I think so that was interesting in
like if I think back to 2012 or 2011 and

182
00:03:41,059 --> 00:03:41,069
like if I think back to 2012 or 2011 and
 

183
00:03:41,069 --> 00:03:44,660
like if I think back to 2012 or 2011 and
first was can we scale it in in the year

184
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:44,670
first was can we scale it in in the year
 

185
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:46,460
first was can we scale it in in the year
or so we had started scaling it to

186
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:46,470
or so we had started scaling it to
 

187
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:48,229
or so we had started scaling it to
hundreds and thousands of machines in

188
00:03:48,229 --> 00:03:48,239
hundreds and thousands of machines in
 

189
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:49,670
hundreds and thousands of machines in
fact we had some runs even going to

190
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:49,680
fact we had some runs even going to
 

191
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,949
fact we had some runs even going to
10,000 machines and all of those shows

192
00:03:51,949 --> 00:03:51,959
10,000 machines and all of those shows
 

193
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:55,339
10,000 machines and all of those shows
great promise in terms of machine

194
00:03:55,339 --> 00:03:55,349
great promise in terms of machine
 

195
00:03:55,349 --> 00:03:57,500
great promise in terms of machine
learning at CoCo the good thing was

196
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:57,510
learning at CoCo the good thing was
 

197
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:58,790
learning at CoCo the good thing was
Google's been doing machine learning for

198
00:03:58,790 --> 00:03:58,800
Google's been doing machine learning for
 

199
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:02,600
Google's been doing machine learning for
a long time deep learning was new but as

200
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:02,610
a long time deep learning was new but as
 

201
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:04,610
a long time deep learning was new but as
we scale this up pretty sure that yes

202
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:04,620
we scale this up pretty sure that yes
 

203
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,380
we scale this up pretty sure that yes
that was possible and it was going to

204
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:06,390
that was possible and it was going to
 

205
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:08,059
that was possible and it was going to
impact lots of things

206
00:04:08,059 --> 00:04:08,069
impact lots of things
 

207
00:04:08,069 --> 00:04:10,280
impact lots of things
we started seeing real products wanting

208
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:10,290
we started seeing real products wanting
 

209
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:12,140
we started seeing real products wanting
to use this again speech was the first

210
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:12,150
to use this again speech was the first
 

211
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:14,509
to use this again speech was the first
there were image things that photos came

212
00:04:14,509 --> 00:04:14,519
there were image things that photos came
 

213
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:17,539
there were image things that photos came
out of in many other products as well so

214
00:04:17,539 --> 00:04:17,549
out of in many other products as well so
 

215
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:21,740
out of in many other products as well so
that was exciting as we went into with

216
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:21,750
that was exciting as we went into with
 

217
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:24,020
that was exciting as we went into with
that a couple of years externally also

218
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:24,030
that a couple of years externally also
 

219
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:26,090
that a couple of years externally also
academia started to you know there was

220
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:26,100
academia started to you know there was
 

221
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,800
academia started to you know there was
lots of push on okay deep learning is

222
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:27,810
lots of push on okay deep learning is
 

223
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:29,420
lots of push on okay deep learning is
interesting we should be doing more and

224
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:29,430
interesting we should be doing more and
 

225
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:34,159
interesting we should be doing more and
so on and so by 2014 we were looking at

226
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:34,169
so on and so by 2014 we were looking at
 

227
00:04:34,169 --> 00:04:36,110
so on and so by 2014 we were looking at
okay this is a big thing it's gonna grow

228
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:36,120
okay this is a big thing it's gonna grow
 

229
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:39,170
okay this is a big thing it's gonna grow
and not just internally externally as

230
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:39,180
and not just internally externally as
 

231
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,240
and not just internally externally as
well yes maybe Google's ahead of where

232
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:41,250
well yes maybe Google's ahead of where
 

233
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:43,520
well yes maybe Google's ahead of where
everybody is but there's a lot to do so

234
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:43,530
everybody is but there's a lot to do so
 

235
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:45,890
everybody is but there's a lot to do so
I wanted this start to make sense and

236
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:45,900
I wanted this start to make sense and
 

237
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,779
I wanted this start to make sense and
come together so the decision to

238
00:04:47,779 --> 00:04:47,789
come together so the decision to
 

239
00:04:47,789 --> 00:04:50,570
come together so the decision to
open-source I was just chatting with the

240
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:50,580
open-source I was just chatting with the
 

241
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,700
open-source I was just chatting with the
Chris flattener about this the decision

242
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:52,710
Chris flattener about this the decision
 

243
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:55,219
Chris flattener about this the decision
go open-source with tons of flow I would

244
00:04:55,219 --> 00:04:55,229
go open-source with tons of flow I would
 

245
00:04:55,229 --> 00:04:58,010
go open-source with tons of flow I would
say so for me personally seems to be one

246
00:04:58,010 --> 00:04:58,020
say so for me personally seems to be one
 

247
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:00,080
say so for me personally seems to be one
of the big seminal moments and all the

248
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:00,090
of the big seminal moments and all the
 

249
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:02,180
of the big seminal moments and all the
software engineering ever I think that's

250
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:02,190
software engineering ever I think that's
 

251
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:04,520
software engineering ever I think that's
a when a large company like Google

252
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:04,530
a when a large company like Google
 

253
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:06,439
a when a large company like Google
decides to take a large project that

254
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:06,449
decides to take a large project that
 

255
00:05:06,449 --> 00:05:10,000
decides to take a large project that
many lawyers might argue has a lot of IP

256
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,010
many lawyers might argue has a lot of IP
 

257
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:12,710
many lawyers might argue has a lot of IP
just decide to go open-source with it

258
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:12,720
just decide to go open-source with it
 

259
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,719
just decide to go open-source with it
and in so doing lead the entire world

260
00:05:14,719 --> 00:05:14,729
and in so doing lead the entire world
 

261
00:05:14,729 --> 00:05:16,430
and in so doing lead the entire world
and saying you know what open innovation

262
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:16,440
and saying you know what open innovation
 

263
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:19,040
and saying you know what open innovation
is is is a pretty powerful thing and

264
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,050
is is is a pretty powerful thing and
 

265
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:23,690
is is is a pretty powerful thing and
it's okay to do that that was I mean

266
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:23,700
it's okay to do that that was I mean
 

267
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:26,029
it's okay to do that that was I mean
that's an incredible incredible moment

268
00:05:26,029 --> 00:05:26,039
that's an incredible incredible moment
 

269
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:27,860
that's an incredible incredible moment
in time so do you remember those

270
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:27,870
in time so do you remember those
 

271
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,839
in time so do you remember those
discussions happening the other open

272
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:29,849
discussions happening the other open
 

273
00:05:29,849 --> 00:05:31,790
discussions happening the other open
source should be happening what was that

274
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:31,800
source should be happening what was that
 

275
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:35,420
source should be happening what was that
like I would say I think so the initial

276
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:35,430
like I would say I think so the initial
 

277
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:37,940
like I would say I think so the initial
idea came from Jeff who was a big

278
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:37,950
idea came from Jeff who was a big
 

279
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:40,219
idea came from Jeff who was a big
proponent of this I think it came off of

280
00:05:40,219 --> 00:05:40,229
proponent of this I think it came off of
 

281
00:05:40,229 --> 00:05:44,629
proponent of this I think it came off of
two big things one was research by his

282
00:05:44,629 --> 00:05:44,639
two big things one was research by his
 

283
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,320
two big things one was research by his
view at a research group we were putting

284
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:48,330
view at a research group we were putting
 

285
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:50,029
view at a research group we were putting
all our research out there if you wanted

286
00:05:50,029 --> 00:05:50,039
all our research out there if you wanted
 

287
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:51,469
all our research out there if you wanted
to we were building on others research

288
00:05:51,469 --> 00:05:51,479
to we were building on others research
 

289
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:54,080
to we were building on others research
and we wanted to push the state of the

290
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:54,090
and we wanted to push the state of the
 

291
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:55,760
and we wanted to push the state of the
art forward and part of that was to

292
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:55,770
art forward and part of that was to
 

293
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:57,860
art forward and part of that was to
share the research that's how I think

294
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:57,870
share the research that's how I think
 

295
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:58,940
share the research that's how I think
deep learning and machine learning has

296
00:05:58,940 --> 00:05:58,950
deep learning and machine learning has
 

297
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:00,580
deep learning and machine learning has
really grown so fast

298
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:00,590
really grown so fast
 

299
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:03,529
really grown so fast
so the next step was okay now word

300
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:03,539
so the next step was okay now word
 

301
00:06:03,539 --> 00:06:05,960
so the next step was okay now word
software help with that and it seemed

302
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:05,970
software help with that and it seemed
 

303
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:09,620
software help with that and it seemed
like they were existing a few libraries

304
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:09,630
like they were existing a few libraries
 

305
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:11,480
like they were existing a few libraries
out there they are hoping one torch

306
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:11,490
out there they are hoping one torch
 

307
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:14,300
out there they are hoping one torch
being other and a few others but they

308
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:14,310
being other and a few others but they
 

309
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:16,100
being other and a few others but they
were all done by academia and the level

310
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:16,110
were all done by academia and the level
 

311
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:18,560
were all done by academia and the level
was was significantly different

312
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:18,570
was was significantly different
 

313
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:20,570
was was significantly different
the other one was from a software

314
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:20,580
the other one was from a software
 

315
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:23,240
the other one was from a software
perspective Google had done lots of

316
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:23,250
perspective Google had done lots of
 

317
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:26,060
perspective Google had done lots of
software or that we'd used internally

318
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:26,070
software or that we'd used internally
 

319
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:29,180
software or that we'd used internally
you know and we published papers often

320
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:29,190
you know and we published papers often
 

321
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:31,820
you know and we published papers often
there was an open source project that

322
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:31,830
there was an open source project that
 

323
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:33,470
there was an open source project that
came out of that that somebody else

324
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:33,480
came out of that that somebody else
 

325
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,510
came out of that that somebody else
picked up that paper and implemented and

326
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:35,520
picked up that paper and implemented and
 

327
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,290
picked up that paper and implemented and
they were very successful back then it

328
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:39,300
they were very successful back then it
 

329
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,690
they were very successful back then it
was like okay there's Hadoop which has

330
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:41,700
was like okay there's Hadoop which has
 

331
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,460
was like okay there's Hadoop which has
come off of tech that we've built

332
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:43,470
come off of tech that we've built
 

333
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:45,470
come off of tech that we've built
we know the tech we've built is very

334
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:45,480
we know the tech we've built is very
 

335
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,510
we know the tech we've built is very
better for a number of different reasons

336
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:47,520
better for a number of different reasons
 

337
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,730
better for a number of different reasons
we've you know invested a lot of effort

338
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:49,740
we've you know invested a lot of effort
 

339
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:53,750
we've you know invested a lot of effort
intact and turns out we have Google

340
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:53,760
intact and turns out we have Google
 

341
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,120
intact and turns out we have Google
cloud and we are now not really

342
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:56,130
cloud and we are now not really
 

343
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:58,550
cloud and we are now not really
providing our tech but we are saying

344
00:06:58,550 --> 00:06:58,560
providing our tech but we are saying
 

345
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,800
providing our tech but we are saying
okay we have BigTable which was thought

346
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:00,810
okay we have BigTable which was thought
 

347
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:02,780
okay we have BigTable which was thought
is no thing we're going to now provide

348
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:02,790
is no thing we're going to now provide
 

349
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:05,360
is no thing we're going to now provide
HBase api's on top of that which isn't

350
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:05,370
HBase api's on top of that which isn't
 

351
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:07,190
HBase api's on top of that which isn't
as good but that's what everybody's used

352
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:07,200
as good but that's what everybody's used
 

353
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,350
as good but that's what everybody's used
to so there's there's like can we make

354
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:09,360
to so there's there's like can we make
 

355
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,510
to so there's there's like can we make
something that is better and really just

356
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:11,520
something that is better and really just
 

357
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,520
something that is better and really just
provide helps the community in lots of

358
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:13,530
provide helps the community in lots of
 

359
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:16,190
provide helps the community in lots of
ways but it also helps push the write a

360
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:16,200
ways but it also helps push the write a
 

361
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,980
ways but it also helps push the write a
good standard forward so how does cloud

362
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:18,990
good standard forward so how does cloud
 

363
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:21,110
good standard forward so how does cloud
fit into that there's a tensorflow open

364
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:21,120
fit into that there's a tensorflow open
 

365
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,720
fit into that there's a tensorflow open
source write library and how does the

366
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:23,730
source write library and how does the
 

367
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:26,750
source write library and how does the
fact that you can use so many of the

368
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:26,760
fact that you can use so many of the
 

369
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,490
fact that you can use so many of the
resources that Google provides and the

370
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:28,500
resources that Google provides and the
 

371
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:32,540
resources that Google provides and the
cloud fit into that strategy so tensile

372
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:32,550
cloud fit into that strategy so tensile
 

373
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:34,250
cloud fit into that strategy so tensile
flow itself is open and you can use it

374
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:34,260
flow itself is open and you can use it
 

375
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:35,510
flow itself is open and you can use it
anywhere right and we want to make sure

376
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:35,520
anywhere right and we want to make sure
 

377
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,230
anywhere right and we want to make sure
that continues to be the case on Google

378
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:39,240
that continues to be the case on Google
 

379
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:42,290
that continues to be the case on Google
cloud we do make sure that there's lots

380
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:42,300
cloud we do make sure that there's lots
 

381
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,910
cloud we do make sure that there's lots
of integrations with everything else and

382
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:43,920
of integrations with everything else and
 

383
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,350
of integrations with everything else and
we want to make sure that it works

384
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:45,360
we want to make sure that it works
 

385
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,570
we want to make sure that it works
really really well there so you're

386
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:47,580
really really well there so you're
 

387
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:50,690
really really well there so you're
leaving the tensorflow effort you tell

388
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:50,700
leaving the tensorflow effort you tell
 

389
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:51,830
leaving the tensorflow effort you tell
me the history and the timeline of

390
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:51,840
me the history and the timeline of
 

391
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,410
me the history and the timeline of
transfer flow project in terms of major

392
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:54,420
transfer flow project in terms of major
 

393
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:56,900
transfer flow project in terms of major
design decisions so like the open source

394
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:56,910
design decisions so like the open source
 

395
00:07:56,910 --> 00:08:00,830
design decisions so like the open source
decision but really you know what to

396
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:00,840
decision but really you know what to
 

397
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,450
decision but really you know what to
include and not there's this incredible

398
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:02,460
include and not there's this incredible
 

399
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,250
include and not there's this incredible
ecosystem that I'd like to talk about

400
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:04,260
ecosystem that I'd like to talk about
 

401
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:07,190
ecosystem that I'd like to talk about
there's all these parts but what if you

402
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:07,200
there's all these parts but what if you
 

403
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:12,680
there's all these parts but what if you
just some sample moments that defined

404
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:12,690
just some sample moments that defined
 

405
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:14,510
just some sample moments that defined
what tensorflow eventually became

406
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:14,520
what tensorflow eventually became
 

407
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,580
what tensorflow eventually became
through its I don't know if you were a

408
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:16,590
through its I don't know if you were a
 

409
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:19,160
through its I don't know if you were a
lot to say history when it's just

410
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:19,170
lot to say history when it's just
 

411
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:20,840
lot to say history when it's just
but in deep learning everything moves so

412
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:20,850
but in deep learning everything moves so
 

413
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:22,730
but in deep learning everything moves so
fast in just a few years is already

414
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:22,740
fast in just a few years is already
 

415
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:28,250
fast in just a few years is already
history yes yes so looking back we were

416
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:28,260
history yes yes so looking back we were
 

417
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:30,680
history yes yes so looking back we were
building tensor flow I guess we open

418
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:30,690
building tensor flow I guess we open
 

419
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:32,060
building tensor flow I guess we open
sourced it in 20

420
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:32,070
sourced it in 20
 

421
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:35,480
sourced it in 20
15 November 2015 we started on it

422
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:35,490
15 November 2015 we started on it
 

423
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:40,790
15 November 2015 we started on it
in summer of 2014 I guess and somewhere

424
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:40,800
in summer of 2014 I guess and somewhere
 

425
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,580
in summer of 2014 I guess and somewhere
like three to six late 2014 by then we

426
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:43,590
like three to six late 2014 by then we
 

427
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:45,530
like three to six late 2014 by then we
had decided that okay there's a high

428
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:45,540
had decided that okay there's a high
 

429
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:47,360
had decided that okay there's a high
likelihood we'll open source it so we

430
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:47,370
likelihood we'll open source it so we
 

431
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:49,160
likelihood we'll open source it so we
started thinking about that and making

432
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:49,170
started thinking about that and making
 

433
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:52,949
started thinking about that and making
sure we're heading down that path

434
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:52,959
sure we're heading down that path
 

435
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:56,530
sure we're heading down that path
at that point by that point we had seen

436
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:56,540
at that point by that point we had seen
 

437
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:58,240
at that point by that point we had seen
a few you know lots of different use

438
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:58,250
a few you know lots of different use
 

439
00:08:58,250 --> 00:08:59,920
a few you know lots of different use
cases at Google so there were things

440
00:08:59,920 --> 00:08:59,930
cases at Google so there were things
 

441
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:02,559
cases at Google so there were things
like okay yes you want to run in a large

442
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:02,569
like okay yes you want to run in a large
 

443
00:09:02,569 --> 00:09:05,259
like okay yes you want to run in a large
scale in the data center yes we need to

444
00:09:05,259 --> 00:09:05,269
scale in the data center yes we need to
 

445
00:09:05,269 --> 00:09:07,629
scale in the data center yes we need to
support different kind of hardware we

446
00:09:07,629 --> 00:09:07,639
support different kind of hardware we
 

447
00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:10,689
support different kind of hardware we
had GPUs at that point we had our first

448
00:09:10,689 --> 00:09:10,699
had GPUs at that point we had our first
 

449
00:09:10,699 --> 00:09:12,759
had GPUs at that point we had our first
TPU at that point er was about to come

450
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:12,769
TPU at that point er was about to come
 

451
00:09:12,769 --> 00:09:15,269
TPU at that point er was about to come
out you know roughly around that time so

452
00:09:15,269 --> 00:09:15,279
out you know roughly around that time so
 

453
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:19,720
out you know roughly around that time so
the design sort of included those we had

454
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:19,730
the design sort of included those we had
 

455
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:22,960
the design sort of included those we had
started to push on mobile so we were

456
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:22,970
started to push on mobile so we were
 

457
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:25,540
started to push on mobile so we were
running models on mobile at that point

458
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:25,550
running models on mobile at that point
 

459
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:28,329
running models on mobile at that point
people were customizing chord so we

460
00:09:28,329 --> 00:09:28,339
people were customizing chord so we
 

461
00:09:28,339 --> 00:09:29,620
people were customizing chord so we
wanted to make sure tensorflow could

462
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:29,630
wanted to make sure tensorflow could
 

463
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:31,449
wanted to make sure tensorflow could
support that as well so that that sort

464
00:09:31,449 --> 00:09:31,459
support that as well so that that sort
 

465
00:09:31,459 --> 00:09:34,780
support that as well so that that sort
of became part of that overall design

466
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:34,790
of became part of that overall design
 

467
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:37,509
of became part of that overall design
when you say mobile you mean like pretty

468
00:09:37,509 --> 00:09:37,519
when you say mobile you mean like pretty
 

469
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,249
when you say mobile you mean like pretty
complicated algorithms running on the

470
00:09:39,249 --> 00:09:39,259
complicated algorithms running on the
 

471
00:09:39,259 --> 00:09:41,829
complicated algorithms running on the
phone that's correct so so then you have

472
00:09:41,829 --> 00:09:41,839
phone that's correct so so then you have
 

473
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:44,319
phone that's correct so so then you have
a model that you deploy on the phone and

474
00:09:44,319 --> 00:09:44,329
a model that you deploy on the phone and
 

475
00:09:44,329 --> 00:09:46,210
a model that you deploy on the phone and
run it their authority at that time

476
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:46,220
run it their authority at that time
 

477
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,829
run it their authority at that time
there was the ideas of running machine

478
00:09:47,829 --> 00:09:47,839
there was the ideas of running machine
 

479
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:49,389
there was the ideas of running machine
learning on the phone that's correct we

480
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:49,399
learning on the phone that's correct we
 

481
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:51,430
learning on the phone that's correct we
already had a couple of products that

482
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:51,440
already had a couple of products that
 

483
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,280
already had a couple of products that
were doing that by then in those cases

484
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:54,290
were doing that by then in those cases
 

485
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:57,100
were doing that by then in those cases
we had basically customized handcrafted

486
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:57,110
we had basically customized handcrafted
 

487
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:59,410
we had basically customized handcrafted
code or some internal libraries that

488
00:09:59,410 --> 00:09:59,420
code or some internal libraries that
 

489
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:01,600
code or some internal libraries that
were using so I was actually at Google

490
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:01,610
were using so I was actually at Google
 

491
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:03,579
were using so I was actually at Google
during this time in a parallel I guess

492
00:10:03,579 --> 00:10:03,589
during this time in a parallel I guess
 

493
00:10:03,589 --> 00:10:06,400
during this time in a parallel I guess
University but we were using piano and

494
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:06,410
University but we were using piano and
 

495
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:09,939
University but we were using piano and
cafe yeah we did we was there some

496
00:10:09,939 --> 00:10:09,949
cafe yeah we did we was there some
 

497
00:10:09,949 --> 00:10:11,769
cafe yeah we did we was there some
degree to which you were bouncing I like

498
00:10:11,769 --> 00:10:11,779
degree to which you were bouncing I like
 

499
00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:14,860
degree to which you were bouncing I like
trying to see what cafe was offering

500
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:14,870
trying to see what cafe was offering
 

501
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:17,110
trying to see what cafe was offering
people trying to see what Theano was

502
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:17,120
people trying to see what Theano was
 

503
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,759
people trying to see what Theano was
offering that you want to make sure

504
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:18,769
offering that you want to make sure
 

505
00:10:18,769 --> 00:10:21,490
offering that you want to make sure
you're delivering on whatever that is

506
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:21,500
you're delivering on whatever that is
 

507
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,360
you're delivering on whatever that is
perhaps the Python part of thing maybe

508
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:24,370
perhaps the Python part of thing maybe
 

509
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:26,860
perhaps the Python part of thing maybe
did that influence any design decisions

510
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:26,870
did that influence any design decisions
 

511
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:29,470
did that influence any design decisions
um totally so when we built this belief

512
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:29,480
um totally so when we built this belief
 

513
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,749
um totally so when we built this belief
and some of that was in parallel with

514
00:10:31,749 --> 00:10:31,759
and some of that was in parallel with
 

515
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:33,610
and some of that was in parallel with
some of these libraries coming up I mean

516
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:33,620
some of these libraries coming up I mean
 

517
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:37,949
some of these libraries coming up I mean
Theano itself is older but we were

518
00:10:37,949 --> 00:10:37,959
Theano itself is older but we were
 

519
00:10:37,959 --> 00:10:40,569
Theano itself is older but we were
building this belief focused on our

520
00:10:40,569 --> 00:10:40,579
building this belief focused on our
 

521
00:10:40,579 --> 00:10:41,949
building this belief focused on our
internal thing because our systems were

522
00:10:41,949 --> 00:10:41,959
internal thing because our systems were
 

523
00:10:41,959 --> 00:10:43,720
internal thing because our systems were
very different by the time we got to

524
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:43,730
very different by the time we got to
 

525
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:46,059
very different by the time we got to
this we looked at a number of libraries

526
00:10:46,059 --> 00:10:46,069
this we looked at a number of libraries
 

527
00:10:46,069 --> 00:10:48,340
this we looked at a number of libraries
that were out there Tiano there were

528
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:48,350
that were out there Tiano there were
 

529
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:50,350
that were out there Tiano there were
folks in the group who had experience

530
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:50,360
folks in the group who had experience
 

531
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,660
folks in the group who had experience
with torch with Lua there were folks

532
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:52,670
with torch with Lua there were folks
 

533
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:55,300
with torch with Lua there were folks
here who had seen cafe I mean actually

534
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:55,310
here who had seen cafe I mean actually
 

535
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:58,680
here who had seen cafe I mean actually
Yangcheng was here as well

536
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:58,690
Yangcheng was here as well
 

537
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:03,300
Yangcheng was here as well
there's one other libraries I think we

538
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:03,310
there's one other libraries I think we
 

539
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:05,310
there's one other libraries I think we
looked at a number of things might even

540
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:05,320
looked at a number of things might even
 

541
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,930
looked at a number of things might even
have looked at China back then I'm

542
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:06,940
have looked at China back then I'm
 

543
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:08,420
have looked at China back then I'm
trying to remember if across there

544
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:08,430
trying to remember if across there
 

545
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:11,400
trying to remember if across there
in fact the I we did discuss ideas

546
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:11,410
in fact the I we did discuss ideas
 

547
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:13,500
in fact the I we did discuss ideas
around okay should we have a graph or

548
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:13,510
around okay should we have a graph or
 

549
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:18,600
around okay should we have a graph or
not and they were so supporting all

550
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:18,610
not and they were so supporting all
 

551
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:20,460
not and they were so supporting all
these together was definitely you know

552
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:20,470
these together was definitely you know
 

553
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:22,560
these together was definitely you know
there were key decisions that we wanted

554
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:22,570
there were key decisions that we wanted
 

555
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:25,860
there were key decisions that we wanted
we we had seen limitations in our priors

556
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:25,870
we we had seen limitations in our priors
 

557
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:30,090
we we had seen limitations in our priors
just believe things a few of them were

558
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:30,100
just believe things a few of them were
 

559
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,950
just believe things a few of them were
just in terms of research was moving so

560
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:31,960
just in terms of research was moving so
 

561
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,950
just in terms of research was moving so
fast we wanted the flexibility we want

562
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:34,960
fast we wanted the flexibility we want
 

563
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,420
fast we wanted the flexibility we want
the hardware was changing fast we

564
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:36,430
the hardware was changing fast we
 

565
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:38,280
the hardware was changing fast we
expected to change that so that those

566
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:38,290
expected to change that so that those
 

567
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:41,140
expected to change that so that those
probably were two things

568
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:41,150
probably were two things
 

569
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:43,180
probably were two things
and yeah I think the flexibility in

570
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:43,190
and yeah I think the flexibility in
 

571
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:44,710
and yeah I think the flexibility in
terms of being able to express all kinds

572
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:44,720
terms of being able to express all kinds
 

573
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,060
terms of being able to express all kinds
of crazy things was definitely a big one

574
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:46,070
of crazy things was definitely a big one
 

575
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:48,519
of crazy things was definitely a big one
then so what the the graph decisions

576
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:48,529
then so what the the graph decisions
 

577
00:11:48,529 --> 00:11:50,820
then so what the the graph decisions
without with moving towards tensorflow

578
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:50,830
without with moving towards tensorflow
 

579
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:54,760
without with moving towards tensorflow
2.0 there's more by default will be

580
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:54,770
2.0 there's more by default will be
 

581
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:57,850
2.0 there's more by default will be
eager execution so sort of hiding the

582
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:57,860
eager execution so sort of hiding the
 

583
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,680
eager execution so sort of hiding the
graph a little bit you know because it's

584
00:11:59,680 --> 00:11:59,690
graph a little bit you know because it's
 

585
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:02,110
graph a little bit you know because it's
less intuitive in terms of the way

586
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:02,120
less intuitive in terms of the way
 

587
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,340
less intuitive in terms of the way
people develop and so on

588
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:03,350
people develop and so on
 

589
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:05,200
people develop and so on
what was that discussion like with in

590
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:05,210
what was that discussion like with in
 

591
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:06,700
what was that discussion like with in
terms of using graphs

592
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:06,710
terms of using graphs
 

593
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:08,740
terms of using graphs
it seemed its kind of the Theano way

594
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:08,750
it seemed its kind of the Theano way
 

595
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:12,190
it seemed its kind of the Theano way
they seemed the obvious choice so I

596
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:12,200
they seemed the obvious choice so I
 

597
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,980
they seemed the obvious choice so I
think where it came from was are like

598
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:14,990
think where it came from was are like
 

599
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:17,260
think where it came from was are like
this belief had a graph like thing as

600
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:17,270
this belief had a graph like thing as
 

601
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:19,090
this belief had a graph like thing as
well a much more simple it wasn't a

602
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:19,100
well a much more simple it wasn't a
 

603
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,260
well a much more simple it wasn't a
general graph it was more like a

604
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:20,270
general graph it was more like a
 

605
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:23,710
general graph it was more like a
straight line you know thing more like

606
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:23,720
straight line you know thing more like
 

607
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,390
straight line you know thing more like
what you might think of cafe I guess in

608
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:25,400
what you might think of cafe I guess in
 

609
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:29,110
what you might think of cafe I guess in
that sense but the graph was and we

610
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:29,120
that sense but the graph was and we
 

611
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,519
that sense but the graph was and we
always were cared about the production

612
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:30,529
always were cared about the production
 

613
00:12:30,529 --> 00:12:32,170
always were cared about the production
stuff like even with disbelief we were

614
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:32,180
stuff like even with disbelief we were
 

615
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:33,579
stuff like even with disbelief we were
deploying a whole bunch of stuff in

616
00:12:33,579 --> 00:12:33,589
deploying a whole bunch of stuff in
 

617
00:12:33,589 --> 00:12:36,460
deploying a whole bunch of stuff in
production so graph did come from that

618
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:36,470
production so graph did come from that
 

619
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:38,500
production so graph did come from that
when we thought of okay should we do

620
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:38,510
when we thought of okay should we do
 

621
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:40,300
when we thought of okay should we do
that in Python and we experiment with it

622
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:40,310
that in Python and we experiment with it
 

623
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:42,970
that in Python and we experiment with it
some ideas where it looked a lot simpler

624
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:42,980
some ideas where it looked a lot simpler
 

625
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:46,930
some ideas where it looked a lot simpler
to use but not having a graph went okay

626
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:46,940
to use but not having a graph went okay
 

627
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,850
to use but not having a graph went okay
how do you deploy now so that was

628
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:48,860
how do you deploy now so that was
 

629
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:50,949
how do you deploy now so that was
probably what triggered the balance for

630
00:12:50,949 --> 00:12:50,959
probably what triggered the balance for
 

631
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:52,329
probably what triggered the balance for
us and eventually we ended up with a

632
00:12:52,329 --> 00:12:52,339
us and eventually we ended up with a
 

633
00:12:52,339 --> 00:12:54,070
us and eventually we ended up with a
graph and I guess the question there is

634
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:54,080
graph and I guess the question there is
 

635
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:57,220
graph and I guess the question there is
did you I mean the production seems to

636
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:57,230
did you I mean the production seems to
 

637
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:59,980
did you I mean the production seems to
be the really good thing to focus on but

638
00:12:59,980 --> 00:12:59,990
be the really good thing to focus on but
 

639
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:02,110
be the really good thing to focus on but
did you even anticipate the other side

640
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:02,120
did you even anticipate the other side
 

641
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,570
did you even anticipate the other side
of it where there could be what is it

642
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:04,580
of it where there could be what is it
 

643
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:06,280
of it where there could be what is it
what are the numbers something crazy a

644
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:06,290
what are the numbers something crazy a
 

645
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:13,210
what are the numbers something crazy a
forty 1 million downloads yep I mean was

646
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:13,220
forty 1 million downloads yep I mean was
 

647
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:15,699
forty 1 million downloads yep I mean was
that even like a possibility in your

648
00:13:15,699 --> 00:13:15,709
that even like a possibility in your
 

649
00:13:15,709 --> 00:13:17,769
that even like a possibility in your
mind that there would be as popular as

650
00:13:17,769 --> 00:13:17,779
mind that there would be as popular as
 

651
00:13:17,779 --> 00:13:22,390
mind that there would be as popular as
it became so I think we did see a need

652
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:22,400
it became so I think we did see a need
 

653
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:26,019
it became so I think we did see a need
for this a lot from the research

654
00:13:26,019 --> 00:13:26,029
for this a lot from the research
 

655
00:13:26,029 --> 00:13:29,590
for this a lot from the research
perspective and like early days of keep

656
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:29,600
perspective and like early days of keep
 

657
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,490
perspective and like early days of keep
learning in some is 41 million oh I

658
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:33,500
learning in some is 41 million oh I
 

659
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,060
learning in some is 41 million oh I
don't think I imagined this number then

660
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:36,070
don't think I imagined this number then
 

661
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:40,810
don't think I imagined this number then
there it seemed like there's a potential

662
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:40,820
there it seemed like there's a potential
 

663
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,060
there it seemed like there's a potential
future where lots more people would be

664
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:43,070
future where lots more people would be
 

665
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:45,430
future where lots more people would be
doing this and how do we enable like I

666
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:45,440
doing this and how do we enable like I
 

667
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,990
doing this and how do we enable like I
would say this kind of growth

668
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:49,000
would say this kind of growth
 

669
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,300
would say this kind of growth
I probably started seeing somewhat after

670
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:51,310
I probably started seeing somewhat after
 

671
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:54,540
I probably started seeing somewhat after
the open-sourcing there was like okay

672
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:54,550
the open-sourcing there was like okay
 

673
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:56,009
the open-sourcing there was like okay
you know deep learning is actually

674
00:13:56,009 --> 00:13:56,019
you know deep learning is actually
 

675
00:13:56,019 --> 00:13:58,379
you know deep learning is actually
growing way faster for a lot of

676
00:13:58,379 --> 00:13:58,389
growing way faster for a lot of
 

677
00:13:58,389 --> 00:14:00,809
growing way faster for a lot of
different reasons and we are in just the

678
00:14:00,809 --> 00:14:00,819
different reasons and we are in just the
 

679
00:14:00,819 --> 00:14:03,689
different reasons and we are in just the
right place to push on that and leverage

680
00:14:03,689 --> 00:14:03,699
right place to push on that and leverage
 

681
00:14:03,699 --> 00:14:05,699
right place to push on that and leverage
that earned and delivered on a lot of

682
00:14:05,699 --> 00:14:05,709
that earned and delivered on a lot of
 

683
00:14:05,709 --> 00:14:07,860
that earned and delivered on a lot of
some things that people want so what

684
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:07,870
some things that people want so what
 

685
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:10,309
some things that people want so what
changed once the open source like how

686
00:14:10,309 --> 00:14:10,319
changed once the open source like how
 

687
00:14:10,319 --> 00:14:12,780
changed once the open source like how
you know this incredible amount of

688
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:12,790
you know this incredible amount of
 

689
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:14,910
you know this incredible amount of
attention from a global population of

690
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:14,920
attention from a global population of
 

691
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,040
attention from a global population of
developers what how did the project

692
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:17,050
developers what how did the project
 

693
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:18,030
developers what how did the project
start changing

694
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:18,040
start changing
 

695
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,790
start changing
I don't you actually remember it during

696
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:20,800
I don't you actually remember it during
 

697
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,429
I don't you actually remember it during
those times I know looking now there's

698
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:23,439
those times I know looking now there's
 

699
00:14:23,439 --> 00:14:24,869
those times I know looking now there's
really good documentation there's an

700
00:14:24,869 --> 00:14:24,879
really good documentation there's an
 

701
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:27,360
really good documentation there's an
ecosystem of tools there's a community

702
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:27,370
ecosystem of tools there's a community
 

703
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:30,259
ecosystem of tools there's a community
of law is a YouTube channel now yeah

704
00:14:30,259 --> 00:14:30,269
of law is a YouTube channel now yeah
 

705
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:34,019
of law is a YouTube channel now yeah
it's very very community driven back

706
00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:34,029
it's very very community driven back
 

707
00:14:34,029 --> 00:14:39,240
it's very very community driven back
then I guess 0.1 version is that the

708
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:39,250
then I guess 0.1 version is that the
 

709
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:41,340
then I guess 0.1 version is that the
version I think we called two point six

710
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:41,350
version I think we called two point six
 

711
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:44,490
version I think we called two point six
or five something like what changed

712
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:44,500
or five something like what changed
 

713
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:48,210
or five something like what changed
leading into 1.0 it's interesting you

714
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:48,220
leading into 1.0 it's interesting you
 

715
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,639
leading into 1.0 it's interesting you
know I think we've gone through a few

716
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:50,649
know I think we've gone through a few
 

717
00:14:50,649 --> 00:14:52,949
know I think we've gone through a few
things there when we started our twin we

718
00:14:52,949 --> 00:14:52,959
things there when we started our twin we
 

719
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:54,509
things there when we started our twin we
first came out people love the

720
00:14:54,509 --> 00:14:54,519
first came out people love the
 

721
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:56,460
first came out people love the
documentation we have because it was

722
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:56,470
documentation we have because it was
 

723
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:58,290
documentation we have because it was
just a huge step up from everything else

724
00:14:58,290 --> 00:14:58,300
just a huge step up from everything else
 

725
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,970
just a huge step up from everything else
because all of those were academic

726
00:14:59,970 --> 00:14:59,980
because all of those were academic
 

727
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:01,980
because all of those were academic
projects people doing you know we don't

728
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:01,990
projects people doing you know we don't
 

729
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:04,949
projects people doing you know we don't
think about documentation I think what

730
00:15:04,949 --> 00:15:04,959
think about documentation I think what
 

731
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,650
think about documentation I think what
that changed was instead of deep

732
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:07,660
that changed was instead of deep
 

733
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:10,650
that changed was instead of deep
learning being a research thing some

734
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:10,660
learning being a research thing some
 

735
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,749
learning being a research thing some
people who were just developers could

736
00:15:12,749 --> 00:15:12,759
people who were just developers could
 

737
00:15:12,759 --> 00:15:15,299
people who were just developers could
now certainly take this out and do some

738
00:15:15,299 --> 00:15:15,309
now certainly take this out and do some
 

739
00:15:15,309 --> 00:15:17,220
now certainly take this out and do some
interesting things with it right who had

740
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:17,230
interesting things with it right who had
 

741
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:19,319
interesting things with it right who had
no clue what machine learning was before

742
00:15:19,319 --> 00:15:19,329
no clue what machine learning was before
 

743
00:15:19,329 --> 00:15:22,679
no clue what machine learning was before
then and that I think really changed how

744
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:22,689
then and that I think really changed how
 

745
00:15:22,689 --> 00:15:24,629
then and that I think really changed how
things started to scale up in some ways

746
00:15:24,629 --> 00:15:24,639
things started to scale up in some ways
 

747
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:28,530
things started to scale up in some ways
and pushed on it over the next few

748
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:28,540
and pushed on it over the next few
 

749
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:30,629
and pushed on it over the next few
months as we looked at you know how do

750
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:30,639
months as we looked at you know how do
 

751
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,939
months as we looked at you know how do
we stabilize things as we look at not

752
00:15:32,939 --> 00:15:32,949
we stabilize things as we look at not
 

753
00:15:32,949 --> 00:15:34,559
we stabilize things as we look at not
just researchers now we want stability

754
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:34,569
just researchers now we want stability
 

755
00:15:34,569 --> 00:15:36,660
just researchers now we want stability
people who aren't apply things that's

756
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:36,670
people who aren't apply things that's
 

757
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:38,540
people who aren't apply things that's
how we started planning for minato and

758
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:38,550
how we started planning for minato and
 

759
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:41,369
how we started planning for minato and
there are certain needs for that

760
00:15:41,369 --> 00:15:41,379
there are certain needs for that
 

761
00:15:41,379 --> 00:15:43,530
there are certain needs for that
perspective and so again documentation

762
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:43,540
perspective and so again documentation
 

763
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:47,040
perspective and so again documentation
comes up designs more kinds of things to

764
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:47,050
comes up designs more kinds of things to
 

765
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:49,130
comes up designs more kinds of things to
put that together

766
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:49,140
put that together
 

767
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:51,740
put that together
and so that was exciting to get back to

768
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:51,750
and so that was exciting to get back to
 

769
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:54,560
and so that was exciting to get back to
a stage where more and more enterprises

770
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:54,570
a stage where more and more enterprises
 

771
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:56,810
a stage where more and more enterprises
wanted to buy in and really get behind

772
00:15:56,810 --> 00:15:56,820
wanted to buy in and really get behind
 

773
00:15:56,820 --> 00:16:00,770
wanted to buy in and really get behind
that and I think post one not oh and you

774
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:00,780
that and I think post one not oh and you
 

775
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:02,780
that and I think post one not oh and you
know with the next few releases that

776
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:02,790
know with the next few releases that
 

777
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:04,580
know with the next few releases that
enterprise adoption also started to take

778
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:04,590
enterprise adoption also started to take
 

779
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:06,530
enterprise adoption also started to take
off I would say between the initial

780
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:06,540
off I would say between the initial
 

781
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,990
off I would say between the initial
release and whatnot oh it was okay

782
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:09,000
release and whatnot oh it was okay
 

783
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,540
release and whatnot oh it was okay
researchers of course then a lot of

784
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:11,550
researchers of course then a lot of
 

785
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:14,000
researchers of course then a lot of
hobby is an early interest people

786
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:14,010
hobby is an early interest people
 

787
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:15,560
hobby is an early interest people
excited about this who started to get on

788
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:15,570
excited about this who started to get on
 

789
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:17,390
excited about this who started to get on
board and then over the one knotek's

790
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:17,400
board and then over the one knotek's
 

791
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,550
board and then over the one knotek's
thing lots of enterprises i imagine

792
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:19,560
thing lots of enterprises i imagine
 

793
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:23,960
thing lots of enterprises i imagine
anything that's you know below 1.0 get

794
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:23,970
anything that's you know below 1.0 get
 

795
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:26,810
anything that's you know below 1.0 get

00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:20,780
or quality they want some stability and
things that just work and so there is

840
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:20,790
things that just work and so there is
 

841
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,730
things that just work and so there is
value in providing that with that kind

842
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:22,740
value in providing that with that kind
 

843
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,290
value in providing that with that kind
of stability and in making it really

844
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:24,300
of stability and in making it really
 

845
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:26,300
of stability and in making it really
simpler because that allows a lot more

846
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:26,310
simpler because that allows a lot more
 

847
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:28,420
simpler because that allows a lot more
people to access it and then there's the

848
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:28,430
people to access it and then there's the
 

849
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:31,790
people to access it and then there's the
research crowd which wants okay they

850
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:31,800
research crowd which wants okay they
 

851
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,290
research crowd which wants okay they
want to do these crazy things exactly

852
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:33,300
want to do these crazy things exactly
 

853
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:35,240
want to do these crazy things exactly
like you're saying right not just deep

854
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:35,250

00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:42,150
even are an enzyme a B or there are
 

861
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:45,920
even are an enzyme a B or there are
transformers now and now it needs to

863
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:48,830

combine with RL and Gans and so on so so

864
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:48,840
combine with RL and Gans and so on so so
 

865
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,990
combine with RL and Gans and so on so so
there's definitely that area that like

866
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:51,000
there's definitely that area that like
 

867
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,240
there's definitely that area that like
the boundary that's shifting and pushing

868
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:53,250
the boundary that's shifting and pushing
 

869
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:55,670
the boundary that's shifting and pushing
the state of the art but I think there's

870
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:55,680
the state of the art but I think there's
 

871
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:58,910
the state of the art but I think there's
more and more of the past arts much more

872
00:17:58,910 --> 00:17:58,920
more and more of the past arts much more

is very very usable by lots of people so

878
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:05,100
is very very usable by lots of people so
 

879
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,710
is very very usable by lots of people so
that makes her that part makes it all

880
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:06,720
that makes her that part makes it all
 

881
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,630
that makes her that part makes it all
easier so I imagine maybe you can

882
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:08,640
easier so I imagine maybe you can
 

883
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,770
easier so I imagine maybe you can
correct me if I'm wrong

884
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:09,780
correct me if I'm wrong
 

885
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:11,330
correct me if I'm wrong
one of the biggest use cases is

886
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:11,340
one of the biggest use cases is
 

887
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,850
one of the biggest use cases is
essentially taking something like resna

888
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:13,860
essentially taking something like resna
 

889
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:16,730
essentially taking something like resna

893
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:19,160

that you have

894
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:19,170
that you have
 

895
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:22,130
that you have
it's basically probably what majority of

896
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:22,140
it's basically probably what majority of
 

897
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:25,340
it's basically probably what majority of
the world does and you want to make that

898
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:25,350
the world does and you want to make that
 

899
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:27,530
the world does and you want to make that
as easy as possible that's right so I

900
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:27,540
as easy as possible that's right so I
 

901
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,960
as easy as possible that's right so I
would say for the hobbyist perspective

902
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:29,970
would say for the hobbyist perspective
 

903
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:32,299
would say for the hobbyist perspective
that's the most common case right

904
00:18:32,299 --> 00:18:32,309
that's the most common case right
 

905
00:18:32,309 --> 00:18:34,730
that's the most common case right
in fact the apps on phones and stuff

906
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:34,740
in fact the apps on phones and stuff
 

907
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,230
in fact the apps on phones and stuff
that you'll see the early ones that's

908
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:36,240
that you'll see the early ones that's
 

909
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,450
that you'll see the early ones that's
the most common case I would say there a

910
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:38,460
the most common case I would say there a
 

911
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:41,560
the most common case I would say there a
couple of reasons for that one is that

912
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:41,570
couple of reasons for that one is that
 

913
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:44,780
couple of reasons for that one is that
everybody talks about that it looks

914
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:44,790
everybody talks about that it looks
 

915
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,120
everybody talks about that it looks
great on slides yeah that's a virtual

917
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:50,180

presentation you know exactly what

918
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:50,190

enterprises wine is that is part of it

920
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:53,010
enterprises wine is that is part of it
 

921
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:55,100
enterprises wine is that is part of it
but that's not the big thing enterprises

922
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:55,110
but that's not the big thing enterprises
 

923
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:57,140
but that's not the big thing enterprises
really have data that they want to make

924
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:57,150
really have data that they want to make
 

925
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:59,570
really have data that they want to make
predictions on this is often what they

926
00:18:59,570 --> 00:18:59,580
predictions on this is often what they
 

927
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:01,370
predictions on this is often what they
used to do with the people who are doing

and so on some of them still benefit

936
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:10,980
and so on some of them still benefit
 

937
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,470
and so on some of them still benefit
from deep learning but they weren't that

938
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:12,480
from deep learning but they weren't that

from deep learning but they weren't that
that that's the bread and butter like

probably just has a very large data set

950
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:26,340
probably just has a very large data set
 

951
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:28,280
probably just has a very large data set
or deep learning can probably shine

952
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:28,290
or deep learning can probably shine
 

953
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:29,840

that's correct right

954
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:29,850
that's correct right
 

955
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:32,120
that's correct right
and then they I think the other pieces

956
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:32,130
and then they I think the other pieces
 

957
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:34,580
and then they I think the other pieces
that they weren't again it with 2.0 or

958
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:34,590
that they weren't again it with 2.0 or

1047
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:24,890
you'd like with it within in the sense
of like ecosystem there's now you're

1048
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:24,900
of like ecosystem there's now you're
 

1049
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,600
of like ecosystem there's now you're
providing more and more data sets and

1050
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:26,610
providing more and more data sets and
 

1051
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:29,720
providing more and more data sets and
more pre training models are you finding

1052
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:29,730
more pre training models are you finding
 

1053
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:32,000
more pre training models are you finding
yourself also the organizer of data sets

1054
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:32,010
yourself also the organizer of data sets
 

1055
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:34,400
yourself also the organizer of data sets
yes I think the tensorflow data sets

1056
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:34,410
yes I think the tensorflow data sets
 

1057
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:35,750
yes I think the tensorflow data sets
that we just released

1058
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:35,760
that we just released
 

1059
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,510
that we just released
that's definitely come up people want

1060
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:38,520
that's definitely come up people want
 

1061
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,070
that's definitely come up people want
these data sets can we organize them and

1062
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:40,080
these data sets can we organize them and
 

1063
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,350
these data sets can we organize them and
can we make that easier so that's that's

1064
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:42,360
can we make that easier so that's that's
 

1065
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:45,500
can we make that easier so that's that's
definitely one important thing the other

1066
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:45,510
definitely one important thing the other
 

1067
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:47,090
definitely one important thing the other
related thing I would say is I often

1068
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:47,100
related thing I would say is I often
 

1069
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:49,070
related thing I would say is I often
tell people you know what don't think of

1070
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:49,080
tell people you know what don't think of
 

1071
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,830
tell people you know what don't think of
the most fanciest thing that the newest

1072
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:51,840
the most fanciest thing that the newest
 

1073
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,020
the most fanciest thing that the newest
model that you see make something very

1074
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:54,030
model that you see make something very
 

1075
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:56,240

basic work and then you can improve it

1076
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:56,250
basic work and then you can improve it
 

1077
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:58,070
basic work and then you can improve it
there's just lots of things you can do

1078
00:21:58,070 --> 00:21:58,080
there's just lots of things you can do
 

1079
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,840
there's just lots of things you can do
in there yeah I start with the basic

1080
00:21:59,840 --> 00:21:59,850
in there yeah I start with the basic
 

1081
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:01,760
in there yeah I start with the basic
truth one of the big things that makes

1082
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:01,770
truth one of the big things that makes
 

1083
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:04,060
truth one of the big things that makes
it makes tensorflow even more accessible

1084
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:04,070
it makes tensorflow even more accessible
 

1085
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:06,560
it makes tensorflow even more accessible
was the appearance whenever that

1086
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:06,570
was the appearance whenever that
 

1087
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:09,530
was the appearance whenever that
happened of Karass the Cara standard

1088
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:09,540
happened of Karass the Cara standard
 

1089
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:12,800
happened of Karass the Cara standard
sort of outside of tents of no I think

1090
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:12,810
sort of outside of tents of no I think
 

1091
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:17,600
sort of outside of tents of no I think
it was Karis on top of the a no at first

1092
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:17,610
it was Karis on top of the a no at first
 

1093
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:21,500
it was Karis on top of the a no at first
only and then Karis became on top of

1094
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:21,510
only and then Karis became on top of
 

1095
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:22,070
only and then Karis became on top of
tensorflow

1096
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:22,080
tensorflow
 

1097
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:27,710
tensorflow
do you know when Cara shows to also add

1098
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:27,720
do you know when Cara shows to also add
 

1099
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,870
do you know when Cara shows to also add
10 Sefolosha back and

1100
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:29,880
10 Sefolosha back and
 

1101
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,120
10 Sefolosha back and
who was the was it just the community

1102
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:32,130
who was the was it just the community
 

1103
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:34,400
who was the was it just the community
that drove that initially do you know if

1104
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:34,410
that drove that initially do you know if
 

1105
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:37,190
that drove that initially do you know if
there was discussions conversations yeah

1106
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:37,200
there was discussions conversations yeah
 

1107
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,160
there was discussions conversations yeah
so Francis started the Charis project

1108
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:40,170
so Francis started the Charis project
 

1109
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:43,520
so Francis started the Charis project
before he was at Google and the first

1110
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:43,530
before he was at Google and the first
 

1111
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:45,920
before he was at Google and the first
thing was Tiana would I don't remember

1112
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:45,930
thing was Tiana would I don't remember
 

1113
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:47,540
thing was Tiana would I don't remember
if that was after tensorflow was created

1114
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:47,550
if that was after tensorflow was created
 

1115
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:51,530
if that was after tensorflow was created
or way before and then at some point ray

1116
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:51,540
or way before and then at some point ray
 

1117
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:52,670
or way before and then at some point ray
intense flow started becoming popular

1118
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:52,680
intense flow started becoming popular
 

1119
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,380
intense flow started becoming popular
there were enough similarities that he

1120
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:54,390
there were enough similarities that he
 

1121
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:56,180
there were enough similarities that he
decided to okay create this interface

1122
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:56,190
decided to okay create this interface
 

1123
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:58,940
decided to okay create this interface
and input tense flows the back end I

1124
00:22:58,940 --> 00:22:58,950
and input tense flows the back end I
 

1125
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:00,530
and input tense flows the back end I
believe that might still have been

1126
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:00,540
believe that might still have been
 

1127
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:04,550
believe that might still have been
before he joined Google so I you know

1128
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:04,560
before he joined Google so I you know
 

1129
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,830
before he joined Google so I you know
we're not really talking about that he

1130
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:06,840
we're not really talking about that he
 

1131
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,260
we're not really talking about that he
decided on his own and thought that was

1132
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:09,270
decided on his own and thought that was
 

1133
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:10,340
decided on his own and thought that was
interesting and relevant to the

1134
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:10,350
interesting and relevant to the
 

1135
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:15,230
interesting and relevant to the
community in fact I didn't find out

1136
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:15,240
community in fact I didn't find out
 

1137
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:18,320
community in fact I didn't find out
about him being at Google until a few

1138
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:18,330
about him being at Google until a few
 

1139
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:20,240
about him being at Google until a few
months after he was here he was working

1140
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:20,250
months after he was here he was working
 

1141
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:22,640
months after he was here he was working
on some research ideas and doing Kerris

1142
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:22,650
on some research ideas and doing Kerris
 

1143
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:24,290
on some research ideas and doing Kerris
on his nights and weekends project and

1144
00:23:24,290 --> 00:23:24,300
on his nights and weekends project and
 

1145
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:26,870
on his nights and weekends project and
things so he wasn't like part of the

1146
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:26,880
things so he wasn't like part of the
 

1147
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,990
things so he wasn't like part of the
texture flow he didn't join in the joint

1148
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:30,000
texture flow he didn't join in the joint
 

1149
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,760
texture flow he didn't join in the joint
research and he's doing some amazing

1150
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:31,770
research and he's doing some amazing
 

1151
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:34,220
research and he's doing some amazing
here's some papers on that on research

1152
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:34,230
here's some papers on that on research
 

1153
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:36,410
here's some papers on that on research
he's done he's a great researcher as

1154
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:36,420
he's done he's a great researcher as
 

1155
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:40,490
he's done he's a great researcher as
well and at some point we realized oh

1156
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:40,500
well and at some point we realized oh
 

1157
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,710
well and at some point we realized oh
he's he's doing this good stuff people

1158
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:42,720
he's he's doing this good stuff people
 

1159
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,960
he's he's doing this good stuff people
seem to like the API and he's right here

1160
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:44,970
seem to like the API and he's right here
 

1161
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:48,380
seem to like the API and he's right here
so we talked to him and he said okay why

1162
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:48,390
so we talked to him and he said okay why
 

1163
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:50,990
so we talked to him and he said okay why
don't I come over to your team and work

1164
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:51,000
don't I come over to your team and work
 

1165
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,240
don't I come over to your team and work
with you for a quarter and let's make

1166
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:53,250
with you for a quarter and let's make
 

1167
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:56,030
with you for a quarter and let's make
that integration happen and we talked to

1168
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:56,040
that integration happen and we talked to
 

1169
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,980
that integration happen and we talked to
his manager and he said sure my quarters

1170
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:57,990
his manager and he said sure my quarters
 

1171
00:23:57,990 --> 00:24:01,520
his manager and he said sure my quarters
fine and that quarter's been something

1172
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:01,530
fine and that quarter's been something
 

1173
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:06,410
fine and that quarter's been something
like two years now so Karis got

1174
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:06,420
like two years now so Karis got
 

1175
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:10,430
like two years now so Karis got
integrated into tensorflow like in a

1176
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:10,440
integrated into tensorflow like in a
 

1177
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:13,610
integrated into tensorflow like in a
deep way yeah and now with 2.0

1178
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:13,620
deep way yeah and now with 2.0
 

1179
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:16,340
deep way yeah and now with 2.0
tensorflow 2.0 sort of Karass is kind of

1180
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:16,350
tensorflow 2.0 sort of Karass is kind of
 

1181
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:19,400
tensorflow 2.0 sort of Karass is kind of
the recommended way for a beginner to

1182
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:19,410
the recommended way for a beginner to
 

1183
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:22,820
the recommended way for a beginner to
interact with testify which makes that

1184
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:22,830
interact with testify which makes that
 

1185
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:24,920
interact with testify which makes that
initial sort of transfer learning or the

1186
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:24,930
initial sort of transfer learning or the
 

1187
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:27,730
initial sort of transfer learning or the
basic use cases even for an enterprise

1188
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:27,740
basic use cases even for an enterprise
 

1189
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:30,080
basic use cases even for an enterprise
super simple right that's good that's

1190
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:30,090
super simple right that's good that's
 

1191
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:31,820
super simple right that's good that's
right so what was that decision like

1192
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:31,830
right so what was that decision like
 

1193
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:35,270
right so what was that decision like
that seems like a I it's kind of a bold

1194
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:35,280
that seems like a I it's kind of a bold
 

1195
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:39,470
that seems like a I it's kind of a bold
decision as well we did spend a lot of

1196
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:39,480
decision as well we did spend a lot of
 

1197
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:42,920
decision as well we did spend a lot of
time thinking about that one we had a

1198
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:42,930
time thinking about that one we had a
 

1199
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:43,350
time thinking about that one we had a
bind

1200
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:43,360
bind
 

1201
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:46,260
bind
of API somewhere by us there was a

1202
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:46,270
of API somewhere by us there was a
 

1203
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:47,640
of API somewhere by us there was a
parallel layers API that we were

1204
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:47,650
parallel layers API that we were
 

1205
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:50,970
parallel layers API that we were
building and when we decided to do caris

1206
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:50,980
building and when we decided to do caris
 

1207
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:52,620
building and when we decided to do caris
in parallel so they were like okay two

1208
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:52,630
in parallel so they were like okay two
 

1209
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:54,600
in parallel so they were like okay two
things that we are looking at and the

1210
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:54,610
things that we are looking at and the
 

1211
00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:56,490
things that we are looking at and the
first thing we was trying to do is just

1212
00:24:56,490 --> 00:24:56,500
first thing we was trying to do is just
 

1213
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,830
first thing we was trying to do is just
have them look similar like be as

1214
00:24:58,830 --> 00:24:58,840
have them look similar like be as
 

1215
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,840
have them look similar like be as
integrator as possible share all of that

1216
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:00,850
integrator as possible share all of that
 

1217
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:03,450
integrator as possible share all of that
stuff they were also like three other

1218
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:03,460
stuff they were also like three other
 

1219
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,640
stuff they were also like three other
API is that others had built over time

1220
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:05,650
API is that others had built over time
 

1221
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:08,210
API is that others had built over time
because we didn't have a standard one

1222
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:08,220
because we didn't have a standard one
 

1223
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:10,650
because we didn't have a standard one
but one of the messages that we keep

1224
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:10,660
but one of the messages that we keep
 

1225
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:12,240
but one of the messages that we keep
kept hearing from the community okay

1226
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:12,250
kept hearing from the community okay
 

1227
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:13,980
kept hearing from the community okay
which one do we use and they kept seeing

1228
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:13,990
which one do we use and they kept seeing
 

1229
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:15,690
which one do we use and they kept seeing
like okay here's a model in this one and

1230
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:15,700
like okay here's a model in this one and
 

1231
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:16,950
like okay here's a model in this one and
here's a model in this one which should

1232
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:16,960
here's a model in this one which should
 

1233
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,340
here's a model in this one which should
I pick so that that's sort of like okay

1234
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:20,350
I pick so that that's sort of like okay
 

1235
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:23,400
I pick so that that's sort of like okay
we had to address that straight on with

1236
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:23,410
we had to address that straight on with
 

1237
00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:25,140
we had to address that straight on with
2.0 the whole idea is you need to

1238
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:25,150
2.0 the whole idea is you need to
 

1239
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:29,039
2.0 the whole idea is you need to
simplify you had to pick one based on

1240
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:29,049
simplify you had to pick one based on
 

1241
00:25:29,049 --> 00:25:32,700
simplify you had to pick one based on
where we were we were like okay let's

1242
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:32,710
where we were we were like okay let's
 

1243
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:34,740
where we were we were like okay let's
see what's what are the what do the

1244
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:34,750
see what's what are the what do the
 

1245
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:36,720
see what's what are the what do the
people like and caris was clearly one

1246
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:36,730
people like and caris was clearly one
 

1247
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:39,480
people like and caris was clearly one
that lots of people loved there were

1248
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:39,490
that lots of people loved there were
 

1249
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:42,240
that lots of people loved there were
lots of great things about it so we

1250
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:42,250
lots of great things about it so we
 

1251
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:45,180
lots of great things about it so we
settled on that organically that's kind

1252
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:45,190
settled on that organically that's kind
 

1253
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:46,799
settled on that organically that's kind
of the best way to do it which it was

1254
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:46,809
of the best way to do it which it was
 

1255
00:25:46,809 --> 00:25:48,390
of the best way to do it which it was
great because it was surprising there

1256
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:48,400
great because it was surprising there
 

1257
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,710
great because it was surprising there
were less to sort of bring in and

1258
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:49,720
were less to sort of bring in and
 

1259
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,900
were less to sort of bring in and
outside I mean there was a feeling like

1260
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:51,910
outside I mean there was a feeling like
 

1261
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:55,200
outside I mean there was a feeling like
Karis might be almost like a competitor

1262
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:55,210
Karis might be almost like a competitor
 

1263
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:57,180
Karis might be almost like a competitor
and this is a certain kind of to

1264
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:57,190
and this is a certain kind of to
 

1265
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:59,510
and this is a certain kind of to
tensorflow and in a sense it became an

1266
00:25:59,510 --> 00:25:59,520
tensorflow and in a sense it became an
 

1267
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,010
tensorflow and in a sense it became an
empowering element of tensorflow

1268
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:02,020
empowering element of tensorflow
 

1269
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:04,380
empowering element of tensorflow
that's right yeah it's interesting how

1270
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:04,390
that's right yeah it's interesting how
 

1271
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:06,510
that's right yeah it's interesting how
you can put two things together which

1272
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:06,520
you can put two things together which
 

1273
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:09,240
you can put two things together which
don't which can align iron in this case

1274
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:09,250
don't which can align iron in this case
 

1275
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:12,450
don't which can align iron in this case
I think Francois the team and I you know

1276
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:12,460
I think Francois the team and I you know
 

1277
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:14,730
I think Francois the team and I you know
a bunch of us have chatted and I think

1278
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:14,740
a bunch of us have chatted and I think
 

1279
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,500
a bunch of us have chatted and I think
we we all want to see the same kind of

1280
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:16,510
we we all want to see the same kind of
 

1281
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:18,450
we we all want to see the same kind of
things we all care about making it

1282
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:18,460
things we all care about making it
 

1283
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:20,880
things we all care about making it
easier for the huge set of developers

1284
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:20,890
easier for the huge set of developers
 

1285
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:23,960
easier for the huge set of developers
out there and that makes a difference so

1286
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:23,970
out there and that makes a difference so
 

1287
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:27,510
out there and that makes a difference so
python has grid over in Rossum who until

1288
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:27,520
python has grid over in Rossum who until
 

1289
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:30,240
python has grid over in Rossum who until
recently held the position of benevolent

1290
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:30,250
recently held the position of benevolent
 

1291
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:33,870
recently held the position of benevolent
dictator for life right so there's a

1292
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:33,880
dictator for life right so there's a
 

1293
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:36,600
dictator for life right so there's a
huge successful open source project like

1294
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:36,610
huge successful open source project like
 

1295
00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:39,480
huge successful open source project like
tensorflow need one person who makes a

1296
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:39,490
tensorflow need one person who makes a
 

1297
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:42,630
tensorflow need one person who makes a
final decision so you did a pretty

1298
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:42,640
final decision so you did a pretty
 

1299
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,659
final decision so you did a pretty
successful tensorflow dev summit just

1300
00:26:45,659 --> 00:26:45,669
successful tensorflow dev summit just
 

1301
00:26:45,669 --> 00:26:48,000
successful tensorflow dev summit just
now last couple of days there's clearly

1302
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:48,010
now last couple of days there's clearly
 

1303
00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:51,240
now last couple of days there's clearly
a lot of different new features being

1304
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:51,250
a lot of different new features being
 

1305
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:53,610
a lot of different new features being
incorporated and amazing ecosystem so on

1306
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:53,620
incorporated and amazing ecosystem so on
 

1307
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:55,460
incorporated and amazing ecosystem so on
who's a

1308
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:55,470
who's a
 

1309
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:57,440
who's a
how are those design decisions made is

1310
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:57,450
how are those design decisions made is
 

1311
00:26:57,450 --> 00:27:01,869
how are those design decisions made is
there is there a btfl intensive flow and

1312
00:27:01,869 --> 00:27:01,879
there is there a btfl intensive flow and
 

1313
00:27:01,879 --> 00:27:05,629
there is there a btfl intensive flow and
or is it more distributed in organic I

1314
00:27:05,629 --> 00:27:05,639
or is it more distributed in organic I
 

1315
00:27:05,639 --> 00:27:07,940
or is it more distributed in organic I
think it's it's some more different I

1316
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:07,950
think it's it's some more different I
 

1317
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:12,619
think it's it's some more different I
would say I've always been involved in

1318
00:27:12,619 --> 00:27:12,629
would say I've always been involved in
 

1319
00:27:12,629 --> 00:27:16,700
would say I've always been involved in
the key design directions but there are

1320
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:16,710
the key design directions but there are
 

1321
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:18,019
the key design directions but there are
lots of things that are distributed

1322
00:27:18,019 --> 00:27:18,029
lots of things that are distributed
 

1323
00:27:18,029 --> 00:27:21,139
lots of things that are distributed
where there number of people Martin Rick

1324
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:21,149
where there number of people Martin Rick
 

1325
00:27:21,149 --> 00:27:23,600
where there number of people Martin Rick
being one who is really driven a lot of

1326
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:23,610
being one who is really driven a lot of
 

1327
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:26,379
being one who is really driven a lot of
our open source stuff a lot of the api's

1328
00:27:26,379 --> 00:27:26,389
our open source stuff a lot of the api's
 

1329
00:27:26,389 --> 00:27:29,180
our open source stuff a lot of the api's
in there there a number of other people

1330
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:29,190
in there there a number of other people
 

1331
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:31,999
in there there a number of other people
who have been you know pushed and been

1332
00:27:31,999 --> 00:27:32,009
who have been you know pushed and been
 

1333
00:27:32,009 --> 00:27:35,450
who have been you know pushed and been
responsible for different parts of it we

1334
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:35,460
responsible for different parts of it we
 

1335
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:38,149
responsible for different parts of it we
do have regular design reviews over the

1336
00:27:38,149 --> 00:27:38,159
do have regular design reviews over the
 

1337
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:39,710
do have regular design reviews over the
last year we've really spent a lot of

1338
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:39,720
last year we've really spent a lot of
 

1339
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,629
last year we've really spent a lot of
time opening up to the community and

1340
00:27:41,629 --> 00:27:41,639
time opening up to the community and
 

1341
00:27:41,639 --> 00:27:44,779
time opening up to the community and
adding transparency we're setting more

1342
00:27:44,779 --> 00:27:44,789
adding transparency we're setting more
 

1343
00:27:44,789 --> 00:27:48,200
adding transparency we're setting more
processes in place so RFC's special

1344
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:48,210
processes in place so RFC's special
 

1345
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:50,060
processes in place so RFC's special
interest groups really grow that

1346
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:50,070
interest groups really grow that
 

1347
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:53,930
interest groups really grow that
community and and scale that I think

1348
00:27:53,930 --> 00:27:53,940
community and and scale that I think
 

1349
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:57,019
community and and scale that I think
that kind of scale that ecosystem is in

1350
00:27:57,019 --> 00:27:57,029
that kind of scale that ecosystem is in
 

1351
00:27:57,029 --> 00:27:59,299
that kind of scale that ecosystem is in
I don't think we could scale with having

1352
00:27:59,299 --> 00:27:59,309
I don't think we could scale with having
 

1353
00:27:59,309 --> 00:28:03,590
I don't think we could scale with having
me as the saloon decision-maker yeah so

1354
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:03,600
me as the saloon decision-maker yeah so
 

1355
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,169
me as the saloon decision-maker yeah so
yeah the growth of that ecosystem maybe

1356
00:28:06,169 --> 00:28:06,179
yeah the growth of that ecosystem maybe
 

1357
00:28:06,179 --> 00:28:08,389
yeah the growth of that ecosystem maybe
you can talk about a little bit first of

1358
00:28:08,389 --> 00:28:08,399
you can talk about a little bit first of
 

1359
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:10,580
you can talk about a little bit first of
all when I started with Andre karpati

1360
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:10,590
all when I started with Andre karpati
 

1361
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:13,610
all when I started with Andre karpati
when he first had come that j/s the fact

1362
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:13,620
when he first had come that j/s the fact
 

1363
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:15,440
when he first had come that j/s the fact
that you can train in your network in

1364
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:15,450
that you can train in your network in
 

1365
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:17,509
that you can train in your network in
the browser's in that JavaScript was

1366
00:28:17,509 --> 00:28:17,519
the browser's in that JavaScript was
 

1367
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:18,200
the browser's in that JavaScript was
incredible

1368
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:18,210
incredible
 

1369
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:20,330
incredible
yep so now tensorflow jas is really

1370
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:20,340
yep so now tensorflow jas is really
 

1371
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:26,029
yep so now tensorflow jas is really
making that a serious like a legit thing

1372
00:28:26,029 --> 00:28:26,039
making that a serious like a legit thing
 

1373
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:28,070
making that a serious like a legit thing
a way to operate whether it's in the

1374
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:28,080
a way to operate whether it's in the
 

1375
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,930
a way to operate whether it's in the
back end or the front end then there's

1376
00:28:29,930 --> 00:28:29,940
back end or the front end then there's
 

1377
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:31,700
back end or the front end then there's
the tensorflow extended like you

1378
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:31,710
the tensorflow extended like you
 

1379
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,769
the tensorflow extended like you
mentioned there's a stencil for light

1380
00:28:33,769 --> 00:28:33,779
mentioned there's a stencil for light
 

1381
00:28:33,779 --> 00:28:37,129
mentioned there's a stencil for light
for mobile and all of it as far as I can

1382
00:28:37,129 --> 00:28:37,139
for mobile and all of it as far as I can
 

1383
00:28:37,139 --> 00:28:38,749
for mobile and all of it as far as I can
tell it's really converging towards

1384
00:28:38,749 --> 00:28:38,759
tell it's really converging towards
 

1385
00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:42,649
tell it's really converging towards
being able to you know save models in

1386
00:28:42,649 --> 00:28:42,659
being able to you know save models in
 

1387
00:28:42,659 --> 00:28:44,480
being able to you know save models in
the same kind of way you can move around

1388
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:44,490
the same kind of way you can move around
 

1389
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:46,879
the same kind of way you can move around
you can train on the desktop and then

1390
00:28:46,879 --> 00:28:46,889
you can train on the desktop and then
 

1391
00:28:46,889 --> 00:28:49,549
you can train on the desktop and then
move it to mobile and so on thickness is

1392
00:28:49,549 --> 00:28:49,559
move it to mobile and so on thickness is
 

1393
00:28:49,559 --> 00:28:54,039
move it to mobile and so on thickness is
that cohesiveness so he may be give me

1394
00:28:54,039 --> 00:28:54,049
that cohesiveness so he may be give me
 

1395
00:28:54,049 --> 00:28:57,379
that cohesiveness so he may be give me
whatever I missed a bigger overview of

1396
00:28:57,379 --> 00:28:57,389
whatever I missed a bigger overview of
 

1397
00:28:57,389 --> 00:28:59,029
whatever I missed a bigger overview of
the mission of the ecosystem that's

1398
00:28:59,029 --> 00:28:59,039
the mission of the ecosystem that's
 

1399
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:00,830
the mission of the ecosystem that's
trying to be built and where is it

1400
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:00,840
trying to be built and where is it
 

1401
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,450
trying to be built and where is it
moving forward yeah

1402
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:02,460
moving forward yeah
 

1403
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:05,359
moving forward yeah
so in short the way I like to think of

1404
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:05,369
so in short the way I like to think of
 

1405
00:29:05,369 --> 00:29:08,539
so in short the way I like to think of
this is our goals to enable machine

1406
00:29:08,539 --> 00:29:08,549
this is our goals to enable machine
 

1407
00:29:08,549 --> 00:29:11,419
this is our goals to enable machine
learning and in a couple of ways you

1408
00:29:11,419 --> 00:29:11,429
learning and in a couple of ways you
 

1409
00:29:11,429 --> 00:29:14,180
learning and in a couple of ways you
know one is if you have lots of exciting

1410
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:14,190
know one is if you have lots of exciting
 

1411
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:16,879
know one is if you have lots of exciting
things going on in ml today we started

1412
00:29:16,879 --> 00:29:16,889
things going on in ml today we started
 

1413
00:29:16,889 --> 00:29:18,560
things going on in ml today we started
with deep learning but we now support a

1414
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:18,570
with deep learning but we now support a
 

1415
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:22,009
with deep learning but we now support a
bunch of other algorithms too so so one

1416
00:29:22,009 --> 00:29:22,019
bunch of other algorithms too so so one
 

1417
00:29:22,019 --> 00:29:24,289
bunch of other algorithms too so so one
is to on the research side keep pushing

1418
00:29:24,289 --> 00:29:24,299
is to on the research side keep pushing
 

1419
00:29:24,299 --> 00:29:26,029
is to on the research side keep pushing
on the state-of-the-art can we you know

1420
00:29:26,029 --> 00:29:26,039
on the state-of-the-art can we you know
 

1421
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:27,560
on the state-of-the-art can we you know
how do we enable researchers to build

1422
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:27,570
how do we enable researchers to build
 

1423
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:30,230
how do we enable researchers to build
the next amazing thing so Bert came out

1424
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:30,240
the next amazing thing so Bert came out
 

1425
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,419
the next amazing thing so Bert came out
recently you know it's great that people

1426
00:29:32,419 --> 00:29:32,429
recently you know it's great that people
 

1427
00:29:32,429 --> 00:29:34,009
recently you know it's great that people
are able to do new kinds of research and

1428
00:29:34,009 --> 00:29:34,019
are able to do new kinds of research and
 

1429
00:29:34,019 --> 00:29:34,909
are able to do new kinds of research and
there are lots of you know amazing

1430
00:29:34,909 --> 00:29:34,919
there are lots of you know amazing
 

1431
00:29:34,919 --> 00:29:36,639
there are lots of you know amazing
research that happens across the world

1432
00:29:36,639 --> 00:29:36,649
research that happens across the world
 

1433
00:29:36,649 --> 00:29:40,190
research that happens across the world
so that's one direction the other is how

1434
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:40,200
so that's one direction the other is how
 

1435
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:43,279
so that's one direction the other is how
do you take that across all the people

1436
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:43,289
do you take that across all the people
 

1437
00:29:43,289 --> 00:29:45,169
do you take that across all the people
outside who want to take that research

1438
00:29:45,169 --> 00:29:45,179
outside who want to take that research
 

1439
00:29:45,179 --> 00:29:46,639
outside who want to take that research
and do some great things with it and

1440
00:29:46,639 --> 00:29:46,649
and do some great things with it and
 

1441
00:29:46,649 --> 00:29:48,740
and do some great things with it and
integrate it to build real products to

1442
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:48,750
integrate it to build real products to
 

1443
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:52,399
integrate it to build real products to
have a real impact on people and so if

1444
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:52,409
have a real impact on people and so if
 

1445
00:29:52,409 --> 00:29:56,450
have a real impact on people and so if
that's the other axes in some ways you

1446
00:29:56,450 --> 00:29:56,460
that's the other axes in some ways you
 

1447
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:57,859
that's the other axes in some ways you
know at a high level one way I think

1448
00:29:57,859 --> 00:29:57,869
know at a high level one way I think
 

1449
00:29:57,869 --> 00:30:01,519
know at a high level one way I think
about it is there a crazy number of

1450
00:30:01,519 --> 00:30:01,529
about it is there a crazy number of
 

1451
00:30:01,529 --> 00:30:04,909
about it is there a crazy number of
compute devices across the world and we

1452
00:30:04,909 --> 00:30:04,919
compute devices across the world and we
 

1453
00:30:04,919 --> 00:30:07,789
compute devices across the world and we
often used to think of ml and training

1454
00:30:07,789 --> 00:30:07,799
often used to think of ml and training
 

1455
00:30:07,799 --> 00:30:09,409
often used to think of ml and training
and all of this as okay something you do

1456
00:30:09,409 --> 00:30:09,419
and all of this as okay something you do
 

1457
00:30:09,419 --> 00:30:11,240
and all of this as okay something you do
either in the work station or the data

1458
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:11,250
either in the work station or the data
 

1459
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:14,629
either in the work station or the data
center or cloud but we see things

1460
00:30:14,629 --> 00:30:14,639
center or cloud but we see things
 

1461
00:30:14,639 --> 00:30:16,100
center or cloud but we see things
running on the phones we see things

1462
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:16,110
running on the phones we see things
 

1463
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:17,869
running on the phones we see things
running on really tiny chips I mean we

1464
00:30:17,869 --> 00:30:17,879
running on really tiny chips I mean we
 

1465
00:30:17,879 --> 00:30:19,879
running on really tiny chips I mean we
had some demos at the developer summit

1466
00:30:19,879 --> 00:30:19,889
had some demos at the developer summit
 

1467
00:30:19,889 --> 00:30:24,139
had some demos at the developer summit
and so the way I think about this

1468
00:30:24,139 --> 00:30:24,149
and so the way I think about this
 

1469
00:30:24,149 --> 00:30:28,490
and so the way I think about this
ecosystem is how do we help get machine

1470
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:28,500
ecosystem is how do we help get machine
 

1471
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,560
ecosystem is how do we help get machine
learning on every device that has the

1472
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:30,570
learning on every device that has the
 

1473
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:33,440
learning on every device that has the
compute capability and that continues to

1474
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:33,450
compute capability and that continues to
 

1475
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:36,590
compute capability and that continues to
grow in and so in some ways this

1476
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:36,600
grow in and so in some ways this
 

1477
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:39,019
grow in and so in some ways this
ecosystem is looked at you know various

1478
00:30:39,019 --> 00:30:39,029
ecosystem is looked at you know various
 

1479
00:30:39,029 --> 00:30:41,240
ecosystem is looked at you know various
aspects of tagged and grown over time to

1480
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:41,250
aspects of tagged and grown over time to
 

1481
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:43,159
aspects of tagged and grown over time to
cover more of those and we continue to

1482
00:30:43,159 --> 00:30:43,169
cover more of those and we continue to
 

1483
00:30:43,169 --> 00:30:45,560
cover more of those and we continue to
push the boundaries in some areas we've

1484
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:45,570
push the boundaries in some areas we've
 

1485
00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:48,830
push the boundaries in some areas we've
built more tooling and things around

1486
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:48,840
built more tooling and things around
 

1487
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,990
built more tooling and things around
that to help you I mean the first tool

1488
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:51,000
that to help you I mean the first tool
 

1489
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,210
that to help you I mean the first tool
we started was ten support you wanted to

1490
00:30:53,210 --> 00:30:53,220
we started was ten support you wanted to
 

1491
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:56,359
we started was ten support you wanted to
learn just the training piece the

1492
00:30:56,359 --> 00:30:56,369
learn just the training piece the
 

1493
00:30:56,369 --> 00:30:58,460
learn just the training piece the
effects or tensorflow extended to really

1494
00:30:58,460 --> 00:30:58,470
effects or tensorflow extended to really
 

1495
00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:00,680
effects or tensorflow extended to really
do your entire ml pipelines if you're

1496
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:00,690
do your entire ml pipelines if you're
 

1497
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:03,169
do your entire ml pipelines if you're
you know care about all that production

1498
00:31:03,169 --> 00:31:03,179
you know care about all that production
 

1499
00:31:03,179 --> 00:31:06,830
you know care about all that production
stuff but then going to the edge going

1500
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:06,840
stuff but then going to the edge going
 

1501
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:09,769
stuff but then going to the edge going
to different kinds of things and it's

1502
00:31:09,769 --> 00:31:09,779
to different kinds of things and it's
 

1503
00:31:09,779 --> 00:31:12,590
to different kinds of things and it's
not just us now if you're a place where

1504
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:12,600
not just us now if you're a place where
 

1505
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,930
not just us now if you're a place where
there are lots of libraries being built

1506
00:31:14,930 --> 00:31:14,940
there are lots of libraries being built
 

1507
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:17,119
there are lots of libraries being built
on top so there are some for research

1508
00:31:17,119 --> 00:31:17,129
on top so there are some for research
 

1509
00:31:17,129 --> 00:31:19,700
on top so there are some for research
may be things like pens flow agent

1510
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:19,710
may be things like pens flow agent
 

1511
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:20,300
may be things like pens flow agent
certain

1512
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:20,310
certain
 

1513

certain
the probability that started as research

1514
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:22,080
the probability that started as research
 

1515
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,170
the probability that started as research
things or for researchers for focusing

1516
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:24,180
things or for researchers for focusing
 

1517
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:26,210
things or for researchers for focusing
on certain kinds of algorithms but

1518
00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:26,220
on certain kinds of algorithms but
 

1519
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:28,070
on certain kinds of algorithms but
they're also being deployed or produced

1520
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:28,080
they're also being deployed or produced
 

1521
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:31,280
they're also being deployed or produced
by you know production folks and some

1522
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:31,290
by you know production folks and some
 

1523
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:33,860
by you know production folks and some
have come from within Google just teams

1524
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:33,870
have come from within Google just teams
 

1525
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:36,050
have come from within Google just teams
across Google who wanted to build these

1526
00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:36,060
across Google who wanted to build these
 

1527
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:38,810
across Google who wanted to build these
things others have come from just the

1528
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:38,820
things others have come from just the
 

1529
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:41,360
things others have come from just the
community because there are different

1530
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:41,370
community because there are different
 

1531
00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:42,830
community because there are different
pieces that different parts of the

1532
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:42,840
pieces that different parts of the
 

1533
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:46,760
pieces that different parts of the
community care about and I see our goal

1534
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:46,770
community care about and I see our goal
 

1535
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:50,270
community care about and I see our goal
as enabling even that right it's not we

1536
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:50,280
as enabling even that right it's not we
 

1537
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:52,730
as enabling even that right it's not we
cannot and won't build every single

1538
00:31:52,730 --> 00:31:52,740
cannot and won't build every single
 

1539
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:54,980
cannot and won't build every single
thing that just doesn't make sense but

1540
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:54,990
thing that just doesn't make sense but
 

1541
00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:57,020
thing that just doesn't make sense but
if we can enable others to build the

1542
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:57,030
if we can enable others to build the
 

1543
00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:58,940
if we can enable others to build the
things that they care about and there's

1544
00:31:58,940 --> 00:31:58,950
things that they care about and there's
 

1545
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:01,040
things that they care about and there's
a broader community that cares about

1546
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:01,050
a broader community that cares about
 

1547
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:03,610
a broader community that cares about
that and we can help encourage that and

1548
00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:03,620
that and we can help encourage that and
 

1549
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:05,990
that and we can help encourage that and
that that's great that really helps the

1550
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:06,000
that that's great that really helps the
 

1551
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,840
that that's great that really helps the
entire ecosystem not just those one of

1552
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:08,850
entire ecosystem not just those one of
 

1553
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:10,670
entire ecosystem not just those one of
the big things about 2.0 that we're

1554
00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:10,680
the big things about 2.0 that we're
 

1555
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:13,220
the big things about 2.0 that we're
pushing on is okay we have these so many

1556
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:13,230
pushing on is okay we have these so many
 

1557
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:15,440
pushing on is okay we have these so many
different pieces right how do we help

1558
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:15,450
different pieces right how do we help
 

1559
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:17,870
different pieces right how do we help
make all of them work well together

1560
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:17,880
make all of them work well together
 

1561
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:20,270
make all of them work well together
so there are few key pieces there that

1562
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:20,280
so there are few key pieces there that
 

1563
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:22,850
so there are few key pieces there that
we're pushing on one being the core

1564
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:22,860
we're pushing on one being the core
 

1565
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:25,280
we're pushing on one being the core
format in there and how we share the

1566
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:25,290
format in there and how we share the
 

1567
00:32:25,290 --> 00:32:27,620
format in there and how we share the
models themselves through save model and

1568
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:27,630
models themselves through save model and
 

1569
00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:31,130
models themselves through save model and
Martin's flow hub and so on and you know

1570
00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:31,140
Martin's flow hub and so on and you know
 

1571
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:32,720
Martin's flow hub and so on and you know
a few of the pieces that we really put

1572
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:32,730
a few of the pieces that we really put
 

1573
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:35,090
a few of the pieces that we really put
this together I was very skeptical that

1574
00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:35,100
this together I was very skeptical that
 

1575
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:37,010
this together I was very skeptical that
that's you know intensive for j/s came

1576
00:32:37,010 --> 00:32:37,020
that's you know intensive for j/s came
 

1577
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:39,350
that's you know intensive for j/s came
out I didn't seem or deep-learning j/s

1578
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:39,360
out I didn't seem or deep-learning j/s
 

1579
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:42,170
out I didn't seem or deep-learning j/s
yeah it was the first it seems like

1580
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:42,180
yeah it was the first it seems like
 

1581
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:45,170
yeah it was the first it seems like
technically very difficult project as a

1582
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:45,180
technically very difficult project as a
 

1583
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:47,300
technically very difficult project as a
standalone it's not as difficult but as

1584
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:47,310
standalone it's not as difficult but as
 

1585
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:49,280
standalone it's not as difficult but as
a thing that integrates into the

1586
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:49,290
a thing that integrates into the
 

1587
00:32:49,290 --> 00:32:51,860
a thing that integrates into the
ecosystems is very difficult so yeah I

1588
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:51,870
ecosystems is very difficult so yeah I
 

1589
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:53,150
ecosystems is very difficult so yeah I
mean there's a lot of aspects of this

1590
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:53,160
mean there's a lot of aspects of this
 

1591
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:56,300
mean there's a lot of aspects of this
you're making look easy but and the

1592
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:56,310
you're making look easy but and the
 

1593
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:58,280
you're making look easy but and the
technical side how many challenges have

1594
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:58,290
technical side how many challenges have
 

1595
00:32:58,290 --> 00:33:02,300
technical side how many challenges have
to be overcome here a lot and still have

1596
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:02,310
to be overcome here a lot and still have
 

1597
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:04,100
to be overcome here a lot and still have
to be yes that's the other question here

1598
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:04,110
to be yes that's the other question here
 

1599
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:06,080
to be yes that's the other question here
too there are lots of steps to a

1600
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:06,090
too there are lots of steps to a
 

1601
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:07,580
too there are lots of steps to a
training leave iterated over the last

1602
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:07,590
training leave iterated over the last
 

1603
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:10,600
training leave iterated over the last
few years so there's lot we've learned I

1604
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:10,610
few years so there's lot we've learned I
 

1605
00:33:10,610 --> 00:33:13,700
few years so there's lot we've learned I
yeah often when things come together

1606
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:13,710
yeah often when things come together
 

1607
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:14,960
yeah often when things come together
well things look easy

1608
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:14,970
well things look easy
 

1609
00:33:14,970 --> 00:33:16,970
well things look easy
that's exactly the point it should be

1610
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:16,980
that's exactly the point it should be
 

1611
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:18,830
that's exactly the point it should be
easy for the end user but there are lots

1612
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:18,840
easy for the end user but there are lots
 

1613
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:21,920
easy for the end user but there are lots
of things that go behind that if I think

1614
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:21,930
of things that go behind that if I think
 

1615
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:28,800
of things that go behind that if I think
about still challenges ahead there are

1616
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:28,810

 

1617
00:33:28,810 --> 00:33:32,100

you know we have a lot more devices

1618
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:32,110
you know we have a lot more devices
 

1619
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:33,720
you know we have a lot more devices
coming on board for example from the

1620
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:33,730
coming on board for example from the
 

1621
00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:35,880
coming on board for example from the
hardware perspective how do we make it

1622
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:35,890
hardware perspective how do we make it
 

1623
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:37,830
hardware perspective how do we make it
really easy for these vendors to

1624
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:37,840
really easy for these vendors to
 

1625
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,500
really easy for these vendors to
integrate with something like tensorflow

1626
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:40,510
integrate with something like tensorflow
 

1627
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:43,530
integrate with something like tensorflow
right so there's a lot of compiler stuff

1628
00:33:43,530 --> 00:33:43,540
right so there's a lot of compiler stuff
 

1629
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:46,590
right so there's a lot of compiler stuff
that others are working on there things

1630
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:46,600
that others are working on there things
 

1631
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,570
that others are working on there things
we can do in terms of our API is and so

1632
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:48,580
we can do in terms of our API is and so
 

1633
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:52,710
we can do in terms of our API is and so
on that we can do as we you know

1634
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:52,720
on that we can do as we you know
 

1635
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,690
on that we can do as we you know
tensorflow started as a very monolithic

1636
00:33:54,690 --> 00:33:54,700
tensorflow started as a very monolithic
 

1637
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:57,210
tensorflow started as a very monolithic
system and to some extent it still is

1638
00:33:57,210 --> 00:33:57,220
system and to some extent it still is
 

1639
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:59,340
system and to some extent it still is
there are less lots of tools around it

1640
00:33:59,340 --> 00:33:59,350
there are less lots of tools around it
 

1641
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:01,530
there are less lots of tools around it
but the core is still pretty large in

1642
00:34:01,530 --> 00:34:01,540
but the core is still pretty large in
 

1643
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:03,930
but the core is still pretty large in
monolithic one of the key challenges for

1644
00:34:03,930 --> 00:34:03,940
monolithic one of the key challenges for
 

1645
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:07,380
monolithic one of the key challenges for
us to scale that out is how do we break

1646
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:07,390
us to scale that out is how do we break
 

1647
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:11,000
us to scale that out is how do we break
that apart with clear interfaces it's

1648
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:11,010
that apart with clear interfaces it's
 

1649
00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:13,080
that apart with clear interfaces it's
you know in some ways its software

1650
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:13,090
you know in some ways its software
 

1651
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:16,230
you know in some ways its software
engineering 101 but for a system that's

1652
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:16,240
engineering 101 but for a system that's
 

1653
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:19,680
engineering 101 but for a system that's
now four years old I guess or more and

1654
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:19,690
now four years old I guess or more and
 

1655
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:21,930
now four years old I guess or more and
that's still rapidly evolving and that

1656
00:34:21,930 --> 00:34:21,940
that's still rapidly evolving and that
 

1657
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:24,780
that's still rapidly evolving and that
we're not slowing down with it's hard to

1658
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:24,790
we're not slowing down with it's hard to
 

1659
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:27,180
we're not slowing down with it's hard to
you know change and modify and really

1660
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:27,190
you know change and modify and really
 

1661
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:29,430
you know change and modify and really
break apart it's sort of like as people

1662
00:34:29,430 --> 00:34:29,440
break apart it's sort of like as people
 

1663
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,619
break apart it's sort of like as people
say right it's like changing the engine

1664
00:34:31,619 --> 00:34:31,629
say right it's like changing the engine
 

1665
00:34:31,629 --> 00:34:33,360
say right it's like changing the engine
with a car running or fake professor

1666
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:33,370
with a car running or fake professor
 

1667
00:34:33,370 --> 00:34:34,950
with a car running or fake professor
that's exactly what we're trying to do

1668
00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:34,960
that's exactly what we're trying to do
 

1669
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:39,210
that's exactly what we're trying to do
so there's a challenge here because the

1670
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:39,220
so there's a challenge here because the
 

1671
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:42,330
so there's a challenge here because the
downside of so many people being excited

1672
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:42,340
downside of so many people being excited
 

1673
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:45,629
downside of so many people being excited
about tensorflow and becoming to rely on

1674
00:34:45,629 --> 00:34:45,639
about tensorflow and becoming to rely on
 

1675
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:48,990
about tensorflow and becoming to rely on
it in many of their applications is that

1676
00:34:48,990 --> 00:34:49,000
it in many of their applications is that
 

1677
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,560
it in many of their applications is that
you're kind of responsible it's the

1678
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:52,570
you're kind of responsible it's the
 

1679
00:34:52,570 --> 00:34:54,540
you're kind of responsible it's the
technical debt you're responsible for

1680
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:54,550
technical debt you're responsible for
 

1681
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:56,430
technical debt you're responsible for
previous versions to some degree still

1682
00:34:56,430 --> 00:34:56,440
previous versions to some degree still
 

1683
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:58,380
previous versions to some degree still
working so when you're trying to

1684
00:34:58,380 --> 00:34:58,390
working so when you're trying to
 

1685
00:34:58,390 --> 00:35:02,400
working so when you're trying to
innovate I mean it's probably easier to

1686
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:02,410
innovate I mean it's probably easier to
 

1687
00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:05,390
innovate I mean it's probably easier to
just start from scratch every few months

1688
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:05,400
just start from scratch every few months
 

1689
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:08,730
just start from scratch every few months
absolutely so do you feel the pain of

1690
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:08,740
absolutely so do you feel the pain of
 

1691
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:12,810
absolutely so do you feel the pain of
that a 2.0 does break some back

1692
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:12,820
that a 2.0 does break some back
 

1693
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:15,660
that a 2.0 does break some back
compatibility but not too much it seems

1694
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:15,670
compatibility but not too much it seems
 

1695
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:16,620
compatibility but not too much it seems
like the conversion is pretty

1696
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:16,630
like the conversion is pretty
 

1697
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:19,050
like the conversion is pretty
straightforward and do you think that's

1698
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:19,060
straightforward and do you think that's
 

1699
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:21,870
straightforward and do you think that's
still important given how quickly deep

1700
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:21,880
still important given how quickly deep
 

1701
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:22,830
still important given how quickly deep
learning is changing

1702
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:22,840
learning is changing
 

1703
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:25,680
learning is changing
can you just the things that don't

1704
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:25,690
can you just the things that don't
 

1705
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:27,180
can you just the things that don't
you've learned can you just start over

1706
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:27,190
you've learned can you just start over
 

1707
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:30,480
you've learned can you just start over
or is there pressure to not it's it's a

1708
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:30,490
or is there pressure to not it's it's a
 

1709
00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:34,800
or is there pressure to not it's it's a
tricky balance so if it was just a

1710
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:34,810
tricky balance so if it was just a
 

1711
00:35:34,810 --> 00:35:37,110
tricky balance so if it was just a

1713
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,880
researcher writing a paper who a year
later will not look at that code again

1714
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:38,890
later will not look at that code again
 

1715
00:35:38,890 --> 00:35:41,260
later will not look at that code again
sure it doesn't matter

1716
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:41,270
sure it doesn't matter
 

1717
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:43,090
sure it doesn't matter
there are a lot of production systems

1718
00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:43,100
there are a lot of production systems
 

1719
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:45,430
there are a lot of production systems
that rely on tensor flow port at Google

1720
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:45,440
that rely on tensor flow port at Google
 

1721
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,720
that rely on tensor flow port at Google
and across the world

1722
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:46,730
and across the world
 

1723
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:49,960
and across the world
and people worry about this I mean

1724
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:49,970
and people worry about this I mean
 

1725
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:51,610
and people worry about this I mean
they're these systems run for a long

1726
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:51,620
they're these systems run for a long
 

1727
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:55,330
they're these systems run for a long
time so it is important to keep that

1728
00:35:55,330 --> 00:35:55,340
time so it is important to keep that
 

1729
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:58,150
time so it is important to keep that
compatibility and so on and yes it does

1730
00:35:58,150 --> 00:35:58,160
compatibility and so on and yes it does
 

1731
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:01,360
compatibility and so on and yes it does
come with a huge cost there's we have to

1732
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:01,370
come with a huge cost there's we have to
 

1733
00:36:01,370 --> 00:36:04,030
come with a huge cost there's we have to
think about a lot of things as we do new

1734
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:04,040
think about a lot of things as we do new
 

1735
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:08,320
think about a lot of things as we do new
things and make new changes I think it's

1736
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:08,330
things and make new changes I think it's
 

1737
00:36:08,330 --> 00:36:11,020
things and make new changes I think it's
a trade-off right you can you might slow

1738
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:11,030
a trade-off right you can you might slow
 

1739
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:13,240
a trade-off right you can you might slow
certain kinds of things down but the

1740
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:13,250
certain kinds of things down but the
 

1741
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:15,010
certain kinds of things down but the
overall value you're bringing because of

1742
00:36:15,010 --> 00:36:15,020
overall value you're bringing because of
 

1743
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:18,220
overall value you're bringing because of
that is is much bigger because it's not

1744
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:18,230
that is is much bigger because it's not
 

1745
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:19,810
that is is much bigger because it's not
just about breaking the person yesterday

1746
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:19,820
just about breaking the person yesterday
 

1747
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:23,020
just about breaking the person yesterday
it's also about telling the person

1748
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:23,030
it's also about telling the person
 

1749
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:25,480
it's also about telling the person
tomorrow that you know what this is how

1750
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:25,490
tomorrow that you know what this is how
 

1751
00:36:25,490 --> 00:36:26,920
tomorrow that you know what this is how
we do things you're not going to break

1752
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:26,930
we do things you're not going to break
 

1753
00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:28,900
we do things you're not going to break
you and you come on part because there

1754
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:28,910
you and you come on part because there
 

1755
00:36:28,910 --> 00:36:30,130
you and you come on part because there
are lots of new people who are also

1756
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:30,140
are lots of new people who are also
 

1757
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:33,040
are lots of new people who are also
going to come on board hey you know one

1758
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:33,050
going to come on board hey you know one
 

1759
00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:34,870
going to come on board hey you know one
way I like to think about this and I

1760
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:34,880
way I like to think about this and I
 

1761
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,790
way I like to think about this and I
always push the team to think about as

1762
00:36:36,790 --> 00:36:36,800
always push the team to think about as
 

1763
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,580
always push the team to think about as
well when you want to do neat things you

1764
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:39,590
well when you want to do neat things you
 

1765
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:41,370
well when you want to do neat things you
want to start with a clean slate

1766
00:36:41,370 --> 00:36:41,380
want to start with a clean slate
 

1767
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:44,890
want to start with a clean slate
design with a clean slate in mind and

1768
00:36:44,890 --> 00:36:44,900
design with a clean slate in mind and
 

1769
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:47,350
design with a clean slate in mind and
then we'll figure out how to make sure

1770
00:36:47,350 --> 00:36:47,360
then we'll figure out how to make sure
 

1771
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,510
then we'll figure out how to make sure
all the other things work and yes we do

1772
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:49,520
all the other things work and yes we do
 

1773
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:52,780
all the other things work and yes we do
make compromises occasionally but unless

1774
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:52,790
make compromises occasionally but unless
 

1775
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:55,270
make compromises occasionally but unless
you've designed with the clean slate and

1776
00:36:55,270 --> 00:36:55,280
you've designed with the clean slate and
 

1777
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,160
you've designed with the clean slate and
not worried about that you'll never get

1778
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:57,170
not worried about that you'll never get
 

1779
00:36:57,170 --> 00:36:59,530
not worried about that you'll never get
to a good place I was brilliant so even

1780
00:36:59,530 --> 00:36:59,540
to a good place I was brilliant so even
 

1781
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:02,740
to a good place I was brilliant so even
if you're do you are responsible when

1782
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:02,750
if you're do you are responsible when
 

1783
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:04,390
if you're do you are responsible when
you're in an idea stage when you're

1784
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:04,400
you're in an idea stage when you're
 

1785
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,550
you're in an idea stage when you're
thinking of new it just put all that

1786
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:06,560
thinking of new it just put all that
 

1787
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,260
thinking of new it just put all that
behind you yeah that's right okay that's

1788
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:08,270
behind you yeah that's right okay that's
 

1789
00:37:08,270 --> 00:37:10,660
behind you yeah that's right okay that's
really really well put so I have to ask

1790
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:10,670
really really well put so I have to ask
 

1791
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:11,920
really really well put so I have to ask
this because a lot of students

1792
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:11,930
this because a lot of students
 

1793
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:14,440
this because a lot of students
developers ask me how I feel about pie

1794
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:14,450
developers ask me how I feel about pie
 

1795
00:37:14,450 --> 00:37:17,350
developers ask me how I feel about pie
tours for successful so I've recently

1796
00:37:17,350 --> 00:37:17,360
tours for successful so I've recently
 

1797
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,870
tours for successful so I've recently
completely switched my research group to

1798
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:19,880
completely switched my research group to
 

1799
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:20,410
completely switched my research group to
tensorflow

1800
00:37:20,410 --> 00:37:20,420
tensorflow
 

1801
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:22,840
tensorflow
I wish everybody would just use the same

1802
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:22,850
I wish everybody would just use the same
 

1803
00:37:22,850 --> 00:37:25,000
I wish everybody would just use the same
thing and tensile force as close to that

1804
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:25,010
thing and tensile force as close to that
 

1805
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:29,800
thing and tensile force as close to that
I believe as we have but do you enjoy

1806
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:29,810
I believe as we have but do you enjoy
 

1807
00:37:29,810 --> 00:37:33,250
I believe as we have but do you enjoy
competition so testify was leading in

1808
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:33,260
competition so testify was leading in
 

1809
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:36,100
competition so testify was leading in
many ways on many dimensions in terms of

1810
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:36,110
many ways on many dimensions in terms of
 

1811
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:38,580
many ways on many dimensions in terms of
the ecosystem terms the number of users

1812
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:38,590
the ecosystem terms the number of users

the ecosystem terms the number of users
momentum power production level so on

1814
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:41,120
momentum power production level so on
 

1815
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:43,990
momentum power production level so on
but you know a lot of researchers and

1816
00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:44,000
but you know a lot of researchers and
 

1817
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,420
but you know a lot of researchers and
now also using PI torch do you enjoy

1818
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:46,430
now also using PI torch do you enjoy
 

1819
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:47,830
now also using PI torch do you enjoy
that kind of competition or do you just

1820
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:47,840
that kind of competition or do you just
 

1821
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:50,470
that kind of competition or do you just
ignore it and focus on making tencel

1822
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:50,480
ignore it and focus on making tencel
 

1823
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:53,230
ignore it and focus on making tencel
flow the best that it can be so just

1824
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:53,240
flow the best that it can be so just
 

1825
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:54,520
flow the best that it can be so just
like research or anything

1826
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:54,530
like research or anything
 

1827
00:37:54,530 --> 00:37:56,080
like research or anything
people are doing right it's great to get

1828
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:56,090
people are doing right it's great to get
 

1829
00:37:56,090 --> 00:38:00,250
people are doing right it's great to get
different kinds of ideas and when we

1830
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:00,260
different kinds of ideas and when we
 

1831
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:01,840
different kinds of ideas and when we
started with tensorflow like I was

1832
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:01,850
started with tensorflow like I was
 

1833
00:38:01,850 --> 00:38:05,200
started with tensorflow like I was
saying earlier one it was very important

1834
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:05,210
saying earlier one it was very important
 

1835
00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:06,970
saying earlier one it was very important
for us to also have production in mind

1836
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:06,980
for us to also have production in mind
 

1837
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:09,100
for us to also have production in mind
we didn't want just research right and

1838
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:09,110
we didn't want just research right and
 

1839
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:11,410
we didn't want just research right and
that's why we chose certain things now

1840
00:38:11,410 --> 00:38:11,420
that's why we chose certain things now
 

1841
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:13,000
that's why we chose certain things now
pi torch came along and said you know

1842
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:13,010
pi torch came along and said you know
 

1843
00:38:13,010 --> 00:38:15,130
pi torch came along and said you know
what I only care about research this is

1844
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:15,140
what I only care about research this is
 

1845
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:16,660
what I only care about research this is
what I'm trying to do what's the best

1846
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:16,670
what I'm trying to do what's the best
 

1847
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:19,390
what I'm trying to do what's the best
thing I can do for this and it started

1848
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:19,400
thing I can do for this and it started
 

1849
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,550
thing I can do for this and it started
iterating and said okay I don't need to

1850
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:21,560
iterating and said okay I don't need to
 

1851
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,290
iterating and said okay I don't need to
worry about drafts let me just run

1852
00:38:23,290 --> 00:38:23,300
worry about drafts let me just run
 

1853
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:26,680
worry about drafts let me just run
things I don't care if it's not as fast

1854
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:26,690
things I don't care if it's not as fast
 

1855
00:38:26,690 --> 00:38:28,240
things I don't care if it's not as fast
as it can be but let me just you know

1856
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:28,250
as it can be but let me just you know
 

1857
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:31,390
as it can be but let me just you know
make this part easy and there are things

1858
00:38:31,390 --> 00:38:31,400
make this part easy and there are things
 

1859
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,980
make this part easy and there are things
you can learn from that right they they

1860
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:32,990
you can learn from that right they they
 

1861
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:35,140
you can learn from that right they they
again had the benefit of seeing what had

1862
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:35,150
again had the benefit of seeing what had
 

1863
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:39,220
again had the benefit of seeing what had
come before but also exploring certain

1864
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:39,230
come before but also exploring certain
 

1865
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:42,400
come before but also exploring certain
different kinds of spaces and they had

1866
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:42,410
different kinds of spaces and they had
 

1867
00:38:42,410 --> 00:38:43,780
different kinds of spaces and they had
some good things there you know building

1868
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:43,790
some good things there you know building
 

1869
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:45,400
some good things there you know building
on say things like chain and so on

1870
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:45,410
on say things like chain and so on
 

1871
00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:48,670
on say things like chain and so on
before that so competition is definitely

1872
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:48,680
before that so competition is definitely
 

1873
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:50,560
before that so competition is definitely
interesting it made us you know this is

1874
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:50,570
interesting it made us you know this is
 

1875
00:38:50,570 --> 00:38:52,060
interesting it made us you know this is
an area that we had thought about like I

1876
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:52,070
an area that we had thought about like I
 

1877
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:54,310
an area that we had thought about like I
said you know very early on over time we

1878
00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:54,320
said you know very early on over time we
 

1879
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,530
said you know very early on over time we
had revisited this a couple of times

1880
00:38:56,530 --> 00:38:56,540
had revisited this a couple of times
 

1881
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:59,320
had revisited this a couple of times
should we add this again at some point

1882
00:38:59,320 --> 00:38:59,330
should we add this again at some point
 

1883
00:38:59,330 --> 00:39:01,450
should we add this again at some point
we said you know what here's it seems

1884
00:39:01,450 --> 00:39:01,460
we said you know what here's it seems
 

1885
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:03,850
we said you know what here's it seems
like this can be done well so let's try

1886
00:39:03,850 --> 00:39:03,860
like this can be done well so let's try
 

1887
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:05,650
like this can be done well so let's try
it again and week that's how you know we

1888
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:05,660
it again and week that's how you know we
 

1889
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:07,780
it again and week that's how you know we
started pushing on eager execution how

1890
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:07,790
started pushing on eager execution how
 

1891
00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:09,970
started pushing on eager execution how
do we combine those two together which

1892
00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:09,980
do we combine those two together which
 

1893
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:12,610
do we combine those two together which
has finally come very well together in

1894
00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:12,620
has finally come very well together in
 

1895
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:14,560
has finally come very well together in
2.0 but it took us a while to get all

1896
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:14,570
2.0 but it took us a while to get all
 

1897
00:39:14,570 --> 00:39:16,690
2.0 but it took us a while to get all
the things together and so on so let me

1898
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:16,700
the things together and so on so let me
 

1899
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:19,930
the things together and so on so let me
I mean ask put another way I think eager

1900
00:39:19,930 --> 00:39:19,940
I mean ask put another way I think eager
 

1901
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,550
I mean ask put another way I think eager
execution is a really powerful thing

1902
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:21,560
execution is a really powerful thing
 

1903
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,500
execution is a really powerful thing
those at it you think he wouldn't have

1904
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:23,510
those at it you think he wouldn't have
 

1905
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:25,270
those at it you think he wouldn't have
been

1906
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:25,280
been
 

1907
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,310
been
you know Muhammad Ali versus Frazier

1908
00:39:27,310 --> 00:39:27,320
you know Muhammad Ali versus Frazier
 

1909
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:30,040
you know Muhammad Ali versus Frazier
right you think it wouldn't have been

1910
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:30,050
right you think it wouldn't have been
 

1911
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:32,109
right you think it wouldn't have been
added as quickly if pi torch wasn't

1912
00:39:32,109 --> 00:39:32,119
added as quickly if pi torch wasn't
 

1913
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:35,170
added as quickly if pi torch wasn't
there it weight might have taken longer

1914
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:35,180
there it weight might have taken longer
 

1915
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:37,690
there it weight might have taken longer
no long yeah it was I mean we dried some

1916
00:39:37,690 --> 00:39:37,700
no long yeah it was I mean we dried some
 

1917
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:39,820
no long yeah it was I mean we dried some
radiance of that before so I'm sure it

1918
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:39,830
radiance of that before so I'm sure it
 

1919
00:39:39,830 --> 00:39:41,470
radiance of that before so I'm sure it
would ever happen but it might have

1920
00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:41,480
would ever happen but it might have
 

1921
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,089
would ever happen but it might have
taken longer I'm grateful that

1922
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:43,099
taken longer I'm grateful that
 

1923
00:39:43,099 --> 00:39:44,680
taken longer I'm grateful that
tensorflow responds in the way they did

1924
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:44,690
tensorflow responds in the way they did
 

1925
00:39:44,690 --> 00:39:46,599
tensorflow responds in the way they did
it's doing some incredible work last

1926
00:39:46,599 --> 00:39:46,609
it's doing some incredible work last
 

1927
00:39:46,609 --> 00:39:48,940
it's doing some incredible work last
couple years what are the things that we

1928
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:48,950
couple years what are the things that we
 

1929
00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:49,990
couple years what are the things that we
didn't talk about are you looking

1930
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:50,000
didn't talk about are you looking
 

1931
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,099
didn't talk about are you looking
forward in 2.0 that it comes to mind so

1932
00:39:54,099 --> 00:39:54,109
forward in 2.0 that it comes to mind so
 

1933
00:39:54,109 --> 00:39:55,420
forward in 2.0 that it comes to mind so
we talked about some of the ecosystem

1934
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:55,430
we talked about some of the ecosystem
 

1935
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:58,870
we talked about some of the ecosystem
stuff making it easily accessible to

1936
00:39:58,870 --> 00:39:58,880
stuff making it easily accessible to
 

1937
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:01,720
stuff making it easily accessible to
Karis Iker execution is there other

1938
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:01,730
Karis Iker execution is there other
 

1939
00:40:01,730 --> 00:40:04,150
Karis Iker execution is there other
things that we missed yeah I would say

1940
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:04,160
things that we missed yeah I would say
 

1941
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:07,839
things that we missed yeah I would say
one is just where 2.0 is and you know

1942
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:07,849
one is just where 2.0 is and you know
 

1943
00:40:07,849 --> 00:40:09,580
one is just where 2.0 is and you know
with all the things that we've talked

1944
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:09,590
with all the things that we've talked
 

1945
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:13,180
with all the things that we've talked
about I think as we think beyond that

1946
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:13,190
about I think as we think beyond that
 

1947
00:40:13,190 --> 00:40:15,130
about I think as we think beyond that
there are lots of other things that it

1948
00:40:15,130 --> 00:40:15,140
there are lots of other things that it
 

1949
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:17,710
there are lots of other things that it
enables us to do and that we are excited

1950
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:17,720
enables us to do and that we are excited
 

1951
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:20,890
enables us to do and that we are excited
about so what it's setting us up for ok

1952
00:40:20,890 --> 00:40:20,900
about so what it's setting us up for ok
 

1953
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:22,599
about so what it's setting us up for ok
the hair these really clean api's we've

1954
00:40:22,599 --> 00:40:22,609
the hair these really clean api's we've
 

1955
00:40:22,609 --> 00:40:24,070
the hair these really clean api's we've
cleaned up the surface for what the

1956
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:24,080
cleaned up the surface for what the
 

1957
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:26,710
cleaned up the surface for what the
users warned what it does also allows us

1958
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:26,720
users warned what it does also allows us
 

1959
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,750
users warned what it does also allows us
to do a whole bunch of stuff behind the

1960
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:28,760
to do a whole bunch of stuff behind the
 

1961
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:31,359
to do a whole bunch of stuff behind the
scenes once we've we are ready with 2.0

1962
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:31,369
scenes once we've we are ready with 2.0
 

1963
00:40:31,369 --> 00:40:36,070
scenes once we've we are ready with 2.0
so for example intensive flow with

1964
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:36,080
so for example intensive flow with
 

1965
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:37,660
so for example intensive flow with
graphs and all the things you could do

1966
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:37,670
graphs and all the things you could do
 

1967
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:39,520
graphs and all the things you could do
you could always get a lot of good

1968
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:39,530
you could always get a lot of good
 

1969
00:40:39,530 --> 00:40:41,500
you could always get a lot of good
performance if you spent the time to

1970
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:41,510
performance if you spent the time to
 

1971
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:45,640
performance if you spent the time to
tune it right and we have clearly shown

1972
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:45,650
tune it right and we have clearly shown
 

1973
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:50,109
tune it right and we have clearly shown
that lots of people do that the 2.0 with

1974
00:40:50,109 --> 00:40:50,119
that lots of people do that the 2.0 with
 

1975
00:40:50,119 --> 00:40:53,740
that lots of people do that the 2.0 with
these API is where we are we can give

1976
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:53,750
these API is where we are we can give
 

1977
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:55,510
these API is where we are we can give
you a lot of performance just with

1978
00:40:55,510 --> 00:40:55,520
you a lot of performance just with
 

1979
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,730
you a lot of performance just with
whatever you do you know if you're

1980
00:40:57,730 --> 00:40:57,740
whatever you do you know if you're
 

1981
00:40:57,740 --> 00:40:59,470
whatever you do you know if you're
because we see please

1982
00:40:59,470 --> 00:40:59,480
because we see please
 

1983
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:02,170
because we see please
it's much cleaner we know most people

1984
00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:02,180
it's much cleaner we know most people
 

1985
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:04,000
it's much cleaner we know most people
are going to do things this way we can

1986
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:04,010
are going to do things this way we can
 

1987
00:41:04,010 --> 00:41:06,670
are going to do things this way we can
really optimize for that and get a lot

1988
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:06,680
really optimize for that and get a lot
 

1989
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:09,220
really optimize for that and get a lot
of those things out of the box and it

1990
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:09,230
of those things out of the box and it
 

1991
00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:10,930
of those things out of the box and it
really allows us you know both for

1992
00:41:10,930 --> 00:41:10,940
really allows us you know both for
 

1993
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:13,420
really allows us you know both for
single machine and distributed and so on

1994
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:13,430
single machine and distributed and so on
 

1995
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:16,329
single machine and distributed and so on
really explore other spaces behind the

1996
00:41:16,329 --> 00:41:16,339
really explore other spaces behind the
 

1997
00:41:16,339 --> 00:41:18,820
really explore other spaces behind the
scenes after you know 2.0 in the future

1998
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:18,830
scenes after you know 2.0 in the future
 

1999
00:41:18,830 --> 00:41:21,579
scenes after you know 2.0 in the future
versions as well so right now the team

2000
00:41:21,579 --> 00:41:21,589
versions as well so right now the team
 

2001
00:41:21,589 --> 00:41:23,620
versions as well so right now the team
is really excited about that that over

2002
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:23,630
is really excited about that that over
 

2003
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:26,290
is really excited about that that over
time I think we'll see that the other

2004
00:41:26,290 --> 00:41:26,300
time I think we'll see that the other
 

2005
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:27,849
time I think we'll see that the other
piece that I was talking about in terms

2006
00:41:27,849 --> 00:41:27,859
piece that I was talking about in terms
 

2007
00:41:27,859 --> 00:41:31,300
piece that I was talking about in terms
of just restructuring the monolithic

2008
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:31,310
of just restructuring the monolithic
 

2009
00:41:31,310 --> 00:41:32,950
of just restructuring the monolithic
thing into more pieces and making it

2010
00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:32,960
thing into more pieces and making it
 

2011
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,980
thing into more pieces and making it
more modular I think that's going to be

2012
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:35,990
more modular I think that's going to be
 

2013
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:38,650
more modular I think that's going to be
really important for a lot

2014
00:41:38,650 --> 00:41:38,660
really important for a lot
 

2015
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:41,830
really important for a lot
the other people in the ecosystem are

2016
00:41:41,830 --> 00:41:41,840
the other people in the ecosystem are
 

2017
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:43,390
the other people in the ecosystem are
their organizations and so on that

2018
00:41:43,390 --> 00:41:43,400
their organizations and so on that
 

2019
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,370
their organizations and so on that
wanted to build things can you elaborate

2020
00:41:45,370 --> 00:41:45,380
wanted to build things can you elaborate
 

2021
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:47,080
wanted to build things can you elaborate
a little bit what you mean by making

2022
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:47,090
a little bit what you mean by making
 

2023
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:50,200
a little bit what you mean by making
tons of flow more ecosystem more modular

2024
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:50,210
tons of flow more ecosystem more modular
 

2025
00:41:50,210 --> 00:41:53,470
tons of flow more ecosystem more modular
so the way it's organized today is

2026
00:41:53,470 --> 00:41:53,480
so the way it's organized today is
 

2027
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:55,540
so the way it's organized today is
there's one there are lots of

2028
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:55,550
there's one there are lots of
 

2029
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:56,710
there's one there are lots of
repositories in the tensorflow

2030
00:41:56,710 --> 00:41:56,720
repositories in the tensorflow

and do that I mean we kind of support
 

2059
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:35,170
and do that I mean we kind of support
that but it's hard for people today I

2060
00:42:35,170 --> 00:42:35,180
that but it's hard for people today I
 

2061
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:37,030
that but it's hard for people today I
think as we are starting to see more

2062
00:42:37,030 --> 00:42:37,040
think as we are starting to see more
 

2063
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,560
think as we are starting to see more
interesting things in some of these

things more independently just allows it
 

2077
00:42:55,010 --> 00:42:57,100
things more independently just allows it
to scale better and by people you mean

they are not the ones that do the
 

2097
00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:20,530
they are not the ones that do the
development or changes in the core some

development or changes in the core some
 

2099
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:21,970

00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:37,250
involved in some of our special interest
 

2115
00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:40,060
involved in some of our special interest
groups and they see a lot of users who

2116
00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:40,070
groups and they see a lot of users who
 

2117
00:43:40,070 --> 00:43:41,440

want certain things and they want to
 

2119
00:43:41,450 --> 00:43:43,180
want certain things and they want to
optimize for that so folks like that

2120
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:43,190
optimize for that so folks like that
 

2121
00:43:43,190 --> 00:43:45,550

perhaps exactly yes so yeah like I

2124
00:43:49,690 --> 00:43:49,700
perhaps exactly yes so yeah like I
 

2125
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:50,980
perhaps exactly yes so yeah like I
mentioned tensorflow has been downloaded

2126
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:50,990
mentioned tensorflow has been downloaded
 

2127
00:43:50,990 --> 00:43:52,500
mentioned tensorflow has been downloaded
41 million

requests and 1,800 contributors so I'm

2132
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:00,050
requests and 1,800 contributors so I'm
 

2133
00:44:00,050 --> 00:44:02,850
requests and 1,800 contributors so I'm
not sure if you can explain it but Oh

2134
00:44:02,850 --> 00:44:02,860
not sure if you can explain it but Oh
 

2135
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:05,290
not sure if you can explain it but Oh
what does it take to build a community

2136
00:44:05,290 --> 00:44:05,300
what does it take to build a community
 

2137
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:08,200
what does it take to build a community
like that what if in retrospect what do

2138
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:08,210
like that what if in retrospect what do
 

2139
00:44:08,210 --> 00:44:10,300
like that what if in retrospect what do
you think what is the critical thing

2140
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:10,310
you think what is the critical thing
 

2141
00:44:10,310 --> 00:44:12,340
you think what is the critical thing
that allowed for this growth to happen

2142
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:12,350
that allowed for this growth to happen
 

2143
00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:15,610
that allowed for this growth to happen
and how does that growth continue yeah

2144
00:44:15,610 --> 00:44:15,620
and how does that growth continue yeah
 

2145
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:17,950
and how does that growth continue yeah
uh yeah that's a interesting question I

2146
00:44:17,950 --> 00:44:17,960
uh yeah that's a interesting question I
 

2147
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:20,170
uh yeah that's a interesting question I
wish I had all the answers there I guess

2148
00:44:20,170 --> 00:44:20,180
wish I had all the answers there I guess
 

2149
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:22,870
wish I had all the answers there I guess
so you could replicate it I I think

2150
00:44:22,870 --> 00:44:22,880
so you could replicate it I I think
 

2151
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:25,540
so you could replicate it I I think
there's a there number of things that

2152
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:25,550
there's a there number of things that
 

2153
00:44:25,550 --> 00:44:29,620
there's a there number of things that
need to come together right a one you

2154
00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:29,630
need to come together right a one you
 

2155
00:44:29,630 --> 00:44:33,220
need to come together right a one you
know just like any new thing it is about

2156
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:33,230
know just like any new thing it is about
 

2157
00:44:33,230 --> 00:44:36,190
know just like any new thing it is about
there's a sweet spot of timing what's

2158
00:44:36,190 --> 00:44:36,200
there's a sweet spot of timing what's
 

2159
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:39,070
there's a sweet spot of timing what's
needed you know does it grow with what's

2160
00:44:39,070 --> 00:44:39,080
needed you know does it grow with what's
 

2161
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:41,350
needed you know does it grow with what's
needed so in this case for example

2162
00:44:41,350 --> 00:44:41,360
needed so in this case for example
 

2163
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:42,910
needed so in this case for example
tensa flow is not just grown because it

2164
00:44:42,910 --> 00:44:42,920
tensa flow is not just grown because it
 

2165
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:44,560
tensa flow is not just grown because it
was a good tool it's also grown with the

2166
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:44,570
was a good tool it's also grown with the
 

2167
00:44:44,570 --> 00:44:47,230
was a good tool it's also grown with the
growth of deep learning itself so those

2168
00:44:47,230 --> 00:44:47,240
growth of deep learning itself so those
 

2169
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:48,340
growth of deep learning itself so those
factors come into play

2170
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:48,350
factors come into play
 

2171
00:44:48,350 --> 00:44:52,870
factors come into play
other than that though I think just

2172
00:44:52,870 --> 00:44:52,880
other than that though I think just
 

2173
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:55,330
other than that though I think just
hearing listening to the community what

2174
00:44:55,330 --> 00:44:55,340
hearing listening to the community what
 

2175
00:44:55,340 --> 00:44:57,790
hearing listening to the community what
they're - what they need being open to

2176
00:44:57,790 --> 00:44:57,800
they're - what they need being open to
 

2177
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:00,370
they're - what they need being open to
like in terms of external contributions

2178
00:45:00,370 --> 00:45:00,380
like in terms of external contributions
 

2179
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:03,670
like in terms of external contributions
we've spent a lot of time in making sure

2180
00:45:03,670 --> 00:45:03,680
we've spent a lot of time in making sure
 

2181
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:06,580
we've spent a lot of time in making sure
we can accept those contributions well

2182
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:06,590
we can accept those contributions well
 

2183
00:45:06,590 --> 00:45:08,560
we can accept those contributions well
we can help the contributors in in

2184
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:08,570
we can help the contributors in in
 

2185
00:45:08,570 --> 00:45:10,480
we can help the contributors in in
adding those putting the right process

2186
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:10,490
adding those putting the right process
 

2187
00:45:10,490 --> 00:45:12,400
adding those putting the right process
in place getting the right kind of

2188
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:12,410
in place getting the right kind of
 

2189
00:45:12,410 --> 00:45:16,300
in place getting the right kind of
community welcoming them and so on like

2190
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:16,310
community welcoming them and so on like
 

2191
00:45:16,310 --> 00:45:17,830
community welcoming them and so on like
over the last year we've really pushed

2192
00:45:17,830 --> 00:45:17,840
over the last year we've really pushed
 

2193
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,930
over the last year we've really pushed
on transparency that that's important

2194
00:45:19,930 --> 00:45:19,940
on transparency that that's important
 

2195
00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:22,690
on transparency that that's important
for an open source project people want

2196
00:45:22,690 --> 00:45:22,700
for an open source project people want
 

2197
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:23,890
for an open source project people want
to know where things are going and

2198
00:45:23,890 --> 00:45:23,900
to know where things are going and
 

2199
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:26,320
to know where things are going and
they're like okay here's a process where

2200
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:26,330
they're like okay here's a process where
 

2201
00:45:26,330 --> 00:45:29,530
they're like okay here's a process where
you can do that here RFC's and so on so

2202
00:45:29,530 --> 00:45:29,540
you can do that here RFC's and so on so
 

2203
00:45:29,540 --> 00:45:31,480
you can do that here RFC's and so on so
thinking through there are lots of

2204
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:31,490
thinking through there are lots of
 

2205
00:45:31,490 --> 00:45:33,610
thinking through there are lots of
community aspects that come into that

2206
00:45:33,610 --> 00:45:33,620
community aspects that come into that
 

2207
00:45:33,620 --> 00:45:37,030
community aspects that come into that
you can really work on as a small

2208
00:45:37,030 --> 00:45:37,040
you can really work on as a small
 

2209
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:38,860
you can really work on as a small
project it's may be easy to do because

2210
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:38,870
project it's may be easy to do because
 

2211
00:45:38,870 --> 00:45:41,020
project it's may be easy to do because
there's like two developers in and you

2212
00:45:41,020 --> 00:45:41,030
there's like two developers in and you
 

2213
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:45,490
there's like two developers in and you
can do those as you grow putting more of

2214
00:45:45,490 --> 00:45:45,500
can do those as you grow putting more of
 

2215
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:47,500
can do those as you grow putting more of
these processes in place thinking about

2216
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:47,510
these processes in place thinking about
 

2217
00:45:47,510 --> 00:45:50,620
these processes in place thinking about
the documentation thinking about what to

2218
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:50,630
the documentation thinking about what to
 

2219
00:45:50,630 --> 00:45:52,570
the documentation thinking about what to
developers care about what kind of tools

2220
00:45:52,570 --> 00:45:52,580
developers care about what kind of tools
 

2221
00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:55,720
developers care about what kind of tools
would they want to use one of these come

2222
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:55,730
would they want to use one of these come
 

2223
00:45:55,730 --> 00:45:58,090
would they want to use one of these come
into planting so one of the big things I

2224
00:45:58,090 --> 00:45:58,100
into planting so one of the big things I
 

2225
00:45:58,100 --> 00:46:00,760
into planting so one of the big things I
think that feeds the tensorflow fire is

2226
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:00,770
think that feeds the tensorflow fire is
 

2227
00:46:00,770 --> 00:46:03,280
think that feeds the tensorflow fire is
people building something on tensorflow

2228
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:03,290
people building something on tensorflow
 

2229
00:46:03,290 --> 00:46:05,700
people building something on tensorflow
and you know some

2230
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:05,710
and you know some
 

2231
00:46:05,710 --> 00:46:07,739
and you know some
implement a particular architecture that

2232
00:46:07,739 --> 00:46:07,749
implement a particular architecture that
 

2233
00:46:07,749 --> 00:46:09,960
implement a particular architecture that
does something cool useful and they put

2234
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:09,970
does something cool useful and they put
 

2235
00:46:09,970 --> 00:46:11,700
does something cool useful and they put
it at that and github and so it just

2236
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:11,710
it at that and github and so it just
 

2237
00:46:11,710 --> 00:46:16,529
it at that and github and so it just
feeds this this growth these have a

2238
00:46:16,529 --> 00:46:16,539
feeds this this growth these have a
 

2239
00:46:16,539 --> 00:46:19,980
feeds this this growth these have a
sense that with 2.0 and 1.0 that there

2240
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:19,990
sense that with 2.0 and 1.0 that there
 

2241
00:46:19,990 --> 00:46:21,480
sense that with 2.0 and 1.0 that there
may be a little bit of a partitioning

2242
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:21,490
may be a little bit of a partitioning
 

2243
00:46:21,490 --> 00:46:24,150
may be a little bit of a partitioning
like there's a Python two and three but

2244
00:46:24,150 --> 00:46:24,160
like there's a Python two and three but
 

2245
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:27,329
like there's a Python two and three but
there'll be a code base and in the older

2246
00:46:27,329 --> 00:46:27,339
there'll be a code base and in the older
 

2247
00:46:27,339 --> 00:46:28,799
there'll be a code base and in the older
versions of test fall there will not be

2248
00:46:28,799 --> 00:46:28,809
versions of test fall there will not be
 

2249
00:46:28,809 --> 00:46:32,339
versions of test fall there will not be
as compatible easily or any pretty

2250
00:46:32,339 --> 00:46:32,349
as compatible easily or any pretty
 

2251
00:46:32,349 --> 00:46:34,730
as compatible easily or any pretty
confident that this kind of conversion

2252
00:46:34,730 --> 00:46:34,740
confident that this kind of conversion
 

2253
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:38,099
confident that this kind of conversion
it's pretty natural and easy to do so

2254
00:46:38,099 --> 00:46:38,109
it's pretty natural and easy to do so
 

2255
00:46:38,109 --> 00:46:40,289
it's pretty natural and easy to do so
we're definitely working on hard to make

2256
00:46:40,289 --> 00:46:40,299
we're definitely working on hard to make
 

2257
00:46:40,299 --> 00:46:42,089
we're definitely working on hard to make
that very easy to do there's lots of

2258
00:46:42,089 --> 00:46:42,099
that very easy to do there's lots of
 

2259
00:46:42,099 --> 00:46:43,589
that very easy to do there's lots of
tooling that we talked about at the

2260
00:46:43,589 --> 00:46:43,599
tooling that we talked about at the
 

2261
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:46,109
tooling that we talked about at the
developer summit this week and really

2262
00:46:46,109 --> 00:46:46,119
developer summit this week and really
 

2263
00:46:46,119 --> 00:46:48,739
developer summit this week and really
continue to invest in that tooling it's

2264
00:46:48,739 --> 00:46:48,749
continue to invest in that tooling it's
 

2265
00:46:48,749 --> 00:46:50,789
continue to invest in that tooling it's
you know when you think of these

2266
00:46:50,789 --> 00:46:50,799
you know when you think of these
 

2267
00:46:50,799 --> 00:46:52,739
you know when you think of these
significant version changes that's

2268
00:46:52,739 --> 00:46:52,749
significant version changes that's
 

2269
00:46:52,749 --> 00:46:54,989
significant version changes that's
always a risk and we we are really

2270
00:46:54,989 --> 00:46:54,999
always a risk and we we are really
 

2271
00:46:54,999 --> 00:46:56,640
always a risk and we we are really
pushing hard to make that transition

2272
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:56,650
pushing hard to make that transition
 

2273
00:46:56,650 --> 00:47:00,809
pushing hard to make that transition
very very smooth I I think so

2274
00:47:00,809 --> 00:47:00,819
very very smooth I I think so
 

2275
00:47:00,819 --> 00:47:03,749
very very smooth I I think so
so at some level people want to move and

2276
00:47:03,749 --> 00:47:03,759
so at some level people want to move and
 

2277
00:47:03,759 --> 00:47:05,700
so at some level people want to move and
they see the value in the new thing they

2278
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:05,710
they see the value in the new thing they
 

2279
00:47:05,710 --> 00:47:07,109
they see the value in the new thing they
don't want to move just because it's a

2280
00:47:07,109 --> 00:47:07,119
don't want to move just because it's a
 

2281
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:08,789
don't want to move just because it's a
new thing and some people do it but most

2282
00:47:08,789 --> 00:47:08,799
new thing and some people do it but most
 

2283
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:11,970
new thing and some people do it but most
people want a really good thing and I

2284
00:47:11,970 --> 00:47:11,980
people want a really good thing and I
 

2285
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:14,160
people want a really good thing and I
think over the next few months as people

2286
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:14,170
think over the next few months as people
 

2287
00:47:14,170 --> 00:47:16,380
think over the next few months as people
start to see the value will F&T see that

2288
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:16,390
start to see the value will F&T see that
 

2289
00:47:16,390 --> 00:47:18,809
start to see the value will F&T see that
shift happening so I'm pretty excited

2290
00:47:18,809 --> 00:47:18,819
shift happening so I'm pretty excited
 

2291
00:47:18,819 --> 00:47:21,029
shift happening so I'm pretty excited
and confident that we will see people

2292
00:47:21,029 --> 00:47:21,039
and confident that we will see people
 

2293
00:47:21,039 --> 00:47:23,700
and confident that we will see people
moving as you said earlier this field is

2294
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:23,710
moving as you said earlier this field is
 

2295
00:47:23,710 --> 00:47:25,140
moving as you said earlier this field is
also moving rapidly so that'll help

2296
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:25,150
also moving rapidly so that'll help
 

2297
00:47:25,150 --> 00:47:27,329
also moving rapidly so that'll help
because we can do more things and you

2298
00:47:27,329 --> 00:47:27,339
because we can do more things and you
 

2299
00:47:27,339 --> 00:47:28,829
because we can do more things and you
know the new things will clearly happen

2300
00:47:28,829 --> 00:47:28,839
know the new things will clearly happen
 

2301
00:47:28,839 --> 00:47:30,930
know the new things will clearly happen
into point X so people who have lots of

2302
00:47:30,930 --> 00:47:30,940
into point X so people who have lots of
 

2303
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:32,729
into point X so people who have lots of
good reasons to move so what do you

2304
00:47:32,729 --> 00:47:32,739
good reasons to move so what do you
 

2305
00:47:32,739 --> 00:47:36,420
good reasons to move so what do you
think that's the 43.0 looks like is that

2306
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:36,430
think that's the 43.0 looks like is that
 

2307
00:47:36,430 --> 00:47:37,680
think that's the 43.0 looks like is that
is there

2308
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:37,690
is there
 

2309
00:47:37,690 --> 00:47:39,839
is there
it's everything's happening so crazily

2310
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:39,849
it's everything's happening so crazily
 

2311
00:47:39,849 --> 00:47:42,779
it's everything's happening so crazily
that even at the end of this year seems

2312
00:47:42,779 --> 00:47:42,789
that even at the end of this year seems
 

2313
00:47:42,789 --> 00:47:46,680
that even at the end of this year seems
impossible to plan for or is it possible

2314
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:46,690
impossible to plan for or is it possible
 

2315
00:47:46,690 --> 00:47:49,559
impossible to plan for or is it possible
to plan for the next five years I I

2316
00:47:49,559 --> 00:47:49,569
to plan for the next five years I I
 

2317
00:47:49,569 --> 00:47:51,509
to plan for the next five years I I
think it's tricky there are some things

2318
00:47:51,509 --> 00:47:51,519
think it's tricky there are some things
 

2319
00:47:51,519 --> 00:47:55,349
think it's tricky there are some things
that we can expect in terms of okay

2320
00:47:55,349 --> 00:47:55,359
that we can expect in terms of okay
 

2321
00:47:55,359 --> 00:47:58,789
that we can expect in terms of okay
change yes change is going to happen I

2322
00:47:58,789 --> 00:47:58,799
change yes change is going to happen I
 

2323
00:47:58,799 --> 00:48:01,079
change yes change is going to happen I
are there some good things going to

2324
00:48:01,079 --> 00:48:01,089
are there some good things going to
 

2325
00:48:01,089 --> 00:48:02,670
are there some good things going to
stick around and something's not going

2326
00:48:02,670 --> 00:48:02,680
stick around and something's not going
 

2327
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:06,749
stick around and something's not going
to stick around I would say that the

2328
00:48:06,749 --> 00:48:06,759
to stick around I would say that the
 

2329
00:48:06,759 --> 00:48:09,239
to stick around I would say that the
basics of deep learning the you know say

2330
00:48:09,239 --> 00:48:09,249
basics of deep learning the you know say
 

2331
00:48:09,249 --> 00:48:12,150
basics of deep learning the you know say
convolution models or the basic kind of

2332
00:48:12,150 --> 00:48:12,160
convolution models or the basic kind of
 

2333
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:13,739
convolution models or the basic kind of
things they'll probably be around in

2334
00:48:13,739 --> 00:48:13,749
things they'll probably be around in
 

2335
00:48:13,749 --> 00:48:17,009
things they'll probably be around in
some form still in five years will rln

2336
00:48:17,009 --> 00:48:17,019
some form still in five years will rln
 

2337
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:19,650
some form still in five years will rln
ganz stay very likely

2338
00:48:19,650 --> 00:48:19,660
ganz stay very likely
 

2339
00:48:19,660 --> 00:48:21,780
ganz stay very likely

based on where they are we have new
 

2341
00:48:21,790 --> 00:48:24,120
based on where they are we have new
things probably but those are hard to

00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:24,130
things probably but those are hard to
 

2343
00:48:24,130 --> 00:48:27,840
things probably but those are hard to
predict and some directionally some

00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:27,850
predict and some directionally some
 

2345

things that we can see is you know and

2346
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:31,210
things that we can see is you know and
 

2347
00:48:31,210 --> 00:48:32,610
things that we can see is you know and
things that we're starting to do right

00:48:32,610 --> 00:48:32,620
things that we're starting to do right
 

2349
00:48:32,620 --> 00:48:35,540
things that we're starting to do right
with some of our projects right now is

2350
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:35,550
with some of our projects right now is
 

2351
00:48:35,550 --> 00:48:38,160
with some of our projects right now is
just 2.0 combining you could execution

2352
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:38,170
just 2.0 combining you could execution
 

2353

00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:43,630
programming language you're not trying
 

2359
00:48:43,630 --> 00:48:45,450
programming language you're not trying
to program something else

similarly with surfer tensorflow we're

2362
00:48:47,370 --> 00:48:47,380
similarly with surfer tensorflow we're
 

2363
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:48,600
similarly with surfer tensorflow we're
taking that approach can you do

2364
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:48,610
taking that approach can you do
 

2365
00:48:48,610 --> 00:48:50,880
taking that approach can you do
something roundup right so some of those

2366
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:50,890
something roundup right so some of those
 

2367
00:48:50,890 --> 00:48:52,650
something roundup right so some of those
ideas seem like okay that's the right

2368
00:48:52,650 --> 00:48:52,660
ideas seem like okay that's the right
 

2369
00:48:52,660 --> 00:48:55,860

direction in five years we expect to see

2370
00:48:55,860 --> 00:48:55,870
direction in five years we expect to see
 

2371
00:48:55,870 --> 00:48:59,070
direction in five years we expect to see
more in that area other things we don't

2372
00:48:59,070 --> 00:48:59,080
more in that area other things we don't
 

2373
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:01,890
more in that area other things we don't
know is will hardware accelerators be

2374
00:49:01,890 --> 00:49:01,900
know is will hardware accelerators be
 

2375
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:05,240
know is will hardware accelerators be
the same will we be able to train with

2376
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:05,250
the same will we be able to train with
 

2377
00:49:05,250 --> 00:49:09,720
the same will we be able to train with
four bits instead of 32 bits and I think

2378
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:09,730
four bits instead of 32 bits and I think
 

2379
00:49:09,730 --> 00:49:11,490
four bits instead of 32 bits and I think
the TPU side of things is exploring that

2380
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:11,500
the TPU side of things is exploring that
 

2381
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:14,070
the TPU side of things is exploring that
I mean GPUs already on version three it

2382
00:49:14,070 --> 00:49:14,080
I mean GPUs already on version three it
 

2383
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:16,620
I mean GPUs already on version three it
seems that the evolution of TPU and

2384
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:16,630
seems that the evolution of TPU and
 

2385
00:49:16,630 --> 00:49:20,280
seems that the evolution of TPU and
tensorflow are sort of their Co evolving

2386
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:20,290

what do you think for beginners is the

2402
00:49:38,370 --> 00:49:38,380
what do you think for beginners is the
 

2403
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:40,110
what do you think for beginners is the
biggest thing they struggle with have

00:49:40,110 --> 00:49:40,120
biggest thing they struggle with have
 

2405
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:42,870
biggest thing they struggle with have
you encountered that or is basically

2406
00:49:42,870 --> 00:49:42,880
you encountered that or is basically
 

2407
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:46,380
you encountered that or is basically
what Karis is solving is that eager like

00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:49,270
we talked about yeah for for some of
 

2411
00:49:49,270 --> 00:49:50,820
we talked about yeah for for some of
them like you said right

2412
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:50,830
them like you said right

beginners want to just be able to take

2414
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:52,930
beginners want to just be able to take
 

2415
00:49:52,930 --> 00:49:55,650
beginners want to just be able to take
some image model they don't care if it's

2416
00:49:55,650 --> 00:49:55,660
some image model they don't care if it's
 

2417
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:57,720
some image model they don't care if it's
inception the rest net or something else

00:50:05,850 --> 00:50:05,860
to make that easy is important so I in
 

2425
00:50:05,860 --> 00:50:08,190
to make that easy is important so I in
some ways if you do that by providing

2426
00:50:08,190 --> 00:50:08,200
some ways if you do that by providing
 

2427
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:10,860
some ways if you do that by providing
them simple models would say in hub or

2428
00:50:10,860 --> 00:50:10,870
them simple models would say in hub or
 

2429
00:50:10,870 --> 00:50:12,360
them simple models would say in hub or
so on and they don't care about what's

2430
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:12,370
so on and they don't care about what's
 

2431
00:50:12,370 --> 00:50:14,490
so on and they don't care about what's
inside that box but they want to be able

2432
00:50:14,490 --> 00:50:14,500
inside that box but they want to be able
 

2433
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:16,950
inside that box but they want to be able
to use it so we are pushing on I think

2434
00:50:16,950 --> 00:50:16,960
to use it so we are pushing on I think
 

2435
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:18,870
to use it so we are pushing on I think
different levels if you look at just a

2436
00:50:18,870 --> 00:50:18,880
different levels if you look at just a
 

2437
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:20,400
different levels if you look at just a
component that you get which has the

2438
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:20,410
component that you get which has the
 

2439
00:50:20,410 --> 00:50:23,610
component that you get which has the
layers already smushed in the beginners

2440
00:50:23,610 --> 00:50:23,620
layers already smushed in the beginners
 

2441
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:26,070
layers already smushed in the beginners
probably just want that then the next

2442
00:50:26,070 --> 00:50:26,080
probably just want that then the next
 

2443
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:27,570
probably just want that then the next
step is okay look at building layers

2444
00:50:27,570 --> 00:50:27,580
step is okay look at building layers
 

2445
00:50:27,580 --> 00:50:30,060
step is okay look at building layers
with players if you go out to research

2446
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:30,070
with players if you go out to research
 

2447
00:50:30,070 --> 00:50:31,830
with players if you go out to research
then they are probably writing custom

2448
00:50:31,830 --> 00:50:31,840
then they are probably writing custom
 

2449
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:33,270
then they are probably writing custom
layers themselves

2450
00:50:33,270 --> 00:50:33,280
layers themselves
 

2451
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,160
layers themselves
they don't live so there's a whole

2452
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:35,170
they don't live so there's a whole
 

2453
00:50:35,170 --> 00:50:37,050
they don't live so there's a whole
spectrum there and then providing the

2454
00:50:37,050 --> 00:50:37,060
spectrum there and then providing the
 

2455
00:50:37,060 --> 00:50:39,780
spectrum there and then providing the
pre-trained models seems to really

2456
00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:39,790
pre-trained models seems to really
 

2457
00:50:39,790 --> 00:50:44,190
pre-trained models seems to really
decrease the time from are you trying to

2458
00:50:44,190 --> 00:50:44,200
decrease the time from are you trying to
 

2459
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:46,290
decrease the time from are you trying to
start so you could basically in a collab

2460
00:50:46,290 --> 00:50:46,300
start so you could basically in a collab
 

2461
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:48,540
start so you could basically in a collab
notebook achieve what you need

2462
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:48,550
notebook achieve what you need
 

2463
00:50:48,550 --> 00:50:51,240
notebook achieve what you need
so basically answering my own question

2464
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:51,250
so basically answering my own question
 

2465
00:50:51,250 --> 00:50:52,260
so basically answering my own question
because I think what tensorflow

2466
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:52,270
because I think what tensorflow
 

2467
00:50:52,270 --> 00:50:56,130
because I think what tensorflow
delivered on recently is this trivial

2468
00:50:56,130 --> 00:50:56,140
delivered on recently is this trivial
 

2469
00:50:56,140 --> 00:50:58,590
delivered on recently is this trivial
for beginners so I was just wondering if

2470
00:50:58,590 --> 00:50:58,600
for beginners so I was just wondering if
 

2471
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:01,200
for beginners so I was just wondering if
there was other pain points you tried to

2472
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:01,210
there was other pain points you tried to
 

2473
00:51:01,210 --> 00:51:02,610
there was other pain points you tried to
ease but I'm not sure there would know

2474
00:51:02,610 --> 00:51:02,620
ease but I'm not sure there would know
 

2475
00:51:02,620 --> 00:51:04,170
ease but I'm not sure there would know
that those are probably the big ones

2476
00:51:04,170 --> 00:51:04,180
that those are probably the big ones
 

2477
00:51:04,180 --> 00:51:06,240
that those are probably the big ones
every night I see high schoolers doing a

2478
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:06,250
every night I see high schoolers doing a
 

2479
00:51:06,250 --> 00:51:08,010
every night I see high schoolers doing a
whole bunch of things now it's pretty

2480
00:51:08,010 --> 00:51:08,020
whole bunch of things now it's pretty
 

2481
00:51:08,020 --> 00:51:10,110
whole bunch of things now it's pretty
amazing it's it's both amazing and

2482
00:51:10,110 --> 00:51:10,120
amazing it's it's both amazing and
 

2483
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:14,070
amazing it's it's both amazing and
terrifying yes in a sense that when they

2484
00:51:14,070 --> 00:51:14,080
terrifying yes in a sense that when they
 

2485
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:18,030
terrifying yes in a sense that when they
grow up it's some incredible ideas will

2486
00:51:18,030 --> 00:51:18,040
grow up it's some incredible ideas will
 

2487
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:19,920
grow up it's some incredible ideas will
be coming from them so there's certainly

2488
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:19,930
be coming from them so there's certainly
 

2489
00:51:19,930 --> 00:51:22,560
be coming from them so there's certainly
a technical aspect to your work but you

2490
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:22,570
a technical aspect to your work but you
 

2491
00:51:22,570 --> 00:51:24,780
a technical aspect to your work but you
also have a management aspect to your

2492
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:24,790
also have a management aspect to your
 

2493
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:27,500
also have a management aspect to your
role with tensorflow leading the project

2494
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:27,510
role with tensorflow leading the project
 

2495

2536
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:25,990
but there's you know often the way I see
 

2537
00:52:25,990 --> 00:52:27,930
but there's you know often the way I see
it as the product of what the team

2538
00:52:27,930 --> 00:52:27,940
it as the product of what the team
 

2539
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:30,360
it as the product of what the team
generates is very larger than the whole

2540
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:30,370
generates is very larger than the whole
 

2541
00:52:30,370 --> 00:52:33,540
generates is very larger than the whole
or you know the individual put together

2542
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:33,550
or you know the individual put together
 

2543
00:52:33,550 --> 00:52:36,840
or you know the individual put together
and so how do we have all of them work

2544
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:36,850
and so how do we have all of them work
 

2545
00:52:36,850 --> 00:52:39,350
and so how do we have all of them work
together the culture of the team itself

2546
00:52:39,350 --> 00:52:39,360
together the culture of the team itself

smart people and throw them together and
 

2555
00:52:48,220 --> 00:52:51,390
smart people and throw them together and
let them do things it's also people have

2556

let them do things it's also people have
 

2557
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:52,680
let them do things it's also people have
to care about what they're building

2558
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:52,690
to care about what they're building

people have to be motivated for the
 

2561
00:52:55,060 --> 00:52:58,410
people have to be motivated for the
right kind of things that's often an

right kind of things that's often an
 

2563
00:52:58,420 --> 00:53:03,330
right kind of things that's often an
important factor and you know finally

2564
00:53:03,330 --> 00:53:03,340
important factor and you know finally
 

2565
00:53:03,340 --> 00:53:05,880
important factor and you know finally
how do you put that together with a

2566
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:05,890
how do you put that together with a
 

2567
00:53:05,890 --> 00:53:08,430
how do you put that together with a
somewhat unified vision of where we want

2568
00:53:08,430 --> 00:53:08,440
somewhat unified vision of where we want
 

2569
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:10,380
somewhat unified vision of where we want
to go so are we all looking in the same

2570
00:53:10,380 --> 00:53:10,390
to go so are we all looking in the same
 

2571
00:53:10,390 --> 00:53:13,920
to go so are we all looking in the same
direction or what's going on over and

2572
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:13,930
direction or what's going on over and
 

2573
00:53:13,930 --> 00:53:17,630
direction or what's going on over and
sometimes it's a mix Google's a very

2574
00:53:17,630 --> 00:53:17,640
sometimes it's a mix Google's a very
 

2575
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:20,510
sometimes it's a mix Google's a very
bottom-up organization in some sense

2576
00:53:20,510 --> 00:53:20,520
bottom-up organization in some sense
 

2577
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:25,020
bottom-up organization in some sense
also research even more so and that's

2578
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:25,030
also research even more so and that's
 

2579
00:53:25,030 --> 00:53:28,560
also research even more so and that's
how we started but as we've become this

2580
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:28,570
how we started but as we've become this
 

2581
00:53:28,570 --> 00:53:31,140
how we started but as we've become this
larger product and ecosystem I think

2582
00:53:31,140 --> 00:53:31,150
larger product and ecosystem I think
 

2583
00:53:31,150 --> 00:53:33,000
larger product and ecosystem I think
it's also important to combine that well

2584
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:33,010
it's also important to combine that well
 

2585
00:53:33,010 --> 00:53:36,930
it's also important to combine that well
with mix if ok here's the direction you

2586
00:53:36,930 --> 00:53:36,940
with mix if ok here's the direction you
 

2587
00:53:36,940 --> 00:53:39,090
with mix if ok here's the direction you
want to go in there is exploration we'll

2588
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:39,100
want to go in there is exploration we'll
 

2589
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:42,000
want to go in there is exploration we'll
do around that but let's keep staying in

2590
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:42,010
do around that but let's keep staying in
 

2591
00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:43,680
do around that but let's keep staying in
that direction not just all over the

2592
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:43,690
that direction not just all over the
 

2593
00:53:43,690 --> 00:53:45,900
that direction not just all over the
place and is there a way you monitor the

2594
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:45,910
place and is there a way you monitor the
 

2595
00:53:45,910 --> 00:53:49,740
place and is there a way you monitor the
health of the team sort of like is is

culture and that's Google in general to
 

2649
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:54,520
culture and that's Google in general to
a large extent but also like you said

2650
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:54,530
a large extent but also like you said
 

2651
00:54:54,530 --> 00:54:57,190
a large extent but also like you said
given that the project has had so many

2652
00:54:57,190 --> 00:54:57,200
given that the project has had so many
 

2653
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:59,590
given that the project has had so many
exciting things to do there's been room

2654
00:54:59,590 --> 00:54:59,600
exciting things to do there's been room
 

2655
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:01,660
exciting things to do there's been room
for lots of people to do different kinds

2656
00:55:01,660 --> 00:55:01,670
for lots of people to do different kinds
 

2657
00:55:01,670 --> 00:55:03,550
for lots of people to do different kinds
of things and grow which which does make

2658
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:03,560
of things and grow which which does make
 

2659
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:05,340
of things and grow which which does make
the problem a bit easier I guess yeah

2660
00:55:05,340 --> 00:55:05,350
the problem a bit easier I guess yeah
 

2661
00:55:05,350 --> 00:55:08,770
the problem a bit easier I guess yeah
and it allows people depending on what

2662
00:55:08,770 --> 00:55:08,780
and it allows people depending on what
 

2663
00:55:08,780 --> 00:55:10,870
and it allows people depending on what
they're doing if there's room around

2664
00:55:10,870 --> 00:55:10,880
they're doing if there's room around
 

2665
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:14,350
they're doing if there's room around
them and that's fine but yes we do it we

2666
00:55:14,350 --> 00:55:14,360
them and that's fine but yes we do it we
 

2667

them and that's fine but yes we do it we
do care about whether superstar an art

that they need to work well with the

2670
00:55:21,250 --> 00:55:21,260
that they need to work well with the
 

2671
00:55:21,260 --> 00:55:23,380
that they need to work well with the
team across Google that's interesting to

2672
00:55:23,380 --> 00:55:23,390
team across Google that's interesting to
 

2673
00:55:23,390 --> 00:55:26,530
team across Google that's interesting to
hear so it's like superstar not the

2674
00:55:26,530 --> 00:55:26,540
hear so it's like superstar not the
 

2675
00:55:26,540 --> 00:55:29,680
hear so it's like superstar not the
productivity broadly is about the team

2676
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:29,690
productivity broadly is about the team
 

2677
00:55:29,690 --> 00:55:32,320
productivity broadly is about the team
yeah yeah yeah I mean they might add a

2678
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:32,330
yeah yeah yeah I mean they might add a
 

2679
00:55:32,330 --> 00:55:34,030
yeah yeah yeah I mean they might add a
lot of value but if they're putting the

2680
00:55:34,030 --> 00:55:34,040
lot of value but if they're putting the
 

2681
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:36,520
lot of value but if they're putting the
team then that's a problem so in hiring

2682
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:36,530
team then that's a problem so in hiring
 

2683
00:55:36,530 --> 00:55:38,830
team then that's a problem so in hiring
engineers it's so interesting right the

2684
00:55:38,830 --> 00:55:38,840
engineers it's so interesting right the
 

2685
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:41,920
engineers it's so interesting right the
hiring process what do you look for how

2686
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:41,930
hiring process what do you look for how
 

2687
00:55:41,930 --> 00:55:44,440
hiring process what do you look for how
do you determine a good developer or a

2688
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:44,450
do you determine a good developer or a
 

2689
00:55:44,450 --> 00:55:46,840
do you determine a good developer or a
good member of her team from just a few

2690
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:46,850
good member of her team from just a few
 

2691
00:55:46,850 --> 00:55:51,070
good member of her team from just a few
minutes or hours together again no magic

2692
00:55:51,070 --> 00:55:51,080
minutes or hours together again no magic
 

2693
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:53,020
minutes or hours together again no magic
answers I'm sure yeah yeah I mean Google

2694
00:55:53,020 --> 00:55:53,030
answers I'm sure yeah yeah I mean Google
 

2695
00:55:53,030 --> 00:55:56,020
answers I'm sure yeah yeah I mean Google
has a hiding process that we've refined

2696
00:55:56,020 --> 00:55:56,030
has a hiding process that we've refined
 

2697
00:55:56,030 --> 00:55:59,250
has a hiding process that we've refined
over the last 20 years I guess and that

2698
00:55:59,250 --> 00:55:59,260
over the last 20 years I guess and that
 

2699
00:55:59,260 --> 00:56:01,540
over the last 20 years I guess and that
you've probably heard and seen a lot

2700
00:56:01,540 --> 00:56:01,550
you've probably heard and seen a lot
 

2701
00:56:01,550 --> 00:56:04,450
you've probably heard and seen a lot
about so we do work with the same hiring

2702
00:56:04,450 --> 00:56:04,460
about so we do work with the same hiring
 

2703
00:56:04,460 --> 00:56:07,860
about so we do work with the same hiring
process and that that's really helped

2704
00:56:07,860 --> 00:56:07,870
process and that that's really helped
 

2705
00:56:07,870 --> 00:56:10,890
process and that that's really helped
for a mean particular I would say in

2706
00:56:10,890 --> 00:56:10,900
for a mean particular I would say in
 

2707
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:13,110
for a mean particular I would say in
addition to the the core technical

2708
00:56:13,110 --> 00:56:13,120
addition to the the core technical
 

2709
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:16,440
addition to the the core technical
skills what does matter is their

2710
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:16,450
skills what does matter is their
 

2711
00:56:16,450 --> 00:56:18,860
skills what does matter is their
motivation in what they want to do

2712
00:56:18,860 --> 00:56:18,870
motivation in what they want to do
 

2713
00:56:18,870 --> 00:56:21,270
motivation in what they want to do
because if that doesn't align well with

2714
00:56:21,270 --> 00:56:21,280
because if that doesn't align well with
 

2715
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:23,910
because if that doesn't align well with
their you want to go that's not going to

2716
00:56:23,910 --> 00:56:23,920
their you want to go that's not going to
 

2717
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:25,530
their you want to go that's not going to
lead to long-term success for either

2718
00:56:25,530 --> 00:56:25,540
lead to long-term success for either
 

2719
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:28,140
lead to long-term success for either
with them or the team and I think that

2720
00:56:28,140 --> 00:56:28,150
with them or the team and I think that
 

2721
00:56:28,150 --> 00:56:30,600
with them or the team and I think that
becomes more important the more senior

2722
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:30,610
becomes more important the more senior
 

2723
00:56:30,610 --> 00:56:32,610
becomes more important the more senior
the person is but it's important at

2724
00:56:32,610 --> 00:56:32,620
the person is but it's important at
 

2725
00:56:32,620 --> 00:56:34,500
the person is but it's important at
every level like even the junior most

2726
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:34,510
every level like even the junior most
 

2727
00:56:34,510 --> 00:56:36,150
every level like even the junior most
engineer if they're not motivated to do

2728
00:56:36,150 --> 00:56:36,160
engineer if they're not motivated to do
 

2729
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:37,230
engineer if they're not motivated to do
well at what they're trying to do

2730
00:56:37,230 --> 00:56:37,240
well at what they're trying to do
 

2731
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:39,210
well at what they're trying to do
however smart they are it's going to be

2732
00:56:39,210 --> 00:56:39,220
however smart they are it's going to be
 

2733
00:56:39,220 --> 00:56:40,650
however smart they are it's going to be
hard for them to succeed there's the

2734
00:56:40,650 --> 00:56:40,660
hard for them to succeed there's the
 

2735
00:56:40,660 --> 00:56:43,740
hard for them to succeed there's the
Google hiring process touch on that

2736
00:56:43,740 --> 00:56:43,750
Google hiring process touch on that
 

2737
00:56:43,750 --> 00:56:46,350
Google hiring process touch on that
passion so like trying to determine

00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:48,420
passion so like trying to determine
because I think as far as I understand

2740
00:56:48,420 --> 00:56:48,430
because I think as far as I understand
 

2741
00:56:48,430 --> 00:56:49,920
because I think as far as I understand
maybe you can speak to it that the

00:56:57,870 --> 00:56:57,880
set there is your puzzle solving ability
 

2749
00:56:57,880 --> 00:57:00,360

anything really doesn't really matter
it's just some cool stuff I'm going to

00:57:11,850 --> 00:57:11,860
it's just some cool stuff I'm going to
 

2761
00:57:11,860 --> 00:57:15,600
it's just some cool stuff I'm going to
do it that I don't know is that

2762
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:15,610
do it that I don't know is that
 

2763
00:57:15,610 --> 00:57:17,130
do it that I don't know is that
something that ultimately ends up and

00:57:17,130 --> 00:57:17,140
something that ultimately ends up and

or once it gets closer to the sales so
 

2769
00:57:22,780 --> 00:57:24,600
or once it gets closer to the sales so
one of the things we do have as part of

2770
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:24,610
one of the things we do have as part of
 

2771
00:57:24,610 --> 00:57:27,330
one of the things we do have as part of
the process is just a culture fit like

2772
00:57:27,330 --> 00:57:27,340
the process is just a culture fit like
 

2773
00:57:27,340 --> 00:57:29,220
the process is just a culture fit like
part of the interview process itself in

2774
00:57:29,220 --> 00:57:29,230
part of the interview process itself in
 

2775
00:57:29,230 --> 00:57:31,080
part of the interview process itself in
addition to just the technical skills in

2776
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:31,090
addition to just the technical skills in
 

2777
00:57:31,090 --> 00:57:33,450
addition to just the technical skills in
each engineer or whoever the interviewer

2778
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:33,460
each engineer or whoever the interviewer
 

2779
00:57:33,460 --> 00:57:37,800
each engineer or whoever the interviewer
is is supposed to rate the person on the

2780
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:37,810
is is supposed to rate the person on the
 

2781
00:57:37,810 --> 00:57:39,450
is is supposed to rate the person on the
culture and the culture fit with Google

2782
00:57:39,450 --> 00:57:39,460
culture and the culture fit with Google
 

2783
00:57:39,460 --> 00:57:41,160
culture and the culture fit with Google
and so on so that is definitely part of

2784
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:41,170
and so on so that is definitely part of
 

2785
00:57:41,170 --> 00:57:45,000
and so on so that is definitely part of
the process now there are various kinds

2786
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:45,010
the process now there are various kinds
 

2787
00:57:45,010 --> 00:57:46,560
the process now there are various kinds
of projects and different kinds of

2788
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:46,570
of projects and different kinds of
 

2789
00:57:46,570 --> 00:57:49,080
of projects and different kinds of
things so there might be variants and if

2790
00:57:49,080 --> 00:57:49,090
things so there might be variants and if
 

2791
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:50,940
things so there might be variants and if
the kind of culture you want there and

00:57:50,940 --> 00:57:50,950
the kind of culture you want there and
 

2793
00:57:50,950 --> 00:57:53,040
the kind of culture you want there and
so on and yes that does vary so for

2794
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:53,050
so on and yes that does vary so for
 

2795
00:57:53,050 --> 00:57:55,110
so on and yes that does vary so for
example tensorflow has always been a

2796
00:57:55,110 --> 00:57:55,120
example tensorflow has always been a
 

2797
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:57,630
example tensorflow has always been a
fast-moving project and we want people

2798
00:57:57,630 --> 00:57:57,640
fast-moving project and we want people
 

2799
00:57:57,640 --> 00:58:01,230
fast-moving project and we want people
who are comfortable with that but at the

2800
00:58:01,230 --> 00:58:01,240
who are comfortable with that but at the
 

2801
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:02,970
who are comfortable with that but at the
same time now for example we are at a

2802
00:58:02,970 --> 00:58:02,980
same time now for example we are at a
 

2803
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:04,080
same time now for example we are at a
place where we are also very

2804
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:04,090
place where we are also very
 

2805
00:58:04,090 --> 00:58:05,790
place where we are also very
full-fledged product and we want to make

2806
00:58:05,790 --> 00:58:05,800
full-fledged product and we want to make
 

2807
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:08,610
full-fledged product and we want to make
sure things that work really really work

2808
00:58:08,610 --> 00:58:08,620
sure things that work really really work
 

2809
00:58:08,620 --> 00:58:11,010
sure things that work really really work
right you can't cut corners all the time

2810
00:58:11,010 --> 00:58:11,020
right you can't cut corners all the time
 

2811
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:13,860
right you can't cut corners all the time
so that balancing that out in finding

2812
00:58:13,860 --> 00:58:13,870
so that balancing that out in finding
 

2813
00:58:13,870 --> 00:58:15,870
so that balancing that out in finding
the people who are the right fits for

2814
00:58:15,870 --> 00:58:15,880
the people who are the right fits for
 

2815
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:18,000
the people who are the right fits for
fit for those is important in anything

2816
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:18,010
fit for those is important in anything
 

2817
00:58:18,010 --> 00:58:19,650
fit for those is important in anything
those kind of things do vary a bit

2818
00:58:19,650 --> 00:58:19,660
those kind of things do vary a bit
 

2819
00:58:19,660 --> 00:58:21,520
those kind of things do vary a bit
across projects and teams and

2820
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:21,530
across projects and teams and
 

2821
00:58:21,530 --> 00:58:23,440
across projects and teams and
product areas across Google and so

2822
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:23,450
product areas across Google and so
 

2823
00:58:23,450 --> 00:58:25,420
product areas across Google and so
you'll see some differences there in the

2824
00:58:25,420 --> 00:58:25,430
you'll see some differences there in the
 

2825
00:58:25,430 --> 00:58:28,510
you'll see some differences there in the
final checklist but a lot of the core

2826
00:58:28,510 --> 00:58:28,520
final checklist but a lot of the core
 

2827
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:31,120
final checklist but a lot of the core
culture it comes along with just the

2828
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:31,130
culture it comes along with just the
 

2829
00:58:31,130 --> 00:58:34,170
culture it comes along with just the
engineering excellence and so on

2830
00:58:34,170 --> 00:58:34,180
engineering excellence and so on
 

2831
00:58:34,180 --> 00:58:38,960
engineering excellence and so on
what is the hardest part of your job I

2832
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:38,970
what is the hardest part of your job I
 

2833
00:58:38,970 --> 00:58:43,140
what is the hardest part of your job I
think you pick I guess it's it's fun I

2834
00:58:43,140 --> 00:58:43,150
think you pick I guess it's it's fun I
 

2835
00:58:43,150 --> 00:58:46,079
think you pick I guess it's it's fun I
would say right hard yes I mean lots of

2836
00:58:46,079 --> 00:58:46,089
would say right hard yes I mean lots of
 

2837
00:58:46,089 --> 00:58:47,489
would say right hard yes I mean lots of
things at different times I think that

2838
00:58:47,489 --> 00:58:47,499
things at different times I think that
 

2839
00:58:47,499 --> 00:58:49,940
things at different times I think that
that does vary so let me clarify that

2840
00:58:49,940 --> 00:58:49,950
that does vary so let me clarify that
 

2841
00:58:49,950 --> 00:58:52,920
that does vary so let me clarify that
difficult things are fun yeah when you

2842
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:52,930
difficult things are fun yeah when you
 

2843
00:58:52,930 --> 00:58:56,670
difficult things are fun yeah when you
solve them right yes it's fun in that in

2844
00:58:56,670 --> 00:58:56,680
solve them right yes it's fun in that in
 

2845
00:58:56,680 --> 00:58:59,970
solve them right yes it's fun in that in
that sense I I think the key to a

2846
00:58:59,970 --> 00:58:59,980
that sense I I think the key to a
 

2847
00:58:59,980 --> 00:59:02,579
that sense I I think the key to a
successful thing across the board and

2848
00:59:02,579 --> 00:59:02,589
successful thing across the board and
 

2849
00:59:02,589 --> 00:59:04,470
successful thing across the board and
you know in this case it's a large

2850
00:59:04,470 --> 00:59:04,480
you know in this case it's a large
 

2851
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:06,299
you know in this case it's a large
ecosystem now but even a small product

2852
00:59:06,299 --> 00:59:06,309
ecosystem now but even a small product
 

2853
00:59:06,309 --> 00:59:10,170
ecosystem now but even a small product
is striking that fine balance across

2854
00:59:10,170 --> 00:59:10,180
is striking that fine balance across
 

2855
00:59:10,180 --> 00:59:12,089
is striking that fine balance across
different aspects of it

2856
00:59:12,089 --> 00:59:12,099
different aspects of it
 

2857
00:59:12,099 --> 00:59:13,650
different aspects of it
sometimes that's how fast do you go

2858
00:59:13,650 --> 00:59:13,660
sometimes that's how fast do you go
 

2859
00:59:13,660 --> 00:59:17,849
sometimes that's how fast do you go
versus how perfect it is sometimes it's

2860
00:59:17,849 --> 00:59:17,859
versus how perfect it is sometimes it's
 

2861
00:59:17,859 --> 00:59:21,089
versus how perfect it is sometimes it's
how do you involve this huge community

2862
00:59:21,089 --> 00:59:21,099
how do you involve this huge community
 

2863
00:59:21,099 --> 00:59:23,759
how do you involve this huge community
who do you involve where you reside okay

2864
00:59:23,759 --> 00:59:23,769
who do you involve where you reside okay
 

2865
00:59:23,769 --> 00:59:25,410
who do you involve where you reside okay
now is not a good time to involve them

2866
00:59:25,410 --> 00:59:25,420
now is not a good time to involve them
 

2867
00:59:25,420 --> 00:59:30,599
now is not a good time to involve them
because it's not the right fit sometimes

2868
00:59:30,599 --> 00:59:30,609
because it's not the right fit sometimes
 

2869
00:59:30,609 --> 00:59:32,609
because it's not the right fit sometimes
it's saying no to certain kinds of

2870
00:59:32,609 --> 00:59:32,619
it's saying no to certain kinds of
 

2871
00:59:32,619 --> 00:59:34,559
it's saying no to certain kinds of
things those are often they're hard

2872
00:59:34,559 --> 00:59:34,569
things those are often they're hard
 

2873
00:59:34,569 --> 00:59:39,479
things those are often they're hard
decisions some of them you make quickly

2874
00:59:39,479 --> 00:59:39,489
decisions some of them you make quickly
 

2875
00:59:39,489 --> 00:59:41,190
decisions some of them you make quickly
because you don't have the time some of

2876
00:59:41,190 --> 00:59:41,200
because you don't have the time some of
 

2877
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:42,870
because you don't have the time some of
them you get time to think about them

2878
00:59:42,870 --> 00:59:42,880
them you get time to think about them
 

2879
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:45,569
them you get time to think about them
but they're always hard so on both both

2880
00:59:45,569 --> 00:59:45,579
but they're always hard so on both both
 

2881
00:59:45,579 --> 00:59:48,269
but they're always hard so on both both
choices are pretty good it's that those

2882
00:59:48,269 --> 00:59:48,279
choices are pretty good it's that those
 

2883
00:59:48,279 --> 00:59:51,239
choices are pretty good it's that those
decision what about deadlines this is do

2884
00:59:51,239 --> 00:59:51,249
decision what about deadlines this is do
 

2885
00:59:51,249 --> 00:59:56,989
decision what about deadlines this is do
you find tensorflow to be driven by

2886
00:59:56,989 --> 00:59:56,999
you find tensorflow to be driven by
 

2887
00:59:56,999 --> 00:59:59,130
you find tensorflow to be driven by
deadlines to a degree that a product

2888
00:59:59,130 --> 00:59:59,140
deadlines to a degree that a product
 

2889
00:59:59,140 --> 01:00:02,309
deadlines to a degree that a product
might or is there still a balance to

2890
01:00:02,309 --> 01:00:02,319
might or is there still a balance to
 

2891
01:00:02,319 --> 01:00:05,130
might or is there still a balance to
where I mean it's less deadline you had

2892
01:00:05,130 --> 01:00:05,140
where I mean it's less deadline you had
 

2893
01:00:05,140 --> 01:00:06,420
where I mean it's less deadline you had
the dev summits

2894
01:00:06,420 --> 01:00:06,430
the dev summits
 

2895
01:00:06,430 --> 01:00:07,849
the dev summits
yeah they came together incredibly

2896
01:00:07,849 --> 01:00:07,859
yeah they came together incredibly
 

2897
01:00:07,859 --> 01:00:09,989
yeah they came together incredibly
didn't look like there's a lot of moving

2898
01:00:09,989 --> 01:00:09,999
didn't look like there's a lot of moving
 

2899
01:00:09,999 --> 01:00:12,390
didn't look like there's a lot of moving
pieces and so on so that did that

2900
01:00:12,390 --> 01:00:12,400
pieces and so on so that did that
 

2901
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:14,519
pieces and so on so that did that
deadline make people rise to the

alpha yeah I'm sure that was done last

2906
01:00:19,349 --> 01:00:19,359
alpha yeah I'm sure that was done last
 

2907
01:00:19,359 --> 01:00:21,539
alpha yeah I'm sure that was done last
minute as well I mean likely there's up

2908
01:00:21,539 --> 01:00:21,549
minute as well I mean likely there's up
 

2909

2911
01:00:24,249 --> 01:00:26,430
to the yes up to the up to the last
point yes again you know it's one of

2912
01:00:26,430 --> 01:00:26,440
point yes again you know it's one of
 

2913
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:29,039
point yes again you know it's one of
those things that's a you need to strike

2914
01:00:29,039 --> 01:00:29,049
those things that's a you need to strike
 

2915
01:00:29,049 --> 01:00:30,839
those things that's a you need to strike
the good balance there's some value that

2916
01:00:30,839 --> 01:00:30,849
the good balance there's some value that
 

2917
01:00:30,849 --> 01:00:33,180
the good balance there's some value that
deadlines spring that does bring a sense

2918
01:00:33,180 --> 01:00:33,190
deadlines spring that does bring a sense
 

2919
01:00:33,190 --> 01:00:35,220
deadlines spring that does bring a sense
of urgency to get the right things

2920
01:00:35,220 --> 01:00:35,230
of urgency to get the right things
 

2921
01:00:35,230 --> 01:00:37,349
of urgency to get the right things
together instead of you know getting the

2922
01:00:37,349 --> 01:00:37,359
together instead of you know getting the
 

2923
01:00:37,359 --> 01:00:39,089
together instead of you know getting the
perfect thing out you need something

2924
01:00:39,089 --> 01:00:39,099
perfect thing out you need something
 

2925
01:00:39,099 --> 01:00:42,029
perfect thing out you need something
that's good and works well and the team

2926
01:00:42,029 --> 01:00:42,039
that's good and works well and the team
 

2927
01:00:42,039 --> 01:00:43,349
that's good and works well and the team
definitely did a great job in putting

2928

definitely did a great job in putting
 

2929
01:00:43,359 --> 01:00:45,359
definitely did a great job in putting
that together so it was very amazed and

2930
01:00:45,359 --> 01:00:45,369
that together so it was very amazed and
 

2931
01:00:45,369 --> 01:00:46,510
that together so it was very amazed and
excited by

2932

excited by
 

2933
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:49,390
excited by
how that came together that said across

2934
01:00:49,390 --> 01:00:49,400
how that came together that said across
 

2935
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:51,340
how that came together that said across

releases at a regular cadence so fine if

2952
01:01:14,110 --> 01:01:14,120
releases at a regular cadence so fine if
 

2953
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:16,150

this month it'll end up in the next
 

2957
01:01:17,420 --> 01:01:19,870
this month it'll end up in the next
release in a month or two and that's

2958
01:01:19,870 --> 01:01:19,880
release in a month or two and that's
 

2959
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:22,810
release in a month or two and that's
okay but we want to get like keep moving

2960
01:01:22,810 --> 01:01:22,820
okay but we want to get like keep moving
 

2961
01:01:22,820 --> 01:01:24,190
okay but we want to get like keep moving
as fast as we can in these different

2962
01:01:24,190 --> 01:01:24,200
as fast as we can in these different
 

2963
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:28,900
as fast as we can in these different
areas because we can iterate and improve

2964
01:01:28,900 --> 01:01:28,910
areas because we can iterate and improve
 

2965
01:01:28,910 --> 01:01:31,420
areas because we can iterate and improve
one things sometimes it's okay to put

2966
01:01:31,420 --> 01:01:31,430
one things sometimes it's okay to put
 

2967
01:01:31,430 --> 01:01:32,980
one things sometimes it's okay to put
things out that aren't fully ready if

2968
01:01:32,980 --> 01:01:32,990
things out that aren't fully ready if
 

2969
01:01:32,990 --> 01:01:34,720
things out that aren't fully ready if
you make sure it's clear that okay this

2970
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:34,730
you make sure it's clear that okay this
 

2971
01:01:34,730 --> 01:01:36,610
you make sure it's clear that okay this
is experimental but it's out there if

2972
01:01:36,610 --> 01:01:36,620
is experimental but it's out there if
 

2973
01:01:36,620 --> 01:01:38,080
is experimental but it's out there if
you want to try and give feedback that's

2974
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:38,090
you want to try and give feedback that's
 

2975
01:01:38,090 --> 01:01:40,120
you want to try and give feedback that's
very very useful I think that quick

2976
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:40,130
very very useful I think that quick
 

2977
01:01:40,130 --> 01:01:42,690
very very useful I think that quick
cycle and quick iteration is important

2978
01:01:42,690 --> 01:01:42,700
cycle and quick iteration is important
 

2979
01:01:42,700 --> 01:01:46,270
cycle and quick iteration is important
that's what we often focus on rather

2980
01:01:46,270 --> 01:01:46,280
that's what we often focus on rather
 

2981
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:48,010
that's what we often focus on rather
than here's a deadline where you get

2982
01:01:48,010 --> 01:01:48,020
than here's a deadline where you get
 

2983
01:01:48,020 --> 01:01:48,640
than here's a deadline where you get
everything else

2984
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:48,650
everything else
 

2985
01:01:48,650 --> 01:01:50,920
everything else
it's to point now is there pressure to

2986
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:50,930
it's to point now is there pressure to
 

2987
01:01:50,930 --> 01:01:54,070
it's to point now is there pressure to
make that stable or like for example

2988
01:01:54,070 --> 01:01:54,080
make that stable or like for example
 

2989

WordPress 5.0 just came out with it and
 

2991
01:01:57,560 --> 01:01:58,930
WordPress 5.0 just came out with it and
there was no pressure

there was no pressure
 

2993
01:01:58,940 --> 01:02:01,570
there was no pressure

- is that it was a lot of build up dates
 

2995

to deliver - way too late but and they
 

2997
01:02:05,150 --> 01:02:06,730

it this do you see Tesla photo 2.0 in

3002
01:02:11,140 --> 01:02:11,150
it this do you see Tesla photo 2.0 in
 

3003
01:02:11,150 --> 01:02:12,760
it this do you see Tesla photo 2.0 in
that same kind of way or is there this

3004
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:12,770
that same kind of way or is there this
 

3005
01:02:12,770 --> 01:02:15,670
that same kind of way or is there this
pressure - once it hits 2.0 once you get

3006
01:02:15,670 --> 01:02:15,680
pressure - once it hits 2.0 once you get
 

3007
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:17,110
pressure - once it hits 2.0 once you get
to the release candidate and then you

3008
01:02:17,110 --> 01:02:17,120
to the release candidate and then you
 

3009
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:19,690
to the release candidate and then you
get to the final that that's gonna be

3010
01:02:19,690 --> 01:02:19,700
get to the final that that's gonna be
 

3011
01:02:19,700 --> 01:02:23,800
get to the final that that's gonna be
the stable thing so it's going to be

3012
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:23,810
the stable thing so it's going to be
 

3013
01:02:23,810 --> 01:02:27,040
the stable thing so it's going to be
stable in just like when not expose ver

3014
01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:27,050
stable in just like when not expose ver
 

3015
01:02:27,050 --> 01:02:29,740
stable in just like when not expose ver
every API that's there it's gonna remain

3016
01:02:29,740 --> 01:02:29,750
every API that's there it's gonna remain
 

3017
01:02:29,750 --> 01:02:33,190

and work it doesn't mean we can't change

3018
01:02:33,190 --> 01:02:33,200
and work it doesn't mean we can't change
 

3019
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:35,260
and work it doesn't mean we can't change
things in under the covers it doesn't

3020
01:02:35,260 --> 01:02:35,270
things in under the covers it doesn't
 

3021
01:02:35,270 --> 01:02:37,360
things in under the covers it doesn't
mean we can't add things so there's

3022
01:02:37,360 --> 01:02:37,370
mean we can't add things so there's
 

3023
01:02:37,370 --> 01:02:39,340
mean we can't add things so there's
still a lot more to for us to do and

3024
01:02:39,340 --> 01:02:39,350
still a lot more to for us to do and
 

3025
01:02:39,350 --> 01:02:41,350
still a lot more to for us to do and
recon did you have more razors so in

3026
01:02:41,350 --> 01:02:41,360
recon did you have more razors so in
 

3027
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:43,240
recon did you have more razors so in
that sense there still I don't think

3028
01:02:43,240 --> 01:02:43,250
that sense there still I don't think
 

3029
01:02:43,250 --> 01:02:44,860
that sense there still I don't think
we'd be done in like two months when we

3030
01:02:44,860 --> 01:02:44,870
we'd be done in like two months when we
 

3031
01:02:44,870 --> 01:02:46,780
we'd be done in like two months when we
released this I don't know if you can

that's a big important piece for us
 

3049
01:03:09,220 --> 01:03:11,410
that's a big important piece for us
tensorflow is already out there we have

3050
01:03:11,410 --> 01:03:11,420
tensorflow is already out there we have
 

3051
01:03:11,420 --> 01:03:13,270
tensorflow is already out there we have
you know 41 million downloads for one

3052
01:03:13,270 --> 01:03:13,280
you know 41 million downloads for one
 

3053
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:15,309
you know 41 million downloads for one
Dalek so it's not like but you have to

3054
01:03:15,309 --> 01:03:15,319
Dalek so it's not like but you have to
 

3055
01:03:15,319 --> 01:03:17,710
Dalek so it's not like but you have to
have it it is yeah yeah exactly so it's

3056
01:03:17,710 --> 01:03:17,720
have it it is yeah yeah exactly so it's
 

3057
01:03:17,720 --> 01:03:19,270
have it it is yeah yeah exactly so it's
not like all a lot of the features that

3058
01:03:19,270 --> 01:03:19,280
not like all a lot of the features that
 

3059
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:21,280
not like all a lot of the features that
we've you know really polishing and

we've you know really polishing and
putting them together out there we don't

3062
01:03:23,890 --> 01:03:23,900
putting them together out there we don't
 

3063
01:03:23,900 --> 01:03:26,530
putting them together out there we don't
have to rush that just because so in

are sort of monetized with things like
 

3261
01:07:39,910 --> 01:07:42,420
are sort of monetized with things like
ads but over the last few years I would

3262
01:07:42,420 --> 01:07:42,430
ads but over the last few years I would
 

3263
01:07:42,430 --> 01:07:43,830
ads but over the last few years I would
say we've definitely seen that

3264
01:07:43,830 --> 01:07:43,840
say we've definitely seen that
 

3265
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:47,310
say we've definitely seen that
transition towards more paid services

3266
01:07:47,310 --> 01:07:47,320
transition towards more paid services
 

3267
01:07:47,320 --> 01:07:49,560
transition towards more paid services
across the web and people are willing to

3268
01:07:49,560 --> 01:07:49,570
across the web and people are willing to
 

3269
01:07:49,570 --> 01:07:51,360
across the web and people are willing to
pay for them because they do see the

3270
01:07:51,360 --> 01:07:51,370
pay for them because they do see the
 

3271
01:07:51,370 --> 01:07:52,680
pay for them because they do see the
value and I mean Netflix is a great

3272
01:07:52,680 --> 01:07:52,690
value and I mean Netflix is a great
 

3273
01:07:52,690 --> 01:07:55,700
value and I mean Netflix is a great
example and we have YouTube doing things

3274
01:07:55,700 --> 01:07:55,710
example and we have YouTube doing things
 

3275
01:07:55,710 --> 01:07:59,190
example and we have YouTube doing things
people pay for the apps they buy more

3276
01:07:59,190 --> 01:07:59,200
people pay for the apps they buy more
 

3277
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:01,370
people pay for the apps they buy more
people I find are willing to pay for

3278
01:08:01,370 --> 01:08:01,380
people I find are willing to pay for
 

3279
01:08:01,380 --> 01:08:04,320
people I find are willing to pay for
newspaper content for the the good news

3280
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:04,330
newspaper content for the the good news
 

3281
01:08:04,330 --> 01:08:07,860
newspaper content for the the good news
websites across the web that wasn't the

3282
01:08:07,860 --> 01:08:07,870
websites across the web that wasn't the
 

3283
01:08:07,870 --> 01:08:09,810
websites across the web that wasn't the
case a few years even a few years ago I

3284
01:08:09,810 --> 01:08:09,820
case a few years even a few years ago I
 

3285
01:08:09,820 --> 01:08:12,300
case a few years even a few years ago I
would say and I just see that change in

3286
01:08:12,300 --> 01:08:12,310
would say and I just see that change in
 

3287
01:08:12,310 --> 01:08:14,400
would say and I just see that change in
myself as well and just lots of people

3288
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:14,410
myself as well and just lots of people
 

3289
01:08:14,410 --> 01:08:16,289
myself as well and just lots of people
around me so definitely hopeful like

3290
01:08:16,289 --> 01:08:16,299
around me so definitely hopeful like
 

3291
01:08:16,299 --> 01:08:19,440
around me so definitely hopeful like
real transition to that mix model where

3292
01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:19,450
real transition to that mix model where
 

3293
01:08:19,450 --> 01:08:22,140
real transition to that mix model where
maybe you get to try something out for

3294
01:08:22,140 --> 01:08:22,150
maybe you get to try something out for
 

3295
01:08:22,150 --> 01:08:22,710
maybe you get to try something out for
free

3296
01:08:22,710 --> 01:08:22,720
free
 

3297
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:25,650
free
maybe with ads but then there's a more

3298
01:08:25,650 --> 01:08:25,660
maybe with ads but then there's a more
 

3299
01:08:25,660 --> 01:08:27,840
maybe with ads but then there's a more
clear revenue model like that sort of

3300
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:27,850
clear revenue model like that sort of
 

3301
01:08:27,850 --> 01:08:29,970
clear revenue model like that sort of
helps go beyond that

3302
01:08:29,970 --> 01:08:29,980
helps go beyond that
 

3303
01:08:29,980 --> 01:08:35,309
helps go beyond that
so speaking of revenue how is it that a

3304
01:08:35,309 --> 01:08:35,319
so speaking of revenue how is it that a
 

3305
01:08:35,319 --> 01:08:37,829
so speaking of revenue how is it that a
person can use the TPU and a Google call

3306
01:08:37,829 --> 01:08:37,839
person can use the TPU and a Google call
 

3307
01:08:37,839 --> 01:08:42,539
person can use the TPU and a Google call
app for free so what's the I guess the

3308
01:08:42,539 --> 01:08:42,549
app for free so what's the I guess the
 

3309
01:08:42,549 --> 01:08:44,960
app for free so what's the I guess the
question is what's the future of

3310
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:44,970
question is what's the future of
 

3311
01:08:44,970 --> 01:08:46,400
question is what's the future of
tensorflow

3312
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:46,410
tensorflow
 

3313
01:08:46,410 --> 01:08:50,190
tensorflow
in terms of empowering say teacher class

3314
01:08:50,190 --> 01:08:50,200
in terms of empowering say teacher class
 

3315
01:08:50,200 --> 01:08:54,530
in terms of empowering say teacher class
of 300 students and they amassed by MIT

3316
01:08:54,530 --> 01:08:54,540
of 300 students and they amassed by MIT
 

3317
01:08:54,540 --> 01:08:57,030
of 300 students and they amassed by MIT
what is going to be the future of that

3318
01:08:57,030 --> 01:08:57,040
what is going to be the future of that
 

3319
01:08:57,040 --> 01:08:57,610
what is going to be the future of that
being

3320
01:08:57,610 --> 01:08:57,620
being
 

3321
01:08:57,620 --> 01:08:59,290
being
able to do their homework intensive flow

3322
01:08:59,290 --> 01:08:59,300
able to do their homework intensive flow
 

3323
01:08:59,300 --> 01:09:01,510
able to do their homework intensive flow
like why are they going to train these

3324
01:09:01,510 --> 01:09:01,520
like why are they going to train these
 

3325
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:03,850
like why are they going to train these
networks right right what's that future

3326
01:09:03,850 --> 01:09:03,860
networks right right what's that future
 

3327
01:09:03,860 --> 01:09:07,120
networks right right what's that future
look like with TP use with cloud

3328
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:07,130
look like with TP use with cloud
 

3329
01:09:07,130 --> 01:09:09,640
look like with TP use with cloud
services and so on I think a number of

3330
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:09,650
services and so on I think a number of
 

3331
01:09:09,650 --> 01:09:12,040
services and so on I think a number of
things that I mean any tensile flow open

3332
01:09:12,040 --> 01:09:12,050
things that I mean any tensile flow open
 

3333
01:09:12,050 --> 01:09:13,930
things that I mean any tensile flow open
source you can run it whatever you can

3334
01:09:13,930 --> 01:09:13,940
source you can run it whatever you can
 

3335
01:09:13,940 --> 01:09:15,790
source you can run it whatever you can
write on your desktop and your desktops

3336
01:09:15,790 --> 01:09:15,800
write on your desktop and your desktops
 

3337
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:17,650
write on your desktop and your desktops
always keep getting more powerful so

3338
01:09:17,650 --> 01:09:17,660
always keep getting more powerful so
 

3339
01:09:17,660 --> 01:09:20,590
always keep getting more powerful so
maybe you can do more my phone is like I

3340
01:09:20,590 --> 01:09:20,600
maybe you can do more my phone is like I
 

3341
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:21,820
maybe you can do more my phone is like I
don't know how many times more powerful

3342
01:09:21,820 --> 01:09:21,830
don't know how many times more powerful
 

3343
01:09:21,830 --> 01:09:24,280
don't know how many times more powerful
than my first desktop probably trained

3344
01:09:24,280 --> 01:09:24,290
than my first desktop probably trained
 

3345
01:09:24,290 --> 01:09:27,130
than my first desktop probably trained
on your phone though yeah right so in

3346
01:09:27,130 --> 01:09:27,140
on your phone though yeah right so in
 

3347
01:09:27,140 --> 01:09:28,600
on your phone though yeah right so in
that sense the power you have in your

3348
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:28,610
that sense the power you have in your
 

3349
01:09:28,610 --> 01:09:32,200
that sense the power you have in your
handles is is a lot more clouds are

3350
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:32,210
handles is is a lot more clouds are
 

3351
01:09:32,210 --> 01:09:34,330
handles is is a lot more clouds are
actually very interesting from say

3352
01:09:34,330 --> 01:09:34,340
actually very interesting from say
 

3353
01:09:34,340 --> 01:09:36,790
actually very interesting from say
students or our courses perspective

3354
01:09:36,790 --> 01:09:36,800
students or our courses perspective
 

3355
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:39,640
students or our courses perspective
because they make it very easy to get

3356
01:09:39,640 --> 01:09:39,650
because they make it very easy to get
 

3357
01:09:39,650 --> 01:09:41,770
because they make it very easy to get
started I mean colab the great thing

3358
01:09:41,770 --> 01:09:41,780
started I mean colab the great thing
 

3359
01:09:41,780 --> 01:09:44,470
started I mean colab the great thing
about is go to a website and it just

3360
01:09:44,470 --> 01:09:44,480
about is go to a website and it just
 

3361
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:47,200
about is go to a website and it just
works no installation needed nothing to

3362
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:47,210
works no installation needed nothing to
 

3363
01:09:47,210 --> 01:09:48,670
works no installation needed nothing to
you know you're just just there and if

3364
01:09:48,670 --> 01:09:48,680
you know you're just just there and if
 

3365
01:09:48,680 --> 01:09:50,500
you know you're just just there and if
things are working that's really the

3366
01:09:50,500 --> 01:09:50,510
things are working that's really the
 

3367
01:09:50,510 --> 01:09:53,350
things are working that's really the
power of cloud as well and so I do

3368
01:09:53,350 --> 01:09:53,360
power of cloud as well and so I do
 

3369
01:09:53,360 --> 01:09:55,570
power of cloud as well and so I do
expect that to grow again

3370
01:09:55,570 --> 01:09:55,580
expect that to grow again
 

3371
01:09:55,580 --> 01:09:57,940
expect that to grow again
