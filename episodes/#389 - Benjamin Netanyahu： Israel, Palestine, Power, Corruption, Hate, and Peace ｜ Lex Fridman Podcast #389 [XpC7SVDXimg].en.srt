00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:00,480
choosing of judges and in the Israeli
 

617
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,350
choosing of judges and in the Israeli
system the judicial activism went so far

618
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:03,360
system the judicial activism went so far
 

619
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,190
system the judicial activism went so far
that effectively the sitting judges have

620
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:07,200
that effectively the sitting judges have
 

621
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,050
that effectively the sitting judges have
an effective veto and and

622
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:11,060
an effective veto and and
 

623
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:14,269
an effective veto and and
choosing judges which means that this is

624
00:13:14,269 --> 00:13:14,279
choosing judges which means that this is
 

625
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:15,769
choosing judges which means that this is
a self-selecting court that just

626
00:13:15,769 --> 00:13:15,779
a self-selecting court that just
 

627
00:13:15,779 --> 00:13:17,690
a self-selecting court that just
perpetrates itself and we want to

628
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:17,700
perpetrates itself and we want to
 

629
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,910
perpetrates itself and we want to
correct that again want to correct it in

630
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:19,920
correct that again want to correct it in
 

631
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,129
correct that again want to correct it in
a balanced way and that's basically what

632
00:13:22,129 --> 00:13:22,139
a balanced way and that's basically what
 

633
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:23,810
a balanced way and that's basically what
we're trying to do so I think there's a

634
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:23,820
we're trying to do so I think there's a
 

635
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,910
we're trying to do so I think there's a
lot of misinformation about that we're

636
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:25,920
lot of misinformation about that we're
 

637
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,490
lot of misinformation about that we're
trying to bring Israeli democracy to

638
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:28,500
trying to bring Israeli democracy to
 

639
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,310

the world and the second thing we have
 

705
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,730
the world and the second thing we have
is a permanent investment in conceptual

706
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:52,740
is a permanent investment in conceptual
 

707
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:54,230
is a permanent investment in conceptual
products because we have a permanent

708

our security services creating uh
 

713
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:03,769
our security services creating uh
basically knowledge workers who then

714
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:03,779
basically knowledge workers who then
 

715
00:15:03,779 --> 00:15:06,889
basically knowledge workers who then
become knowledge entrepreneurs and so we

716
00:15:06,889 --> 00:15:06,899
become knowledge entrepreneurs and so we
 

717
00:15:06,899 --> 00:15:08,569
become knowledge entrepreneurs and so we
create this this structure and that's

718
00:15:08,569 --> 00:15:08,579
create this this structure and that's
 

719
00:15:08,579 --> 00:15:10,310
create this this structure and that's
not going to go away there's been a

720
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:10,320
not going to go away there's been a
 

721
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,470
not going to go away there's been a
decline in investments in the high-tech

722
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:12,480
decline in investments in the high-tech
 

723
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,689
decline in investments in the high-tech
globally I think that's driven by many

724
00:15:14,689 --> 00:15:14,699
globally I think that's driven by many
 

725
00:15:14,699 --> 00:15:16,310
globally I think that's driven by many
factors but the most important one is

726
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:16,320
factors but the most important one is
 

727
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,650
factors but the most important one is
the interest rate which which I think

728
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:18,660
the interest rate which which I think
 

729
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:21,290
the interest rate which which I think
will it'll fluctuate up and down but

730
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:21,300
will it'll fluctuate up and down but
 

731
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,509
will it'll fluctuate up and down but
Israel will remain a very attractive

00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:52,380
here then it'll remain so
 

801
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:54,650
here then it'll remain so
so you had a conversation about AI with

802
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:54,660
so you had a conversation about AI with
 

803
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:57,230
so you had a conversation about AI with
Sam Altman of open Ai and with Elon Musk

804
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:57,240
Sam Altman of open Ai and with Elon Musk
 

805
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:00,350
Sam Altman of open Ai and with Elon Musk
yeah what was the content of that

806
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:00,360
yeah what was the content of that
 

807
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,509
yeah what was the content of that
conversation what's your vision for sort

808
00:17:02,509 --> 00:17:02,519
conversation what's your vision for sort
 

809
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:05,090
conversation what's your vision for sort
of this very highest of

810
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:05,100
of this very highest of
 

811
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:08,809
of this very highest of
Tech uh which is artificial intelligence

812
00:17:08,809 --> 00:17:08,819
Tech uh which is artificial intelligence
 

813
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,490
Tech uh which is artificial intelligence
well first of all I have a high regard

814
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:10,500
well first of all I have a high regard
 

815
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,409
well first of all I have a high regard
for the people I talk to okay

816
00:17:12,409 --> 00:17:12,419
for the people I talk to okay
 

817
00:17:12,419 --> 00:17:14,929
for the people I talk to okay
okay and I I understand that they

818
00:17:14,929 --> 00:17:14,939
okay and I I understand that they
 

819
00:17:14,939 --> 00:17:16,429
okay and I I understand that they
understand things I don't understand and

820
00:17:16,429 --> 00:17:16,439
understand things I don't understand and
 

821
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:17,809
understand things I don't understand and
I don't pretend to understand everything

822
00:17:17,809 --> 00:17:17,819
I don't pretend to understand everything
 

823
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:20,210
I don't pretend to understand everything
but I do understand one thing I

824
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:20,220
but I do understand one thing I
 

825
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,970
but I do understand one thing I
understand that the AI

826
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:22,980
understand that the AI
 

827
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:25,870
understand that the AI
is developing at a geometric rate

828
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:25,880
is developing at a geometric rate
 

829
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:29,750
is developing at a geometric rate
and mostly in in political life and in

830
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:29,760
and mostly in in political life and in
 

831
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,190
and mostly in in political life and in
life in general people don't have an

832
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:31,200
life in general people don't have an
 

833
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,890
life in general people don't have an
intuitive grasp of geometric growth you

834
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:33,900
intuitive grasp of geometric growth you
 

835
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:36,490
intuitive grasp of geometric growth you
understand things basically in linear

836
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:36,500
understand things basically in linear
 

837
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:39,650
understand things basically in linear
increments uh and the idea that you're

838
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:39,660
increments uh and the idea that you're
 

839
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:43,190
increments uh and the idea that you're
coming up a ski slope is very foreign to

840
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:43,200
coming up a ski slope is very foreign to
 

841
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,630
coming up a ski slope is very foreign to
people so I don't understand it and

842
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:44,640
people so I don't understand it and
 

843
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,549
people so I don't understand it and
they're

844
00:17:45,549 --> 00:17:45,559
they're
 

845
00:17:45,559 --> 00:17:48,430
they're
naturally also um

846
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:48,440
naturally also um
 

847
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,990
naturally also um
sort of taken aback by it because what

848
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:51,000
sort of taken aback by it because what
 

849
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,190
sort of taken aback by it because what
do you do okay so I think the the there

850
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:55,200
do you do okay so I think the the there
 

851
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,390
do you do okay so I think the the there
are several conclusions from my

852
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:56,400
are several conclusions from my
 

853
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,610
are several conclusions from my
conversations with the with them and

854
00:17:58,610 --> 00:17:58,620
conversations with the with them and
 

855
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:01,730
conversations with the with them and
from my uh other observations that I've

856
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:01,740
from my uh other observations that I've
 

857
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:03,169
from my uh other observations that I've
been talking about for many years I'm

858
00:18:03,169 --> 00:18:03,179
been talking about for many years I'm
 

859
00:18:03,179 --> 00:18:05,450
been talking about for many years I'm
talking about the need to do this well

860
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:05,460
talking about the need to do this well
 

861
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,850
talking about the need to do this well
the first thing is this

862
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:07,860
the first thing is this
 

863
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:09,950
the first thing is this
there is no possibility of not entering

864
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:09,960
there is no possibility of not entering
 

865
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,289
there is no possibility of not entering
AI with full force

866
00:18:12,289 --> 00:18:12,299
AI with full force
 

867
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:14,570
AI with full force
secondly there is a need for regulation

868
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:14,580
secondly there is a need for regulation
 

869
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:16,669
secondly there is a need for regulation
third it's not clear there will be

870
00:18:16,669 --> 00:18:16,679
third it's not clear there will be
 

871
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:20,330
third it's not clear there will be
Global regulation fourth uh it's not

872
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:20,340
Global regulation fourth uh it's not
 

873
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:22,490
Global regulation fourth uh it's not
clear where it ends up I I certainly

874
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:22,500
clear where it ends up I I certainly
 

875
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,710
clear where it ends up I I certainly
cannot say that now you might say does

876
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:24,720
cannot say that now you might say does
 

877
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,590
cannot say that now you might say does
it come to control us okay that's

878
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:27,600
it come to control us okay that's
 

879
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,049
it come to control us okay that's
question does it come to control us

880
00:18:30,049 --> 00:18:30,059
question does it come to control us
 

881
00:18:30,059 --> 00:18:34,190
question does it come to control us
I don't know the answer to that uh

882
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:34,200
I don't know the answer to that uh
 

883
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:39,289
I don't know the answer to that uh
I think that is uh

884
00:18:39,289 --> 00:18:39,299
I think that is uh
 

885
00:18:39,299 --> 00:18:42,770
I think that is uh
as one uh observation that I had from

886
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:42,780
as one uh observation that I had from
 

887
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:44,270
as one uh observation that I had from
these conversations

888
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:44,280
these conversations
 

889
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,669
these conversations
is if it does come to control us that's

890
00:18:46,669 --> 00:18:46,679
is if it does come to control us that's
 

891
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:48,710
is if it does come to control us that's
probably the only chance of having a

892
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:48,720
probably the only chance of having a
 

893
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,970
probably the only chance of having a
universal regulation because I don't see

894
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:52,980
universal regulation because I don't see
 

895
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:57,230
universal regulation because I don't see
anyone anyone deciding to uh you know to

896
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:57,240
anyone anyone deciding to uh you know to
 

897
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,750
anyone anyone deciding to uh you know to
uh

898
00:18:58,750 --> 00:18:58,760
uh
 

899
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:02,330
uh
avoid the race and cooperate unless you

900
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:02,340
avoid the race and cooperate unless you
 

901
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,370
avoid the race and cooperate unless you
have that threat doesn't mean you can't

902
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:04,380
have that threat doesn't mean you can't
 

903
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:06,710
have that threat doesn't mean you can't
regulate AI within countries even

904
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:06,720
regulate AI within countries even
 

905
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,350
regulate AI within countries even
without that understanding but it does

906
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:09,360
without that understanding but it does
 

907
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,029
without that understanding but it does
mean that there's a limit to regulation

908
00:19:11,029 --> 00:19:11,039
mean that there's a limit to regulation
 

909
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:12,529
mean that there's a limit to regulation
because every country will want to make

910
00:19:12,529 --> 00:19:12,539
because every country will want to make
 

911
00:19:12,539 --> 00:19:14,630
because every country will want to make
sure that it's not uh doesn't give up

912
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:14,640
sure that it's not uh doesn't give up
 

913
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,789
sure that it's not uh doesn't give up
competitive Advantage if there is no

914
00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:16,799
competitive Advantage if there is no
 

915
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:18,490
competitive Advantage if there is no
Universal regulation

916
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:18,500
Universal regulation
 

917
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:21,590
Universal regulation
I think that right now just as you know

918
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:21,600
I think that right now just as you know
 

919
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,510
I think that right now just as you know
10 years ago I read um

920
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:23,520
10 years ago I read um
 

921
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,870
10 years ago I read um
I read a novel I don't read novels but I

922
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:26,880
I read a novel I don't read novels but I
 

923
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,450
I read a novel I don't read novels but I
was forced to read one by a Scientific

924
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:29,460
was forced to read one by a Scientific
 

925
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:32,570
was forced to read one by a Scientific
Advisor I read history I read about

926
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:32,580
Advisor I read history I read about
 

927
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:34,730
Advisor I read history I read about
economics I read about technology I just

928
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:34,740
economics I read about technology I just
 

929
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:38,570
economics I read about technology I just
don't read novels okay and this time uh

930
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:38,580
don't read novels okay and this time uh
 

931
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:40,789
don't read novels okay and this time uh
follow Churchill you know he said fact

932
00:19:40,789 --> 00:19:40,799
follow Churchill you know he said fact
 

933
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:43,070
follow Churchill you know he said fact
is better than Fiction well this fiction

934
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:43,080
is better than Fiction well this fiction
 

935
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:46,190
is better than Fiction well this fiction
would become fact and it was a book it

936
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:46,200
would become fact and it was a book it
 

937
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,770
would become fact and it was a book it
was a novel about

938
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:47,780
was a novel about
 

939
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:51,430
was a novel about
a chinese-american's future cyber war

940
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:51,440
a chinese-american's future cyber war
 

941
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,549
a chinese-american's future cyber war
and I read the book one sitting called

942
00:19:55,549 --> 00:19:55,559
and I read the book one sitting called
 

943
00:19:55,559 --> 00:19:57,409
and I read the book one sitting called
in a team of experts and I said all

944
00:19:57,409 --> 00:19:57,419
in a team of experts and I said all
 

945
00:19:57,419 --> 00:19:59,930
in a team of experts and I said all
right let's uh let's turn Israel into uh

946
00:19:59,930 --> 00:19:59,940
right let's uh let's turn Israel into uh
 

947
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:02,450
right let's uh let's turn Israel into uh
one of the world's five cyber powers and

948
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:02,460
one of the world's five cyber powers and
 

949
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:03,890
one of the world's five cyber powers and
let's do it very quickly and we did

950
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:03,900
let's do it very quickly and we did
 

951
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:06,289
let's do it very quickly and we did
actually we did we did exactly that

952
00:20:06,289 --> 00:20:06,299
actually we did we did exactly that
 

953
00:20:06,299 --> 00:20:08,630
actually we did we did exactly that
uh I think AI

954
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:08,640
uh I think AI
 

955
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,210
uh I think AI
is bigger than that and related to that

956
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:11,220
is bigger than that and related to that
 

957
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:13,909
is bigger than that and related to that
because it'll affect well cyber affects

958
00:20:13,909 --> 00:20:13,919
because it'll affect well cyber affects
 

959
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:16,310
because it'll affect well cyber affects
everything but AI will affect it even

960
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:16,320
everything but AI will affect it even
 

961
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,930
everything but AI will affect it even
more fundamentally and the joining of

962
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:17,940
more fundamentally and the joining of
 

963
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:20,210
more fundamentally and the joining of
the two could be very powerful so I

964
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:20,220
the two could be very powerful so I
 

965
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:22,669
the two could be very powerful so I
think in Israel we have to

966
00:20:22,669 --> 00:20:22,679
think in Israel we have to
 

967
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:24,409
think in Israel we have to
we have to do it anyway for security

968
00:20:24,409 --> 00:20:24,419
we have to do it anyway for security
 

969
00:20:24,419 --> 00:20:27,110
we have to do it anyway for security
reasons when we're doing it but I think

970
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:27,120
reasons when we're doing it but I think
 

971
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,850
reasons when we're doing it but I think
what about

972
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:28,860
what about
 

973
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:31,250
what about
what about our databases that are

974
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:31,260
what about our databases that are
 

975
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:35,210
what about our databases that are
already very robust on on the medical

976
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:35,220
already very robust on on the medical

why don't we stick a genetic database on

980
00:20:40,549 --> 00:20:40,559
why don't we stick a genetic database on
 

981
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:42,409
why don't we stick a genetic database on
that why don't we do other things that

00:20:42,409 --> 00:20:42,419
that why don't we do other things that

that that's one possibility we have it
 

991
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:56,990

in as I said in every single field the

in as I said in every single field the
 

993
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,630
in as I said in every single field the
conclusion is this we have to move on AI

conclusion is this we have to move on AI
 

995
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:02,270
conclusion is this we have to move on AI
we are moving on AI just as we moved on

we are moving on AI just as we moved on

the Industrial Revolution
 

1023
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:37,850
the Industrial Revolution
definitely produce more jobs than they

definitely produce more jobs than they
 

1025
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:42,169
definitely produce more jobs than they
um than they consumed okay that is not

00:21:42,169 --> 00:21:42,179
um than they consumed okay that is not
 

1027
00:21:42,179 --> 00:21:44,270
um than they consumed okay that is not
obvious to me at all

1028
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:44,280
obvious to me at all
 

1029
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,430
obvious to me at all
I mean I could see new jobs creating and

1030
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:46,440
I mean I could see new jobs creating and
 

1031
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,649
I mean I could see new jobs creating and
yes I have that you know that comforting

yes I have that you know that comforting

statement

1034
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:49,860
statement
 

1035
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:51,649
statement
but it's not quite true

1036
00:21:51,649 --> 00:21:51,659
but it's not quite true
 

1037
00:21:51,659 --> 00:21:53,690
but it's not quite true
because I think on balance they'll

1038
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:53,700
because I think on balance they'll
 

1039
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:56,029
because I think on balance they'll
probably consume more jobs many more

1040
00:21:56,029 --> 00:21:56,039
probably consume more jobs many more
 

1041
00:21:56,039 --> 00:21:58,610
probably consume more jobs many more
jobs than they'll create at least in the

jobs than they'll create at least in the
 

1043
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:00,049
jobs than they'll create at least in the
short term

short term
 

1045
00:22:00,059 --> 00:22:01,730

knew that was true okay not only that I
 

1083
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,990
knew that was true okay not only that I
also knew that wealth would spread by

1107
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:10,070
the socioeconomic uh measure but here's
the point I don't know I don't know that

the point I don't know I don't know that
 

1109
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,230
the point I don't know I don't know that
that we will not have

so you'll have the end of scarcity
you'll have enormous productivity

1118
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:20,580
you'll have enormous productivity
 

1119
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:22,490
you'll have enormous productivity
you know very few people are producing

1120
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:22,500
you know very few people are producing
 

1121
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:25,490
you know very few people are producing
enormous added value

1122
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:25,500
enormous added value
 

1123
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,830
enormous added value
you're going to have to tax that to pass

1124
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:27,840
you're going to have to tax that to pass
 

1125
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,590
you're going to have to tax that to pass
it to the others okay you're gonna have

1126
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:30,600
it to the others okay you're gonna have
 

1127
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,090
it to the others okay you're gonna have
to do that that's a political question

1128
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:32,100
to do that that's a political question
 

1129
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,730
to do that that's a political question
I'm not sure how we answer that what if

1130
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:34,740
I'm not sure how we answer that what if
 

1131
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:36,350
I'm not sure how we answer that what if
you tax and somebody else doesn't tax

1132
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:36,360
you tax and somebody else doesn't tax
 

1133
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,669
you tax and somebody else doesn't tax
you're going to get everybody to go

1134
00:23:37,669 --> 00:23:37,679
you're going to get everybody to go
 

1135
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:40,010
you're going to get everybody to go
there that's an issue an international

1136
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:40,020
there that's an issue an international
 

1137
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:41,630
there that's an issue an international
issue that we constantly have to deal

1138
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:41,640
issue that we constantly have to deal
 

1139
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:44,149
issue that we constantly have to deal
with and the second question you have

1140
00:23:44,149 --> 00:23:44,159
with and the second question you have
 

1141
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:46,010
with and the second question you have
is

1142
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:46,020
is
 

1143
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:48,470
is
suppose you solve that problem

1144
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:48,480
suppose you solve that problem
 

1145
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,270
suppose you solve that problem
and you deliver

1146
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:50,280
and you deliver
 

1147
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,850
and you deliver
uh money okay

1148
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:52,860
uh money okay
 

1149
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:58,190
uh money okay
to those who are not involved in the AI

1150
00:23:58,190 --> 00:23:58,200
to those who are not involved in the AI
 

1151
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,270

economy
 

1153
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,010
economy
what do they do

1154
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:01,020
what do they do
 

1155
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:03,350
what do they do
the first question you ask somebody

1156
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:03,360
the first question you ask somebody
 

1157
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,169
the first question you ask somebody
whom you just met after the polite you

1158
00:24:06,169 --> 00:24:06,179
whom you just met after the polite you
 

1159
00:24:06,179 --> 00:24:08,330
whom you just met after the polite you
know the polite exchanges is what do you

1160
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:08,340
know the polite exchanges is what do you
 

1161
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:11,390
know the polite exchanges is what do you
do right well people Define themselves

1162
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:11,400
do right well people Define themselves
 

1163
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,950
do right well people Define themselves
by their profession

1164
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:12,960
by their profession
 

1165
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,470
by their profession
uh and it's going to be difficult if you

1166
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:15,480
uh and it's going to be difficult if you
 

1167
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,930
uh and it's going to be difficult if you
don't have a profession and you know

1168
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:17,940
don't have a profession and you know
 

1169
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:19,190
don't have a profession and you know
people will spend more time

1170
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:19,200
people will spend more time
 

1171
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,149
people will spend more time
self-searching they'll more time and uh

1172
00:24:22,149 --> 00:24:22,159
self-searching they'll more time and uh
 

1173
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:24,529
self-searching they'll more time and uh
in the Arts more time and Leisure I

1174
00:24:24,529 --> 00:24:24,539
in the Arts more time and Leisure I
 

1175
00:24:24,539 --> 00:24:26,930
in the Arts more time and Leisure I
understand that if I have to bet

1176
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:26,940
understand that if I have to bet
 

1177
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:29,930
understand that if I have to bet
it will annihilate many more jobs than

1178
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:29,940
it will annihilate many more jobs than
 

1179
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:32,270
it will annihilate many more jobs than
it will create and it will force a

1180
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:32,280
it will create and it will force a
 

1181
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:35,450
it will create and it will force a
structural change in our economics in

1182
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:35,460
structural change in our economics in
 

1183
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:38,529
structural change in our economics in
our economic models and in our politics

1184
00:24:38,529 --> 00:24:38,539
our economic models and in our politics
 

1185
00:24:38,539 --> 00:24:40,549
our economic models and in our politics
uh and I'm not sure where it's going to

1186
00:24:40,549 --> 00:24:40,559
uh and I'm not sure where it's going to
 

1187
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:41,870
uh and I'm not sure where it's going to
go and that's something we have to

1188
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:41,880
go and that's something we have to
 

1189
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:45,049
go and that's something we have to
respond to at the nation level and just

1190
00:24:45,049 --> 00:24:45,059
respond to at the nation level and just
 

1191
00:24:45,059 --> 00:24:47,270
respond to at the nation level and just
as a human civilization both the threat

1192
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:47,280
as a human civilization both the threat
 

1193
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,250
as a human civilization both the threat
of AI to just

1194
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:49,260
of AI to just
 

1195
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:51,649
of AI to just
us as a human species and then the

1196
00:24:51,649 --> 00:24:51,659
us as a human species and then the
 

1197
00:24:51,659 --> 00:24:54,169
us as a human species and then the
effect on the jobs and like you said

1198
00:24:54,169 --> 00:24:54,179
effect on the jobs and like you said
 

1199
00:24:54,179 --> 00:24:56,570
effect on the jobs and like you said
cyber security and what do you think you

1200
00:24:56,570 --> 00:24:56,580
cyber security and what do you think you
 

1201
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:58,430
cyber security and what do you think you
think you think it's gonna we're gonna

1202
00:24:58,430 --> 00:24:58,440
think you think it's gonna we're gonna
 

1203
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,810
think you think it's gonna we're gonna
lose control

1204
00:24:59,810 --> 00:24:59,820
lose control
 

1205
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:02,690
lose control
no I first of all I do believe maybe

1206
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:02,700
no I first of all I do believe maybe
 

1207
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,549
no I first of all I do believe maybe
naively that it will create more jobs

1208
00:25:04,549 --> 00:25:04,559
naively that it will create more jobs
 

1209
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:06,770
naively that it will create more jobs
than it takes write that down and we'll

1210
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:06,780
than it takes write that down and we'll
 

1211
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:08,750
than it takes write that down and we'll
check it it's on record and you know we

1212
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:08,760
check it it's on record and you know we
 

1213
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,250
check it it's on record and you know we
don't have we don't say we'll check it

1214
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:10,260
don't have we don't say we'll check it
 

1215
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:11,990
don't have we don't say we'll check it
after our lifetime no we'll see it in a

1216
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:12,000
after our lifetime no we'll see it in a
 

1217
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,029
after our lifetime no we'll see it in a
few years we'll see in a few years I'm

1218
00:25:14,029 --> 00:25:14,039
few years we'll see in a few years I'm
 

1219
00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:15,350
few years we'll see in a few years I'm
really concerned about cyber security

1220
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:15,360
really concerned about cyber security
 

1221
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,169
really concerned about cyber security
and the nature of how that changes with

1222
00:25:18,169 --> 00:25:18,179
and the nature of how that changes with
 

1223
00:25:18,179 --> 00:25:20,210
and the nature of how that changes with
the power of AI

1224
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:20,220
the power of AI
 

1225
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:22,970
the power of AI
and in terms of existential threats

1226
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:22,980
and in terms of existential threats
 

1227
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:25,490
and in terms of existential threats
I think there will be so much threats

1228
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:25,500
I think there will be so much threats
 

1229
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,529
I think there will be so much threats
that aren't existential along the way

1230
00:25:27,529 --> 00:25:27,539
that aren't existential along the way
 

1231
00:25:27,539 --> 00:25:29,210
that aren't existential along the way
that that's the thing I'm mostly

1232
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:29,220
that that's the thing I'm mostly
 

1233
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:30,950
that that's the thing I'm mostly
concerned about

1234
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:30,960
concerned about
 

1235
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,070
concerned about
um versus AI taking complete control and

1236
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:34,080
um versus AI taking complete control and
 

1237
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,750
um versus AI taking complete control and
becoming sort of superseding the human

1238
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:35,760
becoming sort of superseding the human
 

1239
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,850
becoming sort of superseding the human
species uh although that is something

1240
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:37,860
species uh although that is something
 

1241
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:40,310
species uh although that is something
you should consider seriously uh because

1242
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:40,320
you should consider seriously uh because
 

1243
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,950
you should consider seriously uh because
of the exponential growth of its

1244
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:42,960
of the exponential growth of its
 

1245
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,870
of the exponential growth of its
capability it's exactly the exponential

1246
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:44,880
capability it's exactly the exponential
 

1247
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,510
capability it's exactly the exponential
growth which we understand

1248
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:46,520
growth which we understand
 

1249
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:50,210
growth which we understand
uh is before us but we don't really it's

1250
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:50,220
uh is before us but we don't really it's
 

1251
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:52,190
uh is before us but we don't really it's
very hard to project forward to really

1252
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:52,200
very hard to project forward to really
 

1253
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,890
very hard to project forward to really
understand that's right exactly right so

1254
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:54,900
understand that's right exactly right so
 

1255
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:57,769
understand that's right exactly right so
you know I'm so I deal with what I can

1256
00:25:57,769 --> 00:25:57,779
you know I'm so I deal with what I can
 

1257
00:25:57,779 --> 00:26:01,310
you know I'm so I deal with what I can
where I can affect something I tend not

1258
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:01,320
where I can affect something I tend not
 

1259
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,950
where I can affect something I tend not
to worry about things I don't control

1260
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:02,960
to worry about things I don't control
 

1261
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,390
to worry about things I don't control
because at a certain point you know

1262
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:05,400
because at a certain point you know
 

1263
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,370
because at a certain point you know
there's no point I mean you have to

1264
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:07,380
there's no point I mean you have to
 

1265
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:09,470
there's no point I mean you have to
decide what you're spending your time on

1266
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:09,480
decide what you're spending your time on
 

1267
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:12,169
decide what you're spending your time on
so I think in Practical terms I think

1268
00:26:12,169 --> 00:26:12,179
so I think in Practical terms I think
 

1269
00:26:12,179 --> 00:26:13,549
so I think in Practical terms I think
we'll make

1270
00:26:13,549 --> 00:26:13,559
we'll make
 

1271
00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:16,490
we'll make
um we'll make Israel a formidable AI

1272
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:16,500
um we'll make Israel a formidable AI
 

1273
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,710
um we'll make Israel a formidable AI
power we understand the limitation of

1274
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:18,720
power we understand the limitation of
 

1275
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,190
power we understand the limitation of
scale computing power

1276
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:21,200
scale computing power
 

1277
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,390
scale computing power
and other things but I think within

1278
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:23,400
and other things but I think within
 

1279
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:27,230
and other things but I think within
those limits I think we can uh make here

1280
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:27,240
those limits I think we can uh make here
 

1281
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,750
those limits I think we can uh make here
this miracle that we move we did in many

1282
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:29,760
this miracle that we move we did in many
 

1283
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,690
this miracle that we move we did in many
other things uh you know we do more with

1284
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:32,700
other things uh you know we do more with
 

1285
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,730
other things uh you know we do more with
less I don't care if it's water the

1286
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:34,740
less I don't care if it's water the
 

1287
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:36,350
less I don't care if it's water the
production of water or the production of

1288
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:36,360
production of water or the production of
 

1289
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,909
production of water or the production of
energy or the production of knowledge of

1290
00:26:37,909 --> 00:26:37,919
energy or the production of knowledge of
 

1291
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:40,130
energy or the production of knowledge of
the production of cyber capabilities

1292
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:40,140
the production of cyber capabilities
 

1293
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:44,049
the production of cyber capabilities
defense and other uh we just do more

1294
00:26:44,049 --> 00:26:44,059
defense and other uh we just do more
 

1295
00:26:44,059 --> 00:26:46,430
defense and other uh we just do more
with less and I think in AI we're going

1296
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:46,440
with less and I think in AI we're going
 

1297
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:50,210
with less and I think in AI we're going
to do a lot more uh with uh relatively

1298
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:50,220
to do a lot more uh with uh relatively
 

1299
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:52,549
to do a lot more uh with uh relatively

1331
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,570
uh in in the military and we barely
spent a minute uh on martial arts

1332
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:32,580
spent a minute uh on martial arts
 

1333
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:34,490
spent a minute uh on martial arts
actually

1334
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:34,500

interesting now the question you really

1346
00:27:48,169 --> 00:27:48,179
interesting now the question you really
 

1347
00:27:48,179 --> 00:27:51,590
interesting now the question you really
have to ask is why did we learn martial

1348
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:51,600
have to ask is why did we learn martial
 

1349
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:55,970
have to ask is why did we learn martial
arts in this special uh Elite unit and

1350
00:27:55,970 --> 00:27:55,980
arts in this special uh Elite unit and
 

1351
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,230
arts in this special uh Elite unit and
the answer is

1352
00:27:57,230 --> 00:27:57,240
the answer is
 

1353
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,390
the answer is
there's no point if you signed Deanna

1354
00:27:59,390 --> 00:27:59,400
there's no point if you signed Deanna
 

1355
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:02,930
there's no point if you signed Deanna
Jones you know there's no point you just

1356
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:02,940
Jones you know there's no point you just
 

1357
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:05,690
Jones you know there's no point you just
you know pull the trigger that's simple

1358
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:05,700
you know pull the trigger that's simple
 

1359
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:08,630
you know pull the trigger that's simple
now I don't expect anyone to pull the

1360
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:08,640
now I don't expect anyone to pull the
 

1361
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,029
now I don't expect anyone to pull the
trigger on this combat and I'm I'm sure

1362
00:28:11,029 --> 00:28:11,039
trigger on this combat and I'm I'm sure
 

1363
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:12,830
trigger on this combat and I'm I'm sure
you'll you'll make sure that doesn't

1364
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:12,840
you'll you'll make sure that doesn't
 

1365
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,590
you'll you'll make sure that doesn't
happen

1366

1371
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:22,250
it's bigger than just combat it's this
kind of Journey of humility and it has

1372
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:22,260
kind of Journey of humility and it has
 

1373
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:25,130
kind of Journey of humility and it has
uh it's an art form it truly is an art

1374
00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:25,140
uh it's an art form it truly is an art
 

1375

1377
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,830
but it's fascinating these two figures
in Tech are facing each other and uh I

1378

won't ask a question of who you would
 

1381
00:28:32,279 --> 00:28:34,549
won't ask a question of who you would
face and how you would do but um well

1382
00:28:34,549 --> 00:28:34,559
face and how you would do but um well

the podcast is that uh
 

1413
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:13,990
the podcast is that uh
at a certain point you want to put

1414
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:14,000
at a certain point you want to put
 

1415
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,370
at a certain point you want to put
barriers to Monopoly

barriers to Monopoly
 

1417
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:18,769
barriers to Monopoly
and if you're in a really able

1418
00:29:18,769 --> 00:29:18,779
and if you're in a really able
 

1419

minister I want to assure that there is

1436
00:29:37,909 --> 00:29:37,919
minister I want to assure that there is
 

1437
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:39,529
minister I want to assure that there is
competition in the market so you have to

1438
00:29:39,529 --> 00:29:39,539
competition in the market so you have to
 

1439
00:29:39,539 --> 00:29:43,070
competition in the market so you have to
limit uh limit this competitive power at

1440
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:43,080
limit uh limit this competitive power at
 

1441
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,389
limit uh limit this competitive power at
a certain point and that becomes

1442
00:29:44,389 --> 00:29:44,399
a certain point and that becomes
 

1443
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:47,870
a certain point and that becomes
increasingly hard uh in the in the world

1444
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:47,880
increasingly hard uh in the in the world
 

1445
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,549
increasingly hard uh in the in the world
where everything is intermissed where do

00:29:49,559 --> 00:29:52,130
where everything is intermissed where do
you define market segments where do you

1448
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:52,140
you define market segments where do you
 

1449
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:55,610
you define market segments where do you
define uh Monopoly uh how do you do that

1450
00:29:55,610 --> 00:29:55,620
define uh Monopoly uh how do you do that
 

1451
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:57,950
define uh Monopoly uh how do you do that
that is very that that actually

1452
00:29:57,950 --> 00:29:57,960
that is very that that actually
 

1453
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:00,409
that is very that that actually
conceptually I find very challenging

1454
00:30:00,409 --> 00:30:00,419
conceptually I find very challenging
 

1455
00:30:00,419 --> 00:30:03,110
conceptually I find very challenging
because of all the dozens of political

1456
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:03,120
because of all the dozens of political
 

1457
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,810
because of all the dozens of political

the most difficult part is the

1460
00:30:08,269 --> 00:30:08,279
the most difficult part is the
 

1461
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:10,190
the most difficult part is the
conceptual part once you have you've

1462
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:10,200
conceptual part once you have you've
 

1463
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,870
conceptual part once you have you've
ironed it out you say here's what I want

1464
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:11,880
ironed it out you say here's what I want
 

1465
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,850
ironed it out you say here's what I want
to do here's the right thing to do then

1466
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:13,860
to do here's the right thing to do then
 

1467
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:15,350
to do here's the right thing to do then
you have a practical problem of

opponents from this or that corner
 

1475
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:27,649
opponents from this or that corner
that's a practical matter but if you

1476
00:30:27,649 --> 00:30:27,659
that's a practical matter but if you
 

1477
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:30,409
that's a practical matter but if you
have it conceptually defined you can

1478
00:30:30,409 --> 00:30:30,419
have it conceptually defined you can
 

1479
00:30:30,419 --> 00:30:33,710
have it conceptually defined you can

should begin to think do you have a
 

1523

should begin to think do you have a
solution to that

1524

well I I think the reason you have
 

1969
00:40:59,099 --> 00:41:02,650
well I I think the reason you have
uh the Persistence of the uh

1970
00:41:02,650 --> 00:41:02,660
uh the Persistence of the uh

1973
00:41:04,619 --> 00:41:08,270
palestinian-israeli conflict which goes
back about a century is the persistent

1974
00:41:08,270 --> 00:41:08,280
back about a century is the persistent
 

1975
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:11,569
back about a century is the persistent
Palestinian refusal to recognize a

1976
00:41:11,569 --> 00:41:11,579
Palestinian refusal to recognize a
 

1977
00:41:11,579 --> 00:41:13,250
Palestinian refusal to recognize a
Jewish State a nation-state for the

1978
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:13,260
Jewish State a nation-state for the
 

1979
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:15,650
Jewish State a nation-state for the
Jewish people in any boundary and that's

1980
00:41:15,650 --> 00:41:15,660
Jewish people in any boundary and that's
 

1981
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:18,290
Jewish people in any boundary and that's
why they opposed the establishment of

1982
00:41:18,290 --> 00:41:18,300
why they opposed the establishment of
 

1983
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:19,790
why they opposed the establishment of
the state of Israel before we had a

1984
00:41:19,790 --> 00:41:19,800
the state of Israel before we had a
 

1985
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,170
the state of Israel before we had a
state now that's why they've opposed it

1986
00:41:21,170 --> 00:41:21,180
state now that's why they've opposed it
 

1987
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:23,870
state now that's why they've opposed it
after we had a state they opposed it

1988
00:41:23,870 --> 00:41:23,880
after we had a state they opposed it
 

1989
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:26,390
after we had a state they opposed it
when we were we didn't have Judea and

1990
00:41:26,390 --> 00:41:26,400
when we were we didn't have Judea and
 

1991
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,130
when we were we didn't have Judea and
Samaria the West Bank in our heads in

1992
00:41:28,130 --> 00:41:28,140
Samaria the West Bank in our heads in
 

1993
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:29,930
Samaria the West Bank in our heads in
Gaza and the oppose it after we have it

1994
00:41:29,930 --> 00:41:29,940
Gaza and the oppose it after we have it
 

1995
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:31,670
Gaza and the oppose it after we have it
doesn't make a difference it's basically

1996
00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:31,680
doesn't make a difference it's basically
 

1997
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:34,010
doesn't make a difference it's basically
the persistent refusal

1998
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:34,020
the persistent refusal
 

1999
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:35,990
the persistent refusal
to recognize a Jewish state in any

2000
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:36,000
to recognize a Jewish state in any
 

2001
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,089
to recognize a Jewish state in any
boundaries and I think their tragedy is

2002
00:41:38,089 --> 00:41:38,099
boundaries and I think their tragedy is
 

2003
00:41:38,099 --> 00:41:40,190
boundaries and I think their tragedy is
that they've been commandeered for a

2004
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:40,200
that they've been commandeered for a
 

2005
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,650
that they've been commandeered for a
century by leadership that refused to

2006
00:41:42,650 --> 00:41:42,660
century by leadership that refused to
 

2007
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:45,770
century by leadership that refused to
compromise with the idea of of Zionism

2008
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:45,780
compromise with the idea of of Zionism
 

2009
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:48,829
compromise with the idea of of Zionism
namely that the Jews deserve a state in

2010
00:41:48,829 --> 00:41:48,839
namely that the Jews deserve a state in
 

2011
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:50,450
namely that the Jews deserve a state in
this part of the world the territorial

2012
00:41:50,450 --> 00:41:50,460
this part of the world the territorial
 

2013
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:52,490
this part of the world the territorial
dispute is something else you have a

2014
00:41:52,490 --> 00:41:52,500

2015
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:54,290

territorial dispute if you say okay

2016
00:41:54,290 --> 00:41:54,300

you're living on this side we're living
 

2019
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,710
you're living on this side we're living
on that side let's decide where the

2020
00:41:57,710 --> 00:41:57,720
on that side let's decide where the
 

2021
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:59,930
on that side let's decide where the
border is and so on that's not what the

2022
00:41:59,930 --> 00:41:59,940
border is and so on that's not what the
 

2023
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:03,109
border is and so on that's not what the
argument is the Palestinian society

2024
00:42:03,109 --> 00:42:03,119
argument is the Palestinian society
 

2025
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:06,069
argument is the Palestinian society
which is itself

2026
00:42:06,069 --> 00:42:06,079
which is itself
 

2027
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:09,950
which is itself
fragmented but all the factions agree

2028
00:42:09,950 --> 00:42:09,960
fragmented but all the factions agree
 

2029
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:12,470
fragmented but all the factions agree
there shouldn't be a Jewish State anyway

2030
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:12,480
there shouldn't be a Jewish State anyway
 

2031
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:15,109
there shouldn't be a Jewish State anyway
okay they just disagree between Hamas

okay they just disagree between Hamas
 

2033
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:17,930
okay they just disagree between Hamas
that says oh well you should have it you

2034
00:42:17,930 --> 00:42:17,940
that says oh well you should have it you
 

2035
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:20,829
that says oh well you should have it you
know we should get rid of it with Terror

2036
00:42:20,829 --> 00:42:20,839
know we should get rid of it with Terror
 

2037
00:42:20,839 --> 00:42:23,089
know we should get rid of it with Terror
and the others who say we know we should

2038
00:42:23,089 --> 00:42:23,099
and the others who say we know we should
 

2039
00:42:23,099 --> 00:42:25,750
and the others who say we know we should
also use political means to dissolve it

2040
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:25,760
also use political means to dissolve it
 

2041
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:29,569

so that is that is the problem so even
 

2043
00:42:29,579 --> 00:42:31,310
so that is that is the problem so even

2052
00:42:40,010 --> 00:42:40,020
we get a state we'll use it as a
 

2053
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:43,069
we get a state we'll use it as a
springboard to destroy the the smaller

2054
00:42:43,069 --> 00:42:43,079
springboard to destroy the the smaller
 

2055
00:42:43,079 --> 00:42:44,450
springboard to destroy the the smaller
Israeli state which is what happened

2056
00:42:44,450 --> 00:42:44,460
Israeli state which is what happened
 

2057
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:46,849
Israeli state which is what happened
when Israel unilaterally walked out of

2058
00:42:46,849 --> 00:42:46,859
when Israel unilaterally walked out of
 

2059
00:42:46,859 --> 00:42:48,890
when Israel unilaterally walked out of
Gaza and effectively established a Hamas

2060
00:42:48,890 --> 00:42:48,900
Gaza and effectively established a Hamas
 

2061
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,990
Gaza and effectively established a Hamas
State there they didn't say all good now

2062
00:42:50,990 --> 00:42:51,000
State there they didn't say all good now
 

2063
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,390
State there they didn't say all good now
we have you know our own territory our

2064
00:42:53,390 --> 00:42:53,400
we have you know our own territory our
 

2065

we have you know our own territory our
own State Israel is no longer there

2069
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:01,210
let's build peace let's build uh uh you
know uh economic projects let's uh

2070
00:43:01,210 --> 00:43:01,220
know uh economic projects let's uh
 

2071
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:03,470
know uh economic projects let's uh
enfranchise our people no they turned it

2072
00:43:03,470 --> 00:43:03,480
enfranchise our people no they turned it
 

2073
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:06,109
enfranchise our people no they turned it
into a basically into a terror Bastion

2074
00:43:06,109 --> 00:43:06,119
into a basically into a terror Bastion
 

2075
00:43:06,119 --> 00:43:08,630
into a basically into a terror Bastion
from which they find uh 10 000 Rockets

2076
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:08,640
from which they find uh 10 000 Rockets
 

2077
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:11,829
from which they find uh 10 000 Rockets
into Israel when Israel left uh Lebanon

2078
00:43:11,829 --> 00:43:11,839
into Israel when Israel left uh Lebanon
 

2079
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:15,109
into Israel when Israel left uh Lebanon
uh you know and because we had terrorist

2080
00:43:15,109 --> 00:43:15,119
uh you know and because we had terrorist
 

2081
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:18,349
uh you know and because we had terrorist
attacks from there then we had Lebanon

2082
00:43:18,349 --> 00:43:18,359
attacks from there then we had Lebanon
 

2083
00:43:18,359 --> 00:43:20,870
attacks from there then we had Lebanon
uh taken over by Hezbollah terrorist

2084
00:43:20,870 --> 00:43:20,880
uh taken over by Hezbollah terrorist
 

2085
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:22,430
uh taken over by Hezbollah terrorist
organization that seeks to destroy

2086
00:43:22,430 --> 00:43:22,440
organization that seeks to destroy
 

2087
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:25,010
organization that seeks to destroy
Israel uh and and therefore every time

2088
00:43:25,010 --> 00:43:25,020
Israel uh and and therefore every time
 

2089
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:27,890
Israel uh and and therefore every time
we just walked out what we got was not

2090
00:43:27,890 --> 00:43:27,900
we just walked out what we got was not
 

2091
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:30,349
we just walked out what we got was not
peace we didn't give uh you know

2092
00:43:30,349 --> 00:43:30,359
peace we didn't give uh you know
 

2093
00:43:30,359 --> 00:43:33,170
peace we didn't give uh you know
territory for peace we got territory for

2094
00:43:33,170 --> 00:43:33,180
territory for peace we got territory for
 

2095
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:35,809
territory for peace we got territory for
Terror that's what we had and that's

2096
00:43:35,809 --> 00:43:35,819
Terror that's what we had and that's
 

2097
00:43:35,819 --> 00:43:37,670
Terror that's what we had and that's
what would happen as long as the the

2098
00:43:37,670 --> 00:43:37,680
what would happen as long as the the
 

2099
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,710
what would happen as long as the the
reigning ideology says we don't want

2100
00:43:39,710 --> 00:43:39,720
reigning ideology says we don't want
 

2101
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:42,829
reigning ideology says we don't want
Israel in any border so the the idea of

2102
00:43:42,829 --> 00:43:42,839
Israel in any border so the the idea of
 

2103
00:43:42,839 --> 00:43:45,770
Israel in any border so the the idea of
uh two states assumes that you'd have on

2104
00:43:45,770 --> 00:43:45,780
uh two states assumes that you'd have on
 

2105
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:47,630
uh two states assumes that you'd have on
the other side a state that wants to

2106
00:43:47,630 --> 00:43:47,640
the other side a state that wants to
 

2107
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:49,309
the other side a state that wants to
live in peace and not one that will be

2108
00:43:49,309 --> 00:43:49,319
live in peace and not one that will be
 

2109
00:43:49,319 --> 00:43:51,470
live in peace and not one that will be
overtaken by Iran and its proxies in two

2110
00:43:51,470 --> 00:43:51,480
overtaken by Iran and its proxies in two
 

2111
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:53,569
overtaken by Iran and its proxies in two
seconds and become a base to destroy

2112
00:43:53,569 --> 00:43:53,579
seconds and become a base to destroy
 

2113
00:43:53,579 --> 00:43:55,849
seconds and become a base to destroy
Israel and therefore I think that most

2114
00:43:55,849 --> 00:43:55,859
Israel and therefore I think that most
 

2115
00:43:55,859 --> 00:43:58,609
Israel and therefore I think that most
Israelis today if you ask them uh

2116
00:43:58,609 --> 00:43:58,619
Israelis today if you ask them uh
 

2117
00:43:58,619 --> 00:44:01,970
Israelis today if you ask them uh
they're yeah they'd say it's not going

2118
00:44:01,970 --> 00:44:01,980
they're yeah they'd say it's not going
 

2119
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:03,950
they're yeah they'd say it's not going
to work in that concept so what do you

2120
00:44:03,950 --> 00:44:03,960
to work in that concept so what do you
 

2121
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:05,870
to work in that concept so what do you
do what do you do with the Palestinians

2122
00:44:05,870 --> 00:44:05,880
do what do you do with the Palestinians
 

2123
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:08,270
do what do you do with the Palestinians
okay they're still there and I don't

2124
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:08,280
okay they're still there and I don't
 

2125
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:10,190
okay they're still there and I don't
unlike them I don't want to throw them

2126
00:44:10,190 --> 00:44:10,200
unlike them I don't want to throw them
 

2127
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:13,010
unlike them I don't want to throw them
out uh they're going to be living here

2128
00:44:13,010 --> 00:44:13,020
out uh they're going to be living here
 

2129
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:14,450
out uh they're going to be living here
and we're going to be living here in an

2130
00:44:14,450 --> 00:44:14,460
and we're going to be living here in an
 

2131
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:16,010
and we're going to be living here in an
area which is by the way just to

2132
00:44:16,010 --> 00:44:16,020
area which is by the way just to
 

2133
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:16,970
area which is by the way just to
understand

2134
00:44:16,970 --> 00:44:16,980
understand
 

2135
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:20,990
understand
uh the area the entire area of uh

2136
00:44:20,990 --> 00:44:21,000
uh the area the entire area of uh
 

2137
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,470
uh the area the entire area of uh
so-called West Bank and in Israel is the

2138
00:44:24,470 --> 00:44:24,480
so-called West Bank and in Israel is the
 

2139
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,210
so-called West Bank and in Israel is the
width of the Washington Beltway more or

2140
00:44:26,210 --> 00:44:26,220
width of the Washington Beltway more or
 

2141
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:28,130
width of the Washington Beltway more or
less just a little more not much more

2142
00:44:28,130 --> 00:44:28,140
less just a little more not much more
 

2143
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:30,230
less just a little more not much more
you can't really divide it up you can't

2144
00:44:30,230 --> 00:44:30,240
you can't really divide it up you can't
 

2145
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:32,270
you can't really divide it up you can't
say well you're going to fly in who

2146
00:44:32,270 --> 00:44:32,280
say well you're going to fly in who
 

2147
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:35,690
say well you're going to fly in who
controls the airspace well it takes you

2148
00:44:35,690 --> 00:44:35,700
controls the airspace well it takes you
 

2149
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:37,490
controls the airspace well it takes you
about two and a half minutes to cross it

2150
00:44:37,490 --> 00:44:37,500
about two and a half minutes to cross it
 

2151
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:42,050
about two and a half minutes to cross it
with a with a regular uh you know seven

2152
00:44:42,050 --> 00:44:42,060
with a with a regular uh you know seven
 

2153
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:44,390
with a with a regular uh you know seven
to four seven okay with the fighter

2154
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:44,400
to four seven okay with the fighter
 

2155
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,130
to four seven okay with the fighter
plane it takes you a minute and a half

2156
00:44:46,130 --> 00:44:46,140
plane it takes you a minute and a half
 

2157
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:48,770
plane it takes you a minute and a half
okay so you're not how are you going to

2158
00:44:48,770 --> 00:44:48,780
okay so you're not how are you going to
 

2159
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:50,089
okay so you're not how are you going to
divide the airspace well you're not

2160
00:44:50,089 --> 00:44:50,099
divide the airspace well you're not
 

2161
00:44:50,099 --> 00:44:51,349
divide the airspace well you're not
going to divide it this wheel is going

2162
00:44:51,349 --> 00:44:51,359
going to divide it this wheel is going
 

2163
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:53,150
going to divide it this wheel is going
to control that airspace and the

2164
00:44:53,150 --> 00:44:53,160
to control that airspace and the
 

2165
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:56,510
to control that airspace and the
electromagnetic space uh and uh and so

2166
00:44:56,510 --> 00:44:56,520
electromagnetic space uh and uh and so
 

2167
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:59,870
electromagnetic space uh and uh and so
on so security has to be uh in the hands

2168
00:44:59,870 --> 00:44:59,880
on so security has to be uh in the hands
 

2169
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:03,230
on so security has to be uh in the hands
of Israel my view of how you solve this

2170
00:45:03,230 --> 00:45:03,240
of Israel my view of how you solve this
 

2171
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:06,589
of Israel my view of how you solve this
problem is that is a simple principle

2172
00:45:06,589 --> 00:45:06,599
problem is that is a simple principle
 

2173
00:45:06,599 --> 00:45:08,870
problem is that is a simple principle
the Palestinians should have all the

2174
00:45:08,870 --> 00:45:08,880
the Palestinians should have all the
 

2175
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:10,790
the Palestinians should have all the
powers to govern themselves and none of

2176
00:45:10,790 --> 00:45:10,800
powers to govern themselves and none of
 

2177
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,710
powers to govern themselves and none of
the powers to threaten Israel which

2178
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:12,720
the powers to threaten Israel which
 

2179
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:14,990
the powers to threaten Israel which
basically means that the responsibility

2180
00:45:14,990 --> 00:45:15,000
basically means that the responsibility
 

2181
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,150
basically means that the responsibility
for overall security remains with Israel

2182
00:45:17,150 --> 00:45:17,160
for overall security remains with Israel
 

2183
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:19,190
for overall security remains with Israel
and from a practice point of view we've

2184
00:45:19,190 --> 00:45:19,200
and from a practice point of view we've
 

2185
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:22,250
and from a practice point of view we've
seen that every time that Israel leaves

2186
00:45:22,250 --> 00:45:22,260
seen that every time that Israel leaves
 

2187
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:25,309
seen that every time that Israel leaves
a territory and and takes its uh

2188
00:45:25,309 --> 00:45:25,319
a territory and and takes its uh
 

2189
00:45:25,319 --> 00:45:27,530
a territory and and takes its uh
Security Forces out of an area it

2190
00:45:27,530 --> 00:45:27,540
Security Forces out of an area it
 

2191
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:29,990
Security Forces out of an area it
immediately is overtaken by hamaso

2192
00:45:29,990 --> 00:45:30,000
immediately is overtaken by hamaso
 

2193
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,970
immediately is overtaken by hamaso
Hezbollah or Judas who basically are

2194
00:45:33,970 --> 00:45:33,980
Hezbollah or Judas who basically are
 

2195
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:36,050
Hezbollah or Judas who basically are
committed to the destruction of Israel

2196
00:45:36,050 --> 00:45:36,060
committed to the destruction of Israel
 

2197
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:38,270
committed to the destruction of Israel
and also bring misery to the the

2198
00:45:38,270 --> 00:45:38,280
and also bring misery to the the
 

2199
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:41,089
and also bring misery to the the
Palestinians or Arab subjects so I think

2200
00:45:41,089 --> 00:45:41,099
Palestinians or Arab subjects so I think
 

2201
00:45:41,099 --> 00:45:44,450
Palestinians or Arab subjects so I think
that that principle is less than perfect

2202
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:44,460
that that principle is less than perfect
 

2203
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:45,730
that that principle is less than perfect
sovereignty

2204
00:45:45,730 --> 00:45:45,740
sovereignty
 

2205
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:48,050
sovereignty

2360
00:48:52,250 --> 00:48:52,260
they should throw out the Jews and if
 

2361
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:53,690
they should throw out the Jews and if
somebody said to you the only way we're

2362
00:48:53,690 --> 00:48:53,700
somebody said to you the only way we're
 

2363
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:55,370
somebody said to you the only way we're
going to have peace with Israel is to

2364
00:48:55,370 --> 00:48:55,380
going to have peace with Israel is to
 

2365
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:58,250
going to have peace with Israel is to
have an ethnically cleansed Palestinian

2366
00:48:58,250 --> 00:48:58,260
have an ethnically cleansed Palestinian
 

2367
00:48:58,260 --> 00:49:00,770
have an ethnically cleansed Palestinian
entity you know that that's outrageous

2368
00:49:00,770 --> 00:49:00,780
entity you know that that's outrageous
 

2369
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:03,410
entity you know that that's outrageous
if you said the only way you know you

2370
00:49:03,410 --> 00:49:03,420
if you said the only way you know you
 

2371
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:05,450
if you said the only way you know you
shouldn't have Jews living in I don't

2372
00:49:05,450 --> 00:49:05,460
shouldn't have Jews living in I don't
 

2373
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:07,490
shouldn't have Jews living in I don't
know in suburbs of London or New York

2374
00:49:07,490 --> 00:49:07,500
know in suburbs of London or New York
 

2375
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:08,930
know in suburbs of London or New York
and so on I don't think that will play

2376
00:49:08,930 --> 00:49:08,940
and so on I don't think that will play
 

2377
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:11,210
and so on I don't think that will play
too well the world is actually advancing

2378
00:49:11,210 --> 00:49:11,220
too well the world is actually advancing
 

2379
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:16,010
too well the world is actually advancing
a solution that says that uh that Jews

2380
00:49:16,010 --> 00:49:16,020
a solution that says that uh that Jews
 

2381
00:49:16,020 --> 00:49:17,630
a solution that says that uh that Jews
cannot live among Arabs and Arabs cannot

2382
00:49:17,630 --> 00:49:17,640
cannot live among Arabs and Arabs cannot
 

2383
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:19,190
cannot live among Arabs and Arabs cannot
live among Jews I I don't think that's

2384
00:49:19,190 --> 00:49:19,200
live among Jews I I don't think that's
 

2385
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:22,190
live among Jews I I don't think that's
the right way to do it uh and I I think

2386
00:49:22,190 --> 00:49:22,200
the right way to do it uh and I I think
 

2387
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:24,650
the right way to do it uh and I I think
there's a solution out there but I don't

2388
00:49:24,650 --> 00:49:24,660
there's a solution out there but I don't
 

2389
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:26,089
there's a solution out there but I don't
think we're going to get to it which is

2390
00:49:26,089 --> 00:49:26,099
think we're going to get to it which is
 

2391
00:49:26,099 --> 00:49:27,950
think we're going to get to it which is
less than perfect sovereignty which

2392
00:49:27,950 --> 00:49:27,960
less than perfect sovereignty which
 

2393
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:31,609
less than perfect sovereignty which
involves Israeli security uh maintained

2394
00:49:31,609 --> 00:49:31,619
involves Israeli security uh maintained
 

2395
00:49:31,619 --> 00:49:34,490
involves Israeli security uh maintained
for the entire territory by Israel which

2396
00:49:34,490 --> 00:49:34,500
for the entire territory by Israel which
 

2397
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:36,950
for the entire territory by Israel which
involves not rooting out anybody not

2398
00:49:36,950 --> 00:49:36,960
involves not rooting out anybody not
 

2399
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:38,690
involves not rooting out anybody not
kicking out uprooting Arabs or

2400
00:49:38,690 --> 00:49:38,700
kicking out uprooting Arabs or
 

2401
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:40,849
kicking out uprooting Arabs or
Palestinians they're going to live in

2402
00:49:40,849 --> 00:49:40,859
Palestinians they're going to live in
 

2403
00:49:40,859 --> 00:49:43,130
Palestinians they're going to live in
enclaves in Sovereign Israel and we're

2404
00:49:43,130 --> 00:49:43,140
enclaves in Sovereign Israel and we're
 

2405
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:45,470
enclaves in Sovereign Israel and we're
going to live in probably an enclaves

2406
00:49:45,470 --> 00:49:45,480
going to live in probably an enclaves
 

2407
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:46,490
going to live in probably an enclaves
there

2408
00:49:46,490 --> 00:49:46,500
there
 

2409
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:48,109
there
probably through transportational

2410
00:49:48,109 --> 00:49:48,119
probably through transportational
 

2411
00:49:48,119 --> 00:49:50,210
probably through transportational
continuity as opposed to territorial

2412
00:49:50,210 --> 00:49:50,220
continuity as opposed to territorial
 

2413
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:52,849
continuity as opposed to territorial
continuity that is uh you know for

2414
00:49:52,849 --> 00:49:52,859
continuity that is uh you know for
 

2415
00:49:52,859 --> 00:49:54,109
continuity that is uh you know for
example you can have tunnels and

2416
00:49:54,109 --> 00:49:54,119
example you can have tunnels and
 

2417
00:49:54,119 --> 00:49:56,390
example you can have tunnels and
overpasses and so on that connect the

2418
00:49:56,390 --> 00:49:56,400
overpasses and so on that connect the
 

2419
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:57,710
overpasses and so on that connect the
various communities we're doing that

2420
00:49:57,710 --> 00:49:57,720
various communities we're doing that
 

2421
00:49:57,720 --> 00:49:58,730
various communities we're doing that
right now

2422
00:49:58,730 --> 00:49:58,740
right now
 

2423
00:49:58,740 --> 00:50:00,829
right now
we're doing that right now and it it

2424
00:50:00,829 --> 00:50:00,839
we're doing that right now and it it
 

2425
00:50:00,839 --> 00:50:03,470
we're doing that right now and it it
actually works I think there is a

2426
00:50:03,470 --> 00:50:03,480
actually works I think there is a
 

2427
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:05,870
actually works I think there is a
solution to this uh it's not the perfect

2428
00:50:05,870 --> 00:50:05,880
solution to this uh it's not the perfect
 

2429
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:08,270
solution to this uh it's not the perfect
world that people think of because that

2430
00:50:08,270 --> 00:50:08,280
world that people think of because that
 

2431
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:12,109
world that people think of because that
model I think doesn't apply here uh if

2432
00:50:12,109 --> 00:50:12,119
model I think doesn't apply here uh if
 

2433
00:50:12,119 --> 00:50:14,870
model I think doesn't apply here uh if
it applies elsewhere it's a question uh

2434
00:50:14,870 --> 00:50:14,880
it applies elsewhere it's a question uh
 

2435
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:17,329
it applies elsewhere it's a question uh
I don't think so but I think there's one

2436
00:50:17,329 --> 00:50:17,339
I don't think so but I think there's one
 

2437
00:50:17,339 --> 00:50:18,349
I don't think so but I think there's one
other thing

2438
00:50:18,349 --> 00:50:18,359
other thing
 

2439
00:50:18,359 --> 00:50:20,030
other thing
and that's the main thing that I've been

2440
00:50:20,030 --> 00:50:20,040
and that's the main thing that I've been
 

2441
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:21,770
and that's the main thing that I've been
involved in

2442
00:50:21,770 --> 00:50:21,780
involved in
 

2443
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:23,750
involved in
you know people said if you don't solve

2444
00:50:23,750 --> 00:50:23,760
you know people said if you don't solve
 

2445
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:25,490
you know people said if you don't solve
the Palestinian problem

2446
00:50:25,490 --> 00:50:25,500
the Palestinian problem
 

2447
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:26,990
the Palestinian problem
you're not going to get to the Arab

2448
00:50:26,990 --> 00:50:27,000
you're not going to get to the Arab
 

2449
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,430
you're not going to get to the Arab
world you're not going to have peace

2450
00:50:28,430 --> 00:50:28,440
world you're not going to have peace
 

2451
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:30,109
world you're not going to have peace
with the Arab world remember the

2452
00:50:30,109 --> 00:50:30,119
with the Arab world remember the
 

2453
00:50:30,119 --> 00:50:31,550
with the Arab world remember the
Palestinians are about two percent of

2454
00:50:31,550 --> 00:50:31,560
Palestinians are about two percent of
 

2455
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:32,750
Palestinians are about two percent of
the Arab world

2456
00:50:32,750 --> 00:50:32,760
the Arab world
 

2457
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:35,510
the Arab world
and the other you know the other 98

2458
00:50:35,510 --> 00:50:35,520
and the other you know the other 98
 

2459
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:37,430
and the other you know the other 98
you're not going to make peace with them

2460
00:50:37,430 --> 00:50:37,440
you're not going to make peace with them
 

2461
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:39,410
you're not going to make peace with them
and that's our goal

2462
00:50:39,410 --> 00:50:39,420
and that's our goal
 

2463
00:50:39,420 --> 00:50:41,870
and that's our goal
and for a long time people accepted that

2464
00:50:41,870 --> 00:50:41,880
and for a long time people accepted that
 

2465
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:43,550
and for a long time people accepted that
after the initial peace treaties with

2466
00:50:43,550 --> 00:50:43,560
after the initial peace treaties with
 

2467
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:46,309
after the initial peace treaties with
Egypt with the Prime Minister begin of

2468
00:50:46,309 --> 00:50:46,319
Egypt with the Prime Minister begin of
 

2469
00:50:46,319 --> 00:50:48,589
Egypt with the Prime Minister begin of
the likud and and president said out of

2470
00:50:48,589 --> 00:50:48,599
the likud and and president said out of
 

2471
00:50:48,599 --> 00:50:51,770
the likud and and president said out of
Egypt and then uh with Jordan between

2472
00:50:51,770 --> 00:50:51,780
Egypt and then uh with Jordan between
 

2473
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:54,890
Egypt and then uh with Jordan between
prime minister Rabin and uh and kink

2474
00:50:54,890 --> 00:50:54,900
prime minister Rabin and uh and kink
 

2475
00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:56,809
prime minister Rabin and uh and kink
Hussein for quarter of a century we

2476
00:50:56,809 --> 00:50:56,819
Hussein for quarter of a century we
 

2477
00:50:56,819 --> 00:50:57,890
Hussein for quarter of a century we
didn't have any more peace treaties

2478
00:50:57,890 --> 00:50:57,900
didn't have any more peace treaties
 

2479
00:50:57,900 --> 00:50:59,750
didn't have any more peace treaties
because people said you got to go

2480
00:50:59,750 --> 00:50:59,760
because people said you got to go
 

2481
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:00,950
because people said you got to go
through the Palestinians and the

2482
00:51:00,950 --> 00:51:00,960
through the Palestinians and the
 

2483
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:03,109
through the Palestinians and the
Palestinians they don't want a solution

2484
00:51:03,109 --> 00:51:03,119
Palestinians they don't want a solution
 

2485
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:05,390
Palestinians they don't want a solution
of the kind that I described or any kind

2486
00:51:05,390 --> 00:51:05,400
of the kind that I described or any kind
 

2487
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:06,950
of the kind that I described or any kind
except the one that involved the

2488
00:51:06,950 --> 00:51:06,960
except the one that involved the
 

2489
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:09,109
except the one that involved the
dissolution of the state of Israel so we

2490
00:51:09,109 --> 00:51:09,119
dissolution of the state of Israel so we
 

2491
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:11,390
dissolution of the state of Israel so we
could wait another half century and I

2492
00:51:11,390 --> 00:51:11,400
could wait another half century and I
 

2493
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:14,510
could wait another half century and I
said no I mean I don't think that we

2494
00:51:14,510 --> 00:51:14,520
said no I mean I don't think that we
 

2495
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:16,130
said no I mean I don't think that we
should accept the premise that we have

2496
00:51:16,130 --> 00:51:16,140
should accept the premise that we have
 

2497
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:17,690
should accept the premise that we have
to wait for the Palestinians because

2498
00:51:17,690 --> 00:51:17,700
to wait for the Palestinians because
 

2499
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:19,309
to wait for the Palestinians because
we'll have to wait forever

2500
00:51:19,309 --> 00:51:19,319
we'll have to wait forever
 

2501
00:51:19,319 --> 00:51:21,710
we'll have to wait forever
so I decided to do it differently I

2502
00:51:21,710 --> 00:51:21,720
so I decided to do it differently I
 

2503
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:24,109
so I decided to do it differently I
decided to go directly to the Arab

2504
00:51:24,109 --> 00:51:24,119
decided to go directly to the Arab
 

2505
00:51:24,119 --> 00:51:27,349
decided to go directly to the Arab
capitals uh and to make the historic

2506
00:51:27,349 --> 00:51:27,359
capitals uh and to make the historic
 

2507
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:31,069
capitals uh and to make the historic
Abraham Accords uh and essentially uh

2508
00:51:31,069 --> 00:51:31,079
Abraham Accords uh and essentially uh
 

2509
00:51:31,079 --> 00:51:33,410
Abraham Accords uh and essentially uh
reversing the equation not a peace

2510
00:51:33,410 --> 00:51:33,420
reversing the equation not a peace
 

2511
00:51:33,420 --> 00:51:36,290
reversing the equation not a peace
process that goes inside out

2512
00:51:36,290 --> 00:51:36,300
process that goes inside out
 

2513
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:39,109
process that goes inside out
but outside in and we went directly to

2514
00:51:39,109 --> 00:51:39,119
but outside in and we went directly to
 

2515
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:42,950
but outside in and we went directly to

arrived at so there's we're not going to
 

2549
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:26,329
arrived at so there's we're not going to
advance a saudi-israeli Peace by having

2550
00:52:26,329 --> 00:52:26,339
advance a saudi-israeli Peace by having
 

2551
00:52:26,339 --> 00:52:28,250
advance a saudi-israeli Peace by having
it publicly discussed and in any case

2552
00:52:28,250 --> 00:52:28,260
it publicly discussed and in any case
 

2553
00:52:28,260 --> 00:52:31,370
it publicly discussed and in any case
it's a decision of the uh of the Saudis

2554
00:52:31,370 --> 00:52:31,380
it's a decision of the uh of the Saudis
 

2555
00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:34,370
it's a decision of the uh of the Saudis
if they want to do it but there's

2556
00:52:34,370 --> 00:52:34,380
if they want to do it but there's
 

2557
00:52:34,380 --> 00:52:36,589
if they want to do it but there's
obviously a mutual interest so here's my

2558
00:52:36,589 --> 00:52:36,599
obviously a mutual interest so here's my
 

2559
00:52:36,599 --> 00:52:37,670
obviously a mutual interest so here's my
view

2560
00:52:37,670 --> 00:52:37,680
view
 

2561
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:40,910
view
if we try to wait for the two percent in

2562
00:52:40,910 --> 00:52:40,920
if we try to wait for the two percent in
 

2563
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:42,829
if we try to wait for the two percent in
order to get to the 98 we're going to

2564
00:52:42,829 --> 00:52:42,839
order to get to the 98 we're going to
 

2565
00:52:42,839 --> 00:52:44,930
order to get to the 98 we're going to
fail and we have failed if we go to the

2566
00:52:44,930 --> 00:52:44,940
fail and we have failed if we go to the
 

2567
00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:47,690
fail and we have failed if we go to the
98 we have a much greater chance of

2568
00:52:47,690 --> 00:52:47,700
98 we have a much greater chance of
 

2569
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:49,670
98 we have a much greater chance of
persuading the two percent you know why

2570
00:52:49,670 --> 00:52:49,680
persuading the two percent you know why
 

2571
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:52,569
persuading the two percent you know why
because the two percent the Palestinian

2572
00:52:52,569 --> 00:52:52,579
because the two percent the Palestinian
 

2573
00:52:52,579 --> 00:52:56,030
because the two percent the Palestinian
uh hope to Vanquish the state of Israel

2574
00:52:56,030 --> 00:52:56,040
uh hope to Vanquish the state of Israel
 

2575
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:58,130
uh hope to Vanquish the state of Israel
and not make peace with it is based

2576
00:52:58,130 --> 00:52:58,140
and not make peace with it is based
 

2577
00:52:58,140 --> 00:52:59,690
and not make peace with it is based
among other things on the pro on the

2578
00:52:59,690 --> 00:52:59,700
among other things on the pro on the
 

2579
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:02,329
among other things on the pro on the
assumption that eventually the 98 the

2580
00:53:02,329 --> 00:53:02,339
assumption that eventually the 98 the
 

2581
00:53:02,339 --> 00:53:04,609
assumption that eventually the 98 the
rest of the Arab world will kick in and

2582
00:53:04,609 --> 00:53:04,619
rest of the Arab world will kick in and
 

2583
00:53:04,619 --> 00:53:06,190
rest of the Arab world will kick in and
destroy the Jewish State help them

2584
00:53:06,190 --> 00:53:06,200
destroy the Jewish State help them
 

2585
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:08,150
destroy the Jewish State help them
dissolve or destroy the Jewish State

2586
00:53:08,150 --> 00:53:08,160
dissolve or destroy the Jewish State
 

2587
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:11,270
dissolve or destroy the Jewish State
when that hope is

2588
00:53:11,270 --> 00:53:11,280
when that hope is
 

2589
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:15,410
when that hope is
um uh taken away then you begin to have

2590
00:53:15,410 --> 00:53:15,420
um uh taken away then you begin to have
 

2591
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:18,530
um uh taken away then you begin to have
a turn to the realistic Solutions of

2592
00:53:18,530 --> 00:53:18,540
a turn to the realistic Solutions of
 

2593
00:53:18,540 --> 00:53:19,970
a turn to the realistic Solutions of
coexistence by the way they'll require

2594
00:53:19,970 --> 00:53:19,980
coexistence by the way they'll require
 

2595
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:22,190
coexistence by the way they'll require
compromise on the Israeli side too and

2596
00:53:22,190 --> 00:53:22,200
compromise on the Israeli side too and
 

2597
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:25,730
compromise on the Israeli side too and
then you know I'm perfectly cognizant of

2598
00:53:25,730 --> 00:53:25,740
then you know I'm perfectly cognizant of
 

2599
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:27,109
then you know I'm perfectly cognizant of
that and willing to do that but I think

2600
00:53:27,109 --> 00:53:27,119
that and willing to do that but I think
 

2601
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:29,809
that and willing to do that but I think
a realistic compromise will be struck

2602
00:53:29,809 --> 00:53:29,819
a realistic compromise will be struck
 

2603
00:53:29,819 --> 00:53:32,690
a realistic compromise will be struck
much more readily when the

2604
00:53:32,690 --> 00:53:32,700
much more readily when the
 

2605
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:35,270
much more readily when the
conflict between Israel and the Arab

2606
00:53:35,270 --> 00:53:35,280
conflict between Israel and the Arab
 

2607
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:37,370
conflict between Israel and the Arab
states the Arab world is effectively

2608
00:53:37,370 --> 00:53:37,380
states the Arab world is effectively
 

2609
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:39,589
states the Arab world is effectively
solved and I think we're on that path it

2610
00:53:39,589 --> 00:53:39,599
solved and I think we're on that path it
 

2611
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:41,630
solved and I think we're on that path it
was a conceptual change just like you

2612
00:53:41,630 --> 00:53:41,640
was a conceptual change just like you
 

2613
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:43,970
was a conceptual change just like you
know I've been involved in a few I told

2614
00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:43,980
know I've been involved in a few I told
 

2615
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:46,549
know I've been involved in a few I told
you the conceptual battle is always the

2616
00:53:46,549 --> 00:53:46,559
you the conceptual battle is always the
 

2617
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:48,349
you the conceptual battle is always the
most difficult one and you know I had to

2618
00:53:48,349 --> 00:53:48,359
most difficult one and you know I had to
 

2619
00:53:48,359 --> 00:53:50,030
most difficult one and you know I had to
fight this battle

2620
00:53:50,030 --> 00:53:50,040
fight this battle
 

2621
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:53,470
fight this battle
to convert a semi-social estate into a

2622
00:53:53,470 --> 00:53:53,480
to convert a semi-social estate into a
 

2623
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:56,690
to convert a semi-social estate into a
free market Capital estate and I have to

2624
00:53:56,690 --> 00:53:56,700
free market Capital estate and I have to
 

2625
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:58,370
free market Capital estate and I have to
say that most people today recognize the

2626
00:53:58,370 --> 00:53:58,380
say that most people today recognize the
 

2627
00:53:58,380 --> 00:54:00,170
say that most people today recognize the
power of competition and the benefits of

2628
00:54:00,170 --> 00:54:00,180
power of competition and the benefits of
 

2629
00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:03,109
power of competition and the benefits of
free markets so we also had to fight

2630
00:54:03,109 --> 00:54:03,119
free markets so we also had to fight
 

2631
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:05,150
free markets so we also had to fight
this battle that said you have to go

2632
00:54:05,150 --> 00:54:05,160
this battle that said you have to go
 

2633
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:08,349
this battle that said you have to go
through the you know the the the the

2634
00:54:08,349 --> 00:54:08,359
through the you know the the the the
 

2635
00:54:08,359 --> 00:54:12,250
through the you know the the the the
Palestinian uh uh straight

2636
00:54:12,250 --> 00:54:12,260
Palestinian uh uh straight
 

2637
00:54:12,260 --> 00:54:14,809
Palestinian uh uh straight
s-t-r-a-i-t to get to the other places

2638
00:54:14,809 --> 00:54:14,819
s-t-r-a-i-t to get to the other places
 

2639
00:54:14,819 --> 00:54:16,609
s-t-r-a-i-t to get to the other places
there's no way to avoid this you know

2640
00:54:16,609 --> 00:54:16,619
there's no way to avoid this you know
 

2641
00:54:16,619 --> 00:54:19,450
there's no way to avoid this you know
you have to go through this this uh

2642
00:54:19,450 --> 00:54:19,460
you have to go through this this uh
 

2643
00:54:19,460 --> 00:54:22,849
you have to go through this this uh
impassable pass and I think that now

2644
00:54:22,849 --> 00:54:22,859
impassable pass and I think that now
 

2645
00:54:22,859 --> 00:54:25,609
impassable pass and I think that now
people are recognizing that will go

2646
00:54:25,609 --> 00:54:25,619
people are recognizing that will go
 

2647
00:54:25,619 --> 00:54:29,030
people are recognizing that will go
around it and probably Circle back and

2648
00:54:29,030 --> 00:54:29,040
around it and probably Circle back and
 

2649
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:30,770
around it and probably Circle back and
that I think actually gives hope not

2650
00:54:30,770 --> 00:54:30,780
that I think actually gives hope not
 

2651
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:33,710
that I think actually gives hope not
only to have an Arab Israeli piece but

2652
00:54:33,710 --> 00:54:33,720
only to have an Arab Israeli piece but
 

2653
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:35,930
only to have an Arab Israeli piece but
circling back in israeli-palestinian

2654
00:54:35,930 --> 00:54:35,940
circling back in israeli-palestinian
 

2655
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:37,849
circling back in israeli-palestinian
piece and obviously this is not

2656
00:54:37,849 --> 00:54:37,859
piece and obviously this is not
 

2657
00:54:37,859 --> 00:54:39,650
piece and obviously this is not
something that you find in the you know

2658
00:54:39,650 --> 00:54:39,660
something that you find in the you know
 

2659
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:41,950
something that you find in the you know
in the sound bites and so on uh but but

2660
00:54:41,950 --> 00:54:41,960
in the sound bites and so on uh but but
 

2661
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:44,510
in the sound bites and so on uh but but
in the in the popular discussion of the

2662
00:54:44,510 --> 00:54:44,520
in the in the popular discussion of the
 

2663
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:47,329
in the in the popular discussion of the
press but that idea is permeating and I

2664
00:54:47,329 --> 00:54:47,339
press but that idea is permeating and I
 

2665
00:54:47,339 --> 00:54:48,589
press but that idea is permeating and I
think it's the right idea because I

2666
00:54:48,589 --> 00:54:48,599
think it's the right idea because I
 

2667
00:54:48,599 --> 00:54:49,790
think it's the right idea because I
think it's the only one that will work

2668
00:54:49,790 --> 00:54:49,800
think it's the only one that will work
 

2669
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:52,790
think it's the only one that will work
so expanding the circle piece just to

2670
00:54:52,790 --> 00:54:52,800
so expanding the circle piece just to
 

2671
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:55,849
so expanding the circle piece just to
linger on that requires what secretly

2672
00:54:55,849 --> 00:54:55,859
linger on that requires what secretly
 

2673
00:54:55,859 --> 00:54:57,230
linger on that requires what secretly
talking

2674
00:54:57,230 --> 00:54:57,240
talking
 

2675
00:54:57,240 --> 00:55:00,049
talking
man to man human to Human

2676
00:55:00,049 --> 00:55:00,059
man to man human to Human
 

2677
00:55:00,059 --> 00:55:02,870
man to man human to Human
uh to leaders of other nations

2678
00:55:02,870 --> 00:55:02,880
uh to leaders of other nations
 

2679
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:04,270
uh to leaders of other nations
and theoretically you're right

2680
00:55:04,270 --> 00:55:04,280
and theoretically you're right
 

2681
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:06,710
and theoretically you're right
theoretically okay

2682
00:55:06,710 --> 00:55:06,720
theoretically okay
 

2683
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:09,230
theoretically okay
well let me ask you another theoretical

2684
00:55:09,230 --> 00:55:09,240
well let me ask you another theoretical
 

2685
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:10,670
well let me ask you another theoretical
question

2686
00:55:10,670 --> 00:55:10,680
question
 

2687
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:13,390
question
um on the circle of peace

2688
00:55:13,390 --> 00:55:13,400
um on the circle of peace
 

2689
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:16,089
um on the circle of peace
as a student of History

2690
00:55:16,089 --> 00:55:16,099
as a student of History
 

2691
00:55:16,099 --> 00:55:18,770
as a student of History
looking at the ideas of War and Peace

2692
00:55:18,770 --> 00:55:18,780
looking at the ideas of War and Peace
 

2693
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:22,010
looking at the ideas of War and Peace
what do you think can achieve peace in

2694
00:55:22,010 --> 00:55:22,020
what do you think can achieve peace in
 

2695
00:55:22,020 --> 00:55:24,230
what do you think can achieve peace in
the war in Ukraine blinking on another

2696
00:55:24,230 --> 00:55:24,240
the war in Ukraine blinking on another
 

2697
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:26,930
the war in Ukraine blinking on another
part of the world if you

2698
00:55:26,930 --> 00:55:26,940
part of the world if you
 

2699
00:55:26,940 --> 00:55:30,109
part of the world if you
if you consider the fight for peace in

2700
00:55:30,109 --> 00:55:30,119
if you consider the fight for peace in
 

2701
00:55:30,119 --> 00:55:31,430
if you consider the fight for peace in
this part of the world

2702
00:55:31,430 --> 00:55:31,440
this part of the world
 

2703
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:33,890
this part of the world
how can you apply that to that other

2704
00:55:33,890 --> 00:55:33,900
how can you apply that to that other
 

2705
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:35,630
how can you apply that to that other
part of the world between Russia and

2706
00:55:35,630 --> 00:55:35,640
part of the world between Russia and
 

2707
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:38,109
part of the world between Russia and
Ukraine now

2708
00:55:38,109 --> 00:55:38,119
Ukraine now
 

2709
00:55:38,119 --> 00:55:41,569
Ukraine now
I think it's one of the

2710
00:55:41,569 --> 00:55:41,579
I think it's one of the
 

2711
00:55:41,579 --> 00:55:44,510
I think it's one of the
The Savage horrors of history and one of

2712
00:55:44,510 --> 00:55:44,520
The Savage horrors of history and one of
 

2713
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:47,450
The Savage horrors of history and one of
the great tragedies that is occurring

2714
00:55:47,450 --> 00:55:47,460
the great tragedies that is occurring
 

2715
00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:49,549
the great tragedies that is occurring
um

2716
00:55:49,549 --> 00:55:49,559

 

2717
00:55:49,559 --> 00:55:52,430

and let me say in advance that uh that

2718
00:55:52,430 --> 00:55:52,440
and let me say in advance that uh that
 

2719
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:55,309
and let me say in advance that uh that
if I have any opportunity to

2720
00:55:55,309 --> 00:55:55,319
if I have any opportunity to
 

2721
00:55:55,319 --> 00:55:59,329
if I have any opportunity to
use my uh contacts to help bring about

2722
00:55:59,329 --> 00:55:59,339
use my uh contacts to help bring about
 

2723
00:55:59,339 --> 00:56:02,870
use my uh contacts to help bring about
it into this tragedy I'll do so uh I've

2724
00:56:02,870 --> 00:56:02,880
it into this tragedy I'll do so uh I've
 

2725
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:05,329
it into this tragedy I'll do so uh I've
had I know both leaders

2726
00:56:05,329 --> 00:56:05,339
had I know both leaders
 

2727
00:56:05,339 --> 00:56:09,049
had I know both leaders
but I don't just jump in and and assume

2728
00:56:09,049 --> 00:56:09,059
but I don't just jump in and and assume
 

2729
00:56:09,059 --> 00:56:10,910
but I don't just jump in and and assume
you know if there's be a desire at a

2730
00:56:10,910 --> 00:56:10,920
you know if there's be a desire at a
 

2731
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:11,930
you know if there's be a desire at a
certain point

2732
00:56:11,930 --> 00:56:11,940
certain point
 

2733
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:14,390
certain point
because the conditions have

2734
00:56:14,390 --> 00:56:14,400
because the conditions have
 

2735
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:17,690
because the conditions have
created the possibility of

2736
00:56:17,690 --> 00:56:17,700
created the possibility of
 

2737
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:21,230
created the possibility of
helping stop this this Carnage then I'll

2738
00:56:21,230 --> 00:56:21,240
helping stop this this Carnage then I'll
 

2739
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:22,609
helping stop this this Carnage then I'll
do it and that's why I choose my words

2740
00:56:22,609 --> 00:56:22,619
do it and that's why I choose my words
 

2741
00:56:22,619 --> 00:56:24,730
do it and that's why I choose my words
carefully because I think that may be

2742
00:56:24,730 --> 00:56:24,740
carefully because I think that may be
 

2743
00:56:24,740 --> 00:56:29,030
carefully because I think that may be
the best uh uh the best thing that I

2744
00:56:29,030 --> 00:56:29,040
the best uh uh the best thing that I
 

2745
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:29,950
the best uh uh the best thing that I
could do

2746
00:56:29,950 --> 00:56:29,960
could do
 

2747
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:32,950
could do
look I I think what you see

2748
00:56:32,950 --> 00:56:32,960
look I I think what you see
 

2749
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:37,150
look I I think what you see
in Ukraine is what happens if you have

2750
00:56:37,150 --> 00:56:37,160
in Ukraine is what happens if you have
 

2751
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:40,250
in Ukraine is what happens if you have
territorial designs on a territory by a

2752
00:56:40,250 --> 00:56:40,260
territorial designs on a territory by a
 

2753
00:56:40,260 --> 00:56:42,770
territorial designs on a territory by a
country that has nuclear weapons

2754
00:56:42,770 --> 00:56:42,780
country that has nuclear weapons
 

2755
00:56:42,780 --> 00:56:46,549
country that has nuclear weapons
and that to me you see the change in the

2756
00:56:46,549 --> 00:56:46,559
and that to me you see the change in the
 

2757
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:48,770
and that to me you see the change in the
equation now

2758
00:56:48,770 --> 00:56:48,780
equation now
 

2759
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:51,530
equation now
I think that people are loath to use

2760
00:56:51,530 --> 00:56:51,540
I think that people are loath to use
 

2761
00:56:51,540 --> 00:56:53,390
I think that people are loath to use
nuclear weapons and I'm not sure that I

2762
00:56:53,390 --> 00:56:53,400
nuclear weapons and I'm not sure that I
 

2763
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:55,849
nuclear weapons and I'm not sure that I
would uh think that the the Russian side

2764
00:56:55,849 --> 00:56:55,859
would uh think that the the Russian side
 

2765
00:56:55,859 --> 00:56:58,010
would uh think that the the Russian side
would use them

2766
00:56:58,010 --> 00:56:58,020
would use them
 

2767
00:56:58,020 --> 00:56:59,930
would use them
with happy abandon I don't think that's

2768
00:56:59,930 --> 00:56:59,940
with happy abandon I don't think that's
 

2769
00:56:59,940 --> 00:57:02,829
with happy abandon I don't think that's
the cushion but you see how the whole

2770
00:57:02,829 --> 00:57:02,839
the cushion but you see how the whole
 

2771
00:57:02,839 --> 00:57:05,870
the cushion but you see how the whole
configuration changes uh when that

2772
00:57:05,870 --> 00:57:05,880
configuration changes uh when that
 

2773
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:07,910
configuration changes uh when that
happens so you have to be very careful

2774
00:57:07,910 --> 00:57:07,920
happens so you have to be very careful
 

2775
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:11,809
happens so you have to be very careful
and how you resolve this conflict so it

2776
00:57:11,809 --> 00:57:11,819
and how you resolve this conflict so it
 

2777
00:57:11,819 --> 00:57:13,130
and how you resolve this conflict so it
doesn't

2778
00:57:13,130 --> 00:57:13,140
doesn't
 

2779
00:57:13,140 --> 00:57:16,370
doesn't
uh well it does go off the rails so to

2780
00:57:16,370 --> 00:57:16,380
uh well it does go off the rails so to
 

2781
00:57:16,380 --> 00:57:18,710
uh well it does go off the rails so to
speak that's by the way the the

2782
00:57:18,710 --> 00:57:18,720
speak that's by the way the the
 

2783
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:21,250
speak that's by the way the the
corollary is here we don't want Iran

2784
00:57:21,250 --> 00:57:21,260
corollary is here we don't want Iran
 

2785
00:57:21,260 --> 00:57:24,049
corollary is here we don't want Iran
which is an aggressive force with an

2786
00:57:24,049 --> 00:57:24,059
which is an aggressive force with an
 

2787
00:57:24,059 --> 00:57:26,450
which is an aggressive force with an
unlim just aggressive ideology of

2788
00:57:26,450 --> 00:57:26,460
unlim just aggressive ideology of
 

2789
00:57:26,460 --> 00:57:27,530
unlim just aggressive ideology of
dominating

2790
00:57:27,530 --> 00:57:27,540
dominating
 

2791
00:57:27,540 --> 00:57:29,270
dominating
first the Muslim world and then

2792
00:57:29,270 --> 00:57:29,280
first the Muslim world and then
 

2793
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:31,309
first the Muslim world and then
eliminating Israel and then becoming a

2794
00:57:31,309 --> 00:57:31,319
eliminating Israel and then becoming a
 

2795
00:57:31,319 --> 00:57:34,250
eliminating Israel and then becoming a
you know Global force uh having nuclear

2796
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:34,260
you know Global force uh having nuclear
 

2797
00:57:34,260 --> 00:57:35,990
you know Global force uh having nuclear
weapons it's totally different when they

2798
00:57:35,990 --> 00:57:36,000
weapons it's totally different when they
 

2799
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,670
weapons it's totally different when they
don't have it than when they do have it

2800
00:57:37,670 --> 00:57:37,680
don't have it than when they do have it
 

2801
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:40,130
don't have it than when they do have it
and that's why one of my main goals has

2802
00:57:40,130 --> 00:57:40,140
and that's why one of my main goals has
 

2803
00:57:40,140 --> 00:57:42,710
and that's why one of my main goals has
been to prevent Iran from having the

2804
00:57:42,710 --> 00:57:42,720
been to prevent Iran from having the
 

2805
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:45,770
been to prevent Iran from having the
means to uh the means of mass

2806
00:57:45,770 --> 00:57:45,780
means to uh the means of mass
 

2807
00:57:45,780 --> 00:57:47,510
means to uh the means of mass
destruction which will be used atomic

2808
00:57:47,510 --> 00:57:47,520
destruction which will be used atomic
 

2809
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:49,549
destruction which will be used atomic
bombs which they openly say will be used

2810
00:57:49,549 --> 00:57:49,559
bombs which they openly say will be used
 

2811
00:57:49,559 --> 00:57:51,490
bombs which they openly say will be used
against us and you can understand that

2812
00:57:51,490 --> 00:57:51,500
against us and you can understand that
 

2813
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:55,730
against us and you can understand that
how to bring about an end to Ukraine

2814
00:57:55,730 --> 00:57:55,740
how to bring about an end to Ukraine
 

2815
00:57:55,740 --> 00:57:58,309
how to bring about an end to Ukraine
I have my ideas I don't think I don't

2816
00:57:58,309 --> 00:57:58,319
I have my ideas I don't think I don't
 

2817

I have my ideas I don't think I don't
think it's worthwhile uh

2818
00:58:01,390 --> 00:58:01,400
think it's worthwhile uh
 

2819
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:04,849
think it's worthwhile uh
discussing them now because they might

Vladimir zielinski and Vladimir Putin
just leaders sitting in a room

2830
00:58:15,410 --> 00:58:15,420
just leaders sitting in a room
 

2831
00:58:15,420 --> 00:58:17,450
just leaders sitting in a room
And discussing how the end of War can be

2832
00:58:17,450 --> 00:58:17,460
And discussing how the end of War can be
 

2833
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:19,069
And discussing how the end of War can be
brought about

2834
00:58:19,069 --> 00:58:19,079
brought about
 

2835
00:58:19,079 --> 00:58:21,230
brought about
I think it's a combination of that but I

2836
00:58:21,230 --> 00:58:21,240
I think it's a combination of that but I
 

2837
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:23,690
I think it's a combination of that but I
think it's the question of interest and

2838
00:58:23,690 --> 00:58:23,700
think it's the question of interest and
 

2839
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:25,849
think it's the question of interest and
uh and whether you have to get both

2840
00:58:25,849 --> 00:58:25,859
uh and whether you have to get both
 

2841
00:58:25,859 --> 00:58:27,530
uh and whether you have to get both
sides

2842
00:58:27,530 --> 00:58:27,540
sides
 

2843
00:58:27,540 --> 00:58:31,490
sides
to to a point where they

2844
00:58:31,490 --> 00:58:31,500
to to a point where they
 

2845
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:34,069
to to a point where they
think that that conversation would lead

2846
00:58:34,069 --> 00:58:34,079
think that that conversation would lead
 

2847
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:35,930
think that that conversation would lead
to something useful that I don't think

2848
00:58:35,930 --> 00:58:35,940
to something useful that I don't think
 

2849
00:58:35,940 --> 00:58:38,510
to something useful that I don't think
they're there right now what part of of

2850
00:58:38,510 --> 00:58:38,520
they're there right now what part of of
 

2851
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:41,030
they're there right now what part of of
this is just basic human ego

2852
00:58:41,030 --> 00:58:41,040
this is just basic human ego
 

2853
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:44,329
this is just basic human ego
stubbornness all of this between leaders

2854
00:58:44,329 --> 00:58:44,339
stubbornness all of this between leaders
 

2855
00:58:44,339 --> 00:58:46,130
stubbornness all of this between leaders
which is why I bring up the power of

2856
00:58:46,130 --> 00:58:46,140
which is why I bring up the power of
 

2857
00:58:46,140 --> 00:58:48,049
which is why I bring up the power of
conversation of sitting in a room

2858
00:58:48,049 --> 00:58:48,059
conversation of sitting in a room
 

2859
00:58:48,059 --> 00:58:49,910
conversation of sitting in a room
realizing we're human beings and then

2860
00:58:49,910 --> 00:58:49,920
realizing we're human beings and then
 

2861
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:51,770
realizing we're human beings and then
there's a history that connects Ukraine

2862
00:58:51,770 --> 00:58:51,780
there's a history that connects Ukraine
 

2863
00:58:51,780 --> 00:58:53,569
there's a history that connects Ukraine
and Russia yeah I don't think they're in

2864
00:58:53,569 --> 00:58:53,579
and Russia yeah I don't think they're in
 

2865
00:58:53,579 --> 00:58:55,130
and Russia yeah I don't think they're in
a position to enter a room right now

2866
00:58:55,130 --> 00:58:55,140
a position to enter a room right now
 

2867
00:58:55,140 --> 00:58:58,190
a position to enter a room right now
realistically I mean you can posit that

2868
00:58:58,190 --> 00:58:58,200
realistically I mean you can posit that
 

2869
00:58:58,200 --> 00:58:59,630
realistically I mean you can posit that
it would be good if that could happen

2870
00:58:59,630 --> 00:58:59,640
it would be good if that could happen
 

2871
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:02,390
it would be good if that could happen
but entering the room is sometimes more

2872
00:59:02,390 --> 00:59:02,400
but entering the room is sometimes more
 

2873
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:04,309
but entering the room is sometimes more
complicated than what happens when

2874
00:59:04,309 --> 00:59:04,319
complicated than what happens when
 

2875
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:05,750
complicated than what happens when
there's a lot of you know

2876
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:05,760
there's a lot of you know
 

2877
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:07,970
there's a lot of you know
pre-negotiation on the negotiation then

2878
00:59:07,970 --> 00:59:07,980
pre-negotiation on the negotiation then
 

2879
00:59:07,980 --> 00:59:09,530
pre-negotiation on the negotiation then
you negotiate endlessly on the

2880
00:59:09,530 --> 00:59:09,540
you negotiate endlessly on the
 

2881
00:59:09,540 --> 00:59:11,210
you negotiate endlessly on the
negotiation they're not even there it

2882
00:59:11,210 --> 00:59:11,220
negotiation they're not even there it
 

2883
00:59:11,220 --> 00:59:12,650
negotiation they're not even there it
took a lot of work for you to get a

2884
00:59:12,650 --> 00:59:12,660
took a lot of work for you to get a
 

2885
00:59:12,660 --> 00:59:13,730
took a lot of work for you to get a
handshake

2886
00:59:13,730 --> 00:59:13,740
handshake

in the past
it's an interesting question how did the

Mossad making contacts with them all the
time and so on but how do we break the

2910
00:59:40,789 --> 00:59:40,799
time and so on but how do we break the
 

2911
00:59:40,799 --> 00:59:43,970
time and so on but how do we break the
ice to the top level of leadership well

we broke the ice because I took a very
 

2915
00:59:46,980 --> 00:59:49,309
we broke the ice because I took a very
strong stance against Iran

00:59:49,309 --> 00:59:49,319
strong stance against Iran
 

2917
00:59:49,319 --> 00:59:52,490
strong stance against Iran
