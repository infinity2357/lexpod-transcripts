you think about maybe 4.7 4.6 4.5

126
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:15,040
you think about maybe 4.7 4.6 4.5
 

127
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,430
you think about maybe 4.7 4.6 4.5
billion years ago planet was quite hot

00:02:19,589 --> 00:02:19,599
there was a limited number of minerals
 

131
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:22,710
there was a limited number of minerals
there was some carbon some water and i

132
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:22,720
there was some carbon some water and i
 

133
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,309
there was some carbon some water and i
think that maybe it's a really simple

134
00:02:24,309 --> 00:02:24,319
think that maybe it's a really simple
 

135
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,949
think that maybe it's a really simple
set of chemistry that we we really don't

136
00:02:26,949 --> 00:02:26,959
set of chemistry that we we really don't
 

137
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:28,070
set of chemistry that we we really don't
understand

138
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:28,080
understand
 

139
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,830
understand
so that means you've got a finite number

140
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:29,840
so that means you've got a finite number
 

141
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,150
so that means you've got a finite number
of elements that are going to react very

142
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:32,160
of elements that are going to react very
 

143
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,229
of elements that are going to react very
simply with one another

144
00:02:34,229 --> 00:02:34,239
simply with one another
 

145
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,390
simply with one another
and out of that mess comes a cell so

146
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:36,400
and out of that mess comes a cell so
 

147
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,110
and out of that mess comes a cell so
literally sand turns into cells and it

148
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:39,120
literally sand turns into cells and it
 

149
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,030
literally sand turns into cells and it
seems to happen quick

150
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:41,040
seems to happen quick
 

151
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,030
seems to happen quick
so what i think i can say with some

152
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:43,040
so what i think i can say with some
 

153
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,229
so what i think i can say with some
degree of

154
00:02:44,229 --> 00:02:44,239
degree of
 

155
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:46,710
degree of
i think not certainty but curiosity

156
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:46,720
i think not certainty but curiosity
 

157
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,270
i think not certainty but curiosity
genuine curiosity is that life happened

158
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:49,280
genuine curiosity is that life happened
 

159
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,350
genuine curiosity is that life happened
fast yeah so when we say fast

160
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:53,360
fast yeah so when we say fast
 

161
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,589
fast yeah so when we say fast
this is a pretty surprising

162
00:02:55,589 --> 00:02:55,599
this is a pretty surprising
 

163
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:57,030
this is a pretty surprising
fact and maybe you can actually correct

164
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:57,040
fact and maybe you can actually correct
 

165
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,390
fact and maybe you can actually correct
me and elaborate but it seems like most

166
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:00,400
me and elaborate but it seems like most
 

167
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,470
me and elaborate but it seems like most
like 70 or 80 percent of the time that

168
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:02,480
like 70 or 80 percent of the time that
 

169
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,990
like 70 or 80 percent of the time that
earth has been around there's been life

170
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:04,000
earth has been around there's been life
 

171
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,589
earth has been around there's been life
on it like some very significant

172
00:03:05,589 --> 00:03:05,599
on it like some very significant
 

173
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,149
on it like some very significant
percentage so when you say fast like the

174
00:03:08,149 --> 00:03:08,159
percentage so when you say fast like the
 

175
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:11,270
percentage so when you say fast like the
slow part is from single cell

176
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:11,280
slow part is from single cell
 

177
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,110
slow part is from single cell
or from bacteria to some more

178
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:13,120
or from bacteria to some more
 

179
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,110
or from bacteria to some more
complicated organism it seems like most

180
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:15,120
complicated organism it seems like most
 

181
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,430
complicated organism it seems like most
of the time that earth has been around

182
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:17,440
of the time that earth has been around
 

183
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,350
of the time that earth has been around
it's been single cell

184
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:19,360
it's been single cell
 

185
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,910
it's been single cell
or like very basic organisms like a

186
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:21,920
or like very basic organisms like a
 

187
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,750
or like very basic organisms like a
couple billion years but yeah you're

188
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:23,760
couple billion years but yeah you're
 

189
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,910
couple billion years but yeah you're
right that that's really i recently kind

190
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:25,920
right that that's really i recently kind
 

191
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,670
right that that's really i recently kind
of revisited

192
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:27,680
of revisited
 

193
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,910
of revisited
our history and saw this

194
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:29,920
our history and saw this
 

195
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,710
our history and saw this
and

196
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:30,720
and
 

197
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,869
and
i was just looking at the timeline wait

198
00:03:32,869 --> 00:03:32,879
i was just looking at the timeline wait
 

199
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,030
i was just looking at the timeline wait
a minute like how did life just spring

200
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:35,040
a minute like how did life just spring
 

201
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,229
a minute like how did life just spring
up so quickly like really quickly that

202
00:03:38,229 --> 00:03:38,239
up so quickly like really quickly that
 

203
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:39,670
up so quickly like really quickly that
makes me think

204
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:39,680
makes me think
 

205
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,149
makes me think
that it really wanted to like

206
00:03:42,149 --> 00:03:42,159
that it really wanted to like
 

207
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,309
that it really wanted to like
put another way it's very easy for life

208
00:03:44,309 --> 00:03:44,319
put another way it's very easy for life
 

209
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:47,430
put another way it's very easy for life
to spring yeah i agree i think it's much

210
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:47,440
to spring yeah i agree i think it's much
 

211
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,350
to spring yeah i agree i think it's much
more inevitable and i think um i try to

212
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:51,360
more inevitable and i think um i try to
 

213
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,429
more inevitable and i think um i try to
kind of not provoke but try and push

214
00:03:53,429 --> 00:03:53,439
kind of not provoke but try and push
 

215
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,110
kind of not provoke but try and push
chemists to think about because chemists

216
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:55,120
chemists to think about because chemists
 

217
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,710
chemists to think about because chemists
are part are central to this problem

218
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:56,720
are part are central to this problem
 

219
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,670
are part are central to this problem
right

220
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:57,680
right
 

221
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,350
right
of understanding the origin of life on

222
00:03:59,350 --> 00:03:59,360
of understanding the origin of life on
 

223
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,869
of understanding the origin of life on
earth at least because we're made of

224
00:04:00,869 --> 00:04:00,879
earth at least because we're made of
 

225
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:03,190
earth at least because we're made of
made of chemistry but i wonder if the

226
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:03,200
made of chemistry but i wonder if the
 

227
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,630
made of chemistry but i wonder if the
origin of life

228
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:04,640
origin of life
 

229
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,630
origin of life
on a planet or so the emergence of life

230
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:06,640
on a planet or so the emergence of life
 

231
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,589
on a planet or so the emergence of life
on the planet is as

232
00:04:09,589 --> 00:04:09,599

 

233
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,710

common as the formation of a star

234
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:12,720
common as the formation of a star
 

235
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,270
common as the formation of a star
and if you start framing it in that way

236
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:15,280
and if you start framing it in that way
 

237
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,469
and if you start framing it in that way
it allows you to then look at the

238
00:04:16,469 --> 00:04:16,479
it allows you to then look at the
 

239
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:18,870
it allows you to then look at the
universe slightly differently because

240
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:18,880
universe slightly differently because
 

241
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,550
universe slightly differently because
um and we can get into this i think in

242
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:20,560
um and we can get into this i think in
 

243
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,189
um and we can get into this i think in
quite some detail but i think i to to

244
00:04:23,189 --> 00:04:23,199
quite some detail but i think i to to
 

245
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,270
quite some detail but i think i to to
come back to your question i have

246
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:25,280
come back to your question i have
 

247
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,830
come back to your question i have
little idea of how life got started but

248
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:27,840
little idea of how life got started but
 

249
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,430
little idea of how life got started but
i know it was simple

250
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:29,440
i know it was simple
 

251
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,310
i know it was simple
and i know that the process of selection

252
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:32,320
and i know that the process of selection
 

253
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,469
and i know that the process of selection
had to occur before

254
00:04:34,469 --> 00:04:34,479
had to occur before
 

255
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:36,629
had to occur before
the biology was established so that

256
00:04:36,629 --> 00:04:36,639
the biology was established so that
 

257
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,230
the biology was established so that
selection

258
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:38,240
selection
 

259
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,510
selection
built the framework from which life

260
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:41,520
built the framework from which life
 

261
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,510
built the framework from which life
kind of grew in complexity and

262
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:43,520
kind of grew in complexity and
 

263
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,189
kind of grew in complexity and
capability and functionality and

264
00:04:45,189 --> 00:04:45,199
capability and functionality and
 

265
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,110
capability and functionality and
autonomy and i think these are all

266
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:47,120
autonomy and i think these are all
 

267
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,629
autonomy and i think these are all
really important words that we can

268
00:04:48,629 --> 00:04:48,639
really important words that we can
 

269
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,629
really important words that we can
unpack over the next

270
00:04:50,629 --> 00:04:50,639
unpack over the next
 

271
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,110
unpack over the next
while can you say all the words again so

272
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:53,120
while can you say all the words again so
 

273
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,430
while can you say all the words again so
he says selection

274
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:55,440
he says selection
 

275
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,430
he says selection
so natural selection

276
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:57,440
so natural selection
 

277
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,230
so natural selection
eight the original a b testing and so

278
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:00,240
eight the original a b testing and so
 

279
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,749
eight the original a b testing and so
and then complexity

280
00:05:01,749 --> 00:05:01,759
and then complexity
 

281
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,070
and then complexity
and then or the degree of autonomy and

282
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:04,080
and then or the degree of autonomy and
 

283
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,469
and then or the degree of autonomy and
sophistication because i think that

284
00:05:06,469 --> 00:05:06,479
sophistication because i think that
 

285
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:09,990
sophistication because i think that
people misunderstand what life is um

286
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:10,000
people misunderstand what life is um
 

287
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,990
people misunderstand what life is um
some people say that life is a cell and

288
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:12,000
some people say that life is a cell and
 

289
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,469
some people say that life is a cell and
some people that say that life is a

290
00:05:14,469 --> 00:05:14,479
some people that say that life is a
 

291
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:18,310
some people that say that life is a
a virus or life is a you know an on off

292
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:18,320
a virus or life is a you know an on off
 

293
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,590
a virus or life is a you know an on off
switch

294
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:19,600
switch
 

295
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,670
switch
i don't think it's that life is the

296
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:21,680
i don't think it's that life is the
 

297
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,870
i don't think it's that life is the
universe developing a memory

298
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:24,880
universe developing a memory
 

299
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,430
universe developing a memory
and the laws of physics and the way well

300
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:27,440
and the laws of physics and the way well
 

301
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,270
and the laws of physics and the way well
there are no laws of physics physics is

302
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:29,280
there are no laws of physics physics is
 

303
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,590
there are no laws of physics physics is
just memory free stuff

304
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:31,600
just memory free stuff
 

305
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,629
just memory free stuff
right

306
00:05:32,629 --> 00:05:32,639
right
 

307
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,469
right
there's only a finite number of ways you

308
00:05:34,469 --> 00:05:34,479
there's only a finite number of ways you
 

309
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:37,350
there's only a finite number of ways you
can arrange the fundamental particles to

310
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:37,360
can arrange the fundamental particles to
 

311
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,710
can arrange the fundamental particles to
do the things life is the universe

312
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:40,720
do the things life is the universe
 

313
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,390
do the things life is the universe
developing

314
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:42,400
developing
 

315
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,629
developing
a memory so it's like

316
00:05:44,629 --> 00:05:44,639
a memory so it's like
 

317
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,230
a memory so it's like
sewing

318
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:46,240
sewing
 

319
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,189
sewing
a piece of art slowly

320
00:05:49,189 --> 00:05:49,199
a piece of art slowly
 

321
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:54,629
a piece of art slowly
and then you can look back at it so

322
00:05:54,629 --> 00:05:54,639

 

323
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,629

so there's a stickiness to life it's

324
00:05:56,629 --> 00:05:56,639
so there's a stickiness to life it's
 

325
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,550
so there's a stickiness to life it's
like universe doing stuff

326
00:05:58,550 --> 00:05:58,560
like universe doing stuff
 

327
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,710
like universe doing stuff
and when you say memory it's like

328
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:00,720
and when you say memory it's like
 

329
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,309
and when you say memory it's like
there's a stickiness to a bunch of the

330
00:06:02,309 --> 00:06:02,319
there's a stickiness to a bunch of the
 

331
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:04,070
there's a stickiness to a bunch of the
stuff that's building together yeah so

332
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:04,080
stuff that's building together yeah so
 

333
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,189
stuff that's building together yeah so
like you can

334
00:06:05,189 --> 00:06:05,199
like you can
 

335
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,390
like you can
in a stable way like uh

336
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:08,400
in a stable way like uh
 

337
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,550
in a stable way like uh
trace back the complexity

338
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:10,560
trace back the complexity
 

339
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,430
trace back the complexity
and that tells a coherent story yeah and

340
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:13,440
and that tells a coherent story yeah and
 

341
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,270
and that tells a coherent story yeah and
i think yeah okay

342
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:15,280
i think yeah okay
 

343
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,070
i think yeah okay
that's by the way very poetic

344
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:18,080
that's by the way very poetic
 

345
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,590
that's by the way very poetic
and beautiful

346
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:19,600
and beautiful
 

347
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,790
and beautiful
life is the universe developing a memory

348
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:22,800
life is the universe developing a memory
 

349
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,070
life is the universe developing a memory
[Music]

350
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:24,080
[Music]
 

351
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,150
[Music]
okay and then there's autonomy you said

352
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:26,160
okay and then there's autonomy you said
 

353
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,710
okay and then there's autonomy you said
complexity we'll talk about but

354
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:28,720
complexity we'll talk about but
 

355
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,150
complexity we'll talk about but
it's a really interesting idea that

356
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:30,160
it's a really interesting idea that
 

357
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,430
it's a really interesting idea that
selection preceded biology

358
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:33,440
selection preceded biology
 

359
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,990
selection preceded biology
yeah i think yes so what first of all

360
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:36,000
yeah i think yes so what first of all
 

361
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,390
yeah i think yes so what first of all
what is chemistry

362
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:38,400
what is chemistry
 

363
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,270
what is chemistry
like does sand still count as chemistry

364
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:41,280
like does sand still count as chemistry
 

365
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,110
like does sand still count as chemistry
sure i mean as a chemist they can't

366
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:43,120
sure i mean as a chemist they can't
 

367
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,950
sure i mean as a chemist they can't
carry a chemist if i'm allowed a card i

368
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:44,960
carry a chemist if i'm allowed a card i
 

369
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,629
carry a chemist if i'm allowed a card i
don't know i don't know what i am most

370
00:06:46,629 --> 00:06:46,639
don't know i don't know what i am most
 

371
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,350
don't know i don't know what i am most
days what is the card made of

372
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:49,360
days what is the card made of
 

373
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,029
days what is the card made of
what's the chemical composition of the

374
00:06:51,029 --> 00:06:51,039
what's the chemical composition of the
 

375
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:51,990
what's the chemical composition of the
card

376
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:52,000
card
 

377
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,909
card
yeah so um what is chemistry well

378
00:06:53,909 --> 00:06:53,919
yeah so um what is chemistry well
 

379
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:55,589
yeah so um what is chemistry well
chemistry is the thing that happens when

380
00:06:55,589 --> 00:06:55,599
chemistry is the thing that happens when
 

381
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:56,790
chemistry is the thing that happens when
you bring electrons together and you

382
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:56,800
you bring electrons together and you
 

383
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,230
you bring electrons together and you
form bonds

384
00:06:58,230 --> 00:06:58,240
form bonds
 

385
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,469
form bonds
so bonds well i say to people when they

386
00:07:00,469 --> 00:07:00,479
so bonds well i say to people when they
 

387
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,469
so bonds well i say to people when they
talk about life elsewhere

388
00:07:02,469 --> 00:07:02,479
talk about life elsewhere
 

389
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:03,589
talk about life elsewhere
and i just say well there's bonds

390
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:03,599
and i just say well there's bonds
 

391
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:05,830
and i just say well there's bonds
there's hope because bonds allow you to

392
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:05,840
there's hope because bonds allow you to
 

393
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,670
there's hope because bonds allow you to
get heterogeneity they allow you to

394
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:07,680
get heterogeneity they allow you to
 

395
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,309
get heterogeneity they allow you to
record those memories or at least on

396
00:07:10,309 --> 00:07:10,319
record those memories or at least on
 

397
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:13,270
record those memories or at least on
earth um you could imagine uh

398
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:13,280
earth um you could imagine uh
 

399
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,430
earth um you could imagine uh
you know a stannis left lemtrey world

400
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:15,440
you know a stannis left lemtrey world
 

401
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,270
you know a stannis left lemtrey world
where you might have life emerging or

402
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:17,280
where you might have life emerging or
 

403
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,589
where you might have life emerging or
intelligence emerging before life that

404
00:07:19,589 --> 00:07:19,599
intelligence emerging before life that
 

405
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:21,510
intelligence emerging before life that
may be something to on like solaris or

406
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:21,520
may be something to on like solaris or
 

407
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,990
may be something to on like solaris or
something but you know to get to

408
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:24,000
something but you know to get to
 

409
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,629
something but you know to get to
selection if you can form if atoms can

410
00:07:26,629 --> 00:07:26,639
selection if you can form if atoms can
 

411
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,390
selection if you can form if atoms can
combine and form bonds

412
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:28,400
combine and form bonds
 

413
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,029
combine and form bonds
those bonds uh those atoms can bond to

414
00:07:31,029 --> 00:07:31,039
those bonds uh those atoms can bond to
 

415
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:32,790
those bonds uh those atoms can bond to
different elements and those and those

416
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:32,800
different elements and those and those
 

417
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,990
different elements and those and those
molecules

418
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:34,000
molecules
 

419
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,589
molecules
will have different identities and

420
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:35,599
will have different identities and
 

421
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:37,110
will have different identities and
interact with each other differently and

422
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:37,120
interact with each other differently and
 

423
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,029
interact with each other differently and
then you can start to have some degree

424
00:07:39,029 --> 00:07:39,039
then you can start to have some degree
 

425
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:41,189
then you can start to have some degree
of causation or interaction

426
00:07:41,189 --> 00:07:41,199
of causation or interaction
 

427
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,430
of causation or interaction
and then selection and then put and then

428
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:43,440
and then selection and then put and then
 

429
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,950
and then selection and then put and then
existence

430
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:44,960
existence
 

431
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,510
existence
and then you you you go you go up the

432
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:47,520
and then you you you go you go up the
 

433
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,309
and then you you you go you go up the
kind of the path of complexity and so at

434
00:07:50,309 --> 00:07:50,319
kind of the path of complexity and so at
 

435
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:51,749
kind of the path of complexity and so at
least on earth

436
00:07:51,749 --> 00:07:51,759
least on earth
 

437
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:53,510
least on earth
as we know it there are there is a

438
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:53,520
as we know it there are there is a
 

439
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,110
as we know it there are there is a
sufficient pool of

440
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:55,120
sufficient pool of
 

441
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,749
sufficient pool of
available chemicals to start create

442
00:07:57,749 --> 00:07:57,759
available chemicals to start create
 

443
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:00,150
available chemicals to start create
searching that combinatorial space of

444
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:00,160
searching that combinatorial space of
 

445
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,350
searching that combinatorial space of
bonds

446
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:01,360
bonds
 

447
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,029
bonds
so okay this is a really interesting

448
00:08:03,029 --> 00:08:03,039
so okay this is a really interesting
 

449
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:06,629
so okay this is a really interesting
question let's let's lay it out so bonds

450
00:08:06,629 --> 00:08:06,639
question let's let's lay it out so bonds
 

451
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:09,990
question let's let's lay it out so bonds
almost like cards we say there's bonds

452
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:10,000
almost like cards we say there's bonds
 

453
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,430
almost like cards we say there's bonds
there is uh

454
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:11,440
there is uh
 

455
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,189
there is uh
life there's intelligence there's

456
00:08:13,189 --> 00:08:13,199
life there's intelligence there's
 

457
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,510
life there's intelligence there's
consciousness and what you just made me

458
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:15,520
consciousness and what you just made me
 

459
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,589
consciousness and what you just made me
realize

460
00:08:17,589 --> 00:08:17,599
realize
 

461
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:21,029
realize
is um

462
00:08:21,029 --> 00:08:21,039

 

463
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,189

those can emerge or let's put bonds

464
00:08:23,189 --> 00:08:23,199
those can emerge or let's put bonds
 

465
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:27,029
those can emerge or let's put bonds
aside uh those can emerge in any order

466
00:08:27,029 --> 00:08:27,039
aside uh those can emerge in any order
 

467
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,670
aside uh those can emerge in any order
that's that's really brilliant so

468
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:29,680
that's that's really brilliant so
 

469
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,230
that's that's really brilliant so
intelligence can come before life it's

470
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:32,240
intelligence can come before life it's
 

471
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:32,949
intelligence can come before life it's
like

472
00:08:32,949 --> 00:08:32,959
like
 

473
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:35,829
like
pan psychists believe that consciousness

474
00:08:35,829 --> 00:08:35,839
pan psychists believe that consciousness
 

475
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,630
pan psychists believe that consciousness
com i guess comes before

476
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:38,640
com i guess comes before
 

477
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,750
com i guess comes before
life

478
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:39,760
life
 

479
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,509
life
and before intelligence

480
00:08:41,509 --> 00:08:41,519
and before intelligence
 

481
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,350
and before intelligence
so consciousness like permeates all

482
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:43,360
so consciousness like permeates all
 

483
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,949
so consciousness like permeates all
matter it's some kind of fabric of

484
00:08:44,949 --> 00:08:44,959
matter it's some kind of fabric of
 

485
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:47,350
matter it's some kind of fabric of
reality okay so like within this

486
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:47,360
reality okay so like within this
 

487
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,110
reality okay so like within this
framework you can kind of arrange

488
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:49,120
framework you can kind of arrange
 

489
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,350
framework you can kind of arrange
everything but you need to have the

490
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:51,360
everything but you need to have the
 

491
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,269
everything but you need to have the
bonds

492
00:08:53,269 --> 00:08:53,279
bonds
 

493
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,590
bonds
um that's precedes everything else oh

494
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:55,600
um that's precedes everything else oh
 

495
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,430
um that's precedes everything else oh
and the other thing is selection

496
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:57,440
and the other thing is selection
 

497
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,750
and the other thing is selection
so like the mechanism of selection

498
00:08:59,750 --> 00:08:59,760
so like the mechanism of selection
 

499
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,110
so like the mechanism of selection

just start again and ask the question
 

581
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,230
just start again and ask the question
and then do it with an experiment i

582
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:22,240
and then do it with an experiment i
 

583
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,670
and then do it with an experiment i
always wanted to be a theoretician

584
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:23,680
always wanted to be a theoretician
 

585
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,350
always wanted to be a theoretician
growing up but i just didn't have the

586
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:25,360
growing up but i just didn't have the
 

587
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,389
growing up but i just didn't have the
just didn't have the intellectual

588
00:10:26,389 --> 00:10:26,399
just didn't have the intellectual
 

589
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:29,430
just didn't have the intellectual
capability but i i was able to think of

590
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:29,440
capability but i i was able to think of
 

591
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,949
capability but i i was able to think of
experiments in my head i could then do

592
00:10:30,949 --> 00:10:30,959
experiments in my head i could then do
 

593
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,389
experiments in my head i could then do
in my lab or in that you know when i was

594
00:10:32,389 --> 00:10:32,399
in my lab or in that you know when i was
 

595
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,630
in my lab or in that you know when i was
a with a child

596
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:34,640
a with a child
 

597
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,430
a with a child
outside and then those experiments in my

598
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:37,440
outside and then those experiments in my
 

599
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,190
outside and then those experiments in my
head and then outside reinforce one

600
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:39,200
head and then outside reinforce one
 

601
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,030
head and then outside reinforce one
another so i think that's a very good

602
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:41,040
another so i think that's a very good
 

603
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,470
another so i think that's a very good
way of kind of

604
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:42,480
way of kind of
 

605
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,550
way of kind of
grounding the science right well that's

606
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:44,560
grounding the science right well that's
 

607
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,750
grounding the science right well that's
the nice way to think about

608
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:45,760
the nice way to think about
 

609
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,750
the nice way to think about
theoreticians is they're just

610
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:47,760
theoreticians is they're just
 

611
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,509
theoreticians is they're just
people who run experiments in their head

612
00:10:49,509 --> 00:10:49,519
people who run experiments in their head
 

613
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,030
people who run experiments in their head
i mean that's exactly what einstein did

614
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:51,040
i mean that's exactly what einstein did
 

615
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,870
i mean that's exactly what einstein did
right and but you were also capable of

616
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:52,880
right and but you were also capable of
 

617
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,310
right and but you were also capable of
doing that in the head

618
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:54,320
doing that in the head
 

619
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,310
doing that in the head
in your head inside your head and in the

620
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:56,320
in your head inside your head and in the
 

621
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,750
in your head inside your head and in the
real world and the connection between

622
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:57,760
real world and the connection between
 

623
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,269

the two

624
00:10:59,269 --> 00:10:59,279
the two
 

625
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:00,630
the two
is when you first discovered your

have to think about because you always

652
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:28,880
have to think about because you always
 

653
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,710
have to think about because you always
struggle about the role of ego in life

00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,069
that's
that's so nice to think about

662
00:11:36,069 --> 00:11:36,079
that's so nice to think about
 

663
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:37,750
that's so nice to think about
don't think about the size of ego the

664
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:37,760
don't think about the size of ego the
 

665
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,430
don't think about the size of ego the
absolute size of ego think about the

666
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:39,440
absolute size of ego think about the
 

667
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,389
absolute size of ego think about the
relative size of ego to the other the

668
00:11:42,389 --> 00:11:42,399
relative size of ego to the other the
 

669
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,710
relative size of ego to the other the
other horses pulling at you and if the

670
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:44,720
other horses pulling at you and if the
 

671
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,310
other horses pulling at you and if the
curiosity one is bigger then uh ego will

672
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:48,320
curiosity one is bigger then uh ego will
 

673
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,790
curiosity one is bigger then uh ego will
do just fine and make you uh fun to talk

674
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:50,800
do just fine and make you uh fun to talk
 

675
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,790
do just fine and make you uh fun to talk
to anyway so those are the two

676
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:52,800
to anyway so those are the two
 

677
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,310
to anyway so those are the two
superpowers how do those connect to

678
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:54,320
superpowers how do those connect to
 

679
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,150
superpowers how do those connect to
natural selection or in selection and

680
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:56,160
natural selection or in selection and
 

681
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,350
natural selection or in selection and
bonds and

682
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:57,360
bonds and
 

683
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,910
bonds and
i forgot already life and consciousness

684
00:11:59,910 --> 00:11:59,920
i forgot already life and consciousness
 

685
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,430
i forgot already life and consciousness
so that we're going back to selection in

686
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:01,440
so that we're going back to selection in
 

687
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,670
so that we're going back to selection in
the universe and origin of life on earth

688
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:03,680
the universe and origin of life on earth
 

689
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,710
the universe and origin of life on earth
i mean um selection has a for i'm

690
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:06,720
i mean um selection has a for i'm
 

691
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,389
i mean um selection has a for i'm
convinced that selection is a force in

692
00:12:08,389 --> 00:12:08,399
convinced that selection is a force in
 

693
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,629
convinced that selection is a force in
the universe not me not a fundamental

694
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:10,639
the universe not me not a fundamental
 

695
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:13,509
the universe not me not a fundamental
force but a but a directing but it is a

696
00:12:13,509 --> 00:12:13,519
force but a but a directing but it is a
 

697
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,750
force but a but a directing but it is a
directing force because existence

698
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:15,760
directing force because existence
 

699
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,629
directing force because existence
although

700
00:12:16,629 --> 00:12:16,639
although
 

701
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:19,190
although
um existence appears to be the default

702
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:19,200
um existence appears to be the default
 

703
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,550
um existence appears to be the default
um the existence of what why does

704
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:22,560
um the existence of what why does
 

705
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,790
um the existence of what why does
um we can get to this later i think but

706
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:24,800
um we can get to this later i think but
 

707
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,389
um we can get to this later i think but
it's amazing that

708
00:12:26,389 --> 00:12:26,399
it's amazing that
 

709
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:29,030
it's amazing that
the discreet things exist

710
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:29,040
the discreet things exist
 

711
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,269
the discreet things exist
and you know you see this cup it's not

712
00:12:31,269 --> 00:12:31,279
and you know you see this cup it's not
 

713
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:33,590
and you know you see this cup it's not
the you know sexiest cup in the world

714
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:33,600
the you know sexiest cup in the world
 

715
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,590
the you know sexiest cup in the world
but it's pretty functional this cup um

716
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:37,600
but it's pretty functional this cup um
 

717
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,190
but it's pretty functional this cup um
the complexity of this cup isn't just in

718
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:39,200
the complexity of this cup isn't just in
 

719
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,949
the complexity of this cup isn't just in
the object it is literally the lineage

720
00:12:40,949 --> 00:12:40,959
the object it is literally the lineage
 

721
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:42,790
the object it is literally the lineage
of people making cups and recognizing

722
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:42,800
of people making cups and recognizing
 

723
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,710
of people making cups and recognizing
that seeing that in their head making an

724
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:44,720
that seeing that in their head making an
 

725
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,150
that seeing that in their head making an
abstraction of a cup and then making a

726
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:46,160
abstraction of a cup and then making a
 

727
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,110
abstraction of a cup and then making a
different one

728
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:47,120
different one
 

729
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:47,910
different one
so

730
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:47,920
so
 

731
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,310
so
i wonder how many billions of cups

732
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:50,320
i wonder how many billions of cups
 

733
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,949
i wonder how many billions of cups
have you know come before this one and

734
00:12:52,949 --> 00:12:52,959
have you know come before this one and
 

735
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:54,389
have you know come before this one and
that's the process of selection and

736
00:12:54,389 --> 00:12:54,399
that's the process of selection and
 

737
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,069
that's the process of selection and
existence and the only reason the cup is

738
00:12:56,069 --> 00:12:56,079
existence and the only reason the cup is
 

739
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:57,430
existence and the only reason the cup is
still used is quite useful i like the

740
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:57,440
still used is quite useful i like the
 

741
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,190
still used is quite useful i like the
handle you know it's convenient so i

742
00:12:59,190 --> 00:12:59,200
handle you know it's convenient so i
 

743
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,550
handle you know it's convenient so i
don't die i keep hydration um and so

744
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:02,560
don't die i keep hydration um and so
 

745
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,150
don't die i keep hydration um and so
i think we are missing something

746
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:04,160
i think we are missing something
 

747
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,829
i think we are missing something
fundamental in the universe about

748
00:13:05,829 --> 00:13:05,839
fundamental in the universe about
 

749
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:08,550
fundamental in the universe about
selection and i think what biology is is

750
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:08,560
selection and i think what biology is is
 

751
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,790
selection and i think what biology is is
a is a selection

752
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:10,800
a is a selection
 

753
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,470
a is a selection
amplifier

754
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:12,480
amplifier
 

755
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,230
amplifier
and that the this is where autonomy

756
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:14,240
and that the this is where autonomy
 

757
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,069
and that the this is where autonomy
comes in and actually i think that how

758
00:13:16,069 --> 00:13:16,079
comes in and actually i think that how
 

759
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,389
comes in and actually i think that how
humanity is going to humans and

760
00:13:18,389 --> 00:13:18,399
humanity is going to humans and
 

761
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:20,949
humanity is going to humans and
and autonomous robots or whatever we're

762
00:13:20,949 --> 00:13:20,959
and autonomous robots or whatever we're
 

763
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:22,310
and autonomous robots or whatever we're
going to call them in the future we'll

764
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:22,320
going to call them in the future we'll
 

765
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,110
going to call them in the future we'll
we'll supercharge that even further so

766
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:25,120
we'll supercharge that even further so
 

767
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,629
we'll supercharge that even further so
selection is happening in the universe

768
00:13:26,629 --> 00:13:26,639
selection is happening in the universe
 

769
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,710
selection is happening in the universe
but if you look in the asteroid belt

770
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:28,720
but if you look in the asteroid belt
 

771
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,190
but if you look in the asteroid belt
selection if objects are being kicked in

772
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:31,200
selection if objects are being kicked in
 

773
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,590
selection if objects are being kicked in
and out the asteroid belt um those

774
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:33,600
and out the asteroid belt um those
 

775
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,190
and out the asteroid belt um those
trajectories are quite complex you don't

776
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:35,200
trajectories are quite complex you don't
 

777
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,389
trajectories are quite complex you don't
really look at that as productive

778
00:13:36,389 --> 00:13:36,399
really look at that as productive
 

779
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,150
really look at that as productive
selection because it's not doing

780
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:38,160
selection because it's not doing
 

781
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,230
selection because it's not doing
anything to improve its function but is

782
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:40,240
anything to improve its function but is
 

783
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,189
anything to improve its function but is
it the

784
00:13:41,189 --> 00:13:41,199
it the
 

785
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:43,509
it the
asteroid belt has existed for some time

786
00:13:43,509 --> 00:13:43,519
asteroid belt has existed for some time
 

787
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:45,509
asteroid belt has existed for some time
so there is some selection going on but

788
00:13:45,509 --> 00:13:45,519
so there is some selection going on but
 

789
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:49,350
so there is some selection going on but
the functionality is is somewhat limited

790
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:49,360
the functionality is is somewhat limited
 

791
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,269
the functionality is is somewhat limited
on earth

792
00:13:51,269 --> 00:13:51,279
on earth
 

793
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:53,350
on earth
at the formation of earth

794
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:53,360
at the formation of earth
 

795
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,590
at the formation of earth
interaction of chemicals and molecules

796
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:55,600
interaction of chemicals and molecules
 

797
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,150
interaction of chemicals and molecules
in the environment gave selection and

798
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:58,160
in the environment gave selection and
 

799
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,350
in the environment gave selection and
then things could happen because you

800
00:13:59,350 --> 00:13:59,360
then things could happen because you
 

801
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,829
then things could happen because you
could think about in chemistry we could

802
00:14:01,829 --> 00:14:01,839
could think about in chemistry we could
 

803
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:03,269
could think about in chemistry we could
have an infinite number of reactions

804
00:14:03,269 --> 00:14:03,279
have an infinite number of reactions
 

805
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:05,030
have an infinite number of reactions
happen but they don't all all the

806
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:05,040
happen but they don't all all the
 

807
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,550
happen but they don't all all the
reactions are allowed to happen don't

808
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:06,560
reactions are allowed to happen don't
 

809
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,829
reactions are allowed to happen don't
happen why because they're energy

810
00:14:07,829 --> 00:14:07,839
happen why because they're energy
 

811
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:08,870
happen why because they're energy
barriers

812
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:08,880
barriers
 

813
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,750
barriers
so

814
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:09,760
so
 

815
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,030
so
there must be some things called

816
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:11,040
there must be some things called
 

817
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,710
there must be some things called
catalysts out there or

818
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:12,720
catalysts out there or
 

819
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,030
catalysts out there or
there are bits of minerals that when two

820
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:15,040
there are bits of minerals that when two
 

821
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,870
there are bits of minerals that when two
molecules get together in that mineral

822
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:16,880
molecules get together in that mineral
 

823
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,470
molecules get together in that mineral
it lowers the energy barrier for the

824
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:18,480
it lowers the energy barrier for the
 

825
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,470
it lowers the energy barrier for the
reaction and so the reaction is is

826
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:20,480
reaction and so the reaction is is
 

827
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,310
reaction and so the reaction is is
promoted so suddenly you get one

828
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:22,320
promoted so suddenly you get one
 

829
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,310
promoted so suddenly you get one
reaction over another

830
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:24,320
reaction over another
 

831
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,150
reaction over another
series of possibilities occurring that

832
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:26,160
series of possibilities occurring that
 

833
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,230
series of possibilities occurring that
makes a particular molecule and this

834
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:28,240
makes a particular molecule and this
 

835
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,550
makes a particular molecule and this
keeps happening in steps and before you

836
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:30,560
keeps happening in steps and before you
 

837
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,629
keeps happening in steps and before you
know it these almost these waves as

838
00:14:32,629 --> 00:14:32,639
know it these almost these waves as
 

839
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,550
know it these almost these waves as
discrete reactions work together and you

840
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:34,560
discrete reactions work together and you
 

841
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,150
discrete reactions work together and you
start to build

842
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:36,160
start to build
 

843
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,990
start to build
a machinery

844
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:38,000
a machinery
 

845
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,829
a machinery
that that that is run by existence

846
00:14:41,829 --> 00:14:41,839
that that that is run by existence
 

847
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:42,949
that that that is run by existence
so

848
00:14:42,949 --> 00:14:42,959
so
 

849
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:45,269
so
as you you go forward in time the fact

850
00:14:45,269 --> 00:14:45,279
as you you go forward in time the fact
 

851
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:46,870
as you you go forward in time the fact
that the molecules

852
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:46,880
that the molecules
 

853
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,310
that the molecules
the bonds are getting there are more

854
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:48,320
the bonds are getting there are more
 

855
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,910
the bonds are getting there are more
bonds in a molecule there's more

856
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:49,920
bonds in a molecule there's more
 

857
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,750
bonds in a molecule there's more
function there's more capability for

858
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:51,760
function there's more capability for
 

859
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,110
function there's more capability for
this molecule to interact with other

860
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:53,120
this molecule to interact with other
 

861
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,670
this molecule to interact with other
molecules to redirect them it's like a

862
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:55,680
molecules to redirect them it's like a
 

863
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,990
molecules to redirect them it's like a
series of little and i don't want to use

864
00:14:57,990 --> 00:14:58,000
series of little and i don't want to use
 

865
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,350
series of little and i don't want to use
this term

866
00:14:59,350 --> 00:14:59,360
this term
 

867
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,949
this term
too much but it's almost thinking about

868
00:15:00,949 --> 00:15:00,959
too much but it's almost thinking about
 

869
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:04,470
too much but it's almost thinking about
the the simplest von neumann constructor

870
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:04,480
the the simplest von neumann constructor
 

871
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,069
the the simplest von neumann constructor
that's the simplest molecule that could

872
00:15:06,069 --> 00:15:06,079
that's the simplest molecule that could
 

873
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:07,430
that's the simplest molecule that could
build a more complicated molecule to

874
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:07,440
build a more complicated molecule to
 

875
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,030
build a more complicated molecule to
build a more complicated molecule and

876
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:09,040
build a more complicated molecule and
 

877
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,470
build a more complicated molecule and
before you know it when that more

878
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:10,480
before you know it when that more
 

879
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,990
before you know it when that more
complicated molecule can act on the

880
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:12,000
complicated molecule can act on the
 

881
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,629
complicated molecule can act on the
causal chain that's produced itself

882
00:15:14,629 --> 00:15:14,639
causal chain that's produced itself
 

883
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,949
causal chain that's produced itself
and change it suddenly you start to get

884
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:16,959
and change it suddenly you start to get
 

885
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:18,629
and change it suddenly you start to get
towards some kind of autonomy and that's

886
00:15:18,629 --> 00:15:18,639
towards some kind of autonomy and that's
 

887
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:21,670
towards some kind of autonomy and that's

but
 

895
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,189
but
uh who's von neumann what's the

uh who's von neumann what's the
 

897
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:30,790
uh who's von neumann what's the

00:15:41,829 --> 00:15:41,839
flying neumann constructor yeah the
 

909
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:44,470
flying neumann constructor yeah the
smallest the minimal so uh what do all

910
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:44,480
smallest the minimal so uh what do all
 

911
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,629
smallest the minimal so uh what do all
those things mean and what is uh

00:15:46,629 --> 00:15:46,639
those things mean and what is uh
 

913
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:47,910
those things mean and what is uh
uh what are we supposed to imagine when

00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:47,920
uh what are we supposed to imagine when
 

915
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,230
uh what are we supposed to imagine when
we think about the smallest uh violent

916
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:50,240
we think about the smallest uh violent

00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:55,910
john von neumann is a real hero actually
if not just me but many people i think

00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:07,360
and
 

935
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,030
and
i'm not sure if it's john von neumann or

936

but as um
 

941
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,069
but as um
i think he was hungarian

942
00:16:14,069 --> 00:16:14,079
i think he was hungarian

00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,150
i think he was hungarian
mathematician came to the us

944
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:16,160
mathematician came to the us
 

945
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,550
mathematician came to the us
and um basically got was involved in the

946
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:18,560
and um basically got was involved in the
 

947
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,069
and um basically got was involved in the
manhattan project and developing

948
00:16:20,069 --> 00:16:20,079
manhattan project and developing
 

949
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:21,350

951
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,150
computation
and um came up with all sorts of ideas

952
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:24,160
and um came up with all sorts of ideas
 

953
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,269
and um came up with all sorts of ideas
and i think it was one of the first

954
00:16:25,269 --> 00:16:25,279
and i think it was one of the first
 

955
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:26,629
and i think it was one of the first
people to come come up with cellular

956
00:16:26,629 --> 00:16:26,639
people to come come up with cellular

961
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,990
and but he really i didn't know this
little fact i think i think so and i

962
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:32,000
little fact i think i think so and i
 

963
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,990
little fact i think i think so and i
think well anyway if he didn't come up

964
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:34,000
think well anyway if he didn't come up
 

965
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,230
think well anyway if he didn't come up
with it he probably did come up with and

966
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:36,240
with it he probably did come up with and
 

967
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,670
with it he probably did come up with and
didn't write it down there was a couple

968
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:37,680
didn't write it down there was a couple
 

969
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,870
didn't write it down there was a couple
of people did at the same time and then

970
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:38,880
of people did at the same time and then
 

971
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,230
of people did at the same time and then
conway obviously took it on and then

972
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:40,240
conway obviously took it on and then
 

973
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,350
conway obviously took it on and then

without a turing machine right it's like
 

1011
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,429

00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,070
those rules look like in the world and
that's what a von neumann kind of

1026
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:32,080
that's what a von neumann kind of
 

1027
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,669
that's what a von neumann kind of

and um
 

1035
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,190
and um
and i'm really fascinated by that

1036
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:41,200
and i'm really fascinated by that
 

1037
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,870

um it's a nice model because as chemists

1044
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:48,720
um it's a nice model because as chemists
 

1045

1151
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,990
molecules that's about the number of
stars in the universe i think of the

1152
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:34,000
stars in the universe i think of the
 

1153
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,070
stars in the universe i think of the
order so there's three universe worth

1154
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:36,080
order so there's three universe worth
 

1155
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,990
order so there's three universe worth
but between somebody corrected you on

1156
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:38,000
but between somebody corrected you on
 

1157
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,310
but between somebody corrected you on
twitter yeah i'm as if i've always been

1158
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:40,320
twitter yeah i'm as if i've always been
 

1159
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,070
twitter yeah i'm as if i've always been
corrected it's a great fact but but

1160
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:42,080
corrected it's a great fact but but
 

1161
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,669
corrected it's a great fact but but
there's a lot of molecules in the water

1162
00:19:43,669 --> 00:19:43,679
there's a lot of molecules in the water
 

1163
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,150
there's a lot of molecules in the water
yeah and so and so there's a lot of so

1164
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:46,160
yeah and so and so there's a lot of so
 

1165
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,230
yeah and so and so there's a lot of so
although it's for you and me really hard

1166
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:48,240
although it's for you and me really hard
 

1167
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,470
although it's for you and me really hard
to conceive of if existence is not

1168
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:52,480
to conceive of if existence is not
 

1169
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,029
to conceive of if existence is not
the default for a long period of time

1170
00:19:55,029 --> 00:19:55,039
the default for a long period of time
 

1171
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:56,470
the default for a long period of time
because what happens is the molecules

1172
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:56,480
because what happens is the molecules
 

1173
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,029
because what happens is the molecules
get degraded so so much of the

1174
00:19:59,029 --> 00:19:59,039
get degraded so so much of the
 

1175
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:00,150
get degraded so so much of the
possibilities in the universe are just

1176
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:00,160
possibilities in the universe are just
 

1177
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,350
possibilities in the universe are just
broken back into atoms so you have this

1178
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:03,360
broken back into atoms so you have this
 

1179
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,630
broken back into atoms so you have this
this kind of

1180
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:04,640
this kind of
 

1181
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,070
this kind of
destruction of the molecules for our

1182
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:06,080
destruction of the molecules for our
 

1183
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,669
destruction of the molecules for our
chemical reactions

1184
00:20:07,669 --> 00:20:07,679
chemical reactions
 

1185
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:09,909
chemical reactions
so you only need one or two molecules to

1186
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:09,919
so you only need one or two molecules to
 

1187
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:12,230
so you only need one or two molecules to
become good at copying themselves for

1188
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:12,240
become good at copying themselves for
 

1189
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,070
become good at copying themselves for
them suddenly to then take resources in

1190
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:14,080
them suddenly to then take resources in
 

1191
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,870
them suddenly to then take resources in
the pool and start to grow and so then

1192
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:16,880
the pool and start to grow and so then
 

1193
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,110
the pool and start to grow and so then
replication actually over time when you

1194
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:19,120
replication actually over time when you
 

1195
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,950
replication actually over time when you
have bonds i think is

1196
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:20,960
have bonds i think is
 

1197
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,870
have bonds i think is
much simpler and much easier

1198
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:22,880
much simpler and much easier
 

1199
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,110
much simpler and much easier
and i even found this in my lab years

1200
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:25,120
and i even found this in my lab years

it's very simple

1212
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:38,400
it's very simple
 

1213
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,149
it's very simple
but when you add acid to it and some

there is a random small molecule with 12
 

1235
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,830
there is a random small molecule with 12

00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:09,280
it happens to template its own
 

1239
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,710
it happens to template its own
production

00:21:13,909 --> 00:21:13,919
and then by chance it templates the ring
 

1243
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:15,830
and then by chance it templates the ring
just an accident just like just an

00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:15,840
just an accident just like just an
 

1245
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,310
just an accident just like just an
absolute accident and that ring also

1246
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:18,320
absolute accident and that ring also
 

1247
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,750
absolute accident and that ring also
helps make

1248
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:19,760
helps make

00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:20,880
the small
 

1251
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,270
the small
12 mer and so you have what's called an

1252
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:23,280
12 mer and so you have what's called an
 

1253
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,430
12 mer and so you have what's called an
auto catalytic set

1254
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:25,440
auto catalytic set
 

1255
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,590

00:21:29,029 --> 00:21:29,039
makes b
 

1259
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:31,110
makes b
and b helps make a

1260
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:31,120
and b helps make a
 

1261
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,350
and b helps make a
and and vice versa and you then make

1262
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:33,360
and and vice versa and you then make
 

1263
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,789
and and vice versa and you then make
this loop so it's a bit like um

1264
00:21:36,789 --> 00:21:36,799
this loop so it's a bit like um
 

1265
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:40,149
this loop so it's a bit like um
these they all work in in synergy to

make this chain of events that grow
 

1269
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:45,510
make this chain of events that grow
and it doesn't take um a very

00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:45,520
and it doesn't take um a very
 

1271
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,669
and it doesn't take um a very
sophisticated model to show that

1272
00:21:47,669 --> 00:21:47,679
sophisticated model to show that
 

1273

it's a lineage of watchers and cruder

1296
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:13,760
it's a lineage of watchers and cruder

00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,230
it's a lineage of watchers and cruder
devices that that that couple are

00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,070
uh
so it's very improbable but once you get

00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:24,080
so it's very improbable but once you get

wheel
 

1311
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,789
wheel
and um

1312
00:22:28,789 --> 00:22:28,799
and um
 

1313
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:30,950
and um
fire it just gets

1314
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:30,960
fire it just gets
 

1315
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,230
fire it just gets
explodes in because it's so successful

1316
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:34,240
explodes in because it's so successful
 

1317
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,029
explodes in because it's so successful
it explodes it's basically

1318
00:22:37,029 --> 00:22:37,039
it explodes it's basically
 

1319
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:39,830
it explodes it's basically
selection so this templating mechanism

1320
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:39,840
selection so this templating mechanism
 

1321
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,590
selection so this templating mechanism
that allows you to have a little like

1322
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:41,600
that allows you to have a little like
 

1323
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,830
that allows you to have a little like
blueprint for yourself how you go

1324
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:43,840
blueprint for yourself how you go
 

1325
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,350
blueprint for yourself how you go
through different procedures is to build

1326
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:45,360
through different procedures is to build
 

1327
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:49,350
through different procedures is to build

1329
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,830

so i uh in chemistry somehow it's

1330
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:51,840
so i uh in chemistry somehow it's
 

1331
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,430
so i uh in chemistry somehow it's
possible to imagine that that kind of

1332
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:53,440
possible to imagine that that kind of
 

1333
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,710
possible to imagine that that kind of
thing

1334
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:54,720
thing
 

1335
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,950
thing
is easy to spring up

1336
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:56,960
is easy to spring up
 

1337
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,029
is easy to spring up
in more complex organisms it feels like

1338
00:22:59,029 --> 00:22:59,039
in more complex organisms it feels like
 

1339
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:00,149
in more complex organisms it feels like
a different thing and much more

1340
00:23:00,149 --> 00:23:00,159
a different thing and much more
 

1341
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:01,510
a different thing and much more
complicated like

1342
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:01,520
complicated like
 

1343
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,110
complicated like
we're having like uh

1344
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:03,120
we're having like uh
 

1345
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,110
we're having like uh
multiple abstractions of the birds and

1346
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:05,120
multiple abstractions of the birds and
 

1347

1351
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,270
human inside with complex organisms it
feels like difficult to have

to uh
 

1359
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,430
to uh
that's gonna get clipped out i'm gonna

1360
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:17,440
that's gonna get clipped out i'm gonna
 

1361
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,230
that's gonna get clipped out i'm gonna
make fun of that um

1362
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:20,240
make fun of that um
 

1363
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,950
make fun of that um
uh it's still it's difficult to develop

1364
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:22,960
uh it's still it's difficult to develop
 

1365
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,110
uh it's still it's difficult to develop
this idea of making copies of yourself

1366
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:25,120
this idea of making copies of yourself
 

1367
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,310
this idea of making copies of yourself
or no

1368
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:26,320
or no
 

1369
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,990
or no
uh because that seems like a magical

1370
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:28,000
uh because that seems like a magical
 

1371
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,750
uh because that seems like a magical
idea for life

1372
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:29,760
idea for life
 

1373
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,070
idea for life
to uh

1374
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:32,080
to uh
 

1375
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,750
to uh
wow

1376
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:33,760
wow
 

1377
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,750
wow
that feels like very necessary for what

1378
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:35,760
that feels like very necessary for what
 

1379
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,669
that feels like very necessary for what
selection is for what evolution is but

1380
00:23:37,669 --> 00:23:37,679
selection is for what evolution is but
 

1381
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:40,470
selection is for what evolution is but
then if selection precedes all this

1382
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:40,480
then if selection precedes all this
 

1383
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,350
then if selection precedes all this
then maybe these are just like echoes

1384
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:43,360
then maybe these are just like echoes
 

1385
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,149
then maybe these are just like echoes
of the selection the selecting mechanism

1386
00:23:46,149 --> 00:23:46,159
of the selection the selecting mechanism
 

1387
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:48,149
of the selection the selecting mechanism
at different scales yeah that's exactly

1388
00:23:48,149 --> 00:23:48,159
at different scales yeah that's exactly
 

1389
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:49,830
at different scales yeah that's exactly
it so selection is the default in the

1390
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:49,840
it so selection is the default in the
 

1391
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,909
it so selection is the default in the
universe if you want to

1392
00:23:51,909 --> 00:23:51,919
universe if you want to
 

1393
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:54,630
universe if you want to
and what happens is that life

1394
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:54,640
and what happens is that life
 

1395
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,190
and what happens is that life
the solution that that life has got on

1396
00:23:57,190 --> 00:23:57,200
the solution that that life has got on
 

1397
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,669
the solution that that life has got on
earth life on earth biology on earth

1398
00:23:59,669 --> 00:23:59,679
earth life on earth biology on earth
 

1399
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:01,909
earth life on earth biology on earth
um is unique to earth we can talk about

1400
00:24:01,909 --> 00:24:01,919
um is unique to earth we can talk about
 

1401
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:03,110
um is unique to earth we can talk about
that um

1402
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:03,120
that um
 

1403
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,669
that um
and that was really hard fought for but

1404
00:24:05,669 --> 00:24:05,679
and that was really hard fought for but
 

1405
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:07,909
and that was really hard fought for but
that was that is the solution that works

1406
00:24:07,909 --> 00:24:07,919
that was that is the solution that works
 

1407
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:10,070
that was that is the solution that works
on earth the ribosome the fundamental

1408
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:10,080
on earth the ribosome the fundamental
 

1409
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,390
on earth the ribosome the fundamental
machine that is responsible for every

1410
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:12,400
machine that is responsible for every
 

1411
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,190
machine that is responsible for every
life for you know every cell on earth of

1412
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:15,200
life for you know every cell on earth of
 

1413
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,870
life for you know every cell on earth of
whatever wherever it is in the in the

1414
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:16,880
whatever wherever it is in the in the
 

1415
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,390
whatever wherever it is in the in the
kingdom of life

1416
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:18,400
kingdom of life
 

1417
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,190
kingdom of life
that is an incredibly complex object but

1418
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:21,200
that is an incredibly complex object but
 

1419
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,190
that is an incredibly complex object but
it was evolved over time and it wasn't

1420
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:23,200
it was evolved over time and it wasn't
 

1421
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,430
it was evolved over time and it wasn't
involved in a vacuum and i think that

1422
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:25,440
involved in a vacuum and i think that
 

1423
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,909
involved in a vacuum and i think that
once we understand that selection

1424
00:24:27,909 --> 00:24:27,919
once we understand that selection
 

1425
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:29,029
once we understand that selection
can um

1426
00:24:29,029 --> 00:24:29,039
can um
 

1427
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:30,549
can um
occur

1428
00:24:30,549 --> 00:24:30,559
occur
 

1429
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:32,950
occur
um without the ribosome but what the

1430
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:32,960
um without the ribosome but what the
 

1431
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,590
um without the ribosome but what the
ribosome does it's a phase transition in

1432
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:35,600
ribosome does it's a phase transition in
 

1433
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,029
ribosome does it's a phase transition in
replication

1434
00:24:37,029 --> 00:24:37,039
replication
 

1435
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:38,390
replication
and i think that that and also

1436
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:38,400
and i think that that and also
 

1437
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,669
and i think that that and also
technology that that is uh um

1438
00:24:41,669 --> 00:24:41,679
technology that that is uh um
 

1439
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:43,909
technology that that is uh um
probably much easier to get to than we

1440
00:24:43,909 --> 00:24:43,919
probably much easier to get to than we
 

1441
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:45,669
probably much easier to get to than we
think

1442
00:24:45,669 --> 00:24:45,679
think
 

1443
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:47,510
think
why why do you put

1444
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:47,520
why why do you put
 

1445
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,510
why why do you put
the ribosome as the central

1446
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:49,520
the ribosome as the central
 

1447
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,390
the ribosome as the central
um

1448
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:50,400
um
 

1449
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,390
um
part of living organisms on earth it

1450
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:52,400
part of living organisms on earth it
 

1451
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,830
part of living organisms on earth it
basically is a combination of two

1452
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:53,840
basically is a combination of two
 

1453
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,630
basically is a combination of two
different polymer systems so rna and

1454
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:56,640
different polymer systems so rna and
 

1455
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,350
different polymer systems so rna and
peptides so the rna world if you like

1456
00:24:59,350 --> 00:24:59,360
peptides so the rna world if you like
 

1457
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,390
peptides so the rna world if you like
gets transmitted and builds proteins and

1458
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:02,400
gets transmitted and builds proteins and
 

1459
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,070
gets transmitted and builds proteins and
the proteins are responsible for all the

1460
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:04,080
the proteins are responsible for all the
 

1461
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,590
the proteins are responsible for all the
catalysis it will the majority of the

1462
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:05,600
catalysis it will the majority of the
 

1463
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,510
catalysis it will the majority of the
catalysis that goes on the cell no

1464
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:07,520
catalysis that goes on the cell no
 

1465
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,470
catalysis that goes on the cell no
ribosome no proteins no decoding

1466
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:10,480
ribosome no proteins no decoding
 

1467
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,029
ribosome no proteins no decoding
no evolution so ribosome is looking at

1468
00:25:13,029 --> 00:25:13,039
no evolution so ribosome is looking at
 

1469
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:15,750
no evolution so ribosome is looking at
the action so you don't put like the rna

1470
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:15,760
the action so you don't put like the rna
 

1471
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,990
the action so you don't put like the rna
itself as the critical thing like

1472
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:18,000
itself as the critical thing like
 

1473
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,149
itself as the critical thing like
information you put action as the most

1474
00:25:20,149 --> 00:25:20,159
information you put action as the most
 

1475
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:21,830
information you put action as the most
important thing i think the actual

1476
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:21,840
important thing i think the actual
 

1477
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,350
important thing i think the actual
molecules that we have in biology right

1478
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:23,360
molecules that we have in biology right
 

1479
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,430
molecules that we have in biology right
now entirely contingent on the history

1480
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:25,440
now entirely contingent on the history
 

1481
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,590
now entirely contingent on the history
of life on earth they could there are so

1482
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:27,600
of life on earth they could there are so
 

1483
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,430
of life on earth they could there are so
many possible solutions and this is

1484
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:29,440
many possible solutions and this is
 

1485
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,350
many possible solutions and this is
where chemistry got itself into origin

1486
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:31,360
where chemistry got itself into origin
 

1487
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,789
where chemistry got itself into origin
of life chemistry gets itself into a bit

1488
00:25:32,789 --> 00:25:32,799
of life chemistry gets itself into a bit
 

1489
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:34,549
of life chemistry gets itself into a bit
of a trap yeah let me uh interrupt you

1490
00:25:34,549 --> 00:25:34,559
of a trap yeah let me uh interrupt you
 

1491
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:36,470
of a trap yeah let me uh interrupt you
there you've tweeted you're gonna get

1492
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:36,480
there you've tweeted you're gonna get
 

1493
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,470
there you've tweeted you're gonna get
i'm i'm gonna cite your tweets like it's

1494
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:38,480
i'm i'm gonna cite your tweets like it's
 

1495
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,310
i'm i'm gonna cite your tweets like it's
shakespeare okay

1496
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:40,320
shakespeare okay
 

1497
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,510
shakespeare okay
it's surprising you haven't gotten

1498
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:41,520
it's surprising you haven't gotten
 

1499
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,830
it's surprising you haven't gotten
cancelled on twitter yet um it's your

1500
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:43,840
cancelled on twitter yet um it's your
 

1501
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,630

brilliance once again saves you um i'm

1502
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:46,640
brilliance once again saves you um i'm
 

1503
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,269
brilliance once again saves you um i'm
just kidding there's there's uh uh you

1504
00:25:49,269 --> 00:25:49,279
just kidding there's there's uh uh you
 

1505
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:50,470
just kidding there's there's uh uh you
like to have a little bit of fun on

1506
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:50,480
like to have a little bit of fun on
 

1507
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,190
like to have a little bit of fun on
twitter you've tweeted that quote origin

1508
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:53,200
twitter you've tweeted that quote origin
 

1509
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,789
twitter you've tweeted that quote origin
of life research is a scam

1510
00:25:56,789 --> 00:25:56,799
of life research is a scam
 

1511
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:59,029
of life research is a scam
so if this is shakespeare can we analyze

1512
00:25:59,029 --> 00:25:59,039
so if this is shakespeare can we analyze
 

1513
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:01,190
so if this is shakespeare can we analyze
this word why why is the origin of life

1514
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:01,200
this word why why is the origin of life
 

1515
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,669
this word why why is the origin of life
research a scam aren't you kind of doing

1516
00:26:03,669 --> 00:26:03,679
research a scam aren't you kind of doing
 

1517
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:05,750
research a scam aren't you kind of doing
origin of life research

1518
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:05,760
origin of life research
 

1519
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:06,630
origin of life research
um

1520
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:06,640
um
 

1521
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,149
um
okay it was tongue-in-cheek but yeah i

1522
00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:08,159
okay it was tongue-in-cheek but yeah i
 

1523
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:10,549
okay it was tongue-in-cheek but yeah i
think and i meant it as tongue-in-cheek

1524
00:26:10,549 --> 00:26:10,559
think and i meant it as tongue-in-cheek
 

1525
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:12,870
think and i meant it as tongue-in-cheek
um i am i'm not doing or i'm not doing

1526
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:12,880
um i am i'm not doing or i'm not doing
 

1527
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,710
um i am i'm not doing or i'm not doing
the origin of life research i'm trying

1528
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:14,720
the origin of life research i'm trying
 

1529
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,630
the origin of life research i'm trying
to make artificial life

1530
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:16,640
to make artificial life
 

1531
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,029
to make artificial life
and i also want to to bound the

1532
00:26:19,029 --> 00:26:19,039
and i also want to to bound the
 

1533
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:20,789
and i also want to to bound the
likelihood of mate of the origin of life

1534
00:26:20,789 --> 00:26:20,799
likelihood of mate of the origin of life
 

1535
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:22,230
likelihood of mate of the origin of life
on earth but more importantly to find

1536
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:22,240
on earth but more importantly to find
 

1537
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,310
on earth but more importantly to find
origin of life elsewhere but let me

1538
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:24,320
origin of life elsewhere but let me
 

1539
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,230
origin of life elsewhere but let me
directly address the tweet there are

1540
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:26,240
directly address the tweet there are
 

1541
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,070
directly address the tweet there are
many many good chemists out there doing

1542
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:28,080
many many good chemists out there doing
 

1543
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,230
many many good chemists out there doing
origin of life research but i want to

1544
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:30,240
origin of life research but i want to
 

1545
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,630
origin of life research but i want to
nudge them and i think they're brilliant

1546
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:32,640
nudge them and i think they're brilliant
 

1547
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,310
nudge them and i think they're brilliant
like there's no there's there's no

1548
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:34,320
like there's no there's there's no
 

1549
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,190
like there's no there's there's no
question

1550
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:35,200
question
 

1551
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,630
question
the chemistry they are doing their

1552
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:36,640
the chemistry they are doing their
 

1553
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,630
the chemistry they are doing their
motivation is great

1554
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:38,640
motivation is great
 

1555
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,390
motivation is great
so what i meant by that tweet is saying

1556
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:40,400
so what i meant by that tweet is saying
 

1557
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,310
so what i meant by that tweet is saying
that maybe they're making assumptions

1558
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:42,320
that maybe they're making assumptions
 

1559
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:45,029
that maybe they're making assumptions
about saying if only

1560
00:26:45,029 --> 00:26:45,039
about saying if only
 

1561
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:46,789
about saying if only
i could make this particular type of

1562
00:26:46,789 --> 00:26:46,799
i could make this particular type of
 

1563
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:50,830
i could make this particular type of
molecule say this rna molecule or this

1564
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:50,840
molecule say this rna molecule or this
 

1565
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,990
molecule say this rna molecule or this
phosphodiester or this other molecule

1566
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:54,000
phosphodiester or this other molecule
 

1567
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,470
phosphodiester or this other molecule
it's going to somehow unlock the origin

1568
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:56,480
it's going to somehow unlock the origin
 

1569
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,669
it's going to somehow unlock the origin
of life

1570
00:26:57,669 --> 00:26:57,679
of life
 

1571
00:26:57,679 --> 00:26:59,909
of life
and i think that origin of life has been

1572
00:26:59,909 --> 00:26:59,919
and i think that origin of life has been
 

1573
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:01,990
and i think that origin of life has been
looking at this for a very long time and

1574
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:02,000
looking at this for a very long time and
 

1575
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,870
looking at this for a very long time and
whilst i i think it's brilliant to

1576
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:04,880
whilst i i think it's brilliant to
 

1577
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,950
whilst i i think it's brilliant to
work out how you can get to those

1578
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:06,960
work out how you can get to those
 

1579
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,909
work out how you can get to those
molecules i think that chemistry and

1580
00:27:09,909 --> 00:27:09,919
molecules i think that chemistry and
 

1581
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:12,549
molecules i think that chemistry and
chemists doing origin of life could

1582
00:27:12,549 --> 00:27:12,559
chemists doing origin of life could
 

1583
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:14,950
chemists doing origin of life could
be nudged into doing something even more

1584
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:14,960
be nudged into doing something even more
 

1585
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,990
be nudged into doing something even more
profound and and so the argument i'm

1586
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:18,000
profound and and so the argument i'm
 

1587
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,470
profound and and so the argument i'm
making it's a bit like right now let's

1588
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:20,480
making it's a bit like right now let's
 

1589
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,029
making it's a bit like right now let's
say i don't know the first tesla that

1590
00:27:23,029 --> 00:27:23,039
say i don't know the first tesla that
 

1591
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:25,190
say i don't know the first tesla that
makes its way to

1592
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:25,200
makes its way to
 

1593
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,630
makes its way to
i don't know into a new country in the

1594
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:26,640
i don't know into a new country in the
 

1595
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,149
i don't know into a new country in the
world let's say i

1596
00:27:28,149 --> 00:27:28,159
world let's say i
 

1597
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:29,830
world let's say i
let's say there's country x that has

1598
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:29,840
let's say there's country x that has
 

1599
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,350
let's say there's country x that has
never had a tesla before and they get

1600
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:31,360
never had a tesla before and they get
 

1601
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,269
never had a tesla before and they get
the tesla russia

1602
00:27:33,269 --> 00:27:33,279
the tesla russia
 

1603
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:34,389
the tesla russia
and they take the test and what they do

1604
00:27:34,389 --> 00:27:34,399
and they take the test and what they do
 

1605
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:35,510
and they take the test and what they do
is they take the tests for a part and

1606
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:35,520
is they take the tests for a part and
 

1607
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,350
is they take the tests for a part and
say we want to find the origin of of

1608
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:37,360
say we want to find the origin of of
 

1609
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,950
say we want to find the origin of of
cars in the universe and say okay how

1610
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:38,960
cars in the universe and say okay how
 

1611
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,029
cars in the universe and say okay how
did this form and how did this fall

1612
00:27:41,029 --> 00:27:41,039
did this form and how did this fall
 

1613
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:42,630
did this form and how did this fall
and they just randomly keep making until

1614
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:42,640
and they just randomly keep making until
 

1615
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,149
and they just randomly keep making until
they make the door they make the wheel

1616
00:27:44,149 --> 00:27:44,159
they make the door they make the wheel
 

1617
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:45,430
they make the door they make the wheel
they make the steering column and all

1618
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:45,440
they make the steering column and all
 

1619
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,950
they make the steering column and all
this stuff and

1620
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:46,960
this stuff and
 

1621
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,149
this stuff and
and they say oh that's the route that's

1622
00:27:48,149 --> 00:27:48,159
and they say oh that's the route that's
 

1623
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:49,990
and they say oh that's the route that's
the way uh that's the way cars emerge on

1624
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:50,000
the way uh that's the way cars emerge on
 

1625
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,070
the way uh that's the way cars emerge on
earth but actually we know that there's

1626
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:52,080
earth but actually we know that there's
 

1627
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,750
earth but actually we know that there's
a causal chain of cars going right back

1628
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:53,760

00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,710
nailed let's now make this other
molecule another molecule and how many

then
 

1725
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:28,710
then
the reason i say this is when you go

the reason i say this is when you go
 

1727

this entity and made it in the lab all
the dna but he didn't make the cell he

the dna but he didn't make the cell he
 

1751

way back to luca and he showed when he
 

1757
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,470
way back to luca and he showed when he
took out the gene the genes and put in

00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:06,480
took out the gene the genes and put in
 

1759
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,630
took out the gene the genes and put in
his genes synthesized the cell could

his genes synthesized the cell could
 

1761
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,870
his genes synthesized the cell could
boot up but it's remarkable that he

1762
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:10,880
boot up but it's remarkable that he
 

1763
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,950
boot up but it's remarkable that he
could not make a cell from scratch and

1764
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:12,960
could not make a cell from scratch and
 

1765
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,110
could not make a cell from scratch and
even now today synthetic biologists

1766
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:15,120
even now today synthetic biologists
 

1767
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,190
even now today synthetic biologists
cannot make a cell from scratch

1768

cannot make a cell from scratch
 

1769
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,590
cannot make a cell from scratch
because there's some contingent

1770
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:19,600
because there's some contingent

and that is just incredible

00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,750
and that is just incredible
so there's lots of layers to the scam

so there's lots of layers to the scam
 

1779
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,830
so there's lots of layers to the scam
well let me then ask

1780
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:31,840
well let me then ask
 

1781
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,870
well let me then ask
the question how can we create life in

1782
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:34,880
the question how can we create life in
 

1783
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,029
the question how can we create life in
the lab from scratch

1784

the lab from scratch
 

1785
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:38,470
the lab from scratch
what have been the most promising

1786
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:38,480
what have been the most promising
 

1787
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,789
what have been the most promising
attempts at creating life in the lab

1788
00:30:40,789 --> 00:30:40,799
attempts at creating life in the lab
 

1789
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:43,110
attempts at creating life in the lab
from scratch has anyone actually been

1790
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:43,120
from scratch has anyone actually been
 

1791
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,350
from scratch has anyone actually been
able to do it do you think anyone will

1792
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:45,360
able to do it do you think anyone will
 

1793
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,190
able to do it do you think anyone will
be able to do it in the near future if

1794
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:47,200
be able to do it in the near future if
 

1795
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,269
be able to do it in the near future if
they haven't already

1796
00:30:49,269 --> 00:30:49,279
they haven't already
 

1797
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:52,870
they haven't already
um can yeah i think that um nobody has

1798
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:52,880
um can yeah i think that um nobody has
 

1799
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,870
um can yeah i think that um nobody has
made life in the lab from scratch lots

1800
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:54,880
made life in the lab from scratch lots
 

1801
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,549
made life in the lab from scratch lots
of people would argue that they have

1802
00:30:56,549 --> 00:30:56,559
of people would argue that they have
 

1803
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:58,710
of people would argue that they have
made progress the craig vent i think the

1804
00:30:58,710 --> 00:30:58,720
made progress the craig vent i think the
 

1805
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,870
made progress the craig vent i think the
synthesis of a synthetic genome

1806
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:00,880
synthesis of a synthetic genome
 

1807

damn
this is we just created life

1834
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:24,000
this is we just created life
 

1835
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,070
this is we just created life
um well what i would i can tell you what

1836
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:26,080
um well what i would i can tell you what
 

1837
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,789
um well what i would i can tell you what
i would expect i would like to be able

1838
00:31:28,789 --> 00:31:28,799
i would expect i would like to be able
 

1839
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:30,149
i would expect i would like to be able
to do

1840
00:31:30,149 --> 00:31:30,159
to do
 

1841
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:32,310
to do
is to

1842
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:32,320
is to
 

1843
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:35,430
is to
go from sand to cells in my lab

1844
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:35,440
go from sand to cells in my lab
 

1845
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,269
go from sand to cells in my lab
and

1846
00:31:37,269 --> 00:31:37,279
and
 

1847
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:39,269
and
and can you explain what sand is you

1848
00:31:39,269 --> 00:31:39,279
and can you explain what sand is you
 

1849
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:40,870
and can you explain what sand is you
just in organic just in organic stuff

1850
00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:40,880
just in organic just in organic stuff
 

1851
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,509
just in organic just in organic stuff
like like like basically just so sand

1852
00:31:43,509 --> 00:31:43,519
like like like basically just so sand
 

1853
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:45,990
like like like basically just so sand
it's just silica silicon oxide with some

1854
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:46,000
it's just silica silicon oxide with some
 

1855
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,870
it's just silica silicon oxide with some
other ions in it maybe some inorganic

1856
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:48,880
other ions in it maybe some inorganic
 

1857
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,870
other ions in it maybe some inorganic
carbon some carbonates

1858
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:50,880
carbon some carbonates
 

1859
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,190
carbon some carbonates
just basically clearly dead stuff you

1860
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:53,200
just basically clearly dead stuff you
 

1861
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,909
just basically clearly dead stuff you
you could just grind rocks into sand and

1862
00:31:55,909 --> 00:31:55,919
you could just grind rocks into sand and
 

1863
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:57,990
you could just grind rocks into sand and
it would be what in like in a vacuum so

1864
00:31:57,990 --> 00:31:58,000
it would be what in like in a vacuum so
 

1865
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,590
it would be what in like in a vacuum so
they could remove anything else that

1866
00:31:59,590 --> 00:31:59,600
they could remove anything else that
 

1867
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,110
they could remove anything else that
could possibly

1868
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:01,120
could possibly
 

1869
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,070
could possibly
uh

1870
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:02,080
uh
 

1871
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,830
uh
be uh

1872
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:03,840
be uh
 

1873
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,830
be uh
like a shadow of life that can assist in

1874
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:05,840
like a shadow of life that can assist in
 

1875
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,110
like a shadow of life that can assist in
the chemical you could do that you could

1876
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:07,120
the chemical you could do that you could
 

1877
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,789
the chemical you could do that you could
insist and say look i'm going to take

1878
00:32:08,789 --> 00:32:08,799
insist and say look i'm going to take
 

1879
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:10,549
insist and say look i'm going to take
and not just inorganic i want some more

1880
00:32:10,549 --> 00:32:10,559
and not just inorganic i want some more
 

1881
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:12,389
and not just inorganic i want some more
i want to cheat and have some organic

1882
00:32:12,389 --> 00:32:12,399
i want to cheat and have some organic
 

1883
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:13,990
i want to cheat and have some organic
but i want inorganic organic and i'll

1884
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:14,000
but i want inorganic organic and i'll
 

1885
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,070
but i want inorganic organic and i'll
explain the play on words in a moment so

1886
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:16,080
explain the play on words in a moment so
 

1887
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,710
explain the play on words in a moment so
i would like to basically put into a

1888
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:18,720
i would like to basically put into a
 

1889
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,870
i would like to basically put into a
world let's say a completely

1890
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:20,880
world let's say a completely
 

1891
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,190
world let's say a completely
you know a synthetic world if you like a

1892
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:23,200
you know a synthetic world if you like a
 

1893
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,389
you know a synthetic world if you like a
closed world

1894
00:32:24,389 --> 00:32:24,399
closed world
 

1895
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:27,190
closed world
put some inorganic materials and just

1896
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:27,200
put some inorganic materials and just
 

1897
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,909
put some inorganic materials and just
literally add some energy in some form

1898
00:32:29,909 --> 00:32:29,919
literally add some energy in some form
 

1899
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:31,990
literally add some energy in some form
be it lightning or heat

1900
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:32,000
be it lightning or heat
 

1901
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,509
be it lightning or heat
uv light

1902
00:32:33,509 --> 00:32:33,519
uv light
 

1903
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:35,990
uv light
and run this thing in cycles

1904
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:36,000
and run this thing in cycles
 

1905
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,070
and run this thing in cycles
over time and let it solve the search

1906
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:38,080
over time and let it solve the search
 

1907
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,110
over time and let it solve the search
problem so

1908
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:39,120
problem so
 

1909
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,710
problem so
i see the origin of life as a search

1910
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:40,720
i see the origin of life as a search
 

1911
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,630
i see the origin of life as a search
problem in chemical space

1912
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:42,640
problem in chemical space
 

1913
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,950
problem in chemical space
and then i would wait literally wait for

1914
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:44,960
and then i would wait literally wait for
 

1915
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,470
and then i would wait literally wait for
a life form to crawl out the test tube

1916
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:46,480
a life form to crawl out the test tube
 

1917
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,070
a life form to crawl out the test tube
that's the joke i tell my group

1918
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:48,080
that's the joke i tell my group
 

1919
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:51,029
that's the joke i tell my group
literally wait uh uh for a very and

1920
00:32:51,029 --> 00:32:51,039
literally wait uh uh for a very and
 

1921
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:52,389
literally wait uh uh for a very and
don't worry it's gonna be very feeble

1922
00:32:52,389 --> 00:32:52,399
don't worry it's gonna be very feeble
 

1923
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:53,990
don't worry it's gonna be very feeble
it's not gonna take over the world you

1924
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:54,000
it's not gonna take over the world you
 

1925
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,509
it's not gonna take over the world you
know there's ways of ethically

1926
00:32:55,509 --> 00:32:55,519
know there's ways of ethically
 

1927
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:57,430
know there's ways of ethically
containing his last words

1928
00:32:57,430 --> 00:32:57,440
containing his last words
 

1929
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:01,269

you know this is being recorded right

1932
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:02,880
you know this is being recorded right
 

1933
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,230
you know this is being recorded right
it'll make you

1934
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:04,240
it'll make you
 

1935
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,990
it'll make you
it will not make you look good once it

1936
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:06,000
it will not make you look good once it
 

1937
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,149
it will not make you look good once it
crawls out of the lab and destroys all

1938
00:33:08,149 --> 00:33:08,159
crawls out of the lab and destroys all
 

1939
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:10,149
crawls out of the lab and destroys all
of human civilization but yes but there

1940
00:33:10,149 --> 00:33:10,159
of human civilization but yes but there
 

1941
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:11,990
of human civilization but yes but there
is very good there's a very good things

1942
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:12,000
is very good there's a very good things
 

1943
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,430
is very good there's a very good things
you can do to prevent that yeah for

1944
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:13,440
you can do to prevent that yeah for
 

1945
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,430
you can do to prevent that yeah for
instance if you put stuff in your world

1946
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:15,440
instance if you put stuff in your world
 

1947
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:18,230
instance if you put stuff in your world
which isn't earth abundant so let's say

1948
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:18,240
which isn't earth abundant so let's say
 

1949
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,549
which isn't earth abundant so let's say
we make life based on molybdenum and it

1950
00:33:20,549 --> 00:33:20,559
we make life based on molybdenum and it
 

1951
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:21,909
we make life based on molybdenum and it
escapes it would die immediately because

1952
00:33:21,909 --> 00:33:21,919
escapes it would die immediately because
 

1953
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:22,870
escapes it would die immediately because
there's not enough molybdenum in the

1954
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:22,880
there's not enough molybdenum in the
 

1955
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,710
there's not enough molybdenum in the
environment so we can put in we can we

1956
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:24,720
environment so we can put in we can we
 

1957
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,870
environment so we can put in we can we
can do it we can do responsible life or

1958
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:26,880
can do it we can do responsible life or
 

1959
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,190
can do it we can do responsible life or
as i fantasize with my research group on

1960
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:29,200
as i fantasize with my research group on
 

1961
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,190
as i fantasize with my research group on
our away day that would go in it's you

1962
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:31,200
our away day that would go in it's you
 

1963
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,789
our away day that would go in it's you
know i think it's actually

1964
00:33:32,789 --> 00:33:32,799
know i think it's actually
 

1965
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:33,990
know i think it's actually
morally

1966
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:34,000
morally
 

1967
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,990
morally
we if life if we don't find if you met

1968
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:36,000
we if life if we don't find if you met
 

1969
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,430
we if life if we don't find if you met
until humanity finds life in the

1970
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:37,440
until humanity finds life in the
 

1971
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,350
until humanity finds life in the
universe this is going on a tangent it's

1972
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:39,360
universe this is going on a tangent it's
 

1973
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,950
universe this is going on a tangent it's
our moral obligation to make origin of

1974
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:40,960
our moral obligation to make origin of
 

1975
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,269
our moral obligation to make origin of
life bombs identify dead planets and

1976
00:33:43,269 --> 00:33:43,279
life bombs identify dead planets and
 

1977
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:44,710
life bombs identify dead planets and
bomb them with our origin of life

1978
00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:44,720
bomb them with our origin of life
 

1979
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,789
bomb them with our origin of life
machines and make them alive i think it

1980
00:33:46,789 --> 00:33:46,799
machines and make them alive i think it
 

1981
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:49,509
machines and make them alive i think it
is our moral obligation to do that

1982
00:33:49,509 --> 00:33:49,519
is our moral obligation to do that
 

1983
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:51,190
is our moral obligation to do that
i'm sure some people might argue with me

1984
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:51,200
i'm sure some people might argue with me
 

1985
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,710
i'm sure some people might argue with me
about that but i think that we need a

1986
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:52,720
about that but i think that we need a
 

1987
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,950
about that but i think that we need a
lot more life in the universe and then

1988
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:54,960
lot more life in the universe and then
 

1989
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,430
lot more life in the universe and then
we kind of forget we

1990
00:33:57,430 --> 00:33:57,440
we kind of forget we
 

1991
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:00,470
we kind of forget we
we did it and then come back

1992
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:00,480
we did it and then come back
 

1993
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,230
we did it and then come back
and then say where did you come from but

1994
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:02,240
and then say where did you come from but
 

1995
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,990
and then say where did you come from but
coming back to the what i'd expect so

1996
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:04,000
coming back to the what i'd expect so
 

1997
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,750
coming back to the what i'd expect so
let's just say are there

1998
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:05,760
let's just say are there
 

1999
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,669
let's just say are there
are you back it's i think this is once

2000
00:34:07,669 --> 00:34:07,679
are you back it's i think this is once
 

2001
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:09,190
are you back it's i think this is once
again a rick and morty episode

2002
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:09,200
again a rick and morty episode
 

2003
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,629
again a rick and morty episode
definitely it's definitely all rick and

2004
00:34:10,629 --> 00:34:10,639
definitely it's definitely all rick and
 

2005
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:12,710
definitely it's definitely all rick and
morty all the way down so we i imagine

2006
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:12,720
morty all the way down so we i imagine
 

2007
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:14,310
morty all the way down so we i imagine
we have this pristine

2008
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:14,320
we have this pristine
 

2009
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,790
we have this pristine
um experiment and everything is you know

2010
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:16,800
um experiment and everything is you know
 

2011
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,270
um experiment and everything is you know
sanitized and we put in inorganic

2012
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:19,280
sanitized and we put in inorganic
 

2013
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,909
sanitized and we put in inorganic
materials and we we have cycles with

2014
00:34:21,909 --> 00:34:21,919
materials and we we have cycles with
 

2015
00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:24,389
materials and we we have cycles with
them day night cycles up down whatever

2016
00:34:24,389 --> 00:34:24,399
them day night cycles up down whatever
 

2017
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:25,510
them day night cycles up down whatever
and we

2018
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:25,520
and we
 

2019
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,270
and we
look for evidence of replication and

2020
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:27,280
look for evidence of replication and
 

2021
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,270
look for evidence of replication and
evolution over time and that's what the

2022
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:29,280
evolution over time and that's what the
 

2023
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,950
evolution over time and that's what the
experiment should be now are there

2024
00:34:30,950 --> 00:34:30,960
experiment should be now are there
 

2025
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,389
experiment should be now are there
people doing this in the world right now

2026
00:34:32,389 --> 00:34:32,399
people doing this in the world right now
 

2027
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:34,069
people doing this in the world right now
there are a couple of there's some

2028
00:34:34,069 --> 00:34:34,079
there are a couple of there's some
 

2029
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:35,750
there are a couple of there's some
really good groups doing this there's

2030
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:35,760
really good groups doing this there's
 

2031
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,270
really good groups doing this there's
some really interesting scientists doing

2032
00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:37,280
some really interesting scientists doing
 

2033
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,629
some really interesting scientists doing
this around the world

2034
00:34:38,629 --> 00:34:38,639
this around the world
 

2035
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:40,550
this around the world
they're kind of

2036
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:40,560
they're kind of
 

2037
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,230
they're kind of
perhaps

2038
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:42,240
perhaps
 

2039
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,470
perhaps
too much associated with the scam

2040
00:34:44,470 --> 00:34:44,480
too much associated with the scam
 

2041
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,190
too much associated with the scam
so

2042
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:45,200
so
 

2043
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:45,990
so
and

2044
00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:46,000
and
 

2045
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,389
and
and so they're using molecules

2046
00:34:48,389 --> 00:34:48,399
and so they're using molecules
 

2047
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:49,990
and so they're using molecules
that are already we're already invented

2048
00:34:49,990 --> 00:34:50,000
that are already we're already invented
 

2049
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,829
that are already we're already invented
by biology so there's a bit of

2050
00:34:51,829 --> 00:34:51,839
by biology so there's a bit of
 

2051
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:53,669
by biology so there's a bit of
replication built in

2052
00:34:53,669 --> 00:34:53,679
replication built in
 

2053
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:55,349
replication built in
um but i still think the work that is

2054
00:34:55,349 --> 00:34:55,359
um but i still think the work that is
 

2055
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:57,910
um but i still think the work that is
doing they're doing is amazing um but i

2056
00:34:57,910 --> 00:34:57,920
doing they're doing is amazing um but i
 

2057
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,829
doing they're doing is amazing um but i
would like people to be a bit freer and

2058
00:34:59,829 --> 00:34:59,839
would like people to be a bit freer and
 

2059
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:02,069
would like people to be a bit freer and
say let's just basically shake a load of

2060
00:35:02,069 --> 00:35:02,079
say let's just basically shake a load of
 

2061
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:04,310
say let's just basically shake a load of
sand in a box and wait for life to come

2062
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:04,320
sand in a box and wait for life to come
 

2063
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,510
sand in a box and wait for life to come
out because that's what happened on

2064
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:05,520
out because that's what happened on
 

2065
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,670
out because that's what happened on
earth and so that we have to understand

2066
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:07,680
earth and so that we have to understand
 

2067
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:08,950
earth and so that we have to understand
that now how would i know i've been

2068
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:08,960
that now how would i know i've been
 

2069
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:11,190
that now how would i know i've been
successful well because i'm not

2070
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:11,200
successful well because i'm not
 

2071
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,550
successful well because i'm not
obsessing with

2072
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:12,560
obsessing with
 

2073
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,829
obsessing with
what molecules are in life

2074
00:35:14,829 --> 00:35:14,839
what molecules are in life
 

2075
00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:18,950
what molecules are in life
now i i would wager a vast quantity of

2076
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:18,960
now i i would wager a vast quantity of
 

2077
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,270
now i i would wager a vast quantity of
money um i'm not very rich so just be a

2078
00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:21,280
money um i'm not very rich so just be a
 

2079
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,950
money um i'm not very rich so just be a
few dollars but for me

2080
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:22,960
few dollars but for me
 

2081
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:23,829
few dollars but for me
um

2082
00:35:23,829 --> 00:35:23,839
um
 

2083
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:26,310
um
the the the solution space will be

2084
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:26,320
the the the solution space will be
 

2085
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,190
the the the solution space will be
different

2086
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:27,200
different
 

2087
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,910
different
so the the genetic material will be not

2088
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:29,920
so the the genetic material will be not
 

2089
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,950
so the the genetic material will be not
rna

2090
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:30,960
rna
 

2091
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,510
rna
the proteins will not be what we think

2092
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:33,520
the proteins will not be what we think
 

2093
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,870
the proteins will not be what we think
they'll it would the solutions will be

2094
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:34,880
they'll it would the solutions will be
 

2095
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,390
they'll it would the solutions will be
just completely different and it might

2096
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:36,400
just completely different and it might
 

2097
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,829
just completely different and it might
be and it'll be very feeble because

2098
00:35:37,829 --> 00:35:37,839
be and it'll be very feeble because
 

2099
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:39,109
be and it'll be very feeble because
that's the other thing we should be able

2100
00:35:39,109 --> 00:35:39,119
that's the other thing we should be able
 

2101
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:40,310
that's the other thing we should be able
to show

2102
00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:40,320
to show
 

2103
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,270
to show
um fairly robustly that even if i did

2104
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:43,280
um fairly robustly that even if i did
 

2105
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,270
um fairly robustly that even if i did
make or someone did make a new life form

2106
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:45,280
make or someone did make a new life form
 

2107
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,310
make or someone did make a new life form
in the lab it would be so poor

2108
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:48,320
in the lab it would be so poor
 

2109
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:51,510
in the lab it would be so poor
that it's not going to leap out it is

2110
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:51,520
that it's not going to leap out it is
 

2111
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:55,109
that it's not going to leap out it is
the the fear about making a lethal life

2112
00:35:55,109 --> 00:35:55,119
the the fear about making a lethal life
 

2113
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:55,990
the the fear about making a lethal life
form

2114
00:35:55,990 --> 00:35:56,000
form
 

2115
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,109
form
in the lab from scratch is um

2116
00:35:59,109 --> 00:35:59,119
in the lab from scratch is um
 

2117
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:00,870
in the lab from scratch is um
similar to us imagining that we're going

2118
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:00,880
similar to us imagining that we're going
 

2119
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,870
similar to us imagining that we're going
to make the terminator uh boston

2120
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:02,880
to make the terminator uh boston
 

2121
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,190
to make the terminator uh boston
dynamics tomorrow yeah simply not you

2122
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:05,200
dynamics tomorrow yeah simply not you
 

2123
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,430
dynamics tomorrow yeah simply not you
and and i and the problem is we don't

2124
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:07,440
and and i and the problem is we don't
 

2125
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,950
and and i and the problem is we don't
communicate that properly i know you

2126
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:08,960
communicate that properly i know you
 

2127
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,910
communicate that properly i know you
yourself very um you explain this very

2128
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:11,920
yourself very um you explain this very
 

2129
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,670
yourself very um you explain this very
well you know there is not the ai

2130
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:13,680
well you know there is not the ai
 

2131
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,349
well you know there is not the ai
catastrophe coming

2132
00:36:15,349 --> 00:36:15,359
catastrophe coming
 

2133
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:16,950
catastrophe coming
um we're very far away from that that

2134
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:16,960
um we're very far away from that that
 

2135
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,470
um we're very far away from that that
doesn't mean we should ignore it same

2136
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:18,480
doesn't mean we should ignore it same
 

2137
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,150
doesn't mean we should ignore it same
with the origin of life catastrophe it's

2138
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:20,160
with the origin of life catastrophe it's
 

2139
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,150
with the origin of life catastrophe it's
not coming anytime soon we shouldn't

2140
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:22,160
not coming anytime soon we shouldn't
 

2141
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,710
not coming anytime soon we shouldn't
ignore it but we shouldn't let that fear

2142
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:24,720
ignore it but we shouldn't let that fear
 

2143
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,550
ignore it but we shouldn't let that fear
stop us from doing those experiments but

2144
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:26,560
stop us from doing those experiments but
 

2145
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,310
stop us from doing those experiments but
this is a much much longer discussion

2146
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:28,320
this is a much much longer discussion
 

2147
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,990
this is a much much longer discussion
because there's a lot of details there i

2148
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:30,000
because there's a lot of details there i
 

2149
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,430
because there's a lot of details there i
would say there is potential for

2150
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:31,440
would say there is potential for
 

2151
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,510
would say there is potential for
catastrophic events

2152
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:33,520
catastrophic events
 

2153
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,109
catastrophic events
to happen

2154
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:35,119
to happen
 

2155
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:38,390
to happen
in much dumber ways within in ai space

2156
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:38,400
in much dumber ways within in ai space
 

2157
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:41,030
in much dumber ways within in ai space
there's a lot of ways to create like uh

2158
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:41,040
there's a lot of ways to create like uh
 

2159
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,030
there's a lot of ways to create like uh
social networks that are creating a kind

2160
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:43,040
social networks that are creating a kind
 

2161
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,430
social networks that are creating a kind
of uh accelerated

2162
00:36:45,430 --> 00:36:45,440
of uh accelerated
 

2163
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,589
of uh accelerated
set of events that we might not be able

2164
00:36:47,589 --> 00:36:47,599
set of events that we might not be able
 

2165
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:49,270
set of events that we might not be able
to control the

2166
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:49,280
to control the
 

2167
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,069
to control the
social network virality in the digital

2168
00:36:52,069 --> 00:36:52,079
social network virality in the digital
 

2169
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:53,190
social network virality in the digital
space

2170
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:53,200
space
 

2171
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,030
space
can create

2172
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:55,040
can create
 

2173
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:58,870
can create
mass movements of ideas that can then if

2174
00:36:58,870 --> 00:36:58,880
mass movements of ideas that can then if
 

2175
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,230
mass movements of ideas that can then if
times are tough

2176
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:00,240
times are tough
 

2177
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,230
times are tough
create military conflict and all those

2178
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:02,240
create military conflict and all those
 

2179
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,910
create military conflict and all those
kinds of things but that's not intel

2180
00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:03,920
kinds of things but that's not intel
 

2181
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,589
kinds of things but that's not intel
super intelligent ai

2182
00:37:05,589 --> 00:37:05,599
super intelligent ai
 

2183
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:07,349
super intelligent ai
that's an interesting

2184
00:37:07,349 --> 00:37:07,359
that's an interesting
 

2185
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:09,829
that's an interesting
at scale application of ai and if you

2186
00:37:09,829 --> 00:37:09,839
at scale application of ai and if you
 

2187
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:13,190
at scale application of ai and if you
look at viruses viruses are pretty dumb

2188
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:13,200
look at viruses viruses are pretty dumb
 

2189
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:16,069
look at viruses viruses are pretty dumb
but at scale their application is pretty

2190
00:37:16,069 --> 00:37:16,079
but at scale their application is pretty
 

2191
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:19,030
but at scale their application is pretty
detrimental and so origin of life much

2192
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:19,040
detrimental and so origin of life much
 

2193
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,230
detrimental and so origin of life much
like

2194
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:20,240
like
 

2195
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:23,349
like
all the kind of virology you know

2196
00:37:23,349 --> 00:37:23,359
all the kind of virology you know
 

2197
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:25,190
all the kind of virology you know
um

2198
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:25,200
um
 

2199
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,510
um
the very contentious word of gain of

2200
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:27,520
the very contentious word of gain of
 

2201
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,510
the very contentious word of gain of
function research and virology sort of

2202
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:29,520
function research and virology sort of
 

2203
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,990
function research and virology sort of
like research on viruses

2204
00:37:31,990 --> 00:37:32,000
like research on viruses
 

2205
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,510
like research on viruses
uh

2206
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:33,520
uh
 

2207
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,829
uh
messing with them

2208
00:37:34,829 --> 00:37:34,839
messing with them
 

2209
00:37:34,839 --> 00:37:37,589
messing with them
genetically that can create a lot of

2210
00:37:37,589 --> 00:37:37,599
genetically that can create a lot of
 

2211
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:39,349
genetically that can create a lot of
problems if not done well so we have to

2212
00:37:39,349 --> 00:37:39,359
problems if not done well so we have to
 

2213
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:41,190
problems if not done well so we have to
be very

2214
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:41,200
be very
 

2215
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,589
be very
cautious so there's a kind of whenever

2216
00:37:43,589 --> 00:37:43,599
cautious so there's a kind of whenever
 

2217
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:46,150
cautious so there's a kind of whenever
you're ultra cautious about stuff

2218
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:46,160
you're ultra cautious about stuff
 

2219
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:50,630
you're ultra cautious about stuff
in ai or in virology and biology

2220
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:50,640
in ai or in virology and biology
 

2221
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:53,430
in ai or in virology and biology
it borders on cynicism i would say where

2222
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:53,440
it borders on cynicism i would say where
 

2223
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,990
it borders on cynicism i would say where
it's like everything we do is going to

2224
00:37:55,990 --> 00:37:56,000
it's like everything we do is going to
 

2225
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,550
it's like everything we do is going to
turn out to be destructive and terrible

2226
00:37:58,550 --> 00:37:58,560
turn out to be destructive and terrible
 

2227
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,910
turn out to be destructive and terrible
so i'm just going to sit here and do

2228
00:37:59,910 --> 00:37:59,920
so i'm just going to sit here and do
 

2229
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:00,870
so i'm just going to sit here and do
nothing

2230
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:00,880
nothing
 

2231
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:03,430
nothing
okay that's a possible solution

2232
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:03,440
okay that's a possible solution
 

2233
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,349
okay that's a possible solution
except for the fact that somebody's

2234
00:38:05,349 --> 00:38:05,359
except for the fact that somebody's
 

2235
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:07,109
except for the fact that somebody's
going to do it

2236
00:38:07,109 --> 00:38:07,119
going to do it
 

2237
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:07,910
going to do it
it's

2238
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:07,920
it's
 

2239
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,470
it's
science and technology progresses

2240
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:10,480
science and technology progresses
 

2241
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:13,750
science and technology progresses
so we have to do it in an ethical way in

2242
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:13,760
so we have to do it in an ethical way in
 

2243
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,470
so we have to do it in an ethical way in
a good way considering in a transparent

2244
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:16,480
a good way considering in a transparent
 

2245
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,870
a good way considering in a transparent
way in an open way

2246
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:18,880
way in an open way
 

2247
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,670
way in an open way
considering

2248
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:21,680
considering
 

2249
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,589
considering
all the possible positive trajectories

2250
00:38:23,589 --> 00:38:23,599
all the possible positive trajectories
 

2251
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:25,510
all the possible positive trajectories
that could be taken and making sure as

2252
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:25,520
that could be taken and making sure as
 

2253
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,030
that could be taken and making sure as
much as possible that we walk those

2254
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:27,040
much as possible that we walk those
 

2255
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,349
much as possible that we walk those
trajectories so yeah i don't think

2256
00:38:29,349 --> 00:38:29,359
trajectories so yeah i don't think
 

2257
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:32,630
trajectories so yeah i don't think
terminator is coming but a totally

2258
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:32,640
terminator is coming but a totally
 

2259
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:35,190
terminator is coming but a totally
unexpected version of terminator

2260
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:35,200
unexpected version of terminator
 

2261
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,710
unexpected version of terminator
maybe around the corner yeah it might be

2262
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:36,720
maybe around the corner yeah it might be
 

2263
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,870
maybe around the corner yeah it might be
here already yeah so i agree with that

2264
00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:38,880
here already yeah so i agree with that
 

2265
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,790
here already yeah so i agree with that
and so going back to the origin of life

2266
00:38:40,790 --> 00:38:40,800
and so going back to the origin of life
 

2267
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,470
and so going back to the origin of life
discussion i think that in synthetic

2268
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:42,480
discussion i think that in synthetic
 

2269
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,470
discussion i think that in synthetic
biology right now

2270
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:44,480
biology right now
 

2271
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,109
biology right now
we have to be very careful about how we

2272
00:38:47,109 --> 00:38:47,119
we have to be very careful about how we
 

2273
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:50,470
we have to be very careful about how we
edit genomes and edit synthetic biology

2274
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:50,480
edit genomes and edit synthetic biology
 

2275
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,790
edit genomes and edit synthetic biology
to do things so that's kind of that's

2276
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:52,800
to do things so that's kind of that's
 

2277
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,150
to do things so that's kind of that's
where things might go wrong in the same

2278
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:54,160
where things might go wrong in the same
 

2279
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,750
where things might go wrong in the same
way as you know twitter turning

2280
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:55,760
way as you know twitter turning
 

2281
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,589
way as you know twitter turning
ourselves into kind of

2282
00:38:57,589 --> 00:38:57,599
ourselves into kind of
 

2283
00:38:57,599 --> 00:38:59,349
ourselves into kind of
strange scale effects

2284
00:38:59,349 --> 00:38:59,359
strange scale effects
 

2285
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:00,390
strange scale effects
i would love

2286
00:39:00,390 --> 00:39:00,400
i would love
 

2287
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,310
i would love
origin of life research or artificial

2288
00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:02,320
origin of life research or artificial
 

2289
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,790
origin of life research or artificial
life research to get to the point where

2290
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:04,800
life research to get to the point where
 

2291
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,630
life research to get to the point where
we have those worries

2292
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:06,640
we have those worries
 

2293
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:07,990
we have those worries
because that's why i think we're just so

2294
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:08,000
because that's why i think we're just so
 

2295
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,069
because that's why i think we're just so
far away from that we are ju you know

2296
00:39:10,069 --> 00:39:10,079
far away from that we are ju you know
 

2297
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:11,510
far away from that we are ju you know
right now i think there are two really

2298
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:11,520
right now i think there are two really
 

2299
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:14,470
right now i think there are two really
important um angles there is the origin

2300
00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:14,480
important um angles there is the origin
 

2301
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,550
important um angles there is the origin
of life people researchers who are

2302
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:16,560
of life people researchers who are
 

2303
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,630
of life people researchers who are
faithfully working on this

2304
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:18,640
faithfully working on this
 

2305
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,550
faithfully working on this
and trying to make those molecules the

2306
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:20,560
and trying to make those molecules the
 

2307
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,630
and trying to make those molecules the
scan molecules i talk about

2308
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:22,640
scan molecules i talk about
 

2309
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,750
scan molecules i talk about
and then there are people on the

2310
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:23,760
and then there are people on the
 

2311
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,510
and then there are people on the
creationist side who's saying look the

2312
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:25,520
creationist side who's saying look the
 

2313
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,870
creationist side who's saying look the
fact you can't make these molecules and

2314
00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:26,880
fact you can't make these molecules and
 

2315
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,710
fact you can't make these molecules and
you can't make a cell means that um

2316
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:28,720
you can't make a cell means that um
 

2317
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,310
you can't make a cell means that um
evolution isn't true and all this other

2318
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:30,320
evolution isn't true and all this other
 

2319
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,870
evolution isn't true and all this other
stuff gotcha yeah and so and

2320
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:32,880
stuff gotcha yeah and so and
 

2321
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,390
stuff gotcha yeah and so and
i find that really frustrating because

2322
00:39:34,390 --> 00:39:34,400
i find that really frustrating because
 

2323
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,910
i find that really frustrating because
actually the origin of life researchers

2324
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:35,920
actually the origin of life researchers
 

2325
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,069
actually the origin of life researchers
are all working in good faith right yes

2326
00:39:38,069 --> 00:39:38,079
are all working in good faith right yes
 

2327
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:40,550
are all working in good faith right yes
and and so what i'm trying to do is give

2328
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:40,560
and and so what i'm trying to do is give
 

2329
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,230
and and so what i'm trying to do is give
origin of life research a little bit

2330
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:42,240
origin of life research a little bit
 

2331
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:45,349
origin of life research a little bit
more of a of a of an open

2332
00:39:45,349 --> 00:39:45,359
more of a of a of an open
 

2333
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:47,750
more of a of a of an open
an open context and one of the things i

2334
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:47,760
an open context and one of the things i
 

2335
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,990
an open context and one of the things i
think is important um i really want to

2336
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:50,000
think is important um i really want to
 

2337
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,310
think is important um i really want to
make a new life form in my lifetime i

2338
00:39:52,310 --> 00:39:52,320
make a new life form in my lifetime i
 

2339
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,230
make a new life form in my lifetime i
really want to prove that life

2340
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:54,240
really want to prove that life
 

2341
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,310
really want to prove that life
is a general phenomena a bit like

2342
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:56,320
is a general phenomena a bit like
 

2343
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,550
is a general phenomena a bit like
gravity in the universe because i think

2344
00:39:58,550 --> 00:39:58,560
gravity in the universe because i think
 

2345
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,069
gravity in the universe because i think
that's going to be really important for

2346
00:40:00,069 --> 00:40:00,079
that's going to be really important for
 

2347
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:01,910
that's going to be really important for
humanity's um

2348
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:01,920
humanity's um
 

2349
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:02,950
humanity's um
global

2350
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:02,960
global
 

2351
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,870
global
psychological state

2352
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:04,880
psychological state
 

2353
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,990
psychological state
meaning going forward that's beautifully

2354
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:08,000
meaning going forward that's beautifully
 

2355
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,069
meaning going forward that's beautifully
that's beautifully put so one it will

2356
00:40:10,069 --> 00:40:10,079
that's beautifully put so one it will
 

2357
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:12,309
that's beautifully put so one it will
help us understand ourselves

2358
00:40:12,309 --> 00:40:12,319
help us understand ourselves
 

2359
00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:14,790
help us understand ourselves
so that's useful for science but two it

2360
00:40:14,790 --> 00:40:14,800
so that's useful for science but two it
 

2361
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,150
so that's useful for science but two it
gives us

2362
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:16,160
gives us
 

2363
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:19,349
gives us
a kind of hope if not uh

2364
00:40:19,349 --> 00:40:19,359
a kind of hope if not uh
 

2365
00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:20,870
a kind of hope if not uh
an awe

2366
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:20,880
an awe
 

2367
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:24,790
an awe
at all the huge amounts of alien

2368
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:24,800
at all the huge amounts of alien
 

2369
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,550
at all the huge amounts of alien
civilizations that are out there if you

2370
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:26,560
civilizations that are out there if you
 

2371
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,069
civilizations that are out there if you
can build life

2372
00:40:28,069 --> 00:40:28,079
can build life
 

2373
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:30,150
can build life
and understand just how easy it is to

2374
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:30,160
and understand just how easy it is to
 

2375
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,910
and understand just how easy it is to
build life

2376
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:31,920
build life
 

2377
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,790
build life
then that's just as good if not much

2378
00:40:34,790 --> 00:40:34,800
then that's just as good if not much
 

2379
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,349
then that's just as good if not much
better than discovering life on another

2380
00:40:37,349 --> 00:40:37,359
better than discovering life on another
 

2381
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:39,829
better than discovering life on another
planet yeah it's

2382
00:40:39,829 --> 00:40:39,839
planet yeah it's
 

2383
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:42,950
planet yeah it's
i mean it's cheaper it's much cheaper

2384
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:42,960
i mean it's cheaper it's much cheaper
 

2385
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,390
i mean it's cheaper it's much cheaper
and much easier

2386
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:44,400
and much easier
 

2387
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,910
and much easier
and uh

2388
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:45,920
and uh
 

2389
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,589
and uh
probably much more conclusive because

2390
00:40:47,589 --> 00:40:47,599
probably much more conclusive because
 

2391
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:49,910
probably much more conclusive because
once you're able to create life

2392
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:49,920
once you're able to create life
 

2393
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,550
once you're able to create life
like you said it's a search problem that

2394
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:52,560
like you said it's a search problem that
 

2395
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:53,430
like you said it's a search problem that
uh

2396
00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:53,440
uh
 

2397
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,790
uh
there's probably a lot of different ways

2398
00:40:54,790 --> 00:40:54,800
there's probably a lot of different ways
 

2399
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,109
there's probably a lot of different ways
to do it so once you create the once you

2400
00:40:57,109 --> 00:40:57,119
to do it so once you create the once you
 

2401
00:40:57,119 --> 00:40:58,790
to do it so once you create the once you
find the first solution

2402
00:40:58,790 --> 00:40:58,800
find the first solution
 

2403
00:40:58,800 --> 00:40:59,910
find the first solution
you probably have all the right

2404
00:40:59,910 --> 00:40:59,920
you probably have all the right
 

2405
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,589
you probably have all the right
methodology for finding all kinds of

2406
00:41:01,589 --> 00:41:01,599
methodology for finding all kinds of
 

2407
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:03,349
methodology for finding all kinds of
other solutions yeah and wouldn't it be

2408
00:41:03,349 --> 00:41:03,359
other solutions yeah and wouldn't it be
 

2409
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:05,430
other solutions yeah and wouldn't it be
great if we could find a solution i mean

2410
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:05,440
great if we could find a solution i mean
 

2411
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,430
great if we could find a solution i mean
it's probably a bit late for

2412
00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:07,440
it's probably a bit late for
 

2413
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,030
it's probably a bit late for
i mean i worry about climate change but

2414
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:09,040
i mean i worry about climate change but
 

2415
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,150
i mean i worry about climate change but
i'm not that worried about climate

2416
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:10,160
i'm not that worried about climate
 

2417
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,990
i'm not that worried about climate
change and i think what one day you

2418
00:41:11,990 --> 00:41:12,000
change and i think what one day you
 

2419
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,270
change and i think what one day you
could think about

2420
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:13,280
could think about
 

2421
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,790
could think about
could we engineer a new type of life

2422
00:41:14,790 --> 00:41:14,800
could we engineer a new type of life
 

2423
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:17,109
could we engineer a new type of life
form that could basically and i i don't

2424
00:41:17,109 --> 00:41:17,119
form that could basically and i i don't
 

2425
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:18,390
form that could basically and i i don't

that might have been a legitimate way to

that might have been a legitimate way to
kind of truncate the surface space

kind of truncate the surface space

but in the outer solar system we might
 

2501
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,309
but in the outer solar system we might
have completely different life forms on

have completely different life forms on

did you just say that you think in terms

life started on mar like uh

2516
00:42:41,990 --> 00:42:42,000
life started on mar like uh
 

2517
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,150
life started on mar like uh
statistically speaking life started on

2518
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:44,160
statistically speaking life started on
 

2519
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,230
statistically speaking life started on
mars and seeded earth it could be

2520
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:46,240
mars and seeded earth it could be
 

2521
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:48,950
mars and seeded earth it could be
possible because life was like so mars

2522
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:48,960
possible because life was like so mars
 

2523
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,870
possible because life was like so mars
was habitable uh for the type of life

2524
00:42:50,870 --> 00:42:50,880
was habitable uh for the type of life
 

2525
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:52,550
was habitable uh for the type of life
that we have right now type of chemistry

2526
00:42:52,550 --> 00:42:52,560
that we have right now type of chemistry
 

2527
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:55,829
that we have right now type of chemistry
before earth so it seems to me that like

2528
00:42:55,829 --> 00:42:55,839
before earth so it seems to me that like
 

2529
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:58,870
before earth so it seems to me that like
mars got searching doing chemistry

2530
00:42:58,870 --> 00:42:58,880
mars got searching doing chemistry
 

2531
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:01,430
mars got searching doing chemistry
and started way before yeah and so they

2532
00:43:01,430 --> 00:43:01,440
and started way before yeah and so they
 

2533
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,190
and started way before yeah and so they
had a few more replicators and some

2534
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:03,200
had a few more replicators and some
 

2535
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,349
had a few more replicators and some
other stuff and if those replicas got

2536
00:43:05,349 --> 00:43:05,359
other stuff and if those replicas got
 

2537
00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:07,589
other stuff and if those replicas got
ejected from mars and landed on earth

2538
00:43:07,589 --> 00:43:07,599
ejected from mars and landed on earth
 

2539
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:09,030
ejected from mars and landed on earth
and earth would like

2540
00:43:09,030 --> 00:43:09,040
and earth would like
 

2541
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:11,430
and earth would like
i don't need to start again right

2542
00:43:11,430 --> 00:43:11,440
i don't need to start again right
 

2543
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,030
i don't need to start again right
thanks for that and then it just carries

2544
00:43:13,030 --> 00:43:13,040
thanks for that and then it just carries
 

2545
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:15,430
thanks for that and then it just carries
on so i i'm not going i think there is

2546
00:43:15,430 --> 00:43:15,440
on so i i'm not going i think there is
 

2547
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:17,670
on so i i'm not going i think there is
we will find evidence of life on mars

2548
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:17,680
we will find evidence of life on mars
 

2549
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:19,910
we will find evidence of life on mars
either life we put there by mistake

2550
00:43:19,910 --> 00:43:19,920
either life we put there by mistake

00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:22,550
either life we put there by mistake
contamination or actually life the

2552
00:43:22,550 --> 00:43:22,560
contamination or actually life the
 

2553
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,390
contamination or actually life the
earliest remnants of life

2554
00:43:24,390 --> 00:43:24,400
earliest remnants of life
 

2555
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:25,910
earliest remnants of life
um and that would be really exciting

2556
00:43:25,910 --> 00:43:25,920
um and that would be really exciting
 

2557
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,990
um and that would be really exciting
it's a really good reason to go there

2558
00:43:27,990 --> 00:43:28,000
it's a really good reason to go there
 

2559
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,670
it's a really good reason to go there
but i think it's more unlikely because

2560
00:43:29,670 --> 00:43:29,680
but i think it's more unlikely because
 

2561
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:31,190
but i think it's more unlikely because
the gravitational situation in the solar

the gravitational situation in the solar
 

2563
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:32,550
the gravitational situation in the solar

00:43:34,630 --> 00:43:34,640
solar system titan and all that that
 

2567
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:36,870
solar system titan and all that that
would be its own thing exactly wow that

2568
00:43:36,870 --> 00:43:36,880
would be its own thing exactly wow that
 

2569
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,270
would be its own thing exactly wow that
would be so cool if we go to mars and we

2570
00:43:39,270 --> 00:43:39,280
would be so cool if we go to mars and we
 

2571
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:41,430
would be so cool if we go to mars and we
find life that looks a hell of a lot

2572
00:43:41,430 --> 00:43:41,440
find life that looks a hell of a lot
 

2573
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:43,670
find life that looks a hell of a lot
similar to earth life and then we'll go

2574
00:43:43,670 --> 00:43:43,680
similar to earth life and then we'll go
 

2575
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:44,790
similar to earth life and then we'll go
to uh

2576
00:43:44,790 --> 00:43:44,800
to uh
 

2577
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,870

2581
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:50,710
ices and the volcanoes and all that kind
of stuff and then we find there

2582
00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:50,720
of stuff and then we find there
 

2583
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,390
of stuff and then we find there
something that looks

2584
00:43:52,390 --> 00:43:52,400
something that looks
 

2585
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:55,829
something that looks
i don't know way weirder yeah some other

2586
00:43:55,829 --> 00:43:55,839
i don't know way weirder yeah some other
 

2587
00:43:55,839 --> 00:43:58,630
i don't know way weirder yeah some other
some non-rna type of in my situation

2588
00:43:58,630 --> 00:43:58,640
some non-rna type of in my situation
 

2589
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:00,550
some non-rna type of in my situation
almost life like in the prebiotic

2590
00:44:00,550 --> 00:44:00,560
almost life like in the prebiotic
 

2591
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,390
almost life like in the prebiotic
chemical space and i think there are

2592
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:02,400
chemical space and i think there are
 

2593
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:03,990
chemical space and i think there are
four types of exoplanets we can go look

2594
00:44:03,990 --> 00:44:04,000
four types of exoplanets we can go look
 

2595
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,630
four types of exoplanets we can go look
for right because when jwst goes up and

2596
00:44:06,630 --> 00:44:06,640
for right because when jwst goes up and
 

2597
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:08,230
for right because when jwst goes up and
touch wood it goes up and everything's

2598
00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:08,240
touch wood it goes up and everything's
 

2599
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:09,349
touch wood it goes up and everything's
fine

2600
00:44:09,349 --> 00:44:09,359
fine
 

2601
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:11,270
fine
when we look at a star we'll know

2602
00:44:11,270 --> 00:44:11,280
when we look at a star we'll know
 

2603
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:12,870
when we look at a star we'll know
statistically most stars have planets

2604
00:44:12,870 --> 00:44:12,880
statistically most stars have planets
 

2605
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:14,470
statistically most stars have planets
around them what type of planet are they

2606
00:44:14,470 --> 00:44:14,480
around them what type of planet are they
 

2607
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:16,230
around them what type of planet are they
are they going to be dead

2608
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:16,240
are they going to be dead
 

2609
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:17,670
are they going to be dead
are they going to be

2610
00:44:17,670 --> 00:44:17,680
are they going to be
 

2611
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:20,550
are they going to be
just a prebiotic origin of life coming

2612
00:44:20,550 --> 00:44:20,560
just a prebiotic origin of life coming
 

2613
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:23,109
just a prebiotic origin of life coming
so are they going to be technological

2614
00:44:23,109 --> 00:44:23,119
so are they going to be technological
 

2615
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:24,470
so are they going to be technological
and you know so with intelligence on

2616
00:44:24,470 --> 00:44:24,480
and you know so with intelligence on
 

2617
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:27,109
and you know so with intelligence on
them and will they will they have died

2618
00:44:27,109 --> 00:44:27,119
them and will they will they have died
 

2619
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:29,910
them and will they will they have died
so so you know from you know had life on

2620
00:44:29,910 --> 00:44:29,920
so so you know from you know had life on
 

2621
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:31,670
so so you know from you know had life on
them but all the four states therefore

2622
00:44:31,670 --> 00:44:31,680
them but all the four states therefore
 

2623
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,670
them but all the four states therefore
and so and suddenly it's a bit like i

2624
00:44:33,670 --> 00:44:33,680
and so and suddenly it's a bit like i
 

2625
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:35,190
and so and suddenly it's a bit like i
want to classify planets the way we

2626
00:44:35,190 --> 00:44:35,200
want to classify planets the way we
 

2627
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:38,630
want to classify planets the way we
classify stars yeah and i think that in

2628
00:44:38,630 --> 00:44:38,640
classify stars yeah and i think that in
 

2629
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:40,630
classify stars yeah and i think that in
terms of their rather than having this

2630
00:44:40,630 --> 00:44:40,640
terms of their rather than having this
 

2631
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:42,470
terms of their rather than having this
all we've found that we've found methane

2632
00:44:42,470 --> 00:44:42,480
all we've found that we've found methane
 

2633
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:43,670
all we've found that we've found methane
there's evidence of life we've found

2634
00:44:43,670 --> 00:44:43,680
there's evidence of life we've found
 

2635
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,349
there's evidence of life we've found
oxygen that's the evidence of life we

2636
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:45,359
oxygen that's the evidence of life we
 

2637
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:47,829
oxygen that's the evidence of life we
found whatever molecule marker

2638
00:44:47,829 --> 00:44:47,839
found whatever molecule marker
 

2639
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:50,309
found whatever molecule marker
um and start to then start frame things

2640
00:44:50,309 --> 00:44:50,319
um and start to then start frame things
 

2641
00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:52,309
um and start to then start frame things
a little bit more but as those four

2642
00:44:52,309 --> 00:44:52,319
a little bit more but as those four
 

2643
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:54,390
a little bit more but as those four
states yeah which by the way you're just

2644
00:44:54,390 --> 00:44:54,400
states yeah which by the way you're just
 

2645
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,109
states yeah which by the way you're just
saying four but there could be a um

2646
00:44:57,109 --> 00:44:57,119
saying four but there could be a um
 

2647
00:44:57,119 --> 00:44:59,510
saying four but there could be a um
before the dead there could be other

2648
00:44:59,510 --> 00:44:59,520
before the dead there could be other
 

2649
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:01,109
before the dead there could be other
states that we humans can't even

2650
00:45:01,109 --> 00:45:01,119
states that we humans can't even
 

2651
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:01,990
states that we humans can't even
conceive

2652
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:02,000
conceive
 

2653
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,550
conceive
just prebiotic almost alive you know got

2654
00:45:04,550 --> 00:45:04,560
just prebiotic almost alive you know got
 

2655
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:06,870
just prebiotic almost alive you know got
the possibility to come alive i think um

2656
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:06,880
the possibility to come alive i think um
 

2657
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:08,630
the possibility to come alive i think um
but there could be a post-technological

2658
00:45:08,630 --> 00:45:08,640
but there could be a post-technological
 

2659
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:11,910
but there could be a post-technological
like whatever we think of as technology

2660
00:45:11,910 --> 00:45:11,920
like whatever we think of as technology
 

2661
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:14,069
like whatever we think of as technology
that could be uh

2662
00:45:14,069 --> 00:45:14,079
that could be uh
 

2663
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:17,670
that could be uh
a like pre-conscious

2664
00:45:17,670 --> 00:45:17,680
a like pre-conscious
 

2665
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:19,990
a like pre-conscious
like well we all meld into one super

2666
00:45:19,990 --> 00:45:20,000
like well we all meld into one super
 

2667
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,589
like well we all meld into one super
intelligent conscious or some weird

2668
00:45:21,589 --> 00:45:21,599
intelligent conscious or some weird
 

2669
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:23,910
intelligent conscious or some weird
thing that naturally happens over time

2670
00:45:23,910 --> 00:45:23,920
thing that naturally happens over time
 

2671
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:29,910
thing that naturally happens over time
yeah i mean i i think that um

2672
00:45:29,910 --> 00:45:29,920

 

2673
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:32,630

we join into a virtual metaverse and and

2674
00:45:32,630 --> 00:45:32,640
we join into a virtual metaverse and and
 

2675
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:34,470
we join into a virtual metaverse and and
start creating which is kind of an

2676
00:45:34,470 --> 00:45:34,480
start creating which is kind of an
 

2677
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:36,870
start creating which is kind of an
interesting idea almost arbitrary

2678
00:45:36,870 --> 00:45:36,880
interesting idea almost arbitrary
 

2679
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:38,630
interesting idea almost arbitrary
uh number of copies of each other much

2680
00:45:38,630 --> 00:45:38,640
uh number of copies of each other much
 

2681
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:40,790
uh number of copies of each other much
more quickly so we can mess with

2682
00:45:40,790 --> 00:45:40,800
more quickly so we can mess with
 

2683
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:43,030
more quickly so we can mess with
different ideas like i can create a

2684
00:45:43,030 --> 00:45:43,040
different ideas like i can create a
 

2685
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:44,870
different ideas like i can create a
thousand copies of lex

2686
00:45:44,870 --> 00:45:44,880
thousand copies of lex
 

2687
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:47,910
thousand copies of lex
uh like every possible version of flex

2688
00:45:47,910 --> 00:45:47,920
uh like every possible version of flex
 

2689
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:50,470
uh like every possible version of flex
and then just see like and then i just

2690
00:45:50,470 --> 00:45:50,480
and then just see like and then i just
 

2691
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:52,309
and then just see like and then i just
have them like argue with each other and

2692
00:45:52,309 --> 00:45:52,319
have them like argue with each other and
 

2693
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:54,710
have them like argue with each other and
like until like in the space of ideas

2694
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:54,720
like until like in the space of ideas
 

2695
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:56,309
like until like in the space of ideas
and see who wins out

2696
00:45:56,309 --> 00:45:56,319
and see who wins out
 

2697
00:45:56,319 --> 00:45:58,069
and see who wins out
how how could that possibly go wrong but

2698
00:45:58,069 --> 00:45:58,079
how how could that possibly go wrong but
 

2699
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:00,550
how how could that possibly go wrong but
anyway but that there's uh especially in

2700
00:46:00,550 --> 00:46:00,560
anyway but that there's uh especially in
 

2701
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:02,230
anyway but that there's uh especially in
this digital space where you could start

2702
00:46:02,230 --> 00:46:02,240
this digital space where you could start
 

2703
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:04,630
this digital space where you could start
exploring with ai's mixed in you can

2704
00:46:04,630 --> 00:46:04,640
exploring with ai's mixed in you can
 

2705
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:06,230
exploring with ai's mixed in you can
start engineering arbitrary

2706
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:06,240
start engineering arbitrary
 

2707
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:08,710
start engineering arbitrary
intelligences you can start playing in

2708
00:46:08,710 --> 00:46:08,720
intelligences you can start playing in
 

2709
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:10,870
intelligences you can start playing in
the space of ideas which might move us

2710
00:46:10,870 --> 00:46:10,880
the space of ideas which might move us
 

2711
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:13,349
the space of ideas which might move us
into a world that looks very

2712
00:46:13,349 --> 00:46:13,359
into a world that looks very
 

2713
00:46:13,359 --> 00:46:15,190
into a world that looks very
different than a biological world like

2714
00:46:15,190 --> 00:46:15,200
different than a biological world like
 

2715
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:17,670
different than a biological world like
our current world the technology is

2716
00:46:17,670 --> 00:46:17,680
our current world the technology is
 

2717
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:19,750
our current world the technology is
still very much tied to our

2718
00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:19,760
still very much tied to our
 

2719
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:21,829
still very much tied to our
biology it's

2720
00:46:21,829 --> 00:46:21,839
biology it's
 

2721
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:24,069
biology it's
we we might move past that definitely we

2722
00:46:24,069 --> 00:46:24,079
we we might move past that definitely we
 

2723
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:25,270
we we might move past that definitely we
definitely will

2724
00:46:25,270 --> 00:46:25,280
definitely will
 

2725
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:26,950
definitely will
definitely that could be another phase

2726
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:26,960
definitely that could be another phase
 

2727
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:28,870
definitely that could be another phase
then sure because then you but i did say

2728
00:46:28,870 --> 00:46:28,880
then sure because then you but i did say
 

2729
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:30,470
then sure because then you but i did say
technological so i think i agree with

2730
00:46:30,470 --> 00:46:30,480
technological so i think i agree with
 

2731
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:31,829
technological so i think i agree with
you i think so you can have let's let's

2732
00:46:31,829 --> 00:46:31,839
you i think so you can have let's let's
 

2733
00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:33,190
you i think so you can have let's let's
get this right so

2734
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:33,200
get this right so
 

2735
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:36,069
get this right so
um dead world no prospective alive

2736
00:46:36,069 --> 00:46:36,079
um dead world no prospective alive
 

2737
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:39,829
um dead world no prospective alive
um prebiotic world life emerging living

2738
00:46:39,829 --> 00:46:39,839
um prebiotic world life emerging living
 

2739
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:41,510
um prebiotic world life emerging living
and technological and you probably and

2740
00:46:41,510 --> 00:46:41,520
and technological and you probably and
 

2741
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:42,630
and technological and you probably and
the dead one you probably won't be able

2742
00:46:42,630 --> 00:46:42,640
the dead one you probably won't be able
 

2743
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:43,910
the dead one you probably won't be able
to tell between the dead never been

2744
00:46:43,910 --> 00:46:43,920
to tell between the dead never been
 

2745
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:45,829
to tell between the dead never been
alive and the dead one

2746
00:46:45,829 --> 00:46:45,839
alive and the dead one
 

2747
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:47,190
alive and the dead one
maybe what some artifacts so maybe

2748
00:46:47,190 --> 00:46:47,200
maybe what some artifacts so maybe
 

2749
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:48,470
maybe what some artifacts so maybe
there's five there's probably not more

2750
00:46:48,470 --> 00:46:48,480
there's five there's probably not more
 

2751
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:50,870
there's five there's probably not more
than five um and i think the

2752
00:46:50,870 --> 00:46:50,880
than five um and i think the
 

2753
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:53,349
than five um and i think the
technological one could allow could have

2754
00:46:53,349 --> 00:46:53,359
technological one could allow could have
 

2755
00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:55,190
technological one could allow could have
life on it still but it might just have

2756
00:46:55,190 --> 00:46:55,200
life on it still but it might just have
 

2757
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:57,190
life on it still but it might just have
exceeded because uh you know one way

2758
00:46:57,190 --> 00:46:57,200
exceeded because uh you know one way
 

2759
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:58,950
exceeded because uh you know one way
that life might survive on earth is if

2760
00:46:58,950 --> 00:46:58,960
that life might survive on earth is if
 

2761
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:00,710
that life might survive on earth is if
we can work out how to deal with the

2762
00:47:00,710 --> 00:47:00,720
we can work out how to deal with the
 

2763
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:01,589
we can work out how to deal with the
coming

2764
00:47:01,589 --> 00:47:01,599
coming
 

2765
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:03,270
coming
the real climate change that comes when

2766
00:47:03,270 --> 00:47:03,280
the real climate change that comes when
 

2767
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:05,270
the real climate change that comes when
the sun expands

2768
00:47:05,270 --> 00:47:05,280
the sun expands
 

2769
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,109
the sun expands
there might be a way to survive that you

2770
00:47:07,109 --> 00:47:07,119
there might be a way to survive that you
 

2771
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:07,910
there might be a way to survive that you
know

2772
00:47:07,910 --> 00:47:07,920
know
 

2773
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:09,270
know
um

2774
00:47:09,270 --> 00:47:09,280
um
 

2775
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:11,109
um
but um yeah i think that we need to

2776
00:47:11,109 --> 00:47:11,119
but um yeah i think that we need to
 

2777
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:12,470
but um yeah i think that we need to
start thinking statistically when it

2778
00:47:12,470 --> 00:47:12,480
start thinking statistically when it
 

2779
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:13,510
start thinking statistically when it
comes to

2780
00:47:13,510 --> 00:47:13,520
comes to
 

2781
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:15,349
comes to
looking for life in the universe let me

2782
00:47:15,349 --> 00:47:15,359
looking for life in the universe let me
 

2783
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:16,630
looking for life in the universe let me
ask you then

2784
00:47:16,630 --> 00:47:16,640
ask you then
 

2785
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:18,710
ask you then
sort of uh

2786
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:18,720
sort of uh
 

2787
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:20,549
sort of uh
statistically

2788
00:47:20,549 --> 00:47:20,559
statistically
 

2789
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:22,870
statistically
how many alien civilizations are out

2790
00:47:22,870 --> 00:47:22,880
how many alien civilizations are out
 

2791
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:23,750
how many alien civilizations are out
there

2792
00:47:23,750 --> 00:47:23,760
there
 

2793
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:26,150
there
in those four phases that you're talking

2794
00:47:26,150 --> 00:47:26,160
in those four phases that you're talking
 

2795
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:28,390
in those four phases that you're talking
about when you look up the stars

2796
00:47:28,390 --> 00:47:28,400
about when you look up the stars
 

2797
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:30,710
about when you look up the stars
and you're sipping on some wine

2798
00:47:30,710 --> 00:47:30,720
and you're sipping on some wine
 

2799
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:33,109
and you're sipping on some wine
and um

2800
00:47:33,109 --> 00:47:33,119
and um
 

2801
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:34,549
and um
talking to other people with british

2802
00:47:34,549 --> 00:47:34,559
talking to other people with british
 

2803
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:36,390
talking to other people with british
accents about something intelligent

2804
00:47:36,390 --> 00:47:36,400
accents about something intelligent
 

2805
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:39,750
accents about something intelligent
intellectual i'm sure uh

2806
00:47:39,750 --> 00:47:39,760
intellectual i'm sure uh
 

2807
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:42,069
intellectual i'm sure uh
do you think there's uh a lot of alien

2808
00:47:42,069 --> 00:47:42,079
do you think there's uh a lot of alien
 

2809
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:44,230
do you think there's uh a lot of alien
civilizations looking back at us

2810
00:47:44,230 --> 00:47:44,240
civilizations looking back at us
 

2811
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:46,710
civilizations looking back at us
i'm wondering the same my

2812
00:47:46,710 --> 00:47:46,720
i'm wondering the same my
 

2813
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:49,349
i'm wondering the same my
romantic view of the universe is really

2814
00:47:49,349 --> 00:47:49,359
romantic view of the universe is really
 

2815
00:47:49,359 --> 00:47:52,230
romantic view of the universe is really
i'm taking loans from my logical self so

2816
00:47:52,230 --> 00:47:52,240
i'm taking loans from my logical self so
 

2817
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:54,069
i'm taking loans from my logical self so
what i'm saying is i have no doubt i

2818
00:47:54,069 --> 00:47:54,079
what i'm saying is i have no doubt i
 

2819
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:55,510
what i'm saying is i have no doubt i
have no idea

2820
00:47:55,510 --> 00:47:55,520
have no idea
 

2821
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:56,470
have no idea
but

2822
00:47:56,470 --> 00:47:56,480
but
 

2823
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:57,910
but
having said that

2824
00:47:57,910 --> 00:47:57,920
having said that
 

2825
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:00,630
having said that
there is no reason to

2826
00:48:00,630 --> 00:48:00,640
there is no reason to
 

2827
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:03,270
there is no reason to
suppose that life is as hard as we first

2828
00:48:03,270 --> 00:48:03,280
suppose that life is as hard as we first
 

2829
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:04,630
suppose that life is as hard as we first
thought it was

2830
00:48:04,630 --> 00:48:04,640
thought it was
 

2831
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:08,710
thought it was
and so if we just take earth as a marker

2832
00:48:08,710 --> 00:48:08,720
and so if we just take earth as a marker
 

2833
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:11,270
and so if we just take earth as a marker
and if i think that life is a much more

2834
00:48:11,270 --> 00:48:11,280
and if i think that life is a much more
 

2835
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:13,190
and if i think that life is a much more
general phenomena than just our biology

2836
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:13,200
general phenomena than just our biology
 

2837
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:15,589
general phenomena than just our biology
then i think the the universe is full of

2838
00:48:15,589 --> 00:48:15,599
then i think the the universe is full of
 

2839
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:16,549
then i think the the universe is full of
life

2840
00:48:16,549 --> 00:48:16,559
life
 

2841
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:18,230
life
and the firm the reason for the fermi

2842
00:48:18,230 --> 00:48:18,240
and the firm the reason for the fermi
 

2843
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:21,349
and the firm the reason for the fermi
paradox is not that um

2844
00:48:21,349 --> 00:48:21,359
paradox is not that um
 

2845
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:22,710
paradox is not that um
they're not out there it's just that we

2846
00:48:22,710 --> 00:48:22,720
they're not out there it's just that we
 

2847
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:24,870
they're not out there it's just that we
can't interact with the other life forms

2848
00:48:24,870 --> 00:48:24,880
can't interact with the other life forms
 

2849
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:26,870
can't interact with the other life forms
because they're so different

2850
00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:26,880
because they're so different
 

2851
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:27,990
because they're so different
and i'm not saying that they're

2852
00:48:27,990 --> 00:48:28,000
and i'm not saying that they're
 

2853
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,910
and i'm not saying that they're
necessarily like hasn't depicted in a

2854
00:48:29,910 --> 00:48:29,920
necessarily like hasn't depicted in a
 

2855
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:32,790
necessarily like hasn't depicted in a
rival or other you know um

2856
00:48:32,790 --> 00:48:32,800
rival or other you know um
 

2857
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:36,630
rival or other you know um
i'm just saying that perhaps

2858
00:48:36,630 --> 00:48:36,640
i'm just saying that perhaps
 

2859
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:38,630
i'm just saying that perhaps
there are very few universal facts in

2860
00:48:38,630 --> 00:48:38,640
there are very few universal facts in
 

2861
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:39,990
there are very few universal facts in
the universe

2862
00:48:39,990 --> 00:48:40,000
the universe
 

2863
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,030
the universe
and that and maybe um

2864
00:48:43,030 --> 00:48:43,040
and that and maybe um
 

2865
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:45,270
and that and maybe um
that is not it's quite the our

2866
00:48:45,270 --> 00:48:45,280
that is not it's quite the our
 

2867
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:47,750
that is not it's quite the our
technologies are quite divergent and so

2868
00:48:47,750 --> 00:48:47,760
technologies are quite divergent and so
 

2869
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:49,750
technologies are quite divergent and so
i think that it's very hard to know how

2870
00:48:49,750 --> 00:48:49,760
i think that it's very hard to know how
 

2871
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,589
i think that it's very hard to know how
we're going to interact with alien life

2872
00:48:51,589 --> 00:48:51,599
we're going to interact with alien life
 

2873
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:53,190
we're going to interact with alien life
you think there's a lot of kinds of life

2874
00:48:53,190 --> 00:48:53,200
you think there's a lot of kinds of life
 

2875
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:54,630
you think there's a lot of kinds of life
that's possible i guess that was the

2876
00:48:54,630 --> 00:48:54,640
that's possible i guess that was the
 

2877
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,390
that's possible i guess that was the
intuition yeah

2878
00:48:56,390 --> 00:48:56,400
intuition yeah
 

2879
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,950
intuition yeah
you provided that uh

2880
00:48:58,950 --> 00:48:58,960
you provided that uh
 

2881
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:00,390
you provided that uh
the way

2882
00:49:00,390 --> 00:49:00,400
the way
 

2883
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:03,510
the way

2885
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:06,470

kind of biology that we have on earth
 

2887
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:08,549
kind of biology that we have on earth
uh is

00:49:08,549 --> 00:49:08,559
uh is

we're almost
unable to see the alternative

00:49:25,829 --> 00:49:25,839
unable to see the alternative

00:49:27,670 --> 00:49:27,680
versions of us
 

2907
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:31,270
versions of us
huh i mean we'll still be able to detect

2908
00:49:31,270 --> 00:49:31,280
huh i mean we'll still be able to detect
 

2909
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:32,870
huh i mean we'll still be able to detect
them we'll still be able to interact

2910
00:49:32,870 --> 00:49:32,880
them we'll still be able to interact
 

2911
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:35,270
them we'll still be able to interact
with them we'll still be able to

2912
00:49:35,270 --> 00:49:35,280
with them we'll still be able to
 

2913
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:38,390
with them we'll still be able to
like which uh what's exactly is lost in

2914
00:49:38,390 --> 00:49:38,400
like which uh what's exactly is lost in
 

2915
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:40,790
like which uh what's exactly is lost in
translation why can't we why can't we

2916
00:49:40,790 --> 00:49:40,800
translation why can't we why can't we
 

2917
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,549
translation why can't we why can't we
see them why can't we talk to them

2918
00:49:42,549 --> 00:49:42,559
see them why can't we talk to them
 

2919
00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:44,870
see them why can't we talk to them
because i too

2920
00:49:44,870 --> 00:49:44,880
because i too
 

2921
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:47,750
because i too
have a sense

2922
00:49:47,750 --> 00:49:47,760

 

2923
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:51,430

you put it way more poetically but

2924
00:49:51,430 --> 00:49:51,440
you put it way more poetically but
 

2925
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:53,109
you put it way more poetically but
it seems both

2926
00:49:53,109 --> 00:49:53,119
it seems both
 

2927
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:54,790
it seems both

2930
00:49:56,390 --> 00:49:56,400
and uh
 

2931
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:58,470
and uh
sort of romantically

00:49:58,470 --> 00:49:58,480
sort of romantically
 

2933
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:00,710
sort of romantically
it feels like the universe should be

2934
00:50:00,710 --> 00:50:00,720
it feels like the universe should be
 

2935
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:03,349
it feels like the universe should be
teeming with life like super intelligent

2936

life
 

2939
00:50:04,319 --> 00:50:07,990
life
and and uh i just i i sit there and the

2940
00:50:07,990 --> 00:50:08,000
and and uh i just i i sit there and the
 

2941
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,710

00:50:10,710 --> 00:50:10,720
fermi paradox is very
 

2943
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:12,950
fermi paradox is very
it's felt very distinctly by me when i

2944
00:50:12,950 --> 00:50:12,960
it's felt very distinctly by me when i
 

2945
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:15,589
it's felt very distinctly by me when i
look up at the stars because it's like

2946
00:50:15,589 --> 00:50:15,599
look up at the stars because it's like
 

2947
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:17,910
look up at the stars because it's like
it it's uh the same way i feel when i'm

2948
00:50:17,910 --> 00:50:17,920
it it's uh the same way i feel when i'm
 

2949
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:19,430
it it's uh the same way i feel when i'm

driving through new jersey and listening
 

2951
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:21,510
driving through new jersey and listening
to bruce springsteen and i feel quite

2952
00:50:21,510 --> 00:50:21,520
to bruce springsteen and i feel quite
 

2953
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:22,630

sad

2954
00:50:22,630 --> 00:50:22,640
sad
 

2955
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:24,390
sad
uh it's like louis c.k talks about

2956
00:50:24,390 --> 00:50:24,400
uh it's like louis c.k talks about
 

2957
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:25,829
uh it's like louis c.k talks about
pulling off to the side of the road and

2958
00:50:25,829 --> 00:50:25,839
pulling off to the side of the road and
 

2959
00:50:25,839 --> 00:50:28,150
pulling off to the side of the road and
just weeping a little bit i'm almost

2960
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:28,160
just weeping a little bit i'm almost
 

2961
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:29,990
just weeping a little bit i'm almost
like

2962
00:50:29,990 --> 00:50:30,000
like
 

2963
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,470
like
wondering like hey why why aren't you

2964
00:50:32,470 --> 00:50:32,480
wondering like hey why why aren't you
 

2965
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:34,790
wondering like hey why why aren't you
talking to us you know it feels lonely

2966
00:50:34,790 --> 00:50:34,800
talking to us you know it feels lonely
 

2967
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,150
talking to us you know it feels lonely
it feels lonely because it feels like

2968
00:50:36,150 --> 00:50:36,160
it feels lonely because it feels like
 

2969
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:38,069
it feels lonely because it feels like
they're out there

2970
00:50:38,069 --> 00:50:38,079
they're out there
 

2971
00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:39,430
they're out there
i think that there are a number of

2972
00:50:39,430 --> 00:50:39,440
i think that there are a number of
 

2973
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:40,549
i think that there are a number of
answers to that i think the firming

2974
00:50:40,549 --> 00:50:40,559
answers to that i think the firming
 

2975
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:43,270
answers to that i think the firming
paradox is is perhaps based on the

2976
00:50:43,270 --> 00:50:43,280
paradox is is perhaps based on the
 

2977
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:45,589
paradox is is perhaps based on the
the assumption that there's

2978
00:50:45,589 --> 00:50:45,599
the assumption that there's
 

2979
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:47,190
the assumption that there's
if life did emerge in the universe it

2980
00:50:47,190 --> 00:50:47,200
if life did emerge in the universe it
 

2981
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:48,950
if life did emerge in the universe it
would be similar to our life

2982
00:50:48,950 --> 00:50:48,960
would be similar to our life
 

2983
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:50,790
would be similar to our life
and there's only one solution

2984
00:50:50,790 --> 00:50:50,800
and there's only one solution
 

2985
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:52,230
and there's only one solution
um and i think that what we've got to

2986
00:50:52,230 --> 00:50:52,240
um and i think that what we've got to
 

2987
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:54,150
um and i think that what we've got to
start to do is go out and look for

2988
00:50:54,150 --> 00:50:54,160
start to do is go out and look for
 

2989
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:56,069
start to do is go out and look for
selection detection

2990
00:50:56,069 --> 00:50:56,079
selection detection
 

2991
00:50:56,079 --> 00:50:58,230
selection detection
rather than an evolution detection

2992
00:50:58,230 --> 00:50:58,240
rather than an evolution detection
 

2993
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:01,270
rather than an evolution detection
rather than life detection

2994
00:51:01,270 --> 00:51:01,280
rather than life detection
 

2995
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:02,950
rather than life detection
and i and i think that once we start to

2996
00:51:02,950 --> 00:51:02,960
and i and i think that once we start to
 

2997
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:05,270
and i and i think that once we start to
do that we might start to see really

2998
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:05,280
do that we might start to see really
 

2999
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:07,030
do that we might start to see really
interesting things

3000
00:51:07,030 --> 00:51:07,040
interesting things
 

3001
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:08,230
interesting things
and we haven't been doing this for very

3002
00:51:08,230 --> 00:51:08,240
and we haven't been doing this for very
 

3003
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:09,990
and we haven't been doing this for very
long um

3004
00:51:09,990 --> 00:51:10,000
long um
 

3005
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,990
long um
and we are living in an expanding

3006
00:51:11,990 --> 00:51:12,000
and we are living in an expanding
 

3007
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,430
and we are living in an expanding
universe and that makes the problem a

3008
00:51:13,430 --> 00:51:13,440
universe and that makes the problem a
 

3009
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:15,589
universe and that makes the problem a
little bit harder

3010
00:51:15,589 --> 00:51:15,599
little bit harder
 

3011
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:17,510
little bit harder

everybody's always leaving
 

3013
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:20,069
everybody's always leaving

3015
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:22,710
um but i'm i'm distance wise i'm very

coming out i was working on a paper

3054
00:51:56,470 --> 00:51:56,480
coming out i was working on a paper
 

3055
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:59,430
coming out i was working on a paper
um a life detection paper and i found it

3056
00:51:59,430 --> 00:51:59,440
um a life detection paper and i found it
 

3057
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:01,829
um a life detection paper and i found it
was so hard to publish this paper

3058
00:52:01,829 --> 00:52:01,839
was so hard to publish this paper
 

3059
00:52:01,839 --> 00:52:04,230
was so hard to publish this paper
and it was almost as depressing i got so

3060
00:52:04,230 --> 00:52:04,240
and it was almost as depressing i got so
 

3061
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:05,750
and it was almost as depressing i got so

of the the film and al astra like life

3068
00:52:11,910 --> 00:52:11,920
of the the film and al astra like life
 

3069
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:13,589
of the the film and al astra like life
is there's no no life elsewhere in the

and but i but i'm incredibly optimistic
 

3075
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:18,790
and but i but i'm incredibly optimistic
that i think we will find life in the

that i think we will find life in the
 

3077
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:21,109
that i think we will find life in the
universe firm evidence of life and it

3078
00:52:21,109 --> 00:52:21,119
universe firm evidence of life and it
 

3079
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:23,109
universe firm evidence of life and it
will have to start on earth making life

3080
00:52:23,109 --> 00:52:23,119
will have to start on earth making life
 

3081
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:24,710
will have to start on earth making life
on earth and surprising as we have to

3082
00:52:24,710 --> 00:52:24,720
on earth and surprising as we have to
 

3083
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:26,190
on earth and surprising as we have to
surprise ourselves and make

surprise ourselves and make
 

3085
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:28,710
surprise ourselves and make
non-biological life on earth and then

3086
00:52:28,710 --> 00:52:28,720
non-biological life on earth and then
 

3087
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:30,790
non-biological life on earth and then
people say well you you made this life

3088
00:52:30,790 --> 00:52:30,800
people say well you you made this life
 

3089
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:32,470
people say well you you made this life
on earth therefore it's

00:52:32,470 --> 00:52:32,480
on earth therefore it's
 

3091
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:34,230

you're part of the causal chain of that
 

3093
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:36,950
you're part of the causal chain of that
and that might be true but if i can show

00:52:36,950 --> 00:52:36,960
and that might be true but if i can show
 

3095
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:39,510
and that might be true but if i can show
how i i i'm able to do it with

that that is it's possible now with

3128
00:53:11,670 --> 00:53:11,680
exoplanets i think
 

3129
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:13,349
exoplanets i think
not brilliantly but we'll be able to

3130
00:53:13,349 --> 00:53:13,359
not brilliantly but we'll be able to
 

3131
00:53:13,359 --> 00:53:15,190
not brilliantly but we'll be able to
start to classify them

3132
00:53:15,190 --> 00:53:15,200
start to classify them
 

3133
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:18,390
start to classify them
and we'll start to get a real

3134
00:53:18,390 --> 00:53:18,400
and we'll start to get a real
 

3135
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:20,230
and we'll start to get a real
feel for what's going on in the universe

3136
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:20,240
feel for what's going on in the universe
 

3137
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:22,230
feel for what's going on in the universe
on these exoplanets because it's only in

3138
00:53:22,230 --> 00:53:22,240
on these exoplanets because it's only in
 

3139
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:23,589
on these exoplanets because it's only in
the last

3140
00:53:23,589 --> 00:53:23,599
the last
 

3141
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:25,990
the last
few decades i think maybe even last

3142
00:53:25,990 --> 00:53:26,000
few decades i think maybe even last
 

3143
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:30,150
few decades i think maybe even last
decade that we even

3144
00:53:30,150 --> 00:53:30,160

 

3145
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:32,470

came to recognize that exoplanets even

3146
00:53:32,470 --> 00:53:32,480
came to recognize that exoplanets even
 

3147
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:33,750
came to recognize that exoplanets even
are common

3148
00:53:33,750 --> 00:53:33,760
are common
 

3149
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:35,510
are common
and i think that that gives us a lot of

3150
00:53:35,510 --> 00:53:35,520
and i think that that gives us a lot of
 

3151
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:37,589
and i think that that gives us a lot of
optimism that life is

3152
00:53:37,589 --> 00:53:37,599
optimism that life is
 

3153
00:53:37,599 --> 00:53:39,109
optimism that life is
going to be out there but i think we

3154
00:53:39,109 --> 00:53:39,119
going to be out there but i think we
 

3155
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:42,390
going to be out there but i think we
have to start framing um

3156
00:53:42,390 --> 00:53:42,400
have to start framing um
 

3157
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:43,990
have to start framing um
we have to start preparing the fact that

3158
00:53:43,990 --> 00:53:44,000
we have to start preparing the fact that
 

3159
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,790
we have to start preparing the fact that
biology is only one solution

3160

biology is only one solution
 

3161
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:48,549
biology is only one solution
i can tell you with confidence that

3162
00:53:48,549 --> 00:53:48,559
i can tell you with confidence that
 

3163
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:51,670
i can tell you with confidence that
biology on earth does not exist anywhere

3164
00:53:51,670 --> 00:53:51,680
biology on earth does not exist anywhere
 

3165
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:53,589
biology on earth does not exist anywhere
else in the universe we are absolutely

3166
00:53:53,589 --> 00:53:53,599
else in the universe we are absolutely
 

3167
00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:54,630
else in the universe we are absolutely

3168
00:53:54,630 --> 00:53:54,640
unique
 

3169
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:57,910
unique
well okay i love the confidence but uh

3170
00:53:57,910 --> 00:53:57,920
well okay i love the confidence but uh
 

3171
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:00,069
well okay i love the confidence but uh
where does

3172
00:54:00,069 --> 00:54:00,079
where does
 

3173
00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:02,309
where does
that confidence come from you know

3174
00:54:02,309 --> 00:54:02,319
that confidence come from you know
 

3175
00:54:02,319 --> 00:54:03,829

chemistry
 

3177
00:54:03,839 --> 00:54:04,870

00:54:04,870 --> 00:54:04,880
uh
 

3179
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:06,790
uh
like how many options does chemistry

3180
00:54:06,790 --> 00:54:06,800
like how many options does chemistry
 

3181
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:08,870
like how many options does chemistry
really have many that's the point and

3182
00:54:08,870 --> 00:54:08,880
really have many that's the point and
 

3183
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:10,470
really have many that's the point and
the thing is this is where the origin of

00:54:10,470 --> 00:54:10,480
the thing is this is where the origin of
 

3185
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:12,069
the thing is this is where the origin of
life scam comes in

life scam comes in
 

3187
00:54:12,079 --> 00:54:12,790
life scam comes in
uh

3188
00:54:12,790 --> 00:54:12,800
uh
 

3189
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:14,069
uh
is that people

3190
00:54:14,069 --> 00:54:14,079
is that people
 

3191
00:54:14,079 --> 00:54:15,670
is that people
don't quite count they don't count the

3192
00:54:15,670 --> 00:54:15,680
don't quite count they don't count the
 

3193
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:18,870
don't quite count they don't count the
numbers so if biology as you find on

3194
00:54:18,870 --> 00:54:18,880
numbers so if biology as you find on
 

3195
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:20,230
numbers so if biology as you find on
earth is common everywhere then there's

3196
00:54:20,230 --> 00:54:20,240
earth is common everywhere then there's
 

3197
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:21,589
earth is common everywhere then there's
something really weird going on that

3198
00:54:21,589 --> 00:54:21,599
something really weird going on that
 

3199
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:23,270
something really weird going on that

basically written in the quantum
 

3201
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:24,950
basically written in the quantum

life is contingent the the origin of
 

3211
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:34,710
life is contingent the the origin of
life on earth was contingent upon the

so that means if we want to find other

00:54:40,549 --> 00:54:40,559
so that means if we want to find other
 

3221
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:43,430
so that means if we want to find other
life like other earth-like worlds we

life like other earth-like worlds we
look for the same kind of rocky world we

3224
00:54:45,109 --> 00:54:45,119
look for the same kind of rocky world we
 

3225
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:47,349
look for the same kind of rocky world we
might look in the same zone as as as

3226
00:54:47,349 --> 00:54:47,359
might look in the same zone as as as
 

3227
00:54:47,359 --> 00:54:49,589
might look in the same zone as as as
earth and we might expect

3228
00:54:49,589 --> 00:54:49,599
earth and we might expect
 

3229
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:51,589
earth and we might expect
reasonably to find

3230
00:54:51,589 --> 00:54:51,599
reasonably to find
 

3231
00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:53,910
reasonably to find
biological like stuff going on that

3232
00:54:53,910 --> 00:54:53,920
biological like stuff going on that
 

3233
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:55,670
biological like stuff going on that
would be a reasonable hypothesis but it

3234
00:54:55,670 --> 00:54:55,680
would be a reasonable hypothesis but it
 

3235
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:57,829
would be a reasonable hypothesis but it
won't be the same it can't be it's like

3236
00:54:57,829 --> 00:54:57,839
won't be the same it can't be it's like
 

3237
00:54:57,839 --> 00:54:59,030
won't be the same it can't be it's like
saying

3238
00:54:59,030 --> 00:54:59,040
saying
 

3239
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:01,349
saying
i don't believe in magic that's why i

3240
00:55:01,349 --> 00:55:01,359
i don't believe in magic that's why i
 

3241
00:55:01,359 --> 00:55:03,670
i don't believe in magic that's why i
i'm sure i just don't believe in magic i

3242
00:55:03,670 --> 00:55:03,680
i'm sure i just don't believe in magic i
 

3243
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:05,270
i'm sure i just don't believe in magic i
believe in statistics and i can do

3244
00:55:05,270 --> 00:55:05,280
believe in statistics and i can do
 

3245
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:07,510
believe in statistics and i can do
experiments and and so i won't get the

3246
00:55:07,510 --> 00:55:07,520
experiments and and so i won't get the
 

3247
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:09,910
experiments and and so i won't get the
same exactly the same sequence of events

3248
00:55:09,910 --> 00:55:09,920
same exactly the same sequence of events
 

3249
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:11,349
same exactly the same sequence of events
i'll get something different

3250
00:55:11,349 --> 00:55:11,359
i'll get something different
 

3251
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:13,750
i'll get something different
and so there is tick tock elsewhere in

3252
00:55:13,750 --> 00:55:13,760
and so there is tick tock elsewhere in
 

3253
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:15,109
and so there is tick tock elsewhere in
the universe but it's not the same as

3254
00:55:15,109 --> 00:55:15,119
the universe but it's not the same as
 

3255
00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:16,630
the universe but it's not the same as
our tick tock right

3256
00:55:16,630 --> 00:55:16,640
our tick tock right
 

3257
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:18,470
our tick tock right
that's that's what i mean which aspect

3258
00:55:18,470 --> 00:55:18,480
that's that's what i mean which aspect
 

3259
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:20,870
that's that's what i mean which aspect
of it is not the same well i just think

3260
00:55:20,870 --> 00:55:20,880
of it is not the same well i just think
 

3261
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:22,069
of it is not the same well i just think
you you it

3262
00:55:22,069 --> 00:55:22,079
you you it
 

3263
00:55:22,079 --> 00:55:24,230
you you it
the so what is tick tock tick tock is a

3264
00:55:24,230 --> 00:55:24,240
the so what is tick tock tick tock is a
 

3265
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:26,230
the so what is tick tock tick tock is a
is a social media where people upload

3266
00:55:26,230 --> 00:55:26,240
is a social media where people upload
 

3267
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:28,549
is a social media where people upload
videos right of silly videos so i guess

3268
00:55:28,549 --> 00:55:28,559
videos right of silly videos so i guess
 

3269
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:30,309
videos right of silly videos so i guess
there might be there's humor there's

3270
00:55:30,309 --> 00:55:30,319
there might be there's humor there's
 

3271
00:55:30,319 --> 00:55:32,950
there might be there's humor there's
attention there's ability to process

3272
00:55:32,950 --> 00:55:32,960
attention there's ability to process
 

3273
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:35,349
attention there's ability to process
this ability for intelligent organisms

3274
00:55:35,349 --> 00:55:35,359
this ability for intelligent organisms
 

3275
00:55:35,359 --> 00:55:38,069
this ability for intelligent organisms
to collaborate on ideas and find human

3276
00:55:38,069 --> 00:55:38,079
to collaborate on ideas and find human
 

3277
00:55:38,079 --> 00:55:39,829
to collaborate on ideas and find human
ideas and play with those ideas make

3278
00:55:39,829 --> 00:55:39,839
ideas and play with those ideas make
 

3279
00:55:39,839 --> 00:55:42,150
ideas and play with those ideas make
them viral memes

3280
00:55:42,150 --> 00:55:42,160
them viral memes
 

3281
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:43,670
them viral memes
you know uh

3282
00:55:43,670 --> 00:55:43,680
you know uh
 

3283
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:45,349
you know uh
humor seems to be kind of fundamental to

3284
00:55:45,349 --> 00:55:45,359
humor seems to be kind of fundamental to
 

3285
00:55:45,359 --> 00:55:47,430
humor seems to be kind of fundamental to
the human experience and i think that um

3286
00:55:47,430 --> 00:55:47,440
the human experience and i think that um
 

3287
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:48,789
the human experience and i think that um
that's a really interesting question we

3288
00:55:48,789 --> 00:55:48,799
that's a really interesting question we
 

3289
00:55:48,799 --> 00:55:50,309
that's a really interesting question we
can ask is humor

3290
00:55:50,309 --> 00:55:50,319
can ask is humor
 

3291
00:55:50,319 --> 00:55:52,309
can ask is humor
a fundamental thing in the universe i

3292
00:55:52,309 --> 00:55:52,319
a fundamental thing in the universe i
 

3293
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:54,150
a fundamental thing in the universe i
think maybe it will be right in terms of

3294
00:55:54,150 --> 00:55:54,160
think maybe it will be right in terms of
 

3295
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:55,990
think maybe it will be right in terms of
if you think about in a game theoretic

3296
00:55:55,990 --> 00:55:56,000
if you think about in a game theoretic
 

3297
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,950
if you think about in a game theoretic
sense humor uh the emergence of humor

3298
00:55:58,950 --> 00:55:58,960
sense humor uh the emergence of humor
 

3299
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:01,670
sense humor uh the emergence of humor
serves a a role in our game engine and

3300
00:56:01,670 --> 00:56:01,680
serves a a role in our game engine and
 

3301
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:02,470
serves a a role in our game engine and
so

3302
00:56:02,470 --> 00:56:02,480
so
 

3303
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:04,230
so
if selection is fundamental in the

3304
00:56:04,230 --> 00:56:04,240
if selection is fundamental in the
 

3305
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:06,789
if selection is fundamental in the
universe and so is humor

3306
00:56:06,789 --> 00:56:06,799
universe and so is humor
 

3307
00:56:06,799 --> 00:56:10,230
universe and so is humor
well i don't actually don't know exactly

3308
00:56:10,230 --> 00:56:10,240
well i don't actually don't know exactly
 

3309
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:11,430
well i don't actually don't know exactly
what uh

3310
00:56:11,430 --> 00:56:11,440
what uh
 

3311
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:13,910
what uh
role humor serves maybe it's like uh

3312
00:56:13,910 --> 00:56:13,920
role humor serves maybe it's like uh
 

3313
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:16,470
role humor serves maybe it's like uh
from a chemical perspective it's uh like

3314
00:56:16,470 --> 00:56:16,480
from a chemical perspective it's uh like
 

3315
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:18,549
from a chemical perspective it's uh like
a catalyst

3316
00:56:18,549 --> 00:56:18,559
a catalyst
 

3317
00:56:18,559 --> 00:56:20,230
a catalyst
for uh

3318
00:56:20,230 --> 00:56:20,240
for uh
 

3319
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:21,670
for uh
i guess it's a several purpose one is

3320
00:56:21,670 --> 00:56:21,680
i guess it's a several purpose one is
 

3321
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:23,190
i guess it's a several purpose one is
the catalyst for spreading ideas on the

3322
00:56:23,190 --> 00:56:23,200
the catalyst for spreading ideas on the
 

3323
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:25,750
the catalyst for spreading ideas on the
internet that's modern humor but humor

3324
00:56:25,750 --> 00:56:25,760
internet that's modern humor but humor
 

3325
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:28,150
internet that's modern humor but humor
is also a good way to deal

3326
00:56:28,150 --> 00:56:28,160
is also a good way to deal
 

3327
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:30,710
is also a good way to deal
with the difficulty of life

3328
00:56:30,710 --> 00:56:30,720
with the difficulty of life
 

3329
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,230
with the difficulty of life
it's a kind of valve

3330
00:56:32,230 --> 00:56:32,240
it's a kind of valve
 

3331
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:35,349
it's a kind of valve
release valve for suffering

3332
00:56:35,349 --> 00:56:35,359
release valve for suffering
 

3333
00:56:35,359 --> 00:56:36,150
release valve for suffering
like

3334
00:56:36,150 --> 00:56:36,160
like
 

3335
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:37,750
like
throughout human history life has been

3336
00:56:37,750 --> 00:56:37,760
throughout human history life has been
 

3337
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:40,309
throughout human history life has been
really hard and for the people that i've

3338
00:56:40,309 --> 00:56:40,319
really hard and for the people that i've
 

3339
00:56:40,319 --> 00:56:41,670
really hard and for the people that i've
known in my life who've lived through

3340
00:56:41,670 --> 00:56:41,680
known in my life who've lived through
 

3341
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:42,950
known in my life who've lived through
some

3342
00:56:42,950 --> 00:56:42,960
some
 

3343
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:45,670
some
really difficult things uh humorous part

3344
00:56:45,670 --> 00:56:45,680
really difficult things uh humorous part
 

3345
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:47,750
really difficult things uh humorous part
of how they deal with that yeah this is

3346
00:56:47,750 --> 00:56:47,760
of how they deal with that yeah this is
 

3347
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:50,549
of how they deal with that yeah this is
usually dark humor but

3348
00:56:50,549 --> 00:56:50,559
usually dark humor but
 

3349
00:56:50,559 --> 00:56:52,470
usually dark humor but
yeah it's interesting i i don't know

3350
00:56:52,470 --> 00:56:52,480
yeah it's interesting i i don't know
 

3351
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:55,030
yeah it's interesting i i don't know
exactly sort of the what what's the more

3352
00:56:55,030 --> 00:56:55,040
exactly sort of the what what's the more
 

3353
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:57,349
exactly sort of the what what's the more
mathematically general way to formulate

3354
00:56:57,349 --> 00:56:57,359
mathematically general way to formulate
 

3355
00:56:57,359 --> 00:56:59,750
mathematically general way to formulate
what the hell is humor

3356
00:56:59,750 --> 00:56:59,760
what the hell is humor
 

3357
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:02,630
what the hell is humor
what humor does it serve but i i still

3358
00:57:02,630 --> 00:57:02,640
what humor does it serve but i i still
 

3359
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:06,150
what humor does it serve but i i still
we're kind of joking here but

3360
00:57:06,150 --> 00:57:06,160

 

3361
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:09,670

it's uh a counterintuitive idea to me

3362
00:57:09,670 --> 00:57:09,680
it's uh a counterintuitive idea to me
 

3363
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:11,670
it's uh a counterintuitive idea to me
to think that uh

3364
00:57:11,670 --> 00:57:11,680
to think that uh
 

3365
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:14,630
to think that uh
life elsewhere in the universe

3366
00:57:14,630 --> 00:57:14,640
life elsewhere in the universe
 

3367
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:17,349
life elsewhere in the universe
is very different than life on earth

3368
00:57:17,349 --> 00:57:17,359
is very different than life on earth
 

3369
00:57:17,359 --> 00:57:19,270
is very different than life on earth
and also

3370
00:57:19,270 --> 00:57:19,280
and also
 

3371
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:20,150
and also
like

3372
00:57:20,150 --> 00:57:20,160
like
 

3373
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:23,349
like
all of each instantiation of life

3374
00:57:23,349 --> 00:57:23,359
all of each instantiation of life
 

3375
00:57:23,359 --> 00:57:25,910
all of each instantiation of life
is likely very different from each other

3376
00:57:25,910 --> 00:57:25,920
is likely very different from each other
 

3377
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:28,549
is likely very different from each other
yeah like maybe there's a few clusters

3378
00:57:28,549 --> 00:57:28,559
yeah like maybe there's a few clusters
 

3379
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:30,470
yeah like maybe there's a few clusters
of similar like life

3380
00:57:30,470 --> 00:57:30,480
of similar like life
 

3381
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:33,030
of similar like life
but uh it's much more likely is what

3382
00:57:33,030 --> 00:57:33,040
but uh it's much more likely is what
 

3383
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:35,670
but uh it's much more likely is what
you're saying to me it's a kind of novel

3384
00:57:35,670 --> 00:57:35,680
you're saying to me it's a kind of novel
 

3385
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:37,349
you're saying to me it's a kind of novel
thought i'm not sure what to do with it

3386
00:57:37,349 --> 00:57:37,359
thought i'm not sure what to do with it
 

3387
00:57:37,359 --> 00:57:39,430
thought i'm not sure what to do with it
but you're saying that there's uh

3388
00:57:39,430 --> 00:57:39,440
but you're saying that there's uh
 

3389
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:43,190
but you're saying that there's uh
it's more common to be a weird outcast

3390
00:57:43,190 --> 00:57:43,200
it's more common to be a weird outcast
 

3391
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:45,430
it's more common to be a weird outcast
in the full spectrum of life than it is

3392
00:57:45,430 --> 00:57:45,440
in the full spectrum of life than it is
 

3393
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:48,630
in the full spectrum of life than it is
to be in some usual cluster so every

3394
00:57:48,630 --> 00:57:48,640
to be in some usual cluster so every
 

3395
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:50,870
to be in some usual cluster so every
instantiation of a kind of

00:57:50,870 --> 00:57:50,880
instantiation of a kind of
 

3397
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:52,630
instantiation of a kind of
chemistry that results in complexity

3398
00:57:52,630 --> 00:57:52,640
chemistry that results in complexity
 

3399
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:54,230
chemistry that results in complexity
that's autonomous and self-replicating

3400
00:57:54,230 --> 00:57:54,240
that's autonomous and self-replicating
 

3401
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:57,030
that's autonomous and self-replicating
however the hell you define life

3402
00:57:57,030 --> 00:57:57,040
however the hell you define life
 

3403
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:58,950
however the hell you define life
that is going to be very different every

3404
00:57:58,950 --> 00:57:58,960
that is going to be very different every
 

3405
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:01,270
that is going to be very different every
time i don't know i

3406
00:58:01,270 --> 00:58:01,280
time i don't know i
 

3407
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:03,190
time i don't know i
it feels like a selection

3408
00:58:03,190 --> 00:58:03,200
it feels like a selection
 

3409
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:04,069
it feels like a selection
is

3410
00:58:04,069 --> 00:58:04,079
is

00:58:04,079 --> 00:58:06,470
is
a fundamental kind of directed force in

00:58:06,470 --> 00:58:06,480
a fundamental kind of directed force in

00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:09,910
a fundamental kind of directed force in
the universe won't selection result in a

00:58:09,910 --> 00:58:09,920
the universe won't selection result in a
 

3415
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:12,470
the universe won't selection result in a
in a few pockets of interesting

3416
00:58:12,470 --> 00:58:12,480
in a few pockets of interesting
 

3417
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:14,309
in a few pockets of interesting
complexities i mean

3418
00:58:14,309 --> 00:58:14,319
complexities i mean
 

3419
00:58:14,319 --> 00:58:16,549
complexities i mean
yeah

3420
00:58:16,549 --> 00:58:16,559
yeah
 

3421
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:19,270
yeah
if we ran earth over

3422
00:58:19,270 --> 00:58:19,280
if we ran earth over
 

3423
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:21,030
if we ran earth over
again over and over and over you're

3424
00:58:21,030 --> 00:58:21,040
again over and over and over you're
 

3425
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:22,950
again over and over and over you're
saying it's going to come up but

3426
00:58:22,950 --> 00:58:22,960
saying it's going to come up but
 

3427
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:24,630
saying it's going to come up but
there's not going to be elephants every

3428
00:58:24,630 --> 00:58:24,640
there's not going to be elephants every
 

3429
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:25,829
there's not going to be elephants every
time

3430
00:58:25,829 --> 00:58:25,839
time
 

3431
00:58:25,839 --> 00:58:28,470
time
yeah i don't think so i think uh and i

3432
00:58:28,470 --> 00:58:28,480
yeah i don't think so i think uh and i
 

3433
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:30,309
yeah i don't think so i think uh and i
think that there will be similarities

3434
00:58:30,309 --> 00:58:30,319
think that there will be similarities
 

3435
00:58:30,319 --> 00:58:32,150
think that there will be similarities
and i think we know we don't know enough

3436
00:58:32,150 --> 00:58:32,160
and i think we know we don't know enough
 

3437
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:34,789
and i think we know we don't know enough
about how selection is um

3438
00:58:34,789 --> 00:58:34,799
about how selection is um
 

3439
00:58:34,799 --> 00:58:36,789
about how selection is um
globally works

3440
00:58:36,789 --> 00:58:36,799
globally works
 

3441
00:58:36,799 --> 00:58:37,670
globally works
um

3442
00:58:37,670 --> 00:58:37,680
um
 

3443
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:39,510
um
but it might be might be that the the

3444
00:58:39,510 --> 00:58:39,520
but it might be might be that the the
 

3445
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:40,549
but it might be might be that the the

elephant
 

3447
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:42,470
elephant
um the emergence of elephants was wired

3448
00:58:42,470 --> 00:58:42,480
um the emergence of elephants was wired
 

3449
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:44,230
um the emergence of elephants was wired
into the history of earth in some way

3450
00:58:44,230 --> 00:58:44,240
into the history of earth in some way
 

3451
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:46,230
into the history of earth in some way
like the gravitational force how

3452
00:58:46,230 --> 00:58:46,240
like the gravitational force how
 

3453
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:47,829
like the gravitational force how
evolution was going

3454
00:58:47,829 --> 00:58:47,839

emergence of mammals but i i just don't

3458
00:58:51,589 --> 00:58:51,599
emergence of mammals but i i just don't
 

3459
00:58:51,599 --> 00:58:53,510
emergence of mammals but i i just don't
know enough about the contingency right

3460
00:58:53,510 --> 00:58:53,520
know enough about the contingency right
 

3461
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:56,309
know enough about the contingency right
the variability all i do know is you

3462
00:58:56,309 --> 00:58:56,319
the variability all i do know is you
 

3463
00:58:56,319 --> 00:58:57,670
the variability all i do know is you
count the number of bits of information

3464
00:58:57,670 --> 00:58:57,680
count the number of bits of information
 

3465
00:58:57,680 --> 00:58:59,670
count the number of bits of information

elephant and
and

3470
00:59:02,150 --> 00:59:02,160
and
 

3471
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:03,589
and
think about the causal chain that

3472
00:59:03,589 --> 00:59:03,599
think about the causal chain that
 

3473
00:59:03,599 --> 00:59:05,750
think about the causal chain that
provide the lineage of elephants going

3474
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:05,760
provide the lineage of elephants going
 

3475
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:07,589
provide the lineage of elephants going
all the way back to luca

3476
00:59:07,589 --> 00:59:07,599
all the way back to luca
 

3477
00:59:07,599 --> 00:59:10,309
all the way back to luca
there's a huge scope for divergence

3478
00:59:10,309 --> 00:59:10,319
there's a huge scope for divergence
 

3479
00:59:10,319 --> 00:59:11,510
there's a huge scope for divergence
yeah but

3480
00:59:11,510 --> 00:59:11,520
yeah but
 

3481
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:13,910
yeah but
just like you said with chemistry and

3482
00:59:13,910 --> 00:59:13,920
just like you said with chemistry and
 

3483
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:16,150
just like you said with chemistry and
selection

3484
00:59:16,150 --> 00:59:16,160

00:59:18,390 --> 00:59:18,400
the the things that result in
 

3487
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:20,789
the the things that result in

3492
00:59:25,990 --> 00:59:26,000
and self-replicating organisms
 

3493
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,390
and self-replicating organisms
uh those are extremely unlikely as

3494
00:59:28,390 --> 00:59:28,400
uh those are extremely unlikely as
 

3495
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:30,069
uh those are extremely unlikely as
you're saying

3496
00:59:30,069 --> 00:59:30,079
you're saying
 

3497
00:59:30,079 --> 00:59:31,910
you're saying
uh but once they're successful they

3498
00:59:31,910 --> 00:59:31,920
uh but once they're successful they
 

3499
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:34,630
uh but once they're successful they
multiply so like i i just it might be a

00:59:34,630 --> 00:59:34,640
multiply so like i i just it might be a
 

3501
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:36,870
multiply so like i i just it might be a
tiny subset of all

3502
00:59:36,870 --> 00:59:36,880
tiny subset of all
 

3503
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:38,309

00:59:40,630 --> 00:59:40,640
universe chemically speaking it might be
 

3507
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:42,069
universe chemically speaking it might be
a very tiny subset is actually

3508
00:59:42,069 --> 00:59:42,079
a very tiny subset is actually
 

3509
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:44,470
a very tiny subset is actually
successful creating elephants

3510
00:59:44,470 --> 00:59:44,480
successful creating elephants
 

3511
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:46,710
successful creating elephants
or uh elephant like

3512
00:59:46,710 --> 00:59:46,720
or uh elephant like
 

3513
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:47,990
or uh elephant like
or slash human-like creatures well

3514
00:59:47,990 --> 00:59:48,000
or slash human-like creatures well
 

3515
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:48,950
or slash human-like creatures well
there's two different questions here's

3516
00:59:48,950 --> 00:59:48,960
there's two different questions here's
 

3517
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:51,270
there's two different questions here's
the first one if we were to reset earth

3518
00:59:51,270 --> 00:59:51,280
the first one if we were to reset earth
 

3519
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:52,789
the first one if we were to reset earth
and to start again

3520
00:59:52,789 --> 00:59:52,799
and to start again
 

3521
00:59:52,799 --> 00:59:54,150
and to start again
the different phases sorry to keep

3522
00:59:54,150 --> 00:59:54,160
the different phases sorry to keep
 

3523
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:56,309
the different phases sorry to keep
interrupting yeah no if we restart earth

3524
00:59:56,309 --> 00:59:56,319
interrupting yeah no if we restart earth
 

3525
00:59:56,319 --> 00:59:57,670
interrupting yeah no if we restart earth
and start again say we could go back

3526
00:59:57,670 --> 00:59:57,680
and start again say we could go back
 

3527
00:59:57,680 --> 00:59:58,789
and start again say we could go back
back to the beginning and do the

3528
00:59:58,789 --> 00:59:58,799
back to the beginning and do the
 

3529
00:59:58,799 --> 01:00:00,789
back to the beginning and do the
experiment or have a number of earths um

3530
01:00:00,789 --> 01:00:00,799
experiment or have a number of earths um
 

3531
01:00:00,799 --> 01:00:02,950
experiment or have a number of earths um
how similar would biology be i would say

3532
01:00:02,950 --> 01:00:02,960
how similar would biology be i would say
 

3533
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:04,789
how similar would biology be i would say
that there would be there would be broad

01:00:13,510 --> 01:00:13,520
each time and go try and try and
 

3545
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:15,589
each time and go try and try and
faithfully reproduce what happened

3546
01:00:15,589 --> 01:00:15,599
faithfully reproduce what happened
 

3547
01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:16,950
faithfully reproduce what happened
then there's the other the other thing

3548
01:00:16,950 --> 01:00:16,960
then there's the other the other thing
 

3549
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:17,910
then there's the other the other thing
about

3550
01:00:17,910 --> 01:00:17,920
about
 

3551
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:19,750
about
when you go to another earth-like planet

3552
01:00:19,750 --> 01:00:19,760
when you go to another earth-like planet
 

3553
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:21,109
when you go to another earth-like planet
elsewhere maybe there's a different

3554
01:00:21,109 --> 01:00:21,119
elsewhere maybe there's a different
 

3555
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:23,910
elsewhere maybe there's a different
ratio particular elements maybe there's

3556
01:00:23,910 --> 01:00:23,920
ratio particular elements maybe there's
 

3557
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:26,069
ratio particular elements maybe there's
uh the bom the bombardment at the

3558
01:00:26,069 --> 01:00:26,079
uh the bom the bombardment at the
 

3559
01:00:26,079 --> 01:00:28,390
uh the bom the bombardment at the
beginning the planet was quicker

3560
01:00:28,390 --> 01:00:28,400
beginning the planet was quicker
 

3561
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:31,270
beginning the planet was quicker
or longer than earth and and i just

3562
01:00:31,270 --> 01:00:31,280
or longer than earth and and i just
 

3563
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:32,870
or longer than earth and and i just
don't have enough information there what

3564
01:00:32,870 --> 01:00:32,880
don't have enough information there what
 

3565
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:34,069
don't have enough information there what
i do know

3566
01:00:34,069 --> 01:00:34,079
i do know
 

3567
01:00:34,079 --> 01:00:35,670
i do know
is that um

3568
01:00:35,670 --> 01:00:35,680
is that um
 

3569
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:37,990
is that um
the the complexity of the story of life

3570
01:00:37,990 --> 01:00:38,000
the the complexity of the story of life
 

3571
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,430
the the complexity of the story of life
on earth

3572
01:00:39,430 --> 01:00:39,440
on earth
 

3573
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:42,309
on earth
gives us lots of scope for variation and

3574
01:00:42,309 --> 01:00:42,319
gives us lots of scope for variation and
 

3575
01:00:42,319 --> 01:00:44,390
gives us lots of scope for variation and
i just don't think it's a reasonable

3576
01:00:44,390 --> 01:00:44,400
i just don't think it's a reasonable
 

3577
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:46,950
i just don't think it's a reasonable
mathematical assumption to think that

3578
01:00:46,950 --> 01:00:46,960
mathematical assumption to think that
 

3579
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:48,950
mathematical assumption to think that
they will the the life on earth that

3580
01:00:48,950 --> 01:00:48,960
they will the the life on earth that
 

3581
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:50,150
they will the the life on earth that
happened again would be the same as what

3582
01:00:50,150 --> 01:00:50,160
happened again would be the same as what
 

3583
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:51,430
happened again would be the same as what
we have now

3584
01:00:51,430 --> 01:00:51,440
we have now
 

3585
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:54,150
we have now
okay but you've also extended that to

3586
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:54,160
okay but you've also extended that to
 

3587
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:56,549
okay but you've also extended that to
say that we might as an explanation from

3588
01:00:56,549 --> 01:00:56,559
say that we might as an explanation from
 

3589
01:00:56,559 --> 01:00:59,349
say that we might as an explanation from
the for the fermi paradox that uh that

3590
01:00:59,349 --> 01:00:59,359
the for the fermi paradox that uh that
 

3591
01:00:59,359 --> 01:01:01,750
the for the fermi paradox that uh that
means we're not able to interact with

3592
01:01:01,750 --> 01:01:01,760
means we're not able to interact with
 

3593
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:02,549
means we're not able to interact with
them

3594
01:01:02,549 --> 01:01:02,559
them
 

3595
01:01:02,559 --> 01:01:04,630
them
or that mean that's an explanation for

3596
01:01:04,630 --> 01:01:04,640
or that mean that's an explanation for
 

3597
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:07,030
or that mean that's an explanation for
why we haven't at scale heard from

3598
01:01:07,030 --> 01:01:07,040
why we haven't at scale heard from
 

3599
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:08,789
why we haven't at scale heard from
aliens is um

3600
01:01:08,789 --> 01:01:08,799
aliens is um
 

3601
01:01:08,799 --> 01:01:10,309
aliens is um
well right now they're different than us

3602
01:01:10,309 --> 01:01:10,319
well right now they're different than us
 

3603
01:01:10,319 --> 01:01:12,549
well right now they're different than us
we've only been looking for say 70 80

3604
01:01:12,549 --> 01:01:12,559
we've only been looking for say 70 80
 

3605
01:01:12,559 --> 01:01:15,270
we've only been looking for say 70 80
years so i think that we're the reason

3606
01:01:15,270 --> 01:01:15,280
years so i think that we're the reason
 

3607
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:17,349
years so i think that we're the reason
we have not found aliens yet

3608
01:01:17,349 --> 01:01:17,359
we have not found aliens yet
 

3609
01:01:17,359 --> 01:01:19,030
we have not found aliens yet
is that we haven't worked out what life

3610
01:01:19,030 --> 01:01:19,040
is that we haven't worked out what life
 

3611
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:19,829
is that we haven't worked out what life
is

3612
01:01:19,829 --> 01:01:19,839
is
 

3613
01:01:19,839 --> 01:01:23,109
is
no but the aliens have worked that out

3614
01:01:23,109 --> 01:01:23,119
no but the aliens have worked that out
 

3615
01:01:23,119 --> 01:01:25,750
no but the aliens have worked that out
surely uh i mean

3616
01:01:25,750 --> 01:01:25,760
surely uh i mean
 

3617
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:27,910
surely uh i mean
statistically speaking they they must be

3618
01:01:27,910 --> 01:01:27,920
statistically speaking they they must be
 

3619
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:30,390
statistically speaking they they must be
there's must be a large number of aliens

3620
01:01:30,390 --> 01:01:30,400
there's must be a large number of aliens
 

3621
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:32,230
there's must be a large number of aliens
that are way ahead of us on this whole

3622
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:32,240
that are way ahead of us on this whole
 

3623
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:33,430
that are way ahead of us on this whole
life question

3624
01:01:33,430 --> 01:01:33,440
life question
 

3625
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:36,390
life question
unless there's something about

3626
01:01:36,390 --> 01:01:36,400
unless there's something about
 

3627
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:38,230
unless there's something about
this stage of uh

3628
01:01:38,230 --> 01:01:38,240
this stage of uh
 

3629
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:40,069
this stage of uh
intellectual evolution that often

3630
01:01:40,069 --> 01:01:40,079
intellectual evolution that often
 

3631
01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:41,670
intellectual evolution that often
quickly results in nuclear war and

3632
01:01:41,670 --> 01:01:41,680
quickly results in nuclear war and
 

3633
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:44,150

there there's something

3636
01:01:46,950 --> 01:01:46,960
there there's something
 

3637
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:49,910
there there's something
in this process that eventually i don't

in this process that eventually i don't

crystallizes the complexity and it stops
 

3643
01:01:53,359 --> 01:01:55,670

either dies or stops developing
 

3645
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:57,750
either dies or stops developing
but most likely they already figured it

3646
01:01:57,750 --> 01:01:57,760
but most likely they already figured it
 

3647
01:01:57,760 --> 01:01:59,750
but most likely they already figured it
out and why aren't they contacting us

3648
01:01:59,750 --> 01:01:59,760
out and why aren't they contacting us
 

3649
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:01,190
out and why aren't they contacting us
there's a some

3650
01:02:01,190 --> 01:02:01,200
there's a some
 

3651
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:03,829
there's a some
some grad student somewhere

3652
01:02:03,829 --> 01:02:03,839
some grad student somewhere
 

3653
01:02:03,839 --> 01:02:06,390
some grad student somewhere
wants to study a new a new green planet

3654
01:02:06,390 --> 01:02:06,400
wants to study a new a new green planet
 

3655
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:08,710
wants to study a new a new green planet
maybe maybe they have i mean maybe i

3656
01:02:08,710 --> 01:02:08,720
maybe maybe they have i mean maybe i
 

3657
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:10,230
maybe maybe they have i mean maybe i
mean i don't i mean i don't have a

3658
01:02:10,230 --> 01:02:10,240
mean i don't i mean i don't have a
 

3659
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:12,230
mean i don't i mean i don't have a
coherent answer to your question other

3660
01:02:12,230 --> 01:02:12,240
coherent answer to your question other
 

3661
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:14,069
coherent answer to your question other
than to say that if there are other

3662
01:02:14,069 --> 01:02:14,079
than to say that if there are other
 

3663
01:02:14,079 --> 01:02:16,230
than to say that if there are other
aliens out there like and they're

3664
01:02:16,230 --> 01:02:16,240
aliens out there like and they're
 

3665
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:17,910
aliens out there like and they're
far more advanced they might be in

3666
01:02:17,910 --> 01:02:17,920
far more advanced they might be in
 

3667
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:19,750
far more advanced they might be in
contact with each other

3668
01:02:19,750 --> 01:02:19,760
contact with each other
 

3669
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:22,069
contact with each other
and they might also um we might be at a

3670
01:02:22,069 --> 01:02:22,079
and they might also um we might be at a
 

3671
01:02:22,079 --> 01:02:23,910
and they might also um we might be at a
point where what i'm saying quite

3672
01:02:23,910 --> 01:02:23,920
point where what i'm saying quite
 

3673
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:26,390
point where what i'm saying quite
critically is it takes two to talk right

3674
01:02:26,390 --> 01:02:26,400
critically is it takes two to talk right
 

3675
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:28,150
critically is it takes two to talk right
yeah so the aliens might be there but if

3676
01:02:28,150 --> 01:02:28,160
yeah so the aliens might be there but if
 

3677
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:30,309
yeah so the aliens might be there but if
we if we don't have the ability to

3678
01:02:30,309 --> 01:02:30,319
we if we don't have the ability to
 

3679
01:02:30,319 --> 01:02:32,309
we if we don't have the ability to
recognize them and talk to them

3680
01:02:32,309 --> 01:02:32,319
recognize them and talk to them
 

3681
01:02:32,319 --> 01:02:34,150
recognize them and talk to them
then the aliens aren't going to want to

3682
01:02:34,150 --> 01:02:34,160
then the aliens aren't going to want to
 

3683
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:35,910
then the aliens aren't going to want to
talk to us

3684
01:02:35,910 --> 01:02:35,920
talk to us
 

3685
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:37,510
talk to us
and i think that's the critical point

3686
01:02:37,510 --> 01:02:37,520
and i think that's the critical point
 

3687
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:39,190
and i think that's the critical point
and probably

3688
01:02:39,190 --> 01:02:39,200
and probably
 

3689
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:42,069
and probably
um if if that is a if that's a filter

3690
01:02:42,069 --> 01:02:42,079
um if if that is a if that's a filter
 

3691
01:02:42,079 --> 01:02:44,470
um if if that is a if that's a filter
there needs to be an ability for one to

3692
01:02:44,470 --> 01:02:44,480
there needs to be an ability for one to
 

3693
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:45,990
there needs to be an ability for one to
communicate with the other and we need

3694
01:02:45,990 --> 01:02:46,000
communicate with the other and we need
 

3695
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,069
communicate with the other and we need
to know what life is before we do that

3696
01:02:48,069 --> 01:02:48,079
to know what life is before we do that
 

3697
01:02:48,079 --> 01:02:50,230
to know what life is before we do that
so we haven't qualified to even join

3698
01:02:50,230 --> 01:02:50,240
so we haven't qualified to even join
 

3699
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:52,069
so we haven't qualified to even join
their club to have a talk well i think

3700
01:02:52,069 --> 01:02:52,079
their club to have a talk well i think
 

3701
01:02:52,079 --> 01:02:54,390
their club to have a talk well i think
they still want to teach us how to talk

3702
01:02:54,390 --> 01:02:54,400
they still want to teach us how to talk
 

3703
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:56,150
they still want to teach us how to talk
right but

3704
01:02:56,150 --> 01:02:56,160
right but
 

3705
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:58,549
right but
my worry is that

3706
01:02:58,549 --> 01:02:58,559
my worry is that
 

3707
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:00,230
my worry is that
or i i think they would want to teach us

3708
01:03:00,230 --> 01:03:00,240
or i i think they would want to teach us
 

3709
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:02,870
or i i think they would want to teach us

uh
like

3714
01:03:05,109 --> 01:03:05,119
like
 

3715
01:03:05,119 --> 01:03:07,750
like
when you even meet i was gonna say child

3716
01:03:07,750 --> 01:03:07,760
when you even meet i was gonna say child
 

3717
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:09,670
when you even meet i was gonna say child
but that's a human species

3718
01:03:09,670 --> 01:03:09,680
but that's a human species
 

3719
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:12,549
but that's a human species
i mean like and

3720
01:03:12,549 --> 01:03:12,559
i mean like and
 

3721
01:03:12,559 --> 01:03:15,510
i mean like and
you want to try to communicate with them

3722
01:03:15,510 --> 01:03:15,520
you want to try to communicate with them
 

3723
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:17,670
you want to try to communicate with them
through whatever devices you can given

3724
01:03:17,670 --> 01:03:17,680
through whatever devices you can given
 

3725
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:20,470
through whatever devices you can given
given what an ant is like i just i worry

3726
01:03:20,470 --> 01:03:20,480
given what an ant is like i just i worry
 

3727
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:22,390
given what an ant is like i just i worry
mostly about that humans are just too

3728
01:03:22,390 --> 01:03:22,400
mostly about that humans are just too
 

3729
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:23,990
mostly about that humans are just too
close minded or don't have the right

3730
01:03:23,990 --> 01:03:24,000
close minded or don't have the right
 

3731
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,150
close minded or don't have the right
tools no i'm going to push back on this

3732
01:03:26,150 --> 01:03:26,160
tools no i'm going to push back on this
 

3733
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:28,390
tools no i'm going to push back on this
quite significantly i would say because

3734
01:03:28,390 --> 01:03:28,400
quite significantly i would say because
 

3735
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:30,390
quite significantly i would say because
we don't understand what life is

3736
01:03:30,390 --> 01:03:30,400
we don't understand what life is
 

3737
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:33,109
we don't understand what life is
and because we don't understand how life

3738
01:03:33,109 --> 01:03:33,119
and because we don't understand how life
 

3739
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:34,390
and because we don't understand how life
immersed in the universe we don't

3740
01:03:34,390 --> 01:03:34,400
immersed in the universe we don't
 

3741
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:35,910
immersed in the universe we don't
understand the physics

3742
01:03:35,910 --> 01:03:35,920
understand the physics
 

3743
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:37,910
understand the physics
that gave rise to life yet and

3744
01:03:37,910 --> 01:03:37,920
that gave rise to life yet and
 

3745
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:40,069
that gave rise to life yet and
that means our description fundamental

3746
01:03:40,069 --> 01:03:40,079
that means our description fundamental
 

3747
01:03:40,079 --> 01:03:41,670
that means our description fundamental
description i'm way out of my pay grade

3748
01:03:41,670 --> 01:03:41,680
description i'm way out of my pay grade
 

3749
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:43,510
description i'm way out of my pay grade
even further out there better but i'll

3750
01:03:43,510 --> 01:03:43,520
even further out there better but i'll
 

3751
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:44,710
even further out there better but i'll
say it anyways i think it's you can't

3752
01:03:44,710 --> 01:03:44,720
say it anyways i think it's you can't
 

3753
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:47,190
say it anyways i think it's you can't
get paid much anyway as you said earlier

3754
01:03:47,190 --> 01:03:47,200
get paid much anyway as you said earlier
 

3755
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:48,470
get paid much anyway as you said earlier
so

3756
01:03:48,470 --> 01:03:48,480
so
 

3757
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:49,510
so
so

3758
01:03:49,510 --> 01:03:49,520
so
 

3759
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:51,430
so
so i would say that we because we don't

3760
01:03:51,430 --> 01:03:51,440
so i would say that we because we don't
 

3761
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:53,270
so i would say that we because we don't
understand the universe yet we do not

3762
01:03:53,270 --> 01:03:53,280
understand the universe yet we do not
 

3763
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:54,789
understand the universe yet we do not
understand how the universe spat out

3764
01:03:54,789 --> 01:03:54,799
understand how the universe spat out
 

3765
01:03:54,799 --> 01:03:55,829
understand how the universe spat out
life

3766
01:03:55,829 --> 01:03:55,839
life
 

3767
01:03:55,839 --> 01:03:57,910
life
and we don't know what life is and then

3768
01:03:57,910 --> 01:03:57,920
and we don't know what life is and then
 

3769
01:03:57,920 --> 01:03:59,750
and we don't know what life is and then
i think that until we understand that it

3770
01:03:59,750 --> 01:03:59,760
i think that until we understand that it
 

3771
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:02,150
i think that until we understand that it
is going to limit our ability to even

3772
01:04:02,150 --> 01:04:02,160
is going to limit our ability to even
 

3773
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:04,309
is going to limit our ability to even
um we don't qualify to talk to the

3774
01:04:04,309 --> 01:04:04,319
um we don't qualify to talk to the
 

3775
01:04:04,319 --> 01:04:05,750
um we don't qualify to talk to the
aliens

3776
01:04:05,750 --> 01:04:05,760
aliens
 

3777
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:07,750
aliens
so i'm going to say that the the they

3778
01:04:07,750 --> 01:04:07,760
so i'm going to say that the the they
 

3779
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:09,589
so i'm going to say that the the they
might be there but we just i'm not going

3780
01:04:09,589 --> 01:04:09,599
might be there but we just i'm not going
 

3781
01:04:09,599 --> 01:04:10,710
might be there but we just i'm not going
to say that i believe in

3782
01:04:10,710 --> 01:04:10,720
to say that i believe in
 

3783
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:12,309
to say that i believe in
inter-dimensional aliens being present

3784
01:04:12,309 --> 01:04:12,319
inter-dimensional aliens being present
 

3785
01:04:12,319 --> 01:04:13,430
inter-dimensional aliens being present
yeah but i think you're just being

3786
01:04:13,430 --> 01:04:13,440
yeah but i think you're just being
 

3787
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:15,750
yeah but i think you're just being
self-critical uh like we don't qualify i

3788
01:04:15,750 --> 01:04:15,760
self-critical uh like we don't qualify i
 

3789
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:17,510
self-critical uh like we don't qualify i
think i think the fact that we don't

3790
01:04:17,510 --> 01:04:17,520
think i think the fact that we don't
 

3791
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:20,069
think i think the fact that we don't
qualify qualifies us we're interesting

3792
01:04:20,069 --> 01:04:20,079
qualify qualifies us we're interesting
 

3793
01:04:20,079 --> 01:04:22,309
qualify qualifies us we're interesting
we're interested in our innocence no i'm

3794
01:04:22,309 --> 01:04:22,319
we're interested in our innocence no i'm
 

3795
01:04:22,319 --> 01:04:23,990
we're interested in our innocence no i'm
saying that

3796
01:04:23,990 --> 01:04:24,000
saying that
 

3797
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,589
saying that
because we don't understand

3798
01:04:25,589 --> 01:04:25,599
because we don't understand
 

3799
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:27,029
because we don't understand
causal chains and the way that

3800
01:04:27,029 --> 01:04:27,039
causal chains and the way that
 

3801
01:04:27,039 --> 01:04:28,309
causal chains and the way that
information is propagated in the

3802
01:04:28,309 --> 01:04:28,319
information is propagated in the
 

3803
01:04:28,319 --> 01:04:30,150
information is propagated in the
universe and we don't understand what

3804
01:04:30,150 --> 01:04:30,160
universe and we don't understand what
 

3805
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:31,430
universe and we don't understand what
replication is yet and we don't

3806
01:04:31,430 --> 01:04:31,440
replication is yet and we don't
 

3807
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:32,549
replication is yet and we don't
understand

3808
01:04:32,549 --> 01:04:32,559
understand
 

3809
01:04:32,559 --> 01:04:34,950
understand
um how life emerged

3810
01:04:34,950 --> 01:04:34,960
um how life emerged
 

3811
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:37,510
um how life emerged
i think that we would not recognize

3812
01:04:37,510 --> 01:04:37,520
i think that we would not recognize
 

3813
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:40,549
i think that we would not recognize
aliens and they and if if someone

3814
01:04:40,549 --> 01:04:40,559
aliens and they and if if someone
 

3815
01:04:40,559 --> 01:04:42,630
aliens and they and if if someone
doesn't recognize you

3816
01:04:42,630 --> 01:04:42,640
doesn't recognize you
 

3817
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:44,309
doesn't recognize you
um you wouldn't go and talk to it you

3818
01:04:44,309 --> 01:04:44,319
um you wouldn't go and talk to it you
 

3819
01:04:44,319 --> 01:04:46,470
um you wouldn't go and talk to it you
don't go and talk to ants

3820
01:04:46,470 --> 01:04:46,480
don't go and talk to ants

3823
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:50,069
you don't go and talk to birds or maybe
some birds you do right because you can

visit uh the weird or earth planet and
 

4015
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:07,670
visit uh the weird or earth planet and
and try to interact i mean it's it's uh

4016
01:08:07,670 --> 01:08:07,680
and try to interact i mean it's it's uh

yeah i i think it's it's a super cool

4018
01:08:09,829 --> 01:08:09,839
yeah i i think it's it's a super cool
 

4019
01:08:09,839 --> 01:08:11,589
yeah i i think it's it's a super cool
idea that you're expressing and just to

4020
01:08:11,589 --> 01:08:11,599
idea that you're expressing and just to
 

4021
01:08:11,599 --> 01:08:14,309
idea that you're expressing and just to
kind of have a sense maybe it's a hope

4022
01:08:14,309 --> 01:08:14,319
kind of have a sense maybe it's a hope
 

4023
01:08:14,319 --> 01:08:16,709
kind of have a sense maybe it's a hope
that there's always going to be a desire

4024
01:08:16,709 --> 01:08:16,719
that there's always going to be a desire
 

4025
01:08:16,719 --> 01:08:19,349
that there's always going to be a desire
to interact even with those that don't

4026
01:08:19,349 --> 01:08:19,359
to interact even with those that don't
 

4027
01:08:19,359 --> 01:08:21,349
to interact even with those that don't
can't possibly understand the depth of

4028
01:08:21,349 --> 01:08:21,359
can't possibly understand the depth of
 

4029
01:08:21,359 --> 01:08:22,870
can't possibly understand the depth of
what you understand

4030
01:08:22,870 --> 01:08:22,880
what you understand
 

4031
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:24,550
what you understand
so i am with you that look so i want to

4032
01:08:24,550 --> 01:08:24,560
so i am with you that look so i want to
 

4033
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:26,950
so i am with you that look so i want to
be as positive as you that we the aliens

4034
01:08:26,950 --> 01:08:26,960
be as positive as you that we the aliens
 

4035
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:28,630
be as positive as you that we the aliens
do exist and we will we will interact

4036
01:08:28,630 --> 01:08:28,640
do exist and we will we will interact
 

4037
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:30,390
do exist and we will we will interact
with them what i'm trying to do is to

4038
01:08:30,390 --> 01:08:30,400
with them what i'm trying to do is to
 

4039
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:31,510
with them what i'm trying to do is to
give you a

4040
01:08:31,510 --> 01:08:31,520
give you a
 

4041
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:33,910
give you a
a reasonable hypothesis why we haven't

4042
01:08:33,910 --> 01:08:33,920
a reasonable hypothesis why we haven't
 

4043
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:34,870
a reasonable hypothesis why we haven't
yet

4044
01:08:34,870 --> 01:08:34,880
yet
 

4045
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:37,749
yet
yeah and also something to strive for to

4046
01:08:37,749 --> 01:08:37,759
yeah and also something to strive for to
 

4047
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:40,229
yeah and also something to strive for to
be able to do that i mean i you know i

4048
01:08:40,229 --> 01:08:40,239
be able to do that i mean i you know i
 

4049
01:08:40,239 --> 01:08:42,309
be able to do that i mean i you know i
there there is the other view that the

4050
01:08:42,309 --> 01:08:42,319
there there is the other view that the
 

4051
01:08:42,319 --> 01:08:44,550
there there is the other view that the
the universe is just too big and life is

4052
01:08:44,550 --> 01:08:44,560
the universe is just too big and life is
 

4053
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:45,910
the universe is just too big and life is
just too rare

4054
01:08:45,910 --> 01:08:45,920
just too rare
 

4055
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:47,749
just too rare
but i want to make come up with an

4056
01:08:47,749 --> 01:08:47,759
but i want to make come up with an
 

4057
01:08:47,759 --> 01:08:50,470
but i want to make come up with an
alternative explanation which i think is

4058
01:08:50,470 --> 01:08:50,480
alternative explanation which i think is
 

4059
01:08:50,480 --> 01:08:53,110
alternative explanation which i think is
reasonable and not been philosophically

4060
01:08:53,110 --> 01:08:53,120
reasonable and not been philosophically
 

4061
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:54,870
reasonable and not been philosophically
and scientifically thought out which is

4062
01:08:54,870 --> 01:08:54,880
and scientifically thought out which is
 

4063
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:57,110
and scientifically thought out which is
this this if you can't actually

4064
01:08:57,110 --> 01:08:57,120
this this if you can't actually
 

4065
01:08:57,120 --> 01:08:59,110
this this if you can't actually
communicate with the object

4066
01:08:59,110 --> 01:08:59,120
communicate with the object
 

4067
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:00,789
communicate with the object
the person the thing

4068
01:09:00,789 --> 01:09:00,799
the person the thing
 

4069
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:02,470
the person the thing
competently you don't even know it's

4070
01:09:02,470 --> 01:09:02,480
competently you don't even know it's
 

4071
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:04,709
competently you don't even know it's
there yeah then then there's no point

4072
01:09:04,709 --> 01:09:04,719
there yeah then then there's no point
 

4073
01:09:04,719 --> 01:09:06,709
there yeah then then there's no point
yet see i disagree with that but i'm

4074
01:09:06,709 --> 01:09:06,719
yet see i disagree with that but i'm
 

4075
01:09:06,719 --> 01:09:08,309
yet see i disagree with that but i'm
totally aligned with your hopeful vision

4076
01:09:08,309 --> 01:09:08,319
totally aligned with your hopeful vision
 

4077
01:09:08,319 --> 01:09:09,749
totally aligned with your hopeful vision
which is like we need to understand the

4078
01:09:09,749 --> 01:09:09,759
which is like we need to understand the
 

4079
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:11,430
which is like we need to understand the
origin of life

4080
01:09:11,430 --> 01:09:11,440
origin of life
 

4081
01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:13,590
origin of life
it will help us engineer life will help

4082
01:09:13,590 --> 01:09:13,600
it will help us engineer life will help
 

4083
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:15,590
it will help us engineer life will help
us engineer intelligent life through

4084
01:09:15,590 --> 01:09:15,600
us engineer intelligent life through
 

4085
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:17,189
us engineer intelligent life through
perhaps on the computer side of

4086
01:09:17,189 --> 01:09:17,199
perhaps on the computer side of
 

4087
01:09:17,199 --> 01:09:18,470
perhaps on the computer side of
simulation

4088
01:09:18,470 --> 01:09:18,480
simulation
 

4089
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:19,990
simulation
and explore all the ways that life

4090
01:09:19,990 --> 01:09:20,000
and explore all the ways that life
 

4091
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,550
and explore all the ways that life
emerges and that will allow us to i

4092
01:09:22,550 --> 01:09:22,560
emerges and that will allow us to i
 

4093
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:24,550
emerges and that will allow us to i
think the fundamental reason we don't

4094
01:09:24,550 --> 01:09:24,560
think the fundamental reason we don't
 

4095
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:27,110
think the fundamental reason we don't
see overwhelming amounts of life

4096
01:09:27,110 --> 01:09:27,120
see overwhelming amounts of life
 

4097
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:29,669
see overwhelming amounts of life
is i actually believe

4098
01:09:29,669 --> 01:09:29,679
is i actually believe
 

4099
01:09:29,679 --> 01:09:31,030
is i actually believe
aliens

4100
01:09:31,030 --> 01:09:31,040
aliens
 

4101
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:33,990
aliens
of course these are all just kind of um

4102
01:09:33,990 --> 01:09:34,000
of course these are all just kind of um
 

4103
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,149
of course these are all just kind of um
open-minded beliefs uh it's it's

4104
01:09:36,149 --> 01:09:36,159
open-minded beliefs uh it's it's
 

4105
01:09:36,159 --> 01:09:37,590
open-minded beliefs uh it's it's
difficult to know for sure about any of

4106
01:09:37,590 --> 01:09:37,600
difficult to know for sure about any of
 

4107
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:39,829
difficult to know for sure about any of
this but i think there's a lot of alien

4108
01:09:39,829 --> 01:09:39,839
this but i think there's a lot of alien
 

4109
01:09:39,839 --> 01:09:41,669
this but i think there's a lot of alien
civilizations which are actively

4110
01:09:41,669 --> 01:09:41,679
civilizations which are actively
 

4111
01:09:41,679 --> 01:09:45,349
civilizations which are actively
communicating with us and we're too dumb

4112
01:09:45,349 --> 01:09:45,359
communicating with us and we're too dumb
 

4113
01:09:45,359 --> 01:09:46,870
communicating with us and we're too dumb
we don't have the right tools that's

4114
01:09:46,870 --> 01:09:46,880
we don't have the right tools that's
 

4115
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:47,910
we don't have the right tools that's
what i'm just seeing that's what i'm

4116
01:09:47,910 --> 01:09:47,920
what i'm just seeing that's what i'm
 

4117
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:49,269
what i'm just seeing that's what i'm
saying no but

well i interpreted you to say they kind
 

4125
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:56,950
well i interpreted you to say they kind
of tried a few times and they're like oh

there could be information out there but

4132
01:10:03,830 --> 01:10:03,840
there could be information out there but
 

4133
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:05,270
there could be information out there but
just put in such a way that we just

4134
01:10:05,270 --> 01:10:05,280
just put in such a way that we just
 

4135
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:08,070
just put in such a way that we just
don't understand it yet right so sorry

4136
01:10:08,070 --> 01:10:08,080
don't understand it yet right so sorry
 

4137
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:09,510
don't understand it yet right so sorry
if i didn't make that clear i mean it's

4138
01:10:09,510 --> 01:10:09,520
if i didn't make that clear i mean it's
 

4139
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:11,350
if i didn't make that clear i mean it's
not just i don't think we caught i think

4140
01:10:11,350 --> 01:10:11,360
not just i don't think we caught i think
 

4141
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:13,590
not just i don't think we caught i think
we qualify as soon as we can decode

4142
01:10:13,590 --> 01:10:13,600
we qualify as soon as we can decode
 

4143
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:15,430
we qualify as soon as we can decode
their signal

4144
01:10:15,430 --> 01:10:15,440
their signal
 

4145
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:17,430
their signal
right so when you say qualified got i

4146
01:10:17,430 --> 01:10:17,440
right so when you say qualified got i
 

4147
01:10:17,440 --> 01:10:19,110
right so when you say qualified got i
got it so you mean we're just not smart

4148
01:10:19,110 --> 01:10:19,120
got it so you mean we're just not smart
 

4149
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:20,310
got it so you mean we're just not smart
enough though the word qualifier was

4150
01:10:20,310 --> 01:10:20,320
enough though the word qualifier was
 

4151
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:21,830
enough though the word qualifier was
thrown off you know so we're not smart

4152
01:10:21,830 --> 01:10:21,840
thrown off you know so we're not smart
 

4153
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:23,510
thrown off you know so we're not smart
enough to do it's like yeah but we need

4154
01:10:23,510 --> 01:10:23,520
enough to do it's like yeah but we need
 

4155
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:25,189
enough to do it's like yeah but we need
to get smarter yeah

4156
01:10:25,189 --> 01:10:25,199
to get smarter yeah
 

4157
01:10:25,199 --> 01:10:27,270
to get smarter yeah
and there's a lot of people who believe

4158
01:10:27,270 --> 01:10:27,280
and there's a lot of people who believe
 

4159
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:29,510
and there's a lot of people who believe
let me get your opinion on this

4160
01:10:29,510 --> 01:10:29,520
let me get your opinion on this
 

4161
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:31,590
let me get your opinion on this
about ufo sightings

4162
01:10:31,590 --> 01:10:31,600
about ufo sightings
 

4163
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:35,189
about ufo sightings
so

4164
01:10:35,189 --> 01:10:35,199

 

4165
01:10:35,199 --> 01:10:38,630

sightings of weird phenomena

4166
01:10:38,630 --> 01:10:38,640
sightings of weird phenomena
 

4167
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:41,750
sightings of weird phenomena
that uh you know what does ufo mean

4168
01:10:41,750 --> 01:10:41,760
that uh you know what does ufo mean
 

4169
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:44,870
that uh you know what does ufo mean
it means it's a flying object

4170
01:10:44,870 --> 01:10:44,880
it means it's a flying object
 

4171
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:46,390
it means it's a flying object
and it's not

4172
01:10:46,390 --> 01:10:46,400
and it's not
 

4173
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:48,149
and it's not
identified

4174
01:10:48,149 --> 01:10:48,159
identified
 

4175
01:10:48,159 --> 01:10:50,149
identified
uh clearly at the time of sighting

4176
01:10:50,149 --> 01:10:50,159
uh clearly at the time of sighting
 

4177
01:10:50,159 --> 01:10:52,550
uh clearly at the time of sighting
that's what ufo means so it could be uh

4178
01:10:52,550 --> 01:10:52,560
that's what ufo means so it could be uh
 

4179
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:54,070
that's what ufo means so it could be uh
physics phenomena it could be bald

4180
01:10:54,070 --> 01:10:54,080
physics phenomena it could be bald
 

4181
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:55,669
physics phenomena it could be bald
lightning it could be all kinds of

4182
01:10:55,669 --> 01:10:55,679
lightning it could be all kinds of
 

4183
01:10:55,679 --> 01:10:57,350
lightning it could be all kinds of
fascinating i was always fascinated with

4184
01:10:57,350 --> 01:10:57,360
fascinating i was always fascinated with
 

4185
01:10:57,360 --> 01:10:58,870
fascinating i was always fascinated with
ball lightning as a

4186
01:10:58,870 --> 01:10:58,880
ball lightning as a
 

4187
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:00,310
ball lightning as a
um

4188
01:11:00,310 --> 01:11:00,320
um
 

4189
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:01,910
um
like the fact that there could be

4190
01:11:01,910 --> 01:11:01,920
like the fact that there could be
 

4191
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:04,310
like the fact that there could be
physical phenomena in this world that

4192
01:11:04,310 --> 01:11:04,320
physical phenomena in this world that
 

4193
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:06,229
physical phenomena in this world that
are observable by the human eye of

4194
01:11:06,229 --> 01:11:06,239
are observable by the human eye of
 

4195
01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:08,310
are observable by the human eye of
course all physical phenomena generally

4196
01:11:08,310 --> 01:11:08,320
course all physical phenomena generally
 

4197
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:09,590
course all physical phenomena generally
are fascinating

4198
01:11:09,590 --> 01:11:09,600
are fascinating
 

4199
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:11,430
are fascinating
that are

4200
01:11:11,430 --> 01:11:11,440
that are
 

4201
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:13,430
that are
that that really smart people can't

4202
01:11:13,430 --> 01:11:13,440
that that really smart people can't
 

4203
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:15,510
that that really smart people can't
explain i love that because it's like

4204
01:11:15,510 --> 01:11:15,520
explain i love that because it's like
 

4205
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:17,189
explain i love that because it's like
wait a minute especially if you can

4206
01:11:17,189 --> 01:11:17,199
wait a minute especially if you can
 

4207
01:11:17,199 --> 01:11:18,390
wait a minute especially if you can
replicate it

4208
01:11:18,390 --> 01:11:18,400
replicate it
 

4209
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:19,669
replicate it
it's like wait a minute how does this

4210
01:11:19,669 --> 01:11:19,679
it's like wait a minute how does this
 

4211
01:11:19,679 --> 01:11:22,229
it's like wait a minute how does this
happen that's like the precursor to

4212
01:11:22,229 --> 01:11:22,239
happen that's like the precursor to
 

4213
01:11:22,239 --> 01:11:24,630
happen that's like the precursor to
giant discoveries in chemistry biology

4214
01:11:24,630 --> 01:11:24,640
giant discoveries in chemistry biology
 

4215
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:27,510
giant discoveries in chemistry biology
and physics and so on but it sucks when

4216
01:11:27,510 --> 01:11:27,520
and physics and so on but it sucks when
 

4217
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:29,430
and physics and so on but it sucks when
those events are super rare right

4218
01:11:29,430 --> 01:11:29,440
those events are super rare right
 

4219
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:32,149
those events are super rare right
physical like like ball lightning

4220
01:11:32,149 --> 01:11:32,159
physical like like ball lightning
 

4221
01:11:32,159 --> 01:11:32,950
physical like like ball lightning
so

4222
01:11:32,950 --> 01:11:32,960
so
 

4223
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:35,189
so
so that's out there and then

4224
01:11:35,189 --> 01:11:35,199
so that's out there and then
 

4225
01:11:35,199 --> 01:11:36,870
so that's out there and then
of course that phenomena could have

4226
01:11:36,870 --> 01:11:36,880
of course that phenomena could have
 

4227
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:38,550
of course that phenomena could have
other interpretations that don't have to

4228
01:11:38,550 --> 01:11:38,560
other interpretations that don't have to
 

4229
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:40,310
other interpretations that don't have to
do with the physics of chemistry the

4230
01:11:40,310 --> 01:11:40,320
do with the physics of chemistry the
 

4231
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:43,270
do with the physics of chemistry the
biology of earth it could have to do

4232
01:11:43,270 --> 01:11:43,280
biology of earth it could have to do
 

4233
01:11:43,280 --> 01:11:44,510
biology of earth it could have to do
with more

4234
01:11:44,510 --> 01:11:44,520
with more
 

4235
01:11:44,520 --> 01:11:46,790
with more
extraterrestrial explanations

4236
01:11:46,790 --> 01:11:46,800
extraterrestrial explanations
 

4237
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:47,830
extraterrestrial explanations
that

4238
01:11:47,830 --> 01:11:47,840
that
 

4239
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:49,990
that
in large part thanks to hollywood and

4240
01:11:49,990 --> 01:11:50,000
in large part thanks to hollywood and
 

4241
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:51,590
in large part thanks to hollywood and
movies and all those kinds of things

4242
01:11:51,590 --> 01:11:51,600
movies and all those kinds of things
 

4243
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:53,510
movies and all those kinds of things
captivates the imaginations of millions

4244
01:11:53,510 --> 01:11:53,520
captivates the imaginations of millions
 

4245
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:56,390
captivates the imaginations of millions
of people

4246
01:11:56,390 --> 01:11:56,400

 

4247
01:11:56,400 --> 01:11:58,470

but just because it's science fiction

4248
01:11:58,470 --> 01:11:58,480
but just because it's science fiction
 

4249
01:11:58,480 --> 01:11:59,990
but just because it's science fiction
that captivates the imagination of

4250
01:11:59,990 --> 01:12:00,000
that captivates the imagination of
 

4251
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,910
that captivates the imagination of
people doesn't mean that some of those

4252
01:12:01,910 --> 01:12:01,920
people doesn't mean that some of those
 

4253
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:03,350
people doesn't mean that some of those
sightings

4254
01:12:03,350 --> 01:12:03,360
sightings
 

4255
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:05,270
sightings
all it takes is one

4256
01:12:05,270 --> 01:12:05,280
all it takes is one
 

4257
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:07,350
all it takes is one
one of those sightings

4258
01:12:07,350 --> 01:12:07,360
one of those sightings
 

4259
01:12:07,360 --> 01:12:09,830
one of those sightings
is actually a sign that's it's

4260
01:12:09,830 --> 01:12:09,840
is actually a sign that's it's
 

4261
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:12,390
is actually a sign that's it's
extraterrestrial intelligence that it's

4262
01:12:12,390 --> 01:12:12,400
extraterrestrial intelligence that it's
 

4263
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:13,750
extraterrestrial intelligence that it's
um

4264
01:12:13,750 --> 01:12:13,760
um
 

4265
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:16,470
um
object that's not of this particular

4266
01:12:16,470 --> 01:12:16,480
object that's not of this particular
 

4267
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:18,149
object that's not of this particular
world do you think there's a chance that

4268
01:12:18,149 --> 01:12:18,159
world do you think there's a chance that
 

4269
01:12:18,159 --> 01:12:19,590
world do you think there's a chance that
that's the case what do you make

4270
01:12:19,590 --> 01:12:19,600
that's the case what do you make
 

4271
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:21,189
that's the case what do you make
especially the pilot sightings what do

4272
01:12:21,189 --> 01:12:21,199
especially the pilot sightings what do
 

4273
01:12:21,199 --> 01:12:23,110
especially the pilot sightings what do
you make of those

4274
01:12:23,110 --> 01:12:23,120
you make of those
 

4275
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:26,070
you make of those
um so i i agree there's a chance there's

4276
01:12:26,070 --> 01:12:26,080
um so i i agree there's a chance there's
 

4277
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:28,390
um so i i agree there's a chance there's
always a chance any good scientist would

4278
01:12:28,390 --> 01:12:28,400
always a chance any good scientist would
 

4279
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:29,430
always a chance any good scientist would
have to

4280
01:12:29,430 --> 01:12:29,440
have to
 

4281
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:31,350
have to
observation this would have to

4282
01:12:31,350 --> 01:12:31,360
observation this would have to
 

4283
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:34,310
observation this would have to
you know i want to see if aliens exist

4284
01:12:34,310 --> 01:12:34,320
you know i want to see if aliens exist
 

4285
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:36,790
you know i want to see if aliens exist
come come to earth what i know about the

4286
01:12:36,790 --> 01:12:36,800
come come to earth what i know about the
 

4287
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:39,590
come come to earth what i know about the
universe is i think it's unlikely right

4288
01:12:39,590 --> 01:12:39,600
universe is i think it's unlikely right
 

4289
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:42,070
universe is i think it's unlikely right
now that there are aliens visiting us

4290
01:12:42,070 --> 01:12:42,080
now that there are aliens visiting us
 

4291
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:44,310
now that there are aliens visiting us
but but not impossible

4292
01:12:44,310 --> 01:12:44,320
but but not impossible
 

4293
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:46,830
but but not impossible
i think the um releases the

4294
01:12:46,830 --> 01:12:46,840
i think the um releases the
 

4295
01:12:46,840 --> 01:12:48,390
i think the um releases the
dramatization

4296
01:12:48,390 --> 01:12:48,400
dramatization
 

4297
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:49,910
dramatization
has been happening politically saying

4298
01:12:49,910 --> 01:12:49,920
has been happening politically saying
 

4299
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:50,870
has been happening politically saying
we're going to release all this

4300
01:12:50,870 --> 01:12:50,880
we're going to release all this
 

4301
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:52,709
we're going to release all this
information this you know classified

4302
01:12:52,709 --> 01:12:52,719
information this you know classified
 

4303
01:12:52,719 --> 01:12:53,990
information this you know classified
information

4304

information
 

4305
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,550
information
um i was kind of disappointed because it

4306
01:12:56,550 --> 01:12:56,560
um i was kind of disappointed because it
 

4307
01:12:56,560 --> 01:12:58,149
um i was kind of disappointed because it
was just

4308
01:12:58,149 --> 01:12:58,159
was just
 

4309
01:12:58,159 --> 01:13:00,709
was just
very poor um

4310
01:13:00,709 --> 01:13:00,719
very poor um
 

4311
01:13:00,719 --> 01:13:01,910
very poor um
material

4312
01:13:01,910 --> 01:13:01,920
material
 

4313
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:03,189
material
and

4314
01:13:03,189 --> 01:13:03,199
and
 

4315
01:13:03,199 --> 01:13:05,350
and
right now the the you know the the

4316
01:13:05,350 --> 01:13:05,360
right now the the you know the the
 

4317
01:13:05,360 --> 01:13:07,030
right now the the you know the the
ability to capture

4318
01:13:07,030 --> 01:13:07,040
ability to capture
 

4319
01:13:07,040 --> 01:13:09,590
ability to capture
high-resolution video everybody is

4320
01:13:09,590 --> 01:13:09,600
high-resolution video everybody is
 

4321
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:11,350
high-resolution video everybody is
carrying around with an incredible video

4322
01:13:11,350 --> 01:13:11,360
carrying around with an incredible video
 

4323
01:13:11,360 --> 01:13:13,510
carrying around with an incredible video
device now and

4324
01:13:13,510 --> 01:13:13,520
device now and
 

4325
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:15,189
device now and
we haven't

4326
01:13:15,189 --> 01:13:15,199
we haven't
 

4327
01:13:15,199 --> 01:13:18,630
we haven't
got more compelling data and so that

4328
01:13:18,630 --> 01:13:18,640
got more compelling data and so that
 

4329
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:19,910
got more compelling data and so that
we've just

4330
01:13:19,910 --> 01:13:19,920
we've just
 

4331
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:20,870
we've just
seeing

4332
01:13:20,870 --> 01:13:20,880
seeing
 

4333
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:22,470
seeing
grainy pictures

4334
01:13:22,470 --> 01:13:22,480
grainy pictures
 

4335
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:24,310
grainy pictures
a lot of hear say

4336
01:13:24,310 --> 01:13:24,320
a lot of hear say
 

4337
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:26,390
a lot of hear say
instrument kind of malfunctions and

4338
01:13:26,390 --> 01:13:26,400
instrument kind of malfunctions and
 

4339
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:29,030
instrument kind of malfunctions and
whatnot and so i think on balance i

4340
01:13:29,030 --> 01:13:29,040

the great mysteries before us without
 

4483
01:15:50,719 --> 01:15:53,030
the great mysteries before us without
great leadership and i just think

4484
01:15:53,030 --> 01:15:53,040
great leadership and i just think
 

4485
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:54,550
great leadership and i just think
it's actually the fact that there's a

4486

it's actually the fact that there's a
 

4487
01:15:54,560 --> 01:15:56,310
it's actually the fact that there's a
lot of high definition cameras is not

lot of high definition cameras is not
 

4489
01:15:56,320 --> 01:15:57,430
lot of high definition cameras is not
enough

4490
01:15:57,430 --> 01:15:57,440
enough
 

4491
01:15:57,440 --> 01:16:01,510
enough
to capture the full richness of weird

4492
01:16:01,510 --> 01:16:01,520
to capture the full richness of weird
 

4493

everybody having a smartphone in their
pocket

4504
01:16:13,750 --> 01:16:13,760
pocket
 

4505
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:14,790
pocket
is enough

4506
01:16:14,790 --> 01:16:14,800
is enough
 

4507
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:17,350
is enough
i think that allows for tick-tock videos

4508
01:16:17,350 --> 01:16:17,360
i think that allows for tick-tock videos
 

4509
01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:19,189
i think that allows for tick-tock videos
i don't think it allows for

4510
01:16:19,189 --> 01:16:19,199
i don't think it allows for
 

4511
01:16:19,199 --> 01:16:21,510
i don't think it allows for
the capture of even interesting

4512
01:16:21,510 --> 01:16:21,520
the capture of even interesting
 

4513
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:23,669
the capture of even interesting
relatively rare human events

4514
01:16:23,669 --> 01:16:23,679
relatively rare human events
 

4515
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:25,270
relatively rare human events
that's not that common

4516
01:16:25,270 --> 01:16:25,280
that's not that common
 

4517
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:27,510
that's not that common
it's rare to have be in the right moment

4518
01:16:27,510 --> 01:16:27,520
it's rare to have be in the right moment
 

4519
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:29,430
it's rare to have be in the right moment
in the right time to be able to capture

4520
01:16:29,430 --> 01:16:29,440
in the right time to be able to capture
 

4521
01:16:29,440 --> 01:16:30,390
in the right time to be able to capture
the thing

4522
01:16:30,390 --> 01:16:30,400
the thing
 

4523
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:32,470
the thing
i agree i agree let me let me rephrase

4524
01:16:32,470 --> 01:16:32,480
i agree i agree let me let me rephrase
 

4525

01:16:34,790 --> 01:16:34,800
what i think on this i i haven't seen
 

4527

what i think on this i i haven't seen
enough information i haven't really

4528
01:16:36,070 --> 01:16:36,080
enough information i haven't really
 

4529
01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:38,950
enough information i haven't really
actively sought it out i must admit but

4530
01:16:38,950 --> 01:16:38,960
actively sought it out i must admit but
 

4531
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:41,270
actively sought it out i must admit but
i'm i'm reviewing that i love the idea

4532
01:16:41,270 --> 01:16:41,280
i'm i'm reviewing that i love the idea
 

4533
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:43,270
i'm i'm reviewing that i love the idea
of anomaly detection in chemistry in

01:16:43,270 --> 01:16:43,280
of anomaly detection in chemistry in
 

4535
01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:44,550
of anomaly detection in chemistry in
particular right i want to make

4536
01:16:44,550 --> 01:16:44,560
particular right i want to make
 

4537
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:47,110
particular right i want to make
anomalies sorry or not necessarily make

01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:55,830
two from chemistry
um which are really quite interesting

4546
01:16:55,830 --> 01:16:55,840
um which are really quite interesting
 

4547
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:59,110
um which are really quite interesting
um phlogiston going way back

4548
01:16:59,110 --> 01:16:59,120
um phlogiston going way back
 

4549
01:16:59,120 --> 01:17:00,470
um phlogiston going way back
where people said there's this thing

4550
01:17:00,470 --> 01:17:00,480
where people said there's this thing
 

4551
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:03,110
where people said there's this thing
called phlogiston and for ages the

4552
01:17:03,110 --> 01:17:03,120
called phlogiston and for ages the
 

4553
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:05,750
called phlogiston and for ages the
alchemist got really um this kind of

4554
01:17:05,750 --> 01:17:05,760
alchemist got really um this kind of
 

4555
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:08,390
alchemist got really um this kind of
this the fire is the thing

4556
01:17:08,390 --> 01:17:08,400
this the fire is the thing
 

4557
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:10,470
this the fire is the thing
um and that's one and we determined that

4558
01:17:10,470 --> 01:17:10,480
um and that's one and we determined that
 

4559
01:17:10,480 --> 01:17:13,189
um and that's one and we determined that
logistician wasn't what we thought it is

4560
01:17:13,189 --> 01:17:13,199
logistician wasn't what we thought it is
 

4561
01:17:13,199 --> 01:17:15,669
logistician wasn't what we thought it is
let's go to physics the ether the if is

4562
01:17:15,669 --> 01:17:15,679
let's go to physics the ether the if is
 

4563
01:17:15,679 --> 01:17:17,189
let's go to physics the ether the if is
a hard one because i think actually the

4564
01:17:17,189 --> 01:17:17,199
a hard one because i think actually the
 

4565
01:17:17,199 --> 01:17:19,030
a hard one because i think actually the
ether might exist and i'll tell you what

4566
01:17:19,030 --> 01:17:19,040
ether might exist and i'll tell you what
 

4567
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:20,950
ether might exist and i'll tell you what
i think the ether is later

4568
01:17:20,950 --> 01:17:20,960
i think the ether is later
 

4569
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:22,550
i think the ether is later
um

4570
01:17:22,550 --> 01:17:22,560
um
 

4571
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:23,910
um
and and and

4572
01:17:23,910 --> 01:17:23,920
and and and
 

4573
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:25,990
and and and
can you explain either so as the vacuum

4574
01:17:25,990 --> 01:17:26,000
can you explain either so as the vacuum
 

4575
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:27,590
can you explain either so as the vacuum
so that light traveling through the

4576
01:17:27,590 --> 01:17:27,600
so that light traveling through the
 

4577
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:29,510
so that light traveling through the
ether in the vacuum there is some thing

4578
01:17:29,510 --> 01:17:29,520
ether in the vacuum there is some thing
 

4579
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:31,030
ether in the vacuum there is some thing
that we call the ether that that

4580
01:17:31,030 --> 01:17:31,040
that we call the ether that that
 

4581
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:33,030
that we call the ether that that
basically mediates the the movement of

4582
01:17:33,030 --> 01:17:33,040
basically mediates the the movement of
 

4583
01:17:33,040 --> 01:17:33,830
basically mediates the the movement of
light

4584
01:17:33,830 --> 01:17:33,840
light
 

4585
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:36,390
light
say and i think that um and then the

4586
01:17:36,390 --> 01:17:36,400
say and i think that um and then the
 

4587
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:38,870
say and i think that um and then the
other one is cold fusion which is more

4588
01:17:38,870 --> 01:17:38,880
other one is cold fusion which is more
 

4589
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:40,390
other one is cold fusion which is more
so a few years ago

4590
01:17:40,390 --> 01:17:40,400
so a few years ago
 

4591
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:43,110
so a few years ago
um that that people observed when they

4592
01:17:43,110 --> 01:17:43,120
um that that people observed when they
 

4593
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:45,350
um that that people observed when they
did some electrochemistry when they were

4594
01:17:45,350 --> 01:17:45,360
did some electrochemistry when they were
 

4595
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:48,070
did some electrochemistry when they were
splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen

4596
01:17:48,070 --> 01:17:48,080
splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen
 

4597
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:49,669
splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen
that you got more energy out than you

4598
01:17:49,669 --> 01:17:49,679
that you got more energy out than you
 

4599
01:17:49,679 --> 01:17:51,990
that you got more energy out than you
put in and people got excited and they

4600
01:17:51,990 --> 01:17:52,000
put in and people got excited and they
 

4601
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,630
put in and people got excited and they
thought that this was a nuclear reaction

4602
01:17:54,630 --> 01:17:54,640
thought that this was a nuclear reaction
 

4603
01:17:54,640 --> 01:17:57,030
thought that this was a nuclear reaction
and um and in the end it was kind of

4604
01:17:57,030 --> 01:17:57,040
and um and in the end it was kind of
 

4605
01:17:57,040 --> 01:17:58,790
and um and in the end it was kind of
discredited because you didn't detect

4606
01:17:58,790 --> 01:17:58,800
discredited because you didn't detect
 

4607
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:00,709
discredited because you didn't detect
neutrons and stuff but

4608
01:18:00,709 --> 01:18:00,719
neutrons and stuff but
 

4609
01:18:00,719 --> 01:18:02,790
neutrons and stuff but
i'm pretty sure

4610
01:18:02,790 --> 01:18:02,800
i'm pretty sure
 

4611
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:04,470
i'm pretty sure
i'm a chemist i'm going telling you this

4612
01:18:04,470 --> 01:18:04,480
i'm a chemist i'm going telling you this
 

4613
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:06,390
i'm a chemist i'm going telling you this
on your podcast but why not i'm pretty

4614
01:18:06,390 --> 01:18:06,400
on your podcast but why not i'm pretty
 

4615
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:07,830
on your podcast but why not i'm pretty
sure there's interesting electrochemical

4616
01:18:07,830 --> 01:18:07,840
sure there's interesting electrochemical
 

4617
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:09,350
sure there's interesting electrochemical
phenomena that's not completely bottomed

4618
01:18:09,350 --> 01:18:09,360
phenomena that's not completely bottomed
 

4619
01:18:09,360 --> 01:18:11,350
phenomena that's not completely bottomed
out yet that there is something there

4620
01:18:11,350 --> 01:18:11,360
out yet that there is something there
 

4621
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:14,149
out yet that there is something there
however we lack the technology and the

4622
01:18:14,149 --> 01:18:14,159
however we lack the technology and the
 

4623
01:18:14,159 --> 01:18:15,830
however we lack the technology and the
experimental design

4624
01:18:15,830 --> 01:18:15,840
experimental design
 

4625
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:17,750
experimental design
so all i'm saying in your response about

4626
01:18:17,750 --> 01:18:17,760
so all i'm saying in your response about
 

4627
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:19,270
so all i'm saying in your response about
aliens is that we do we lack the

4628
01:18:19,270 --> 01:18:19,280
aliens is that we do we lack the
 

4629
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:21,030
aliens is that we do we lack the
experimental design to really capture

4630
01:18:21,030 --> 01:18:21,040
experimental design to really capture
 

4631
01:18:21,040 --> 01:18:22,390
experimental design to really capture
these anomalies

4632
01:18:22,390 --> 01:18:22,400
these anomalies
 

4633
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:25,270
these anomalies
and we are in circulating encircling the

4634
01:18:25,270 --> 01:18:25,280
and we are in circulating encircling the
 

4635
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:27,189
and we are in circulating encircling the
planet with many more detection systems

4636
01:18:27,189 --> 01:18:27,199
planet with many more detection systems
 

4637
01:18:27,199 --> 01:18:29,270
planet with many more detection systems
we've got satellites everywhere so there

4638
01:18:29,270 --> 01:18:29,280
we've got satellites everywhere so there
 

4639
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:31,189
we've got satellites everywhere so there
is i do hope that we are going to

4640
01:18:31,189 --> 01:18:31,199
is i do hope that we are going to
 

4641
01:18:31,199 --> 01:18:33,350
is i do hope that we are going to
discover more anomalies and remember

4642
01:18:33,350 --> 01:18:33,360
discover more anomalies and remember
 

4643
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:34,550
discover more anomalies and remember
that

4644
01:18:34,550 --> 01:18:34,560
that
 

4645
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:36,550
that
the solar system isn't just static in

4646
01:18:36,550 --> 01:18:36,560
the solar system isn't just static in
 

4647
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:39,030
the solar system isn't just static in
space it's moving through the universe

4648
01:18:39,030 --> 01:18:39,040
space it's moving through the universe
 

4649
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:40,790
space it's moving through the universe
so there's just more and more chance i'm

4650
01:18:40,790 --> 01:18:40,800
so there's just more and more chance i'm
 

4651
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:42,870
so there's just more and more chance i'm
not what with avi loeb that uh he's

4652
01:18:42,870 --> 01:18:42,880
not what with avi loeb that uh he's
 

4653
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:45,030
not what with avi loeb that uh he's
generating all sorts of kind of

4654
01:18:45,030 --> 01:18:45,040
generating all sorts of kind of
 

4655
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:46,149
generating all sorts of kind of
um

4656
01:18:46,149 --> 01:18:46,159
um
 

4657
01:18:46,159 --> 01:18:48,950
um
occult i would say uh with this but

4658
01:18:48,950 --> 01:18:48,960
occult i would say uh with this but
 

4659
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:50,709
occult i would say uh with this but
there but i'm not against him i think

4660
01:18:50,709 --> 01:18:50,719

should frame it statistically in the
 

4701
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:32,630

them head on and i think we must do that

4858
01:22:22,310 --> 01:22:22,320
them head on and i think we must do that
 

4859
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:24,470
them head on and i think we must do that
and and i think that i i try and do that

01:22:24,470 --> 01:22:24,480
and and i think that i i try and do that
 

4861

walking through the walls uh and it it

4864
01:22:30,070 --> 01:22:30,080
walking through the walls uh and it it
 

4865
01:22:30,080 --> 01:22:32,550
walking through the walls uh and it it
it gives me it's difficult for me

4866
01:22:32,550 --> 01:22:32,560
it gives me it's difficult for me
 

4867
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:35,750
it gives me it's difficult for me
personally it's quite painful um but it

4868
01:22:35,750 --> 01:22:35,760
personally it's quite painful um but it
 

4869
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:38,149
personally it's quite painful um but it
always leads to a deeper understanding

01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:41,830
of the people i'm with in particular you
know the arguments i have with all sorts

4874
01:22:41,830 --> 01:22:41,840
know the arguments i have with all sorts
 

4875
01:22:41,840 --> 01:22:44,310

of interesting minds because
 

4877
01:22:44,320 --> 01:22:46,229
of interesting minds because
i want to solve the problem or i want to

understand more about why i exist
 

4881
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:50,950

um you know that's

4882
01:22:50,950 --> 01:22:50,960
um you know that's
 

4883
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:53,270
um you know that's
that's that's it really and i i think we

4884
01:22:53,270 --> 01:22:53,280
that's that's it really and i i think we
 

4885
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:55,270
that's that's it really and i i think we
have to not dismiss science on that

4886
01:22:55,270 --> 01:22:55,280
have to not dismiss science on that
 

4887
01:22:55,280 --> 01:22:57,510
have to not dismiss science on that
basis i think we can we can work with

4888
01:22:57,510 --> 01:22:57,520
basis i think we can we can work with
 

4889
01:22:57,520 --> 01:23:00,470
basis i think we can we can work with
science no science is beautiful but uh

science yeah yeah and those are those
 

4915
01:23:28,159 --> 01:23:30,070
science yeah yeah and those are those
are no good but yes you're right the the

01:23:30,070 --> 01:23:30,080
are no good but yes you're right the the
 

4917

rare explanations for rare phenomena
 

4929
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:47,270
rare explanations for rare phenomena
you have to walk cautiously

4930
01:23:47,270 --> 01:23:47,280

 

4931

don't understand something
 

4937

don't understand something
and it's rare and you can't replicate it

4938
01:23:55,350 --> 01:23:55,360
and it's rare and you can't replicate it
 

4939

and it's rare and you can't replicate it
doesn't quite apply

01:23:56,950 --> 01:23:56,960
doesn't quite apply
 

4941
01:23:56,960 --> 01:23:58,870
doesn't quite apply
yeah yeah yeah that's it i agree with

4942
01:23:58,870 --> 01:23:58,880
yeah yeah yeah that's it i agree with
 

4943
01:23:58,880 --> 01:24:00,310
yeah yeah yeah that's it i agree with
you the challenge is to

4944
01:24:00,310 --> 01:24:00,320
you the challenge is to
 

4945
01:24:00,320 --> 01:24:02,229
you the challenge is to
is to not dismiss the anomaly because

4946
01:24:02,229 --> 01:24:02,239
is to not dismiss the anomaly because
 

4947
01:24:02,239 --> 01:24:04,550
is to not dismiss the anomaly because
you can't replicate it i mean we can

4948
01:24:04,550 --> 01:24:04,560
you can't replicate it i mean we can
 

4949
01:24:04,560 --> 01:24:05,910
you can't replicate it i mean we can
talk about this this is something i

4950
01:24:05,910 --> 01:24:05,920
talk about this this is something i
 

4951
01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:07,350
talk about this this is something i
realized when we were developing

4952
01:24:07,350 --> 01:24:07,360
realized when we were developing
 

4953
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:09,830
realized when we were developing
assembly theory um

4954
01:24:09,830 --> 01:24:09,840
assembly theory um
 

4955
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:12,950
assembly theory um
um that people thinking that the the the

4956
01:24:12,950 --> 01:24:12,960
um that people thinking that the the the
 

4957
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:14,629
um that people thinking that the the the
the track they're on is so don't matter

4958
01:24:14,629 --> 01:24:14,639
the track they're on is so don't matter
 

4959
01:24:14,639 --> 01:24:17,270
the track they're on is so don't matter
dogmatic where there is this thing

4960
01:24:17,270 --> 01:24:17,280
dogmatic where there is this thing
 

4961
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:19,189
dogmatic where there is this thing
that they see but they don't see and it

4962
01:24:19,189 --> 01:24:19,199
that they see but they don't see and it
 

4963
01:24:19,199 --> 01:24:20,790
that they see but they don't see and it
takes a bit of time and you just have to

4964
01:24:20,790 --> 01:24:20,800
takes a bit of time and you just have to
 

4965
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:23,350
takes a bit of time and you just have to
keep reframing it and my approach is to

4966
01:24:23,350 --> 01:24:23,360
keep reframing it and my approach is to
 

4967
01:24:23,360 --> 01:24:24,790
keep reframing it and my approach is to
say well why can't this be right you

4968
01:24:24,790 --> 01:24:24,800
say well why can't this be right you
 

4969
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:25,830
say well why can't this be right you
know why

4970
01:24:25,830 --> 01:24:25,840
know why
 

4971
01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:28,149
know why
why must we accept that rna is the only

4972
01:24:28,149 --> 01:24:28,159
why must we accept that rna is the only
 

4973
01:24:28,159 --> 01:24:30,790
why must we accept that rna is the only
way into life i mean who said was there

4974
01:24:30,790 --> 01:24:30,800
way into life i mean who said was there
 

4975
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:33,270
way into life i mean who said was there
you know does rna have a special special

4976
01:24:33,270 --> 01:24:33,280
you know does rna have a special special
 

4977
01:24:33,280 --> 01:24:35,990
you know does rna have a special special
uh class of of uh information that's

encoded in the universe no of course it

4980
01:24:37,590 --> 01:24:37,600
encoded in the universe no of course it
 

4981
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:39,350
encoded in the universe no of course it
doesn't right that you know rna is not a

4982
01:24:39,350 --> 01:24:39,360
doesn't right that you know rna is not a
 

4983
01:24:39,360 --> 01:24:41,750
doesn't right that you know rna is not a
special molecule with in the space of

4984
01:24:41,750 --> 01:24:41,760
special molecule with in the space of
 

4985
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:43,110
special molecule with in the space of
all the other molecules but it's so

4986
01:24:43,110 --> 01:24:43,120
all the other molecules but it's so
 

4987
01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:45,430
all the other molecules but it's so
elegant and simple and it works so well

4988
01:24:45,430 --> 01:24:45,440
elegant and simple and it works so well
 

4989
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:47,030
elegant and simple and it works so well
for the evolution process that we kind

4990
01:24:47,030 --> 01:24:47,040
for the evolution process that we kind
 

4991
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:48,950
for the evolution process that we kind
of use that as an intuition to explain

4992
01:24:48,950 --> 01:24:48,960
of use that as an intuition to explain
 

4993
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:50,550
of use that as an intuition to explain
that that must be the only way to have

4994
01:24:50,550 --> 01:24:50,560
that that must be the only way to have
 

4995
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:51,350
that that must be the only way to have
life

4996
01:24:51,350 --> 01:24:51,360
life
 

4997
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:52,790
life
sure

4998
01:24:52,790 --> 01:24:52,800
sure
 

4999
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:54,950
sure
uh but you mentioned assembly theory

5000
01:24:54,950 --> 01:24:54,960
uh but you mentioned assembly theory
 

5001
01:24:54,960 --> 01:24:56,709
uh but you mentioned assembly theory
well first let me pause bathroom break

5002
01:24:56,709 --> 01:24:56,719
well first let me pause bathroom break
 

5003
01:24:56,719 --> 01:24:59,669
well first let me pause bathroom break
needed yeah let's take two minutes

5004
01:24:59,669 --> 01:24:59,679
needed yeah let's take two minutes
 

5005
01:24:59,679 --> 01:25:02,550
needed yeah let's take two minutes
we took a quick break and offline you

5006
01:25:02,550 --> 01:25:02,560
we took a quick break and offline you
 

5007
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:04,790
we took a quick break and offline you
mentioned to me

5008
01:25:04,790 --> 01:25:04,800
mentioned to me
 

5009
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:08,229
mentioned to me
that you have a lab in your home

5010
01:25:08,229 --> 01:25:08,239
that you have a lab in your home
 

5011
01:25:08,239 --> 01:25:10,229
that you have a lab in your home
and then i said that you're basically

5012
01:25:10,229 --> 01:25:10,239
and then i said that you're basically
 

5013
01:25:10,239 --> 01:25:12,470
and then i said that you're basically
rick from rick and morty which is

5014
01:25:12,470 --> 01:25:12,480
rick from rick and morty which is
 

5015
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:14,070
rick from rick and morty which is
something i've been thinking this whole

5016
01:25:14,070 --> 01:25:14,080
something i've been thinking this whole
 

5017
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:15,270
something i've been thinking this whole
conversation

5018
01:25:15,270 --> 01:25:15,280
conversation
 

5019
01:25:15,280 --> 01:25:16,709
conversation
and then you say

5020
01:25:16,709 --> 01:25:16,719
and then you say
 

5021
01:25:16,719 --> 01:25:20,229
and then you say
that there's a glowing pickle

5022
01:25:20,229 --> 01:25:20,239
that there's a glowing pickle
 

5023
01:25:20,239 --> 01:25:22,629
that there's a glowing pickle
that you used something involving cold

5024
01:25:22,629 --> 01:25:22,639
that you used something involving cold
 

5025
01:25:22,639 --> 01:25:24,229
that you used something involving cold
plasma i believe i don't know but can

5026
01:25:24,229 --> 01:25:24,239
plasma i believe i don't know but can
 

5027
01:25:24,239 --> 01:25:26,000
plasma i believe i don't know but can
you explain the and pickle situation

5028
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:26,010
you explain the and pickle situation
 

5029
01:25:26,010 --> 01:25:31,270
you explain the and pickle situation
[Laughter]

5030
01:25:31,270 --> 01:25:31,280
[Laughter]
 

5031
01:25:31,280 --> 01:25:33,590
[Laughter]
and is there many arbitrarily many

5032
01:25:33,590 --> 01:25:33,600
and is there many arbitrarily many
 

5033
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:35,830
and is there many arbitrarily many
versions of you in alternate dimensions

5034
01:25:35,830 --> 01:25:35,840
versions of you in alternate dimensions
 

5035
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:37,830
versions of you in alternate dimensions
so i think you're aware of i tried to

5036
01:25:37,830 --> 01:25:37,840
so i think you're aware of i tried to
 

5037
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:38,830
so i think you're aware of i tried to
make an

5038
01:25:38,830 --> 01:25:38,840
make an
 

5039
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:41,750
make an
electrochemical memory in at home

5040
01:25:41,750 --> 01:25:41,760
electrochemical memory in at home
 

5041
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:44,229
electrochemical memory in at home
um using a and the only way using a

5042
01:25:44,229 --> 01:25:44,239
um using a and the only way using a
 

5043
01:25:44,239 --> 01:25:46,950
um using a and the only way using a
pickle the only way i could get any um

5044
01:25:46,950 --> 01:25:46,960
pickle the only way i could get any um
 

5045
01:25:46,960 --> 01:25:48,470
pickle the only way i could get any um
traction with it was actually by

5046
01:25:48,470 --> 01:25:48,480
traction with it was actually by
 

5047
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:50,550
traction with it was actually by
plugging it into a very high voltage

5048
01:25:50,550 --> 01:25:50,560
plugging it into a very high voltage
 

5049
01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:52,229
plugging it into a very high voltage
alternating current and then putting in

5050
01:25:52,229 --> 01:25:52,239
alternating current and then putting in
 

5051
01:25:52,239 --> 01:25:54,470
alternating current and then putting in
a couple electrodes but my kids weren't

5052
01:25:54,470 --> 01:25:54,480
a couple electrodes but my kids weren't
 

5053
01:25:54,480 --> 01:25:55,830
a couple electrodes but my kids weren't
impressed they're not impressed with

5054
01:25:55,830 --> 01:25:55,840
impressed they're not impressed with
 

5055
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:57,510
impressed they're not impressed with
anything i do any experiments i do at

5056
01:25:57,510 --> 01:25:57,520
anything i do any experiments i do at
 

5057
01:25:57,520 --> 01:25:59,030
anything i do any experiments i do at
home i think it's quite funny but you

5058
01:25:59,030 --> 01:25:59,040
home i think it's quite funny but you
 

5059
01:25:59,040 --> 01:26:00,790
home i think it's quite funny but you
connected to a pickle to some electro i

5060
01:26:00,790 --> 01:26:00,800
connected to a pickle to some electro i
 

5061
01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:03,750
connected to a pickle to some electro i
mean 240 volts yeah ac yeah and then had

5062
01:26:03,750 --> 01:26:03,760
mean 240 volts yeah ac yeah and then had
 

5063
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:05,030
mean 240 volts yeah ac yeah and then had
a couple of electrodes on it so what

5064
01:26:05,030 --> 01:26:05,040
a couple of electrodes on it so what
 

5065
01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:07,510
a couple of electrodes on it so what
happens is a pickle um

5066
01:26:07,510 --> 01:26:07,520
happens is a pickle um
 

5067
01:26:07,520 --> 01:26:09,669
happens is a pickle um
this is a classic thing you do

5068
01:26:09,669 --> 01:26:09,679
this is a classic thing you do
 

5069
01:26:09,679 --> 01:26:11,669
this is a classic thing you do
i mean i shouldn't pranks you do you put

5070
01:26:11,669 --> 01:26:11,679
i mean i shouldn't pranks you do you put
 

5071
01:26:11,679 --> 01:26:13,510
i mean i shouldn't pranks you do you put
a pluck pickle into the mains and just

5072
01:26:13,510 --> 01:26:13,520
a pluck pickle into the mains and just
 

5073
01:26:13,520 --> 01:26:15,350
a pluck pickle into the mains and just
leave it run away and leave it and what

5074
01:26:15,350 --> 01:26:15,360
leave it run away and leave it and what
 

5075
01:26:15,360 --> 01:26:17,830
leave it run away and leave it and what
happens is it it starts to decompose it

5076
01:26:17,830 --> 01:26:17,840
happens is it it starts to decompose it
 

5077
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:19,270
happens is it it starts to decompose it
heats up and then explodes because the

5078
01:26:19,270 --> 01:26:19,280
heats up and then explodes because the
 

5079
01:26:19,280 --> 01:26:21,590
heats up and then explodes because the
water turns to steam and it just

5080
01:26:21,590 --> 01:26:21,600
water turns to steam and it just
 

5081
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:23,990
water turns to steam and it just
violently explodes but i wondered if i

5082
01:26:23,990 --> 01:26:24,000
violently explodes but i wondered if i
 

5083
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,149
violently explodes but i wondered if i
could cause the iron sodium potassium

5084
01:26:26,149 --> 01:26:26,159
could cause the iron sodium potassium
 

5085
01:26:26,159 --> 01:26:27,830
could cause the iron sodium potassium
ions in the pickle to migrate it'd been

5086
01:26:27,830 --> 01:26:27,840
ions in the pickle to migrate it'd been
 

5087
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:31,189
ions in the pickle to migrate it'd been
in a jar right it's been in a in a brine

5088
01:26:31,189 --> 01:26:31,199
in a jar right it's been in a in a brine
 

5089
01:26:31,199 --> 01:26:33,189
in a jar right it's been in a in a brine
that was yeah that was not my that was

5090
01:26:33,189 --> 01:26:33,199
that was yeah that was not my that was
 

5091
01:26:33,199 --> 01:26:34,950
that was yeah that was not my that was
not my best experiment so i've done far

5092
01:26:34,950 --> 01:26:34,960
not my best experiment so i've done far
 

5093
01:26:34,960 --> 01:26:36,950
not my best experiment so i've done far
better experiments in my lab at home at

5094
01:26:36,950 --> 01:26:36,960
better experiments in my lab at home at
 

5095
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:38,870
better experiments in my lab at home at
that time was a failed experiment but

5096
01:26:38,870 --> 01:26:38,880
that time was a failed experiment but
 

5097
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:41,510
that time was a failed experiment but
you never know it could uh

5098
01:26:41,510 --> 01:26:41,520
you never know it could uh
 

5099
01:26:41,520 --> 01:26:43,270
you never know it could uh
every experiment is a successful

5100
01:26:43,270 --> 01:26:43,280
every experiment is a successful
 

5101
01:26:43,280 --> 01:26:45,430
every experiment is a successful
experiment uh if you stick with it long

5102
01:26:45,430 --> 01:26:45,440
experiment uh if you stick with it long
 

5103
01:26:45,440 --> 01:26:47,270
experiment uh if you stick with it long
enough well i mean i get i got kicked

5104
01:26:47,270 --> 01:26:47,280
enough well i mean i get i got kicked
 

5105
01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:49,189
enough well i mean i get i got kicked
out of my own lab by my research team

5106
01:26:49,189 --> 01:26:49,199
out of my own lab by my research team
 

5107
01:26:49,199 --> 01:26:50,790
out of my own lab by my research team
many years ago and for good reason i

5108
01:26:50,790 --> 01:26:50,800
many years ago and for good reason i
 

5109
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:52,149
many years ago and for good reason i
mean my team is brilliant and i used to

5110
01:26:52,149 --> 01:26:52,159
mean my team is brilliant and i used to
 

5111
01:26:52,159 --> 01:26:53,750
mean my team is brilliant and i used to
go and just break things

5112
01:26:53,750 --> 01:26:53,760
go and just break things
 

5113
01:26:53,760 --> 01:26:56,070
go and just break things
so what i do do at home is i have a kind

5114
01:26:56,070 --> 01:26:56,080
so what i do do at home is i have a kind
 

5115
01:26:56,080 --> 01:26:57,990
so what i do do at home is i have a kind
of electronics workshop

5116
01:26:57,990 --> 01:26:58,000
of electronics workshop
 

5117
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:01,270
of electronics workshop
um and i prototype experiments there

5118
01:27:01,270 --> 01:27:01,280
um and i prototype experiments there
 

5119
01:27:01,280 --> 01:27:04,070
um and i prototype experiments there
then i try and then i try and suggest to

5120
01:27:04,070 --> 01:27:04,080
then i try and then i try and suggest to
 

5121
01:27:04,080 --> 01:27:06,070
then i try and then i try and suggest to
my team sometimes maybe we can try this

5122
01:27:06,070 --> 01:27:06,080
my team sometimes maybe we can try this
 

5123
01:27:06,080 --> 01:27:07,030
my team sometimes maybe we can try this
thing

5124
01:27:07,030 --> 01:27:07,040
thing
 

5125
01:27:07,040 --> 01:27:08,790
thing
and they would just say oh well that's

5126
01:27:08,790 --> 01:27:08,800
and they would just say oh well that's
 

5127
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:10,070
and they would just say oh well that's
not going to work because of this and

5128
01:27:10,070 --> 01:27:10,080
not going to work because of this and
 

5129
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:12,229
not going to work because of this and
i'll say aha but actually i've tried and

5130
01:27:12,229 --> 01:27:12,239
i'll say aha but actually i've tried and
 

5131
01:27:12,239 --> 01:27:13,510
i'll say aha but actually i've tried and
here's some code and here's some

5132
01:27:13,510 --> 01:27:13,520
here's some code and here's some
 

5133
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:16,149
here's some code and here's some
hardware can we have a go so that i'm

5134
01:27:16,149 --> 01:27:16,159
hardware can we have a go so that i'm
 

5135
01:27:16,159 --> 01:27:17,990
hardware can we have a go so that i'm
doing that less and less now as i get

5136
01:27:17,990 --> 01:27:18,000
doing that less and less now as i get
 

5137
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,550
doing that less and less now as i get
even more busy but um that's quite fun

5138
01:27:20,550 --> 01:27:20,560
even more busy but um that's quite fun
 

5139
01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:22,310
even more busy but um that's quite fun
because then they feel that we're in the

5140
01:27:22,310 --> 01:27:22,320
because then they feel that we're in the
 

5141
01:27:22,320 --> 01:27:24,310
because then they feel that we're in the
you know in the experiment together you

5142
01:27:24,310 --> 01:27:24,320
you know in the experiment together you
 

5143
01:27:24,320 --> 01:27:26,070
you know in the experiment together you
do in fact

5144
01:27:26,070 --> 01:27:26,080

just like rick from rick and morty uh

5148
01:27:29,990 --> 01:27:30,000
just like rick from rick and morty uh

just like rick from rick and morty uh
connect up chemistry

5150
01:27:32,790 --> 01:27:32,800
connect up chemistry
 

5151
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:34,790
connect up chemistry
with computation

5152
01:27:34,790 --> 01:27:34,800
with computation
 

5153
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:36,550
with computation
so

5154
01:27:36,550 --> 01:27:36,560
so
 

5155
01:27:36,560 --> 01:27:38,629
so
sort of

5156
01:27:38,629 --> 01:27:38,639
sort of
 

5157
01:27:38,639 --> 01:27:41,189
sort of
and when we say chemistry we don't mean

5158
01:27:41,189 --> 01:27:41,199
and when we say chemistry we don't mean
 

5159
01:27:41,199 --> 01:27:42,550
and when we say chemistry we don't mean
the

01:27:45,280 --> 01:27:47,270
of chemistry
a modeling of chemistry we mean

5166
01:27:47,270 --> 01:27:47,280
a modeling of chemistry we mean
 

5167
01:27:47,280 --> 01:27:49,590
a modeling of chemistry we mean
chemistry in the physical space as well

5168
01:27:49,590 --> 01:27:49,600
chemistry in the physical space as well
 

5169
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:51,510
chemistry in the physical space as well
as in the digital space which is

5170
01:27:51,510 --> 01:27:51,520
as in the digital space which is
 

5171
01:27:51,520 --> 01:27:52,870
as in the digital space which is
fascinating we'll

5172
01:27:52,870 --> 01:27:52,880
fascinating we'll
 

5173
01:27:52,880 --> 01:27:55,110
fascinating we'll
talk about that but first you mentioned

5174
01:27:55,110 --> 01:27:55,120
talk about that but first you mentioned
 

5175
01:27:55,120 --> 01:27:57,910
talk about that but first you mentioned
assembly theory so we'll stick on

5176
01:27:57,910 --> 01:27:57,920
assembly theory so we'll stick on
 

5177
01:27:57,920 --> 01:28:00,550
assembly theory so we'll stick on
theory and these big ideas

5178
01:28:00,550 --> 01:28:00,560
theory and these big ideas
 

5179
01:28:00,560 --> 01:28:02,870
theory and these big ideas
i would say revolutionary ideas

5180
01:28:02,870 --> 01:28:02,880
i would say revolutionary ideas
 

5181
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:05,110
i would say revolutionary ideas

this uh intersection between
 

5183
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:07,510
this uh intersection between
mathematics and philosophy what is

5184
01:28:07,510 --> 01:28:07,520
mathematics and philosophy what is
 

5185
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:09,030
mathematics and philosophy what is
assembly theory

5186
01:28:09,030 --> 01:28:09,040
assembly theory
 

5187
01:28:09,040 --> 01:28:11,669
assembly theory
and generally speaking how would we

5188
01:28:11,669 --> 01:28:11,679
and generally speaking how would we
 

5189
01:28:11,679 --> 01:28:13,510
and generally speaking how would we
recognize life

5190
01:28:13,510 --> 01:28:13,520
recognize life
 

5191
01:28:13,520 --> 01:28:15,110
recognize life
if we saw it

5192
01:28:15,110 --> 01:28:15,120
if we saw it
 

5193
01:28:15,120 --> 01:28:17,430
if we saw it
so assembly theory is a theory

5194
01:28:17,430 --> 01:28:17,440
so assembly theory is a theory
 

5195
01:28:17,440 --> 01:28:19,430
so assembly theory is a theory
goes back a few years now my struggle

5196
01:28:19,430 --> 01:28:19,440
goes back a few years now my struggle
 

5197
01:28:19,440 --> 01:28:22,070
goes back a few years now my struggle
for maybe almost 10 years

5198
01:28:22,070 --> 01:28:22,080
for maybe almost 10 years
 

5199
01:28:22,080 --> 01:28:23,669

01:28:29,590 --> 01:28:29,600
everybody was dancing around
 

5207
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:31,669
everybody was dancing around
the problem of what life is and what it

5208
01:28:31,669 --> 01:28:31,679
the problem of what life is and what it
 

5209
01:28:31,679 --> 01:28:32,470
the problem of what life is and what it
does

5210
01:28:32,470 --> 01:28:32,480
does
 

5211
01:28:32,480 --> 01:28:33,750
does
but i'll tell you about what assembly

5212
01:28:33,750 --> 01:28:33,760
but i'll tell you about what assembly
 

5213
01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:35,830
but i'll tell you about what assembly
theory is because i think it's easier so

5214
01:28:35,830 --> 01:28:35,840
theory is because i think it's easier so
 

5215
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:37,430
theory is because i think it's easier so
assembly theory literally says if you

5216
01:28:37,430 --> 01:28:37,440
assembly theory literally says if you
 

5217
01:28:37,440 --> 01:28:39,110
assembly theory literally says if you
take an object

5218
01:28:39,110 --> 01:28:39,120
take an object
 

5219
01:28:39,120 --> 01:28:40,790
take an object
any given object

5220
01:28:40,790 --> 01:28:40,800
any given object
 

5221
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:42,550
any given object
and you are able to break that object

5222
01:28:42,550 --> 01:28:42,560
and you are able to break that object
 

5223
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:44,790
and you are able to break that object
into parts very gently so just maybe

5224
01:28:44,790 --> 01:28:44,800
into parts very gently so just maybe
 

5225
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:47,510
into parts very gently so just maybe
let's say take a piece of very intricate

5226
01:28:47,510 --> 01:28:47,520
let's say take a piece of very intricate
 

5227
01:28:47,520 --> 01:28:49,990
let's say take a piece of very intricate
chinese porcelain and you tap it just on

5228
01:28:49,990 --> 01:28:50,000
chinese porcelain and you tap it just on
 

5229
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,229
chinese porcelain and you tap it just on
the hammer or the nail at some point and

5230
01:28:52,229 --> 01:28:52,239
the hammer or the nail at some point and
 

5231
01:28:52,239 --> 01:28:54,870
the hammer or the nail at some point and
it will fragment into many parts

5232
01:28:54,870 --> 01:28:54,880
it will fragment into many parts
 

5233
01:28:54,880 --> 01:28:57,110
it will fragment into many parts
and if that object is able to fragment

5234
01:28:57,110 --> 01:28:57,120
and if that object is able to fragment
 

5235
01:28:57,120 --> 01:28:58,950
and if that object is able to fragment
into many and you count those num those

5236
01:28:58,950 --> 01:28:58,960
into many and you count those num those
 

5237
01:28:58,960 --> 01:29:00,629
into many and you count those num those
parts the different parts so they're

5238
01:29:00,629 --> 01:29:00,639
parts the different parts so they're
 

5239
01:29:00,639 --> 01:29:02,390
parts the different parts so they're
unsymmetrical

5240
01:29:02,390 --> 01:29:02,400
unsymmetrical
 

5241
01:29:02,400 --> 01:29:04,390
unsymmetrical
um assembly theory says

5242
01:29:04,390 --> 01:29:04,400
um assembly theory says
 

5243
01:29:04,400 --> 01:29:05,270
um assembly theory says
the

5244
01:29:05,270 --> 01:29:05,280
the
 

5245
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:07,830
the
larger the number of parts unsymmetrical

5246
01:29:07,830 --> 01:29:07,840
larger the number of parts unsymmetrical
 

5247
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:10,870
larger the number of parts unsymmetrical
parts that object has the more likely it

5248
01:29:10,870 --> 01:29:10,880
parts that object has the more likely it
 

5249
01:29:10,880 --> 01:29:12,629
parts that object has the more likely it
is that object has been created by an

5250
01:29:12,629 --> 01:29:12,639
is that object has been created by an
 

5251
01:29:12,639 --> 01:29:14,950
is that object has been created by an
evolutionary or information process

5252
01:29:14,950 --> 01:29:14,960
evolutionary or information process
 

5253
01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:16,470
evolutionary or information process
especially

5254
01:29:16,470 --> 01:29:16,480
especially
 

5255
01:29:16,480 --> 01:29:19,189
especially
if that object is not one-off you've got

5256
01:29:19,189 --> 01:29:19,199
if that object is not one-off you've got
 

5257
01:29:19,199 --> 01:29:21,910
if that object is not one-off you've got
a an abundance of them

5258
01:29:21,910 --> 01:29:21,920
a an abundance of them
 

5259
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:23,510
a an abundance of them
and that's really important the abundant

5260
01:29:23,510 --> 01:29:23,520
and that's really important the abundant
 

5261
01:29:23,520 --> 01:29:25,430
and that's really important the abundant
i and i so because if you what i'm

5262
01:29:25,430 --> 01:29:25,440
i and i so because if you what i'm
 

5263
01:29:25,440 --> 01:29:26,790
i and i so because if you what i'm
literally saying about the abundance if

5264
01:29:26,790 --> 01:29:26,800
literally saying about the abundance if
 

5265
01:29:26,800 --> 01:29:28,550
literally saying about the abundance if
you have a one-off object and you break

5266
01:29:28,550 --> 01:29:28,560
you have a one-off object and you break
 

5267
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:30,070
you have a one-off object and you break
it into parts

5268
01:29:30,070 --> 01:29:30,080
it into parts
 

5269
01:29:30,080 --> 01:29:32,229
it into parts
and it has lots of lots of parts you'd

5270
01:29:32,229 --> 01:29:32,239
and it has lots of lots of parts you'd
 

5271
01:29:32,239 --> 01:29:33,350
and it has lots of lots of parts you'd
say well that's

5272
01:29:33,350 --> 01:29:33,360
say well that's
 

5273
01:29:33,360 --> 01:29:34,709
say well that's
that could be

5274
01:29:34,709 --> 01:29:34,719
that could be
 

5275
01:29:34,719 --> 01:29:38,070
that could be
incredibly intricate and complex but it

5276
01:29:38,070 --> 01:29:38,080
incredibly intricate and complex but it
 

5277
01:29:38,080 --> 01:29:39,830
incredibly intricate and complex but it
could be just random

5278
01:29:39,830 --> 01:29:39,840
could be just random
 

5279
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:41,590
could be just random
and i was troubled with this for years

5280
01:29:41,590 --> 01:29:41,600
and i was troubled with this for years
 

5281
01:29:41,600 --> 01:29:43,510
and i was troubled with this for years
because i saw in reality that assembly

5282
01:29:43,510 --> 01:29:43,520
because i saw in reality that assembly
 

5283
01:29:43,520 --> 01:29:45,750
because i saw in reality that assembly
theory worked but when i talked to very

5284
01:29:45,750 --> 01:29:45,760
theory worked but when i talked to very
 

5285
01:29:45,760 --> 01:29:47,830
theory worked but when i talked to very
good computational

5286
01:29:47,830 --> 01:29:47,840
good computational
 

5287
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:50,310
good computational
complexity computationalists algorithmic

5288
01:29:50,310 --> 01:29:50,320
complexity computationalists algorithmic
 

5289
01:29:50,320 --> 01:29:52,709
complexity computationalists algorithmic
complexity people they said you haven't

5290
01:29:52,709 --> 01:29:52,719
complexity people they said you haven't
 

5291
01:29:52,719 --> 01:29:53,910
complexity people they said you haven't
really done this properly you haven't

5292
01:29:53,910 --> 01:29:53,920
really done this properly you haven't
 

5293
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:56,070
really done this properly you haven't
thought about it it's like this this is

5294
01:29:56,070 --> 01:29:56,080
thought about it it's like this this is
 

5295
01:29:56,080 --> 01:29:57,590
thought about it it's like this this is
the random problem

5296
01:29:57,590 --> 01:29:57,600
the random problem
 

5297
01:29:57,600 --> 01:29:59,990
the random problem
and so um i kept working this up because

5298
01:29:59,990 --> 01:30:00,000
and so um i kept working this up because
 

5299
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,149
and so um i kept working this up because
i invented an assembly theory

5300
01:30:02,149 --> 01:30:02,159
i invented an assembly theory
 

5301
01:30:02,159 --> 01:30:04,870
i invented an assembly theory
in chemistry first of all with molecules

5302
01:30:04,870 --> 01:30:04,880
in chemistry first of all with molecules
 

5303
01:30:04,880 --> 01:30:07,990
in chemistry first of all with molecules
and so the thought experiment was

5304
01:30:07,990 --> 01:30:08,000
and so the thought experiment was
 

5305
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,629
and so the thought experiment was
how complex does a molecule need to be

5306
01:30:10,629 --> 01:30:10,639
how complex does a molecule need to be
 

5307
01:30:10,639 --> 01:30:12,229
how complex does a molecule need to be
when i find it that it couldn't possibly

5308
01:30:12,229 --> 01:30:12,239
when i find it that it couldn't possibly
 

5309
01:30:12,239 --> 01:30:14,950
when i find it that it couldn't possibly
have risen by chance probabilistically

5310
01:30:14,950 --> 01:30:14,960
have risen by chance probabilistically
 

5311
01:30:14,960 --> 01:30:16,709
have risen by chance probabilistically
and if i found this molecule able to

5312
01:30:16,709 --> 01:30:16,719
and if i found this molecule able to
 

5313
01:30:16,719 --> 01:30:18,470
and if i found this molecule able to
detect it enough quantities in the same

5314
01:30:18,470 --> 01:30:18,480
detect it enough quantities in the same
 

5315
01:30:18,480 --> 01:30:19,750
detect it enough quantities in the same
object like a machine like a mass

5316
01:30:19,750 --> 01:30:19,760
object like a machine like a mass
 

5317
01:30:19,760 --> 01:30:21,350
object like a machine like a mass
spectrometer so typically in a mass

5318
01:30:21,350 --> 01:30:21,360
spectrometer so typically in a mass
 

5319
01:30:21,360 --> 01:30:23,270
spectrometer so typically in a mass
spectrometer you weigh the molecules in

5320
01:30:23,270 --> 01:30:23,280
spectrometer you weigh the molecules in
 

5321
01:30:23,280 --> 01:30:25,030
spectrometer you weigh the molecules in
electric field you probably have to have

5322
01:30:25,030 --> 01:30:25,040
electric field you probably have to have
 

5323
01:30:25,040 --> 01:30:26,790
electric field you probably have to have
on the order of 10 000 identical

5324
01:30:26,790 --> 01:30:26,800
on the order of 10 000 identical
 

5325
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:29,430
on the order of 10 000 identical
molecules to get a signal so 10 000

5326
01:30:29,430 --> 01:30:29,440
molecules to get a signal so 10 000
 

5327
01:30:29,440 --> 01:30:32,629
molecules to get a signal so 10 000
identical molecules that are complex

5328
01:30:32,629 --> 01:30:32,639
identical molecules that are complex
 

5329
01:30:32,639 --> 01:30:35,350
identical molecules that are complex
what's the chance of them occurring by

5330
01:30:35,350 --> 01:30:35,360
what's the chance of them occurring by
 

5331
01:30:35,360 --> 01:30:36,470
what's the chance of them occurring by
chance

5332
01:30:36,470 --> 01:30:36,480

well we can do the math let's take a

5334
01:30:37,830 --> 01:30:37,840
well we can do the math let's take a
 

5335
01:30:37,840 --> 01:30:39,990
well we can do the math let's take a
molecule like strychnine or

5336
01:30:39,990 --> 01:30:40,000
molecule like strychnine or
 

5337
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:41,189
molecule like strychnine or
um

5338
01:30:41,189 --> 01:30:41,199
um
 

5339
01:30:41,199 --> 01:30:43,430
um
or yes a stricken is a good molecule

5340
01:30:43,430 --> 01:30:43,440
or yes a stricken is a good molecule
 

5341
01:30:43,440 --> 01:30:44,790
or yes a stricken is a good molecule
actually to take

5342
01:30:44,790 --> 01:30:44,800
actually to take
 

5343
01:30:44,800 --> 01:30:47,030

or viagra is a good molecule i have made

5344
01:30:47,030 --> 01:30:47,040
or viagra is a good molecule i have made
 

5345
01:30:47,040 --> 01:30:48,629
or viagra is a good molecule i have made
jokes about viagra because it's complex

5346
01:30:48,629 --> 01:30:48,639
jokes about viagra because it's complex
 

5347
01:30:48,639 --> 01:30:50,470
jokes about viagra because it's complex
molecule and one of my friends said yeah

5348
01:30:50,470 --> 01:30:50,480
molecule and one of my friends said yeah
 

5349
01:30:50,480 --> 01:30:52,709
molecule and one of my friends said yeah
if we find viagra on mars in detectable

5350
01:30:52,709 --> 01:30:52,719
if we find viagra on mars in detectable
 

5351
01:30:52,719 --> 01:30:57,669
if we find viagra on mars in detectable
quantities we know something is up

5352
01:30:57,669 --> 01:30:57,679

 

5353
01:30:57,679 --> 01:31:00,070

yeah but anyway it's a complex molecule

5354
01:31:00,070 --> 01:31:00,080
yeah but anyway it's a complex molecule
 

5355
01:31:00,080 --> 01:31:01,590
yeah but anyway it's a complex molecule
so what you do is you take this molecule

5356
01:31:01,590 --> 01:31:01,600
so what you do is you take this molecule
 

5357
01:31:01,600 --> 01:31:02,950
so what you do is you take this molecule
in the mass spectrometer and you hit it

5358
01:31:02,950 --> 01:31:02,960
in the mass spectrometer and you hit it
 

5359
01:31:02,960 --> 01:31:04,550
in the mass spectrometer and you hit it
with some electrons or an electric field

5360
01:31:04,550 --> 01:31:04,560
with some electrons or an electric field
 

5361
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:06,149
with some electrons or an electric field
it breaks apart

5362
01:31:06,149 --> 01:31:06,159
it breaks apart
 

5363
01:31:06,159 --> 01:31:08,790
it breaks apart
and if the larger than the larger the

5364
01:31:08,790 --> 01:31:08,800
and if the larger than the larger the
 

5365
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:11,350
and if the larger than the larger the
number of different parts you know

5366
01:31:11,350 --> 01:31:11,360
number of different parts you know
 

5367
01:31:11,360 --> 01:31:12,950
number of different parts you know
when it starts to get to a threshold my

5368
01:31:12,950 --> 01:31:12,960
when it starts to get to a threshold my
 

5369
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:14,629
when it starts to get to a threshold my
idea was that that molecule could not be

5370
01:31:14,629 --> 01:31:14,639
idea was that that molecule could not be
 

5371
01:31:14,639 --> 01:31:17,110
idea was that that molecule could not be
created by chance probabilistically

5372
01:31:17,110 --> 01:31:17,120
created by chance probabilistically
 

5373
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:19,270
created by chance probabilistically
so that was where assembly thought

5374
01:31:19,270 --> 01:31:19,280
so that was where assembly thought
 

5375
01:31:19,280 --> 01:31:21,189
so that was where assembly thought
theory was born in an experiment in a

5376
01:31:21,189 --> 01:31:21,199
theory was born in an experiment in a
 

5377
01:31:21,199 --> 01:31:23,830
theory was born in an experiment in a
mass spec experiment and i was thinking

5378
01:31:23,830 --> 01:31:23,840
mass spec experiment and i was thinking
 

5379
01:31:23,840 --> 01:31:25,270
mass spec experiment and i was thinking
about this because nasa's sending the

5380
01:31:25,270 --> 01:31:25,280
about this because nasa's sending the
 

5381
01:31:25,280 --> 01:31:27,990
about this because nasa's sending the
mass spectrometers to mars to titan

5382
01:31:27,990 --> 01:31:28,000
mass spectrometers to mars to titan
 

5383
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:29,669
mass spectrometers to mars to titan
is going to send them to europa there's

5384
01:31:29,669 --> 01:31:29,679
is going to send them to europa there's
 

5385
01:31:29,679 --> 01:31:31,270
is going to send them to europa there's
going to be a nuclear-powered mass

5386
01:31:31,270 --> 01:31:31,280
going to be a nuclear-powered mass
 

5387
01:31:31,280 --> 01:31:33,189
going to be a nuclear-powered mass
spectrometer going to titan

5388
01:31:33,189 --> 01:31:33,199
spectrometer going to titan
 

5389
01:31:33,199 --> 01:31:34,550
spectrometer going to titan
this i mean this is the coolest

5390
01:31:34,550 --> 01:31:34,560
this i mean this is the coolest
 

5391
01:31:34,560 --> 01:31:36,629
this i mean this is the coolest
experiment ever they're not only sending

5392
01:31:36,629 --> 01:31:36,639
experiment ever they're not only sending
 

5393
01:31:36,639 --> 01:31:38,310
experiment ever they're not only sending
a drone that's going to fly around titan

5394
01:31:38,310 --> 01:31:38,320
a drone that's going to fly around titan
 

5395
01:31:38,320 --> 01:31:39,510
a drone that's going to fly around titan
it's going to be

5396
01:31:39,510 --> 01:31:39,520
it's going to be
 

5397
01:31:39,520 --> 01:31:41,270
it's going to be
powered by a you know

5398
01:31:41,270 --> 01:31:41,280
powered by a you know
 

5399
01:31:41,280 --> 01:31:43,830
powered by a you know
a nuclear slug a nuclear battery and

5400
01:31:43,830 --> 01:31:43,840
a nuclear slug a nuclear battery and
 

5401
01:31:43,840 --> 01:31:45,270
a nuclear slug a nuclear battery and
it's going to have a mass spectrometer

5402
01:31:45,270 --> 01:31:45,280
it's going to have a mass spectrometer
 

5403
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:47,590
it's going to have a mass spectrometer
on it is this already launched no it's

5404
01:31:47,590 --> 01:31:47,600
on it is this already launched no it's
 

5405
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:49,510
on it is this already launched no it's
going to it's dragonfly and it's going

5406
01:31:49,510 --> 01:31:49,520
going to it's dragonfly and it's going
 

5407
01:31:49,520 --> 01:31:51,110
going to it's dragonfly and it's going
to be launched in a few years i think it

5408
01:31:51,110 --> 01:31:51,120
to be launched in a few years i think it
 

5409
01:31:51,120 --> 01:31:52,229
to be launched in a few years i think it
got pushed a year because of the

5410
01:31:52,229 --> 01:31:52,239
got pushed a year because of the
 

5411
01:31:52,239 --> 01:31:53,350
got pushed a year because of the
pandemic

5412
01:31:53,350 --> 01:31:53,360
pandemic
 

5413
01:31:53,360 --> 01:31:55,189
pandemic
so i think you you three or four years

5414
01:31:55,189 --> 01:31:55,199
so i think you you three or four years
 

5415
01:31:55,199 --> 01:31:56,149
so i think you you three or four years
fly

5416
01:31:56,149 --> 01:31:56,159
fly
 

5417
01:31:56,159 --> 01:31:58,550
fly
nuclear dragonfly is going to fly to

5418
01:31:58,550 --> 01:31:58,560

of the various chemicals on titan yeah

5428
01:32:09,910 --> 01:32:09,920
of the various chemicals on titan yeah
 

5429
01:32:09,920 --> 01:32:11,669
of the various chemicals on titan yeah
i'm trying to convince nasa i don't know

5430
01:32:11,669 --> 01:32:11,679
i'm trying to convince nasa i don't know
 

5431
01:32:11,679 --> 01:32:13,350
i'm trying to convince nasa i don't know
if i'll be able to convince the dragon

5432
01:32:13,350 --> 01:32:13,360
if i'll be able to convince the dragon

fly team

5434
01:32:14,950 --> 01:32:14,960
fly team
 

5435
01:32:14,960 --> 01:32:16,790
fly team
um that they should apply this approach

5436
01:32:16,790 --> 01:32:16,800
um that they should apply this approach
 

5437
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:18,709
um that they should apply this approach
but they will get data and depending on

5438
01:32:18,709 --> 01:32:18,719
but they will get data and depending on
 

5439
01:32:18,719 --> 01:32:20,790
but they will get data and depending on
how good their mass spectrometer is but

5440
01:32:20,790 --> 01:32:20,800
how good their mass spectrometer is but
 

5441
01:32:20,800 --> 01:32:22,390
how good their mass spectrometer is but
i had this thought experiment anyway i

5442
01:32:22,390 --> 01:32:22,400
i had this thought experiment anyway i
 

5443
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:24,229
i had this thought experiment anyway i
did this thought experiment

5444
01:32:24,229 --> 01:32:24,239
did this thought experiment
 

5445
01:32:24,239 --> 01:32:26,870
did this thought experiment
and for me it seemed to work i i turned

5446
01:32:26,870 --> 01:32:26,880
and for me it seemed to work i i turned
 

5447
01:32:26,880 --> 01:32:28,870
and for me it seemed to work i i turned
the thought experiment into an algorithm

5448
01:32:28,870 --> 01:32:28,880
the thought experiment into an algorithm
 

5449
01:32:28,880 --> 01:32:30,709
the thought experiment into an algorithm
in assembly theory and i basically

5450
01:32:30,709 --> 01:32:30,719
in assembly theory and i basically
 

5451
01:32:30,719 --> 01:32:32,870
in assembly theory and i basically
assembly theory if i take let's just

5452
01:32:32,870 --> 01:32:32,880
assembly theory if i take let's just
 

5453
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:34,390
assembly theory if i take let's just
make it generic and let's just take the

5454
01:32:34,390 --> 01:32:34,400
make it generic and let's just take the
 

5455
01:32:34,400 --> 01:32:37,510
make it generic and let's just take the
word abracadabra say can i

5456
01:32:37,510 --> 01:32:37,520
word abracadabra say can i
 

5457
01:32:37,520 --> 01:32:39,270
word abracadabra say can i
um if you find the word so if you have a

5458
01:32:39,270 --> 01:32:39,280
um if you find the word so if you have a
 

5459
01:32:39,280 --> 01:32:41,270
um if you find the word so if you have a
book with lots of words in it and you

5460
01:32:41,270 --> 01:32:41,280
book with lots of words in it and you
 

5461
01:32:41,280 --> 01:32:43,510
book with lots of words in it and you
find abracadabra one off and it's a wrap

5462
01:32:43,510 --> 01:32:43,520
find abracadabra one off and it's a wrap
 

5463
01:32:43,520 --> 01:32:45,350
find abracadabra one off and it's a wrap
book that's been written by

5464
01:32:45,350 --> 01:32:45,360
book that's been written by
 

5465
01:32:45,360 --> 01:32:47,669
book that's been written by
in a random way you know set of monkeys

5466
01:32:47,669 --> 01:32:47,679
in a random way you know set of monkeys
 

5467
01:32:47,679 --> 01:32:49,590
in a random way you know set of monkeys
in a room and you know head type and

5468
01:32:49,590 --> 01:32:49,600
in a room and you know head type and
 

5469
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:51,030
in a room and you know head type and
you're on typewriters and you find one

5470
01:32:51,030 --> 01:32:51,040
you're on typewriters and you find one
 

5471
01:32:51,040 --> 01:32:52,709
you're on typewriters and you find one
or fabric adapter no big deal but if you

5472
01:32:52,709 --> 01:32:52,719
or fabric adapter no big deal but if you
 

5473
01:32:52,719 --> 01:32:54,629
or fabric adapter no big deal but if you
find lots of reoccurrences of

5474
01:32:54,629 --> 01:32:54,639
find lots of reoccurrences of
 

5475
01:32:54,639 --> 01:32:56,550
find lots of reoccurrences of
abracadabra well that means something

5476
01:32:56,550 --> 01:32:56,560
abracadabra well that means something
 

5477
01:32:56,560 --> 01:32:58,229
abracadabra well that means something
weird is going on but let's think about

5478
01:32:58,229 --> 01:32:58,239
weird is going on but let's think about
 

5479
01:32:58,239 --> 01:33:00,390
weird is going on but let's think about
the assembly number of abracadabra

5480
01:33:00,390 --> 01:33:00,400
the assembly number of abracadabra
 

5481
01:33:00,400 --> 01:33:01,110
the assembly number of abracadabra
so

5482
01:33:01,110 --> 01:33:01,120
so
 

5483
01:33:01,120 --> 01:33:03,110
so
abracadabra has a you know

5484
01:33:03,110 --> 01:33:03,120
abracadabra has a you know
 

5485
01:33:03,120 --> 01:33:04,950
abracadabra has a you know
has a number of letters in it you can

5486
01:33:04,950 --> 01:33:04,960
has a number of letters in it you can
 

5487
01:33:04,960 --> 01:33:06,149
has a number of letters in it you can
break it down so you just cut the

5488
01:33:06,149 --> 01:33:06,159
break it down so you just cut the
 

5489
01:33:06,159 --> 01:33:07,350
break it down so you just cut the
letters up

5490
01:33:07,350 --> 01:33:07,360
letters up
 

5491
01:33:07,360 --> 01:33:08,709
letters up
but when you actually reassemble

5492
01:33:08,709 --> 01:33:08,719
but when you actually reassemble
 

5493
01:33:08,719 --> 01:33:11,030
but when you actually reassemble
abracadabra the minimum number of ways

5494
01:33:11,030 --> 01:33:11,040
abracadabra the minimum number of ways
 

5495
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:12,629
abracadabra the minimum number of ways
of organizing those letters so you'd

5496
01:33:12,629 --> 01:33:12,639
of organizing those letters so you'd
 

5497
01:33:12,639 --> 01:33:13,990
of organizing those letters so you'd
have an a a b

5498
01:33:13,990 --> 01:33:14,000
have an a a b
 

5499
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:15,030
have an a a b
you know

5500
01:33:15,030 --> 01:33:15,040
you know
 

5501
01:33:15,040 --> 01:33:16,709
you know
uh and keep going up

5502
01:33:16,709 --> 01:33:16,719
uh and keep going up
 

5503
01:33:16,719 --> 01:33:19,110
uh and keep going up
um there's just that you can when you

5504
01:33:19,110 --> 01:33:19,120
um there's just that you can when you
 

5505
01:33:19,120 --> 01:33:21,669
um there's just that you can when you
cut abracadabra up into parts you can

5506
01:33:21,669 --> 01:33:21,679
cut abracadabra up into parts you can
 

5507
01:33:21,679 --> 01:33:23,990
cut abracadabra up into parts you can
put it together again in seven steps so

5508
01:33:23,990 --> 01:33:24,000
put it together again in seven steps so
 

5509
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:25,590
put it together again in seven steps so
what does that mean that means if you

5510
01:33:25,590 --> 01:33:25,600
what does that mean that means if you
 

5511
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:27,510
what does that mean that means if you
basically don't re you're allowed to

5512
01:33:27,510 --> 01:33:27,520
basically don't re you're allowed to
 

5513
01:33:27,520 --> 01:33:29,430
basically don't re you're allowed to
reuse things you make in the chain at

5514
01:33:29,430 --> 01:33:29,440
reuse things you make in the chain at
 

5515
01:33:29,440 --> 01:33:30,470
reuse things you make in the chain at
the beginning

5516
01:33:30,470 --> 01:33:30,480
the beginning
 

5517
01:33:30,480 --> 01:33:32,550
the beginning
that's the memory of the universe the

5518
01:33:32,550 --> 01:33:32,560
that's the memory of the universe the
 

5519
01:33:32,560 --> 01:33:34,870
that's the memory of the universe the
process that makes abracadabra

5520
01:33:34,870 --> 01:33:34,880
process that makes abracadabra
 

5521
01:33:34,880 --> 01:33:36,550
process that makes abracadabra
and because that causal chain you can

5522
01:33:36,550 --> 01:33:36,560
and because that causal chain you can
 

5523
01:33:36,560 --> 01:33:39,030
and because that causal chain you can
then get to abracadabra quicker than the

5524
01:33:39,030 --> 01:33:39,040
then get to abracadabra quicker than the
 

5525
01:33:39,040 --> 01:33:40,870
then get to abracadabra quicker than the
number of letters if we're having to

5526
01:33:40,870 --> 01:33:40,880
number of letters if we're having to
 

5527
01:33:40,880 --> 01:33:43,030
number of letters if we're having to
specify only in seven

5528
01:33:43,030 --> 01:33:43,040
specify only in seven
 

5529
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:44,629
specify only in seven
so if you take that to a molecule and

5530
01:33:44,629 --> 01:33:44,639
so if you take that to a molecule and
 

5531
01:33:44,639 --> 01:33:46,310
so if you take that to a molecule and
you cut the molecule up

5532
01:33:46,310 --> 01:33:46,320
you cut the molecule up
 

5533
01:33:46,320 --> 01:33:47,750
you cut the molecule up
into parts

5534
01:33:47,750 --> 01:33:47,760
into parts
 

5535
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:49,910
into parts
and you can on the causal chain and you

5536
01:33:49,910 --> 01:33:49,920
and you can on the causal chain and you
 

5537
01:33:49,920 --> 01:33:51,669
and you can on the causal chain and you
basically start with the atoms and then

5538
01:33:51,669 --> 01:33:51,679
basically start with the atoms and then
 

5539
01:33:51,679 --> 01:33:54,070
basically start with the atoms and then
bonds and then you randomly add on those

5540
01:33:54,070 --> 01:33:54,080
bonds and then you randomly add on those
 

5541
01:33:54,080 --> 01:33:56,229
bonds and then you randomly add on those
parts to make the a make the b

5542
01:33:56,229 --> 01:33:56,239
parts to make the a make the b
 

5543
01:33:56,239 --> 01:33:58,950
parts to make the a make the b
make the and keep going all the way up

5544
01:33:58,950 --> 01:33:58,960
make the and keep going all the way up
 

5545
01:33:58,960 --> 01:34:01,110
make the and keep going all the way up
um i found that literally assembly

5546
01:34:01,110 --> 01:34:01,120
um i found that literally assembly
 

5547
01:34:01,120 --> 01:34:03,430
um i found that literally assembly
theory allows me to say how compressed a

5548
01:34:03,430 --> 01:34:03,440
theory allows me to say how compressed a
 

5549
01:34:03,440 --> 01:34:04,790
theory allows me to say how compressed a
molecule is

5550
01:34:04,790 --> 01:34:04,800
molecule is
 

5551
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:06,229
molecule is
so when there's some information in

5552
01:34:06,229 --> 01:34:06,239
so when there's some information in
 

5553
01:34:06,239 --> 01:34:07,030
so when there's some information in
there

5554
01:34:07,030 --> 01:34:07,040
there
 

5555
01:34:07,040 --> 01:34:09,510
there
um and i realized that assembly theory

5556
01:34:09,510 --> 01:34:09,520
um and i realized that assembly theory
 

5557
01:34:09,520 --> 01:34:11,669
um and i realized that assembly theory
is it wasn't isn't just

5558
01:34:11,669 --> 01:34:11,679
is it wasn't isn't just
 

5559
01:34:11,679 --> 01:34:13,590
is it wasn't isn't just
confined to molecular space it can apply

5560
01:34:13,590 --> 01:34:13,600
confined to molecular space it can apply
 

5561
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:14,709
confined to molecular space it can apply
to anything but let me finish the

5562
01:34:14,709 --> 01:34:14,719
to anything but let me finish the
 

5563
01:34:14,719 --> 01:34:17,189
to anything but let me finish the
molecular argument so what i did is i

5564
01:34:17,189 --> 01:34:17,199
molecular argument so what i did is i
 

5565
01:34:17,199 --> 01:34:20,550
molecular argument so what i did is i
i had this theory i was one of my one of

5566
01:34:20,550 --> 01:34:20,560
i had this theory i was one of my one of
 

5567
01:34:20,560 --> 01:34:22,550
i had this theory i was one of my one of
my students we wrote an algorithm

5568
01:34:22,550 --> 01:34:22,560
my students we wrote an algorithm
 

5569
01:34:22,560 --> 01:34:24,070
my students we wrote an algorithm
we basically took the

5570
01:34:24,070 --> 01:34:24,080
we basically took the
 

5571
01:34:24,080 --> 01:34:26,149
we basically took the
20 million molecules from the database

5572
01:34:26,149 --> 01:34:26,159
20 million molecules from the database
 

5573
01:34:26,159 --> 01:34:27,510
20 million molecules from the database
and we just calculated their assembly

5574
01:34:27,510 --> 01:34:27,520
and we just calculated their assembly
 

5575
01:34:27,520 --> 01:34:28,629
and we just calculated their assembly
number

5576
01:34:28,629 --> 01:34:28,639
number
 

5577
01:34:28,639 --> 01:34:30,790
number
and that's the index like basically

5578
01:34:30,790 --> 01:34:30,800
and that's the index like basically
 

5579
01:34:30,800 --> 01:34:32,629
and that's the index like basically
if i take a molecule and i cut it up

5580
01:34:32,629 --> 01:34:32,639
if i take a molecule and i cut it up
 

5581
01:34:32,639 --> 01:34:33,830
if i take a molecule and i cut it up
into bonds

5582
01:34:33,830 --> 01:34:33,840
into bonds
 

5583
01:34:33,840 --> 01:34:35,830
into bonds
what is the minimum number of steps i

5584
01:34:35,830 --> 01:34:35,840
what is the minimum number of steps i
 

5585
01:34:35,840 --> 01:34:38,629
what is the minimum number of steps i
need to take to reform that molecule

5586
01:34:38,629 --> 01:34:38,639
need to take to reform that molecule
 

5587
01:34:38,639 --> 01:34:41,830
need to take to reform that molecule
from atoms so reusability of previously

5588
01:34:41,830 --> 01:34:41,840
from atoms so reusability of previously
 

5589
01:34:41,840 --> 01:34:43,830
from atoms so reusability of previously
foreign things is somehow fundamental

5590
01:34:43,830 --> 01:34:43,840
foreign things is somehow fundamental
 

5591
01:34:43,840 --> 01:34:45,430
foreign things is somehow fundamental
exactly it's like a memory in the

5592
01:34:45,430 --> 01:34:45,440
exactly it's like a memory in the
 

5593
01:34:45,440 --> 01:34:47,430
exactly it's like a memory in the
universe right i'm making lots of leaps

5594
01:34:47,430 --> 01:34:47,440
universe right i'm making lots of leaps
 

5595
01:34:47,440 --> 01:34:49,030
universe right i'm making lots of leaps
here like it's kind of weird i'm saying

5596
01:34:49,030 --> 01:34:49,040
here like it's kind of weird i'm saying
 

5597
01:34:49,040 --> 01:34:50,709
here like it's kind of weird i'm saying
right there's a process that can form

5598
01:34:50,709 --> 01:34:50,719
right there's a process that can form
 

5599
01:34:50,719 --> 01:34:53,350
right there's a process that can form
the a and the b and the c let's say and

5600
01:34:53,350 --> 01:34:53,360
the a and the b and the c let's say and
 

5601
01:34:53,360 --> 01:34:55,109
the a and the b and the c let's say and
then when there's and because we've

5602
01:34:55,109 --> 01:34:55,119
then when there's and because we've
 

5603
01:34:55,119 --> 01:34:56,950
then when there's and because we've
formed a and b before we can use a and b

5604
01:34:56,950 --> 01:34:56,960
formed a and b before we can use a and b
 

5605
01:34:56,960 --> 01:34:59,910
formed a and b before we can use a and b
again with no extra cost except one unit

5606
01:34:59,910 --> 01:34:59,920
again with no extra cost except one unit
 

5607
01:34:59,920 --> 01:35:01,750
again with no extra cost except one unit
so that's the kind of what the chain of

5608
01:35:01,750 --> 01:35:01,760
so that's the kind of what the chain of
 

5609
01:35:01,760 --> 01:35:03,510
so that's the kind of what the chain of
events and that's how you think about

5610
01:35:03,510 --> 01:35:03,520
events and that's how you think about
 

5611
01:35:03,520 --> 01:35:05,750
events and that's how you think about
memory here when you say the universe

5612
01:35:05,750 --> 01:35:05,760
memory here when you say the universe
 

5613
01:35:05,760 --> 01:35:08,070
memory here when you say the universe
when you talk about the universe and or

5614
01:35:08,070 --> 01:35:08,080
when you talk about the universe and or
 

5615
01:35:08,080 --> 01:35:10,310
when you talk about the universe and or
life is the universe

5616
01:35:10,310 --> 01:35:10,320
life is the universe
 

5617
01:35:10,320 --> 01:35:14,149
life is the universe
creating memory exactly so we we we went

5618
01:35:14,149 --> 01:35:14,159
creating memory exactly so we we we went
 

5619
01:35:14,159 --> 01:35:15,590
creating memory exactly so we we we went
through chemical space and we looked at

5620
01:35:15,590 --> 01:35:15,600
through chemical space and we looked at
 

5621
01:35:15,600 --> 01:35:17,270
through chemical space and we looked at
the assembly numbers and we were able to

5622
01:35:17,270 --> 01:35:17,280
the assembly numbers and we were able to
 

5623
01:35:17,280 --> 01:35:19,590
the assembly numbers and we were able to
classify it we said okay

5624
01:35:19,590 --> 01:35:19,600
classify it we said okay
 

5625
01:35:19,600 --> 01:35:22,070
classify it we said okay
let's test it let's go so we're able to

5626
01:35:22,070 --> 01:35:22,080
let's test it let's go so we're able to
 

5627
01:35:22,080 --> 01:35:23,990
let's test it let's go so we're able to
take a whole bunch of molecules and

5628
01:35:23,990 --> 01:35:24,000
take a whole bunch of molecules and
 

5629
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,550
take a whole bunch of molecules and
assign an assembly index to them

5630
01:35:26,550 --> 01:35:26,560
assign an assembly index to them
 

5631
01:35:26,560 --> 01:35:29,030
assign an assembly index to them
okay and it's just those

5632
01:35:29,030 --> 01:35:29,040
okay and it's just those
 

5633
01:35:29,040 --> 01:35:30,629
okay and it's just those
as a function of the number of bonds in

5634
01:35:30,629 --> 01:35:30,639
as a function of the number of bonds in
 

5635
01:35:30,639 --> 01:35:32,390

the molecule how much symmetry so

5636
01:35:32,390 --> 01:35:32,400
the molecule how much symmetry so
 

5637
01:35:32,400 --> 01:35:34,709
the molecule how much symmetry so
literally assembly theory is a measure

5638
01:35:34,709 --> 01:35:34,719
literally assembly theory is a measure
 

5639
01:35:34,719 --> 01:35:38,550
literally assembly theory is a measure
of how little symmetry a molecule has so

5640
01:35:38,550 --> 01:35:38,560
of how little symmetry a molecule has so
 

5641
01:35:38,560 --> 01:35:40,390
of how little symmetry a molecule has so
the more asymmetry the more information

5642
01:35:40,390 --> 01:35:40,400
the more asymmetry the more information
 

5643
01:35:40,400 --> 01:35:42,310
the more asymmetry the more information
the more weird it is like a jackson

5644
01:35:42,310 --> 01:35:42,320
the more weird it is like a jackson
 

5645
01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:45,350
the more weird it is like a jackson
pollock or some description so i then

5646
01:35:45,350 --> 01:35:45,360
pollock or some description so i then
 

5647
01:35:45,360 --> 01:35:46,310
pollock or some description so i then
went

5648
01:35:46,310 --> 01:35:46,320
went
 

5649
01:35:46,320 --> 01:35:47,910
went
and did a load of experiments and i

5650
01:35:47,910 --> 01:35:47,920
and did a load of experiments and i
 

5651
01:35:47,920 --> 01:35:50,149
and did a load of experiments and i
basically took those molecules i cut

5652
01:35:50,149 --> 01:35:50,159
basically took those molecules i cut
 

5653
01:35:50,159 --> 01:35:51,590
basically took those molecules i cut
them up in the mass spec and measured

5654
01:35:51,590 --> 01:35:51,600
them up in the mass spec and measured
 

5655
01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:53,109
them up in the mass spec and measured
the number of peaks without any

5656
01:35:53,109 --> 01:35:53,119
the number of peaks without any
 

5657
01:35:53,119 --> 01:35:55,030
the number of peaks without any
knowledge of the molecule

5658
01:35:55,030 --> 01:35:55,040
knowledge of the molecule
 

5659
01:35:55,040 --> 01:35:57,030
knowledge of the molecule
and we found the assembly num then the

5660
01:35:57,030 --> 01:35:57,040
and we found the assembly num then the
 

5661
01:35:57,040 --> 01:35:58,870
and we found the assembly num then the
there was a almost

5662
01:35:58,870 --> 01:35:58,880
there was a almost
 

5663
01:35:58,880 --> 01:36:00,629
there was a almost
not quite a one-to-one correlation but

5664
01:36:00,629 --> 01:36:00,639
not quite a one-to-one correlation but
 

5665
01:36:00,639 --> 01:36:02,629
not quite a one-to-one correlation but
almost because not all bonds are equal

5666
01:36:02,629 --> 01:36:02,639
almost because not all bonds are equal
 

5667
01:36:02,639 --> 01:36:04,310
almost because not all bonds are equal
they have different energies i then did

5668
01:36:04,310 --> 01:36:04,320
they have different energies i then did
 

5669
01:36:04,320 --> 01:36:06,390
they have different energies i then did

to basically jangle the molecules and

5676
01:36:11,669 --> 01:36:11,679
to basically jangle the molecules and
 

5677
01:36:11,679 --> 01:36:13,590
to basically jangle the molecules and
get a signature out and i also used

and what we did
 

5703
01:36:33,679 --> 01:36:35,510
and what we did
in the next part of the work

5704
01:36:35,510 --> 01:36:35,520
in the next part of the work
 

5705
01:36:35,520 --> 01:36:38,390
in the next part of the work
is um we took molecules randomly from

5706
01:36:38,390 --> 01:36:38,400
is um we took molecules randomly from
 

5707
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:40,550
is um we took molecules randomly from
the environment from outer space from

01:36:49,679 --> 01:36:51,430
and they because they didn't believe us
blinded some samples

5718
01:36:51,430 --> 01:36:51,440
blinded some samples
 

5719
01:36:51,440 --> 01:36:53,910
blinded some samples
and that we found that all

5720
01:36:53,910 --> 01:36:53,920
and that we found that all
 

5721
01:36:53,920 --> 01:36:55,669
and that we found that all
these samples that

5722
01:36:55,669 --> 01:36:55,679
these samples that
 

5723
01:36:55,679 --> 01:36:57,270
these samples that
came from biology

5724
01:36:57,270 --> 01:36:57,280
came from biology
 

5725
01:36:57,280 --> 01:36:59,590
came from biology
produced molecules that had a very high

5726
01:36:59,590 --> 01:36:59,600
produced molecules that had a very high
 

5727
01:36:59,600 --> 01:37:01,350
produced molecules that had a very high
assembly number above a threshold of

5728
01:37:01,350 --> 01:37:01,360
assembly number above a threshold of
 

5729
01:37:01,360 --> 01:37:02,709
assembly number above a threshold of
about 15.

5730
01:37:02,709 --> 01:37:02,719
about 15.
 

5731
01:37:02,719 --> 01:37:04,070
about 15.
so basically

5732
01:37:04,070 --> 01:37:04,080
so basically
 

5733
01:37:04,080 --> 01:37:05,990
so basically
all the other stuff that came from our

5734
01:37:05,990 --> 01:37:06,000
all the other stuff that came from our
 

5735
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:07,830
all the other stuff that came from our
ebiotic origin

5736
01:37:07,830 --> 01:37:07,840
ebiotic origin
 

5737
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:10,310
ebiotic origin
was low there was no complexity there so

5738
01:37:10,310 --> 01:37:10,320
was low there was no complexity there so
 

5739
01:37:10,320 --> 01:37:12,149
was low there was no complexity there so
we suddenly realized that on earth at

5740
01:37:12,149 --> 01:37:12,159
we suddenly realized that on earth at
 

5741
01:37:12,159 --> 01:37:14,229
we suddenly realized that on earth at
least there is a cut-off that

5742
01:37:14,229 --> 01:37:14,239
least there is a cut-off that
 

5743
01:37:14,239 --> 01:37:15,990
least there is a cut-off that
natural phenomena

5744
01:37:15,990 --> 01:37:16,000
natural phenomena
 

5745
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,149
natural phenomena
cannot produce molecules that need more

5746
01:37:18,149 --> 01:37:18,159
cannot produce molecules that need more
 

5747
01:37:18,159 --> 01:37:21,030
cannot produce molecules that need more
than 15 steps to make them

5748
01:37:21,030 --> 01:37:21,040
than 15 steps to make them
 

5749
01:37:21,040 --> 01:37:23,590
than 15 steps to make them
so i realized that this is a way to make

5750
01:37:23,590 --> 01:37:23,600
so i realized that this is a way to make
 

5751
01:37:23,600 --> 01:37:26,390
so i realized that this is a way to make
a scale of life a scale of technology as

5752
01:37:26,390 --> 01:37:26,400
a scale of life a scale of technology as
 

5753
01:37:26,400 --> 01:37:27,270
a scale of life a scale of technology as
well

5754
01:37:27,270 --> 01:37:27,280
well
 

5755
01:37:27,280 --> 01:37:28,229
well
and

5756
01:37:28,229 --> 01:37:28,239
and
 

5757
01:37:28,239 --> 01:37:29,750
and
literally you could just go sniffing for

5758
01:37:29,750 --> 01:37:29,760
literally you could just go sniffing for
 

5759
01:37:29,760 --> 01:37:33,350
literally you could just go sniffing for
molecules off earth on titan on mars and

5760
01:37:33,350 --> 01:37:33,360
molecules off earth on titan on mars and
 

5761
01:37:33,360 --> 01:37:35,030
molecules off earth on titan on mars and
when you find a molecule in the mass

5762
01:37:35,030 --> 01:37:35,040
when you find a molecule in the mass
 

5763
01:37:35,040 --> 01:37:36,709
when you find a molecule in the mass
spectrometer that gives you more than 15

5764
01:37:36,709 --> 01:37:36,719
spectrometer that gives you more than 15
 

5765
01:37:36,719 --> 01:37:38,790
spectrometer that gives you more than 15
parts you'll know

5766
01:37:38,790 --> 01:37:38,800
parts you'll know
 

5767
01:37:38,800 --> 01:37:40,470
parts you'll know
pretty much for sure

5768
01:37:40,470 --> 01:37:40,480
pretty much for sure
 

5769
01:37:40,480 --> 01:37:43,030
pretty much for sure
that it had to be produced by evolution

5770
01:37:43,030 --> 01:37:43,040
that it had to be produced by evolution
 

5771
01:37:43,040 --> 01:37:44,390
that it had to be produced by evolution
and this allowed me to come up with a

5772
01:37:44,390 --> 01:37:44,400
and this allowed me to come up with a
 

5773
01:37:44,400 --> 01:37:45,990
and this allowed me to come up with a
general definition of life based on

5774
01:37:45,990 --> 01:37:46,000
general definition of life based on
 

5775
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,310
general definition of life based on
assembly theory to say that if i find an

5776
01:37:48,310 --> 01:37:48,320
assembly theory to say that if i find an
 

5777
01:37:48,320 --> 01:37:49,430
assembly theory to say that if i find an
object

5778
01:37:49,430 --> 01:37:49,440
object
 

5779
01:37:49,440 --> 01:37:51,350
object
that has a that has a large number of

5780
01:37:51,350 --> 01:37:51,360
that has a that has a large number of
 

5781
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:55,189
that has a that has a large number of
parts say an iphone or boeing 747 or you

5782
01:37:55,189 --> 01:37:55,199
parts say an iphone or boeing 747 or you
 

5783
01:37:55,199 --> 01:37:56,149
parts say an iphone or boeing 747 or you
know

5784
01:37:56,149 --> 01:37:56,159
know
 

5785
01:37:56,159 --> 01:37:58,070
know
any complex object and i can find it in

5786
01:37:58,070 --> 01:37:58,080
any complex object and i can find it in
 

5787
01:37:58,080 --> 01:38:00,550
any complex object and i can find it in
abundance and cut it up

5788
01:38:00,550 --> 01:38:00,560
abundance and cut it up
 

5789
01:38:00,560 --> 01:38:02,470
abundance and cut it up
i can tell you whether that has been

5790
01:38:02,470 --> 01:38:02,480
i can tell you whether that has been
 

5791
01:38:02,480 --> 01:38:04,629
i can tell you whether that has been
produced by an informational process or

5792
01:38:04,629 --> 01:38:04,639
produced by an informational process or
 

5793
01:38:04,639 --> 01:38:06,550
produced by an informational process or
not and that's what assembly theory kind

5794
01:38:06,550 --> 01:38:06,560
not and that's what assembly theory kind
 

5795
01:38:06,560 --> 01:38:07,510
not and that's what assembly theory kind
of does

5796
01:38:07,510 --> 01:38:07,520
of does
 

5797
01:38:07,520 --> 01:38:09,669
of does
but it goes a bit further

5798
01:38:09,669 --> 01:38:09,679
but it goes a bit further
 

5799
01:38:09,679 --> 01:38:11,510
but it goes a bit further
i then realized that this isn't just

5800
01:38:11,510 --> 01:38:11,520
i then realized that this isn't just
 

5801
01:38:11,520 --> 01:38:14,149
i then realized that this isn't just
about life it's about causation

5802
01:38:14,149 --> 01:38:14,159
about life it's about causation
 

5803
01:38:14,159 --> 01:38:15,830
about life it's about causation
so actually it tells you about where

5804
01:38:15,830 --> 01:38:15,840
so actually it tells you about where
 

5805
01:38:15,840 --> 01:38:17,750
so actually it tells you about where
there's a causal structure so now i can

5806
01:38:17,750 --> 01:38:17,760
there's a causal structure so now i can
 

5807
01:38:17,760 --> 01:38:19,109
there's a causal structure so now i can
look at objects in the universe say that

5808
01:38:19,109 --> 01:38:19,119
look at objects in the universe say that
 

5809
01:38:19,119 --> 01:38:20,870
look at objects in the universe say that
again this cup and say right i'm going

5810
01:38:20,870 --> 01:38:20,880
again this cup and say right i'm going
 

5811
01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:22,629
again this cup and say right i'm going
to look at how many independent parts it

5812
01:38:22,629 --> 01:38:22,639
to look at how many independent parts it
 

5813
01:38:22,639 --> 01:38:23,510
to look at how many independent parts it
has

5814
01:38:23,510 --> 01:38:23,520
has
 

5815
01:38:23,520 --> 01:38:25,350
has
so that's the assembly number

5816
01:38:25,350 --> 01:38:25,360
so that's the assembly number
 

5817
01:38:25,360 --> 01:38:27,590
so that's the assembly number
i'll then look at the abundance how many

5818
01:38:27,590 --> 01:38:27,600
i'll then look at the abundance how many
 

5819
01:38:27,600 --> 01:38:29,189
i'll then look at the abundance how many
cups are two on this table maybe there's

5820
01:38:29,189 --> 01:38:29,199
cups are two on this table maybe there's
 

5821
01:38:29,199 --> 01:38:31,590
cups are two on this table maybe there's
a few more you got stashed away so

5822
01:38:31,590 --> 01:38:31,600
a few more you got stashed away so
 

5823
01:38:31,600 --> 01:38:34,709
a few more you got stashed away so
assembly is a is a function of

5824
01:38:34,709 --> 01:38:34,719
assembly is a is a function of
 

5825
01:38:34,719 --> 01:38:37,189
assembly is a is a function of
the complexity of the object

5826
01:38:37,189 --> 01:38:37,199
the complexity of the object
 

5827
01:38:37,199 --> 01:38:38,950
the complexity of the object
times the number of copy numbers of that

5828
01:38:38,950 --> 01:38:38,960
times the number of copy numbers of that
 

5829
01:38:38,960 --> 01:38:40,709
times the number of copy numbers of that
object or a function of the copy number

5830
01:38:40,709 --> 01:38:40,719
object or a function of the copy number
 

5831
01:38:40,719 --> 01:38:42,870
object or a function of the copy number
normalized so i realize there's a new

5832
01:38:42,870 --> 01:38:42,880
normalized so i realize there's a new
 

5833
01:38:42,880 --> 01:38:46,149
normalized so i realize there's a new
quantity in the universe you have energy

5834
01:38:46,149 --> 01:38:46,159
quantity in the universe you have energy
 

5835
01:38:46,159 --> 01:38:49,030
quantity in the universe you have energy
entropy and assembly

5836
01:38:49,030 --> 01:38:49,040
entropy and assembly
 

5837
01:38:49,040 --> 01:38:50,629
entropy and assembly
so assembly the way we should think

5838
01:38:50,629 --> 01:38:50,639
so assembly the way we should think
 

5839
01:38:50,639 --> 01:38:53,510
so assembly the way we should think
about that is uh how much uh reusability

5840
01:38:53,510 --> 01:38:53,520
about that is uh how much uh reusability
 

5841
01:38:53,520 --> 01:38:55,109
about that is uh how much uh reusability
there is

5842
01:38:55,109 --> 01:38:55,119
there is
 

5843
01:38:55,119 --> 01:38:55,990
there is
because

5844
01:38:55,990 --> 01:38:56,000
because
 

5845
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:57,990
because
reusability is like the like can you

5846
01:38:57,990 --> 01:38:58,000
reusability is like the like can you
 

5847
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,310
reusability is like the like can you
play devil's advocate to this so like

5848
01:39:00,310 --> 01:39:00,320
play devil's advocate to this so like
 

5849
01:39:00,320 --> 01:39:01,990
play devil's advocate to this so like
could this just be

5850
01:39:01,990 --> 01:39:02,000
could this just be
 

5851
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,070
could this just be
a nice

5852
01:39:04,070 --> 01:39:04,080
a nice
 

5853
01:39:04,080 --> 01:39:05,510
a nice
uh

5854
01:39:05,510 --> 01:39:05,520
uh
 

5855
01:39:05,520 --> 01:39:08,070
uh
tertiary signal

5856
01:39:08,070 --> 01:39:08,080
tertiary signal
 

5857
01:39:08,080 --> 01:39:10,229
tertiary signal
for living organisms

5858
01:39:10,229 --> 01:39:10,239
for living organisms
 

5859
01:39:10,239 --> 01:39:13,350
for living organisms
like some kind of distant signal that's

5860
01:39:13,350 --> 01:39:13,360
like some kind of distant signal that's
 

5861
01:39:13,360 --> 01:39:15,510
like some kind of distant signal that's
yeah this is a nice property but it's

5862
01:39:15,510 --> 01:39:15,520
yeah this is a nice property but it's
 

5863
01:39:15,520 --> 01:39:17,750
yeah this is a nice property but it's
not capturing something fundamental or

5864
01:39:17,750 --> 01:39:17,760
not capturing something fundamental or
 

5865
01:39:17,760 --> 01:39:19,590
not capturing something fundamental or
do you think reusability is something

5866
01:39:19,590 --> 01:39:19,600
do you think reusability is something
 

5867
01:39:19,600 --> 01:39:21,750
do you think reusability is something
fundamental to the life and complex

5868
01:39:21,750 --> 01:39:21,760
fundamental to the life and complex
 

5869
01:39:21,760 --> 01:39:23,590
fundamental to the life and complex
organisms i think reusability is

5870
01:39:23,590 --> 01:39:23,600
organisms i think reusability is
 

5871
01:39:23,600 --> 01:39:25,510
organisms i think reusability is
fundamental in the universe

5872
01:39:25,510 --> 01:39:25,520
fundamental in the universe
 

5873
01:39:25,520 --> 01:39:27,030
fundamental in the universe
not just for life and complex or

5874
01:39:27,030 --> 01:39:27,040
not just for life and complex or
 

5875
01:39:27,040 --> 01:39:29,189
not just for life and complex or
organisms it's about causation

5876
01:39:29,189 --> 01:39:29,199
organisms it's about causation
 

5877
01:39:29,199 --> 01:39:30,870
organisms it's about causation
so i think assembly

5878
01:39:30,870 --> 01:39:30,880
so i think assembly
 

5879
01:39:30,880 --> 01:39:32,870
so i think assembly
tells you if you find objects because

5880
01:39:32,870 --> 01:39:32,880
tells you if you find objects because
 

5881
01:39:32,880 --> 01:39:34,470
tells you if you find objects because
you can do this reject trajectories as

5882
01:39:34,470 --> 01:39:34,480
you can do this reject trajectories as
 

5883
01:39:34,480 --> 01:39:37,270
you can do this reject trajectories as
well you think about it that

5884
01:39:37,270 --> 01:39:37,280
well you think about it that
 

5885
01:39:37,280 --> 01:39:39,430
well you think about it that
in the unit the fact there are objects

5886
01:39:39,430 --> 01:39:39,440
in the unit the fact there are objects
 

5887
01:39:39,440 --> 01:39:41,990
in the unit the fact there are objects
in the universe on earth his mind is

5888
01:39:41,990 --> 01:39:42,000
in the universe on earth his mind is
 

5889
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:43,669
in the universe on earth his mind is
weird

5890
01:39:43,669 --> 01:39:43,679
weird
 

5891
01:39:43,679 --> 01:39:45,270
weird
you think about it we should just have a

5892
01:39:45,270 --> 01:39:45,280
you think about it we should just have a
 

5893
01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:47,350
you think about it we should just have a
commentary explosion of stuff

5894
01:39:47,350 --> 01:39:47,360
commentary explosion of stuff
 

5895
01:39:47,360 --> 01:39:50,790
commentary explosion of stuff
the fact that not everything exists

5896
01:39:50,790 --> 01:39:50,800
the fact that not everything exists
 

5897
01:39:50,800 --> 01:39:51,590
the fact that not everything exists
is

5898
01:39:51,590 --> 01:39:51,600
is
 

5899
01:39:51,600 --> 01:39:53,430
is
is really weird

5900
01:39:53,430 --> 01:39:53,440
is really weird
 

5901
01:39:53,440 --> 01:39:56,070
is really weird
now and then

5902
01:39:56,070 --> 01:39:56,080
now and then
 

5903
01:39:56,080 --> 01:39:58,149
now and then
as i'm looking at two mugs and two water

5904
01:39:58,149 --> 01:39:58,159
as i'm looking at two mugs and two water
 

5905
01:39:58,159 --> 01:40:00,870
as i'm looking at two mugs and two water
bottles and uh the things that exist

5906
01:40:00,870 --> 01:40:00,880
bottles and uh the things that exist
 

5907
01:40:00,880 --> 01:40:02,310
bottles and uh the things that exist
kind of

5908
01:40:02,310 --> 01:40:02,320
kind of
 

5909
01:40:02,320 --> 01:40:03,750
kind of
uh

5910
01:40:03,750 --> 01:40:03,760
uh
 

5911
01:40:03,760 --> 01:40:06,149
uh
are similar and multiply

5912
01:40:06,149 --> 01:40:06,159
are similar and multiply
 

5913
01:40:06,159 --> 01:40:08,550
are similar and multiply
yeah in copies yeah yeah so i would say

5914
01:40:08,550 --> 01:40:08,560
yeah in copies yeah yeah so i would say
 

5915
01:40:08,560 --> 01:40:10,629
yeah in copies yeah yeah so i would say
that assembly allows you to do something

5916
01:40:10,629 --> 01:40:10,639
that assembly allows you to do something
 

5917
01:40:10,639 --> 01:40:12,629
that assembly allows you to do something
that statistical mechanics

5918
01:40:12,629 --> 01:40:12,639
that statistical mechanics
 

5919
01:40:12,639 --> 01:40:14,390
that statistical mechanics
and people looking at entropy have got

5920
01:40:14,390 --> 01:40:14,400
and people looking at entropy have got
 

5921
01:40:14,400 --> 01:40:16,870
and people looking at entropy have got
stuck with yeah for a while

5922
01:40:16,870 --> 01:40:16,880
stuck with yeah for a while
 

5923
01:40:16,880 --> 01:40:18,470
stuck with yeah for a while
so i'm making it's pretty bold i mean

5924
01:40:18,470 --> 01:40:18,480
so i'm making it's pretty bold i mean
 

5925
01:40:18,480 --> 01:40:20,390
so i'm making it's pretty bold i mean
i'm writing a paper with sarah walker on

5926
01:40:20,390 --> 01:40:20,400
i'm writing a paper with sarah walker on
 

5927
01:40:20,400 --> 01:40:23,030
i'm writing a paper with sarah walker on
this at the moment and we're realizing

5928
01:40:23,030 --> 01:40:23,040
this at the moment and we're realizing
 

5929
01:40:23,040 --> 01:40:24,229
this at the moment and we're realizing
we don't want to get ahead of ourselves

5930
01:40:24,229 --> 01:40:24,239
we don't want to get ahead of ourselves
 

5931
01:40:24,239 --> 01:40:25,830
we don't want to get ahead of ourselves
because i think that there's lots of

5932
01:40:25,830 --> 01:40:25,840
because i think that there's lots of
 

5933
01:40:25,840 --> 01:40:27,189
because i think that there's lots of
ways where this

5934
01:40:27,189 --> 01:40:27,199
ways where this
 

5935
01:40:27,199 --> 01:40:29,510
ways where this
is you know it's it's a really

5936
01:40:29,510 --> 01:40:29,520
is you know it's it's a really
 

5937
01:40:29,520 --> 01:40:32,229
is you know it's it's a really
interesting idea it works for molecules

5938
01:40:32,229 --> 01:40:32,239
interesting idea it works for molecules
 

5939
01:40:32,239 --> 01:40:33,990
interesting idea it works for molecules
and it appears to work for any objects

5940
01:40:33,990 --> 01:40:34,000
and it appears to work for any objects
 

5941
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:35,669
and it appears to work for any objects
produced by causation because you can

take a motor car you can look at the

5944
01:40:36,709 --> 01:40:36,719
take a motor car you can look at the
 

5945
01:40:36,719 --> 01:40:37,990
take a motor car you can look at the
assembly of the motor car look at a book

01:40:37,990 --> 01:40:38,000
assembly of the motor car look at a book
 

5947
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:39,669
assembly of the motor car look at a book
look at the assembly of the book

5948
01:40:39,669 --> 01:40:39,679
look at the assembly of the book
 

5949
01:40:39,679 --> 01:40:41,430
look at the assembly of the book
assembly theory tells you there's a way

5950
01:40:41,430 --> 01:40:41,440
assembly theory tells you there's a way
 

5951
01:40:41,440 --> 01:40:42,229
assembly theory tells you there's a way
of

01:40:42,239 --> 01:40:44,310
of
compressing and reusing and so when

compressing and reusing and so when
 

5955
01:40:44,320 --> 01:40:45,669

01:40:45,669 --> 01:40:45,679
people i talk to
 

5957
01:40:45,679 --> 01:40:47,270
people i talk to
information theorists they say oh this

5958
01:40:47,270 --> 01:40:47,280
information theorists they say oh this
 

5959
01:40:47,280 --> 01:40:50,149
information theorists they say oh this
is just logical depth i say it is like

5960
01:40:50,149 --> 01:40:50,159
is just logical depth i say it is like
 

5961
01:40:50,159 --> 01:40:52,310
is just logical depth i say it is like
logical depth but it's experimentally

5962
01:40:52,310 --> 01:40:52,320
logical depth but it's experimentally
 

5963
01:40:52,320 --> 01:40:53,669
logical depth but it's experimentally
measurable

5964
01:40:53,669 --> 01:40:53,679
measurable
 

5965
01:40:53,679 --> 01:40:54,790
measurable
they say oh it's a bit like common

5966
01:40:54,790 --> 01:40:54,800
they say oh it's a bit like common
 

5967
01:40:54,800 --> 01:40:56,790
they say oh it's a bit like common
golovk complexity and so but it's

5968
01:40:56,790 --> 01:40:56,800
golovk complexity and so but it's
 

5969
01:40:56,800 --> 01:40:58,870
golovk complexity and so but it's
computable

5970
01:40:58,870 --> 01:40:58,880
computable
 

5971
01:40:58,880 --> 01:40:59,990
computable
and now okay it's not infinitely

5972
01:40:59,990 --> 01:41:00,000
and now okay it's not infinitely
 

5973
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:01,990
and now okay it's not infinitely
computable gets mp hard very quickly

5974
01:41:01,990 --> 01:41:02,000
computable gets mp hard very quickly
 

5975
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:03,669

right it's very hard problem when you

5976
01:41:03,669 --> 01:41:03,679
right it's very hard problem when you
 

5977
01:41:03,679 --> 01:41:06,070
right it's very hard problem when you
could get but it's uncomputable enough

5978
01:41:06,070 --> 01:41:06,080
could get but it's uncomputable enough
 

5979
01:41:06,080 --> 01:41:07,910
could get but it's uncomputable enough
you're contractible enough to be able to

5980
01:41:07,910 --> 01:41:07,920
you're contractible enough to be able to
 

5981
01:41:07,920 --> 01:41:09,030
you're contractible enough to be able to
tell the difference between a molecule

5982
01:41:09,030 --> 01:41:09,040

uh causation
 

5989
01:41:13,520 --> 01:41:15,910
uh causation
and and i think that that's really

5990
01:41:15,910 --> 01:41:15,920
and and i think that that's really
 

5991
01:41:15,920 --> 01:41:17,430
and and i think that that's really
interesting because

5992
01:41:17,430 --> 01:41:17,440
interesting because
 

5993
01:41:17,440 --> 01:41:19,430
interesting because
until now there's no way of measuring

so when you have a molecule

6028
01:41:58,149 --> 01:41:58,159
so when you have a molecule
 

6029
01:41:58,159 --> 01:42:00,950
so when you have a molecule
you're trying to figure out okay

you're trying to figure out okay
 

6031
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:02,950
you're trying to figure out okay
if we were to reuse parts of this

01:42:02,960 --> 01:42:05,430
if we were to reuse parts of this
molecule which parts can we

6034
01:42:05,430 --> 01:42:05,440
molecule which parts can we
 

6035
01:42:05,440 --> 01:42:07,350
molecule which parts can we

to
uh as an optimization problem and be

01:42:10,390 --> 01:42:10,400
uh as an optimization problem and be
 

6041
01:42:10,400 --> 01:42:11,430
uh as an optimization problem and be
hard

6042
01:42:11,430 --> 01:42:11,440
hard
 

6043
01:42:11,440 --> 01:42:13,830
hard
to figure out the minimum amount of

01:42:13,830 --> 01:42:13,840
to figure out the minimum amount of
 

6045
01:42:13,840 --> 01:42:15,750
to figure out the minimum amount of

reused components
 

6047
01:42:15,760 --> 01:42:18,310

that will create this molecule and it

6048
01:42:18,310 --> 01:42:18,320
that will create this molecule and it
 

6049
01:42:18,320 --> 01:42:20,149
that will create this molecule and it
becomes difficult when you start to look

6050
01:42:20,149 --> 01:42:20,159
becomes difficult when you start to look
 

6051
01:42:20,159 --> 01:42:22,790
becomes difficult when you start to look
at a huge huge molecules arbitrarily

6052
01:42:22,790 --> 01:42:22,800
at a huge huge molecules arbitrarily
 

6053
01:42:22,800 --> 01:42:25,030
at a huge huge molecules arbitrarily
large because i'm also like mapping this

6054
01:42:25,030 --> 01:42:25,040
large because i'm also like mapping this
 

6055
01:42:25,040 --> 01:42:27,109
large because i'm also like mapping this
can i can i think about this

6056
01:42:27,109 --> 01:42:27,119
can i can i think about this
 

6057
01:42:27,119 --> 01:42:29,350
can i can i think about this
in complexity generally like looking at

6058
01:42:29,350 --> 01:42:29,360
in complexity generally like looking at
 

6059
01:42:29,360 --> 01:42:31,109
in complexity generally like looking at
a cellular automata system and saying

6060
01:42:31,109 --> 01:42:31,119
a cellular automata system and saying
 

6061
01:42:31,119 --> 01:42:33,750
a cellular automata system and saying
like what's the what can this be used as

6062
01:42:33,750 --> 01:42:33,760
like what's the what can this be used as
 

6063
01:42:33,760 --> 01:42:36,390
like what's the what can this be used as
a measure of complexity for like uh

6064
01:42:36,390 --> 01:42:36,400
a measure of complexity for like uh
 

6065
01:42:36,400 --> 01:42:38,629
a measure of complexity for like uh
arbitrarily complicated system

6066
01:42:38,629 --> 01:42:38,639
arbitrarily complicated system
 

6067
01:42:38,639 --> 01:42:41,910
arbitrarily complicated system
yeah i think it can it can and i think

6068
01:42:41,910 --> 01:42:41,920
yeah i think it can it can and i think
 

6069
01:42:41,920 --> 01:42:43,270
yeah i think it can it can and i think
that the question is then what's the

6070
01:42:43,270 --> 01:42:43,280
that the question is then what's the
 

6071
01:42:43,280 --> 01:42:45,030
that the question is then what's the
benefit because there's plenty of

6072
01:42:45,030 --> 01:42:45,040
benefit because there's plenty of
 

6073
01:42:45,040 --> 01:42:45,830
benefit because there's plenty of
um

6074
01:42:45,830 --> 01:42:45,840
um
 

6075
01:42:45,840 --> 01:42:47,270
um
i mean in computer science and

6076
01:42:47,270 --> 01:42:47,280
i mean in computer science and
 

6077
01:42:47,280 --> 01:42:49,830
i mean in computer science and
mathematics and physics people have been

6078
01:42:49,830 --> 01:42:49,840
mathematics and physics people have been
 

6079
01:42:49,840 --> 01:42:51,510
mathematics and physics people have been
really seriously studying complexity for

6080
01:42:51,510 --> 01:42:51,520
really seriously studying complexity for
 

6081
01:42:51,520 --> 01:42:53,030
really seriously studying complexity for
a long time

6082
01:42:53,030 --> 01:42:53,040
a long time
 

6083
01:42:53,040 --> 01:42:54,149
a long time
and i think there's some really

6084
01:42:54,149 --> 01:42:54,159
and i think there's some really
 

6085
01:42:54,159 --> 01:42:55,750
and i think there's some really
interesting problems of where we course

6086
01:42:55,750 --> 01:42:55,760
interesting problems of where we course
 

6087
01:42:55,760 --> 01:42:56,709
interesting problems of where we course
grain

6088
01:42:56,709 --> 01:42:56,719
grain
 

6089
01:42:56,719 --> 01:42:59,189
grain
and we lose information and all assembly

6090
01:42:59,189 --> 01:42:59,199
and we lose information and all assembly
 

6091
01:42:59,199 --> 01:43:00,950
and we lose information and all assembly
theory does really assembly theory just

6092
01:43:00,950 --> 01:43:00,960
theory does really assembly theory just
 

6093
01:43:00,960 --> 01:43:03,109
theory does really assembly theory just
explains weak emergence

6094
01:43:03,109 --> 01:43:03,119
explains weak emergence
 

6095
01:43:03,119 --> 01:43:05,030
explains weak emergence
and and so what assembly theory says

6096
01:43:05,030 --> 01:43:05,040
and and so what assembly theory says
 

6097
01:43:05,040 --> 01:43:05,910
and and so what assembly theory says
look

6098
01:43:05,910 --> 01:43:05,920
look
 

6099
01:43:05,920 --> 01:43:08,229
look
going from the atoms into atoms that

6100
01:43:08,229 --> 01:43:08,239
going from the atoms into atoms that
 

6101
01:43:08,239 --> 01:43:09,990
going from the atoms into atoms that
interact those first replicators that

6102
01:43:09,990 --> 01:43:10,000
interact those first replicators that
 

6103
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:11,430
interact those first replicators that
build one another

6104
01:43:11,430 --> 01:43:11,440
build one another
 

6105
01:43:11,440 --> 01:43:13,830
build one another
um assembly at the the minimal level

6106
01:43:13,830 --> 01:43:13,840
um assembly at the the minimal level
 

6107
01:43:13,840 --> 01:43:15,030
um assembly at the the minimal level
just tells you evidence that there's

6108
01:43:15,030 --> 01:43:15,040
just tells you evidence that there's
 

6109
01:43:15,040 --> 01:43:17,750
just tells you evidence that there's
been replication and selection

6110
01:43:17,750 --> 01:43:17,760
been replication and selection
 

6111
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:20,070
been replication and selection
and i think the more selected something

6112
01:43:20,070 --> 01:43:20,080
and i think the more selected something
 

6113
01:43:20,080 --> 01:43:22,390
and i think the more selected something
is the higher the assembly

6114
01:43:22,390 --> 01:43:22,400
is the higher the assembly
 

6115
01:43:22,400 --> 01:43:25,430
is the higher the assembly
and so we we're able to start to know

6116
01:43:25,430 --> 01:43:25,440
and so we we're able to start to know
 

6117
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:26,629
and so we we're able to start to know
how to look for selection in the

6118
01:43:26,629 --> 01:43:26,639
how to look for selection in the
 

6119
01:43:26,639 --> 01:43:28,470
how to look for selection in the
universe if you go to the moon there's

6120
01:43:28,470 --> 01:43:28,480
universe if you go to the moon there's
 

6121
01:43:28,480 --> 01:43:29,990
universe if you go to the moon there's
nothing a very high assembly on the moon

6122
01:43:29,990 --> 01:43:30,000
nothing a very high assembly on the moon
 

6123
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:31,830
nothing a very high assembly on the moon
except the human artifacts we've left

6124
01:43:31,830 --> 01:43:31,840
except the human artifacts we've left
 

6125
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:32,950
except the human artifacts we've left
there

6126
01:43:32,950 --> 01:43:32,960
there
 

6127
01:43:32,960 --> 01:43:35,910
there
so again let's go back to the sandbox

6128
01:43:35,910 --> 01:43:35,920
so again let's go back to the sandbox
 

6129
01:43:35,920 --> 01:43:38,709
so again let's go back to the sandbox
in assembly theory says if all the sand

6130
01:43:38,709 --> 01:43:38,719
in assembly theory says if all the sand
 

6131
01:43:38,719 --> 01:43:41,030
in assembly theory says if all the sand
grains could stick together that's the

6132
01:43:41,030 --> 01:43:41,040
grains could stick together that's the
 

6133
01:43:41,040 --> 01:43:42,629
grains could stick together that's the
infinite conventory explosion in the

6134
01:43:42,629 --> 01:43:42,639
infinite conventory explosion in the
 

6135
01:43:42,639 --> 01:43:44,550
infinite conventory explosion in the
universe that should be the default

6136
01:43:44,550 --> 01:43:44,560
universe that should be the default
 

6137
01:43:44,560 --> 01:43:46,390
universe that should be the default
well we don't have that now let's

6138
01:43:46,390 --> 01:43:46,400
well we don't have that now let's
 

6139
01:43:46,400 --> 01:43:48,790
well we don't have that now let's
assemble sand grains together and what

6140
01:43:48,790 --> 01:43:48,800
assemble sand grains together and what
 

6141
01:43:48,800 --> 01:43:50,709
assemble sand grains together and what
that's um and do them in every possible

6142
01:43:50,709 --> 01:43:50,719
that's um and do them in every possible
 

6143
01:43:50,719 --> 01:43:53,830
that's um and do them in every possible
way so we have a series of minimal

6144
01:43:53,830 --> 01:43:53,840
way so we have a series of minimal
 

6145
01:43:53,840 --> 01:43:55,350
way so we have a series of minimal
operations that can move the sound

6146
01:43:55,350 --> 01:43:55,360
operations that can move the sound
 

6147
01:43:55,360 --> 01:43:57,109
operations that can move the sound
together but all that doesn't exist

6148
01:43:57,109 --> 01:43:57,119
together but all that doesn't exist
 

6149
01:43:57,119 --> 01:43:59,189
together but all that doesn't exist
either now because we have specific

6150
01:43:59,189 --> 01:43:59,199
either now because we have specific
 

6151
01:43:59,199 --> 01:44:00,149
either now because we have specific
memory where we say what we're going to

6152
01:44:00,149 --> 01:44:00,159
memory where we say what we're going to
 

6153
01:44:00,159 --> 01:44:02,070
memory where we say what we're going to
put three sand grains in a line or four

6154
01:44:02,070 --> 01:44:02,080
put three sand grains in a line or four
 

6155
01:44:02,080 --> 01:44:04,070
put three sand grains in a line or four
and make a cross or a triangle or

6156
01:44:04,070 --> 01:44:04,080
and make a cross or a triangle or
 

6157
01:44:04,080 --> 01:44:05,750
and make a cross or a triangle or
something unsymmetrical and once we've

6158
01:44:05,750 --> 01:44:05,760
something unsymmetrical and once we've
 

6159
01:44:05,760 --> 01:44:07,189
something unsymmetrical and once we've
made the triangle the unsymmetrical

6160
01:44:07,189 --> 01:44:07,199
made the triangle the unsymmetrical
 

6161
01:44:07,199 --> 01:44:08,790
made the triangle the unsymmetrical
thing we remember that we can use it

6162
01:44:08,790 --> 01:44:08,800
thing we remember that we can use it
 

6163
01:44:08,800 --> 01:44:10,790
thing we remember that we can use it
again because on that causal chain

6164
01:44:10,790 --> 01:44:10,800
again because on that causal chain
 

6165
01:44:10,800 --> 01:44:12,390
again because on that causal chain
so what assembly theory allows you to do

6166
01:44:12,390 --> 01:44:12,400
so what assembly theory allows you to do
 

6167
01:44:12,400 --> 01:44:14,070
so what assembly theory allows you to do
is go to the actual object that you

6168
01:44:14,070 --> 01:44:14,080
is go to the actual object that you
 

6169
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:16,709
is go to the actual object that you
exist you find in space and actually the

6170
01:44:16,709 --> 01:44:16,719
exist you find in space and actually the
 

6171
01:44:16,719 --> 01:44:19,030
exist you find in space and actually the
way you get there is by disassembling it

6172
01:44:19,030 --> 01:44:19,040
way you get there is by disassembling it
 

6173
01:44:19,040 --> 01:44:19,750
way you get there is by disassembling it
so

6174
01:44:19,750 --> 01:44:19,760
so
 

6175
01:44:19,760 --> 01:44:22,070
so
this assembly theory works by

6176
01:44:22,070 --> 01:44:22,080
this assembly theory works by
 

6177
01:44:22,080 --> 01:44:24,550
this assembly theory works by
disassembling objects you have and

6178
01:44:24,550 --> 01:44:24,560
disassembling objects you have and
 

6179
01:44:24,560 --> 01:44:27,350
disassembling objects you have and
understanding the the steps to create

6180
01:44:27,350 --> 01:44:27,360
understanding the the steps to create
 

6181
01:44:27,360 --> 01:44:29,189
understanding the the steps to create
them and it works with map for bot for

6182
01:44:29,189 --> 01:44:29,199
them and it works with map for bot for
 

6183
01:44:29,199 --> 01:44:30,390
them and it works with map for bot for
molecules beautifully because you just

6184
01:44:30,390 --> 01:44:30,400
molecules beautifully because you just
 

6185
01:44:30,400 --> 01:44:31,590
molecules beautifully because you just
break bonds

6186
01:44:31,590 --> 01:44:31,600
break bonds
 

6187
01:44:31,600 --> 01:44:32,950
break bonds
but like you said it's not be hard it's

6188
01:44:32,950 --> 01:44:32,960
but like you said it's not be hard it's
 

6189
01:44:32,960 --> 01:44:34,149
but like you said it's not be hard it's
very difficult

6190
01:44:34,149 --> 01:44:34,159
very difficult
 

6191
01:44:34,159 --> 01:44:35,430
very difficult
it's a difficult problem to figure out

6192
01:44:35,430 --> 01:44:35,440
it's a difficult problem to figure out
 

6193
01:44:35,440 --> 01:44:37,030
it's a difficult problem to figure out
how to break them apart for molecules

6194
01:44:37,030 --> 01:44:37,040
how to break them apart for molecules
 

6195
01:44:37,040 --> 01:44:38,950
how to break them apart for molecules
it's easy if you just keep low enough in

6196
01:44:38,950 --> 01:44:38,960
it's easy if you just keep low enough in
 

6197
01:44:38,960 --> 01:44:40,629
it's easy if you just keep low enough in
molecular weight space

6198
01:44:40,629 --> 01:44:40,639
molecular weight space
 

6199
01:44:40,639 --> 01:44:42,709
molecular weight space
it's good enough so it's a complete

6200
01:44:42,709 --> 01:44:42,719
it's good enough so it's a complete
 

6201
01:44:42,719 --> 01:44:43,750
it's good enough so it's a complete
theory

6202
01:44:43,750 --> 01:44:43,760
theory
 

6203
01:44:43,760 --> 01:44:45,350
theory
when we start to think about objects we

6204
01:44:45,350 --> 01:44:45,360
when we start to think about objects we
 

6205
01:44:45,360 --> 01:44:47,430
when we start to think about objects we
can start to assign we can start to

6206
01:44:47,430 --> 01:44:47,440
can start to assign we can start to
 

6207
01:44:47,440 --> 01:44:48,950
can start to assign we can start to
think about things at different levels

6208
01:44:48,950 --> 01:44:48,960
think about things at different levels
 

6209
01:44:48,960 --> 01:44:50,310
think about things at different levels
different atoms what do you assign as

6210
01:44:50,310 --> 01:44:50,320
different atoms what do you assign as
 

6211
01:44:50,320 --> 01:44:51,430
different atoms what do you assign as
your atom

6212
01:44:51,430 --> 01:44:51,440
your atom
 

6213
01:44:51,440 --> 01:44:53,990
your atom
so in a molecule the atom this is really

6214
01:44:53,990 --> 01:44:54,000
so in a molecule the atom this is really
 

6215
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:55,669
so in a molecule the atom this is really
confusing because the word atom i mean

6216
01:44:55,669 --> 01:44:55,679
confusing because the word atom i mean
 

6217
01:44:55,679 --> 01:44:57,910
confusing because the word atom i mean
smallest breakable part so in a molecule

6218
01:44:57,910 --> 01:44:57,920
smallest breakable part so in a molecule
 

6219
01:44:57,920 --> 01:44:59,990
smallest breakable part so in a molecule
the atom is the bond because you break

6220
01:44:59,990 --> 01:45:00,000
the atom is the bond because you break
 

6221
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,390
the atom is the bond because you break
bonds not atoms right right

6222
01:45:02,390 --> 01:45:02,400
bonds not atoms right right
 

6223
01:45:02,400 --> 01:45:05,510
bonds not atoms right right
so in a car the atom might be i don't

6224
01:45:05,510 --> 01:45:05,520
so in a car the atom might be i don't
 

6225
01:45:05,520 --> 01:45:07,669
so in a car the atom might be i don't
know a small amount of iron or the

6226
01:45:07,669 --> 01:45:07,679
know a small amount of iron or the
 

6227
01:45:07,679 --> 01:45:10,709
know a small amount of iron or the
smallest you know reusable part a rivet

6228
01:45:10,709 --> 01:45:10,719
smallest you know reusable part a rivet
 

6229
01:45:10,719 --> 01:45:13,590
smallest you know reusable part a rivet
uh a piece of plastic or something so

6230
01:45:13,590 --> 01:45:13,600
uh a piece of plastic or something so
 

6231
01:45:13,600 --> 01:45:14,950
uh a piece of plastic or something so
you've got to be really careful in a

6232
01:45:14,950 --> 01:45:14,960
you've got to be really careful in a
 

6233
01:45:14,960 --> 01:45:17,030
you've got to be really careful in a
microprocessor the atoms might be

6234
01:45:17,030 --> 01:45:17,040
microprocessor the atoms might be
 

6235
01:45:17,040 --> 01:45:18,390
microprocessor the atoms might be
transistors

6236
01:45:18,390 --> 01:45:18,400
transistors
 

6237
01:45:18,400 --> 01:45:20,149
transistors
and so

6238
01:45:20,149 --> 01:45:20,159
and so
 

6239
01:45:20,159 --> 01:45:22,550
and so
how are some the amount of assembly that

6240
01:45:22,550 --> 01:45:22,560
how are some the amount of assembly that
 

6241
01:45:22,560 --> 01:45:24,950
how are some the amount of assembly that
something as is a function you have to

6242
01:45:24,950 --> 01:45:24,960
something as is a function you have to
 

6243
01:45:24,960 --> 01:45:27,189
something as is a function you have to
look at the the atom level what are you

6244
01:45:27,189 --> 01:45:27,199
look at the the atom level what are you
 

6245
01:45:27,199 --> 01:45:28,390
look at the the atom level what are you
where are your parts what are you

6246
01:45:28,390 --> 01:45:28,400
where are your parts what are you
 

6247
01:45:28,400 --> 01:45:29,510
where are your parts what are you
counting that's one of the things you

6248
01:45:29,510 --> 01:45:29,520
counting that's one of the things you
 

6249
01:45:29,520 --> 01:45:30,790
counting that's one of the things you
get to choose

6250
01:45:30,790 --> 01:45:30,800
get to choose
 

6251
01:45:30,800 --> 01:45:32,790
get to choose
what is uh what scale is they add what

6252
01:45:32,790 --> 01:45:32,800
what is uh what scale is they add what
 

6253
01:45:32,800 --> 01:45:34,870
what is uh what scale is they add what
is the minimum exact thing i mean

6254
01:45:34,870 --> 01:45:34,880
is the minimum exact thing i mean
 

6255
01:45:34,880 --> 01:45:37,590
is the minimum exact thing i mean
there's a huge amount of trade-offs in

6256
01:45:37,590 --> 01:45:37,600
there's a huge amount of trade-offs in
 

6257
01:45:37,600 --> 01:45:39,109
there's a huge amount of trade-offs in
when you approach a system and try to

6258
01:45:39,109 --> 01:45:39,119
when you approach a system and try to
 

6259
01:45:39,119 --> 01:45:41,189
when you approach a system and try to
analyze like if you approach earth

6260
01:45:41,189 --> 01:45:41,199
analyze like if you approach earth
 

6261
01:45:41,199 --> 01:45:42,629
analyze like if you approach earth
you're an alien civilization try to

6262
01:45:42,629 --> 01:45:42,639
you're an alien civilization try to
 

6263
01:45:42,639 --> 01:45:45,270
you're an alien civilization try to
study earth what is the atom for trying

6264
01:45:45,270 --> 01:45:45,280
study earth what is the atom for trying
 

6265
01:45:45,280 --> 01:45:48,310
study earth what is the atom for trying
to measure the complexity of of life

6266
01:45:48,310 --> 01:45:48,320
to measure the complexity of of life
 

6267
01:45:48,320 --> 01:45:50,629
to measure the complexity of of life
is it uh are humans the atoms i would

6268
01:45:50,629 --> 01:45:50,639
is it uh are humans the atoms i would
 

6269
01:45:50,639 --> 01:45:53,350
is it uh are humans the atoms i would
say to start with you just use molecules

6270
01:45:53,350 --> 01:45:53,360
say to start with you just use molecules
 

6271
01:45:53,360 --> 01:45:55,430
say to start with you just use molecules
i can say for sure if there are

6272
01:45:55,430 --> 01:45:55,440
i can say for sure if there are
 

6273
01:45:55,440 --> 01:45:57,189
i can say for sure if there are
molecules of sufficient complexity on

6274
01:45:57,189 --> 01:45:57,199
molecules of sufficient complexity on
 

6275
01:45:57,199 --> 01:45:59,270
molecules of sufficient complexity on
earth then i know that life has made

6276
01:45:59,270 --> 01:45:59,280
earth then i know that life has made
 

6277
01:45:59,280 --> 01:46:00,790
earth then i know that life has made
them and then go further and show

6278
01:46:00,790 --> 01:46:00,800
them and then go further and show
 

6279
01:46:00,800 --> 01:46:02,149
them and then go further and show
technology there are molecules that

6280
01:46:02,149 --> 01:46:02,159
technology there are molecules that
 

6281
01:46:02,159 --> 01:46:03,270
technology there are molecules that
exist

6282
01:46:03,270 --> 01:46:03,280
exist
 

6283
01:46:03,280 --> 01:46:05,189
exist
on earth that are not possible even by

6284
01:46:05,189 --> 01:46:05,199
on earth that are not possible even by
 

6285
01:46:05,199 --> 01:46:07,270
on earth that are not possible even by
biology you needed technology and you

6286
01:46:07,270 --> 01:46:07,280
biology you needed technology and you
 

6287
01:46:07,280 --> 01:46:09,669
biology you needed technology and you
needed microprocessors to get there

6288
01:46:09,669 --> 01:46:09,679
needed microprocessors to get there
 

6289
01:46:09,679 --> 01:46:11,990
needed microprocessors to get there
so that's really cool and that there's a

6290
01:46:11,990 --> 01:46:12,000
so that's really cool and that there's a
 

6291
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:13,750
so that's really cool and that there's a
correlation between

6292
01:46:13,750 --> 01:46:13,760
correlation between
 

6293
01:46:13,760 --> 01:46:16,709
correlation between
that uh between the the coolness of that

6294
01:46:16,709 --> 01:46:16,719
that uh between the the coolness of that
 

6295
01:46:16,719 --> 01:46:19,030
that uh between the the coolness of that
and uh assembly number whatever the

6296
01:46:19,030 --> 01:46:19,040
and uh assembly number whatever the
 

6297
01:46:19,040 --> 01:46:20,629
and uh assembly number whatever the
measure what's the what would you call

6298
01:46:20,629 --> 01:46:20,639
measure what's the what would you call
 

6299
01:46:20,639 --> 01:46:23,590
measure what's the what would you call
the measure assembly index yeah so yes

6300
01:46:23,590 --> 01:46:23,600
the measure assembly index yeah so yes
 

6301
01:46:23,600 --> 01:46:25,750
the measure assembly index yeah so yes
there are three kind of fundamental kind

6302
01:46:25,750 --> 01:46:25,760
there are three kind of fundamental kind
 

6303
01:46:25,760 --> 01:46:27,189
there are three kind of fundamental kind
of labels we haven't so there's the

6304
01:46:27,189 --> 01:46:27,199
of labels we haven't so there's the
 

6305
01:46:27,199 --> 01:46:30,229
of labels we haven't so there's the
quantity of assembly and the assembly

6306
01:46:30,229 --> 01:46:30,239
quantity of assembly and the assembly
 

6307
01:46:30,239 --> 01:46:31,510
quantity of assembly and the assembly
so if you have a box let's just have a

6308
01:46:31,510 --> 01:46:31,520
so if you have a box let's just have a
 

6309
01:46:31,520 --> 01:46:33,030
so if you have a box let's just have a
box of molecules so i'm gonna have my

6310
01:46:33,030 --> 01:46:33,040
box of molecules so i'm gonna have my
 

6311
01:46:33,040 --> 01:46:34,070
box of molecules so i'm gonna have my
box

6312
01:46:34,070 --> 01:46:34,080
box
 

6313
01:46:34,080 --> 01:46:35,669
box
we count the number of identical

6314
01:46:35,669 --> 01:46:35,679
we count the number of identical
 

6315
01:46:35,679 --> 01:46:37,750
we count the number of identical
molecules and then we chop each molecule

6316
01:46:37,750 --> 01:46:37,760
molecules and then we chop each molecule
 

6317
01:46:37,760 --> 01:46:40,550
molecules and then we chop each molecule
up in a individual molecule class and

6318
01:46:40,550 --> 01:46:40,560
up in a individual molecule class and
 

6319
01:46:40,560 --> 01:46:42,790
up in a individual molecule class and
calculate the assembly number so

6320
01:46:42,790 --> 01:46:42,800
calculate the assembly number so
 

6321
01:46:42,800 --> 01:46:45,590
calculate the assembly number so
basically that you then have a function

6322
01:46:45,590 --> 01:46:45,600
basically that you then have a function
 

6323
01:46:45,600 --> 01:46:47,109
basically that you then have a function
that sums over

6324
01:46:47,109 --> 01:46:47,119
that sums over
 

6325
01:46:47,119 --> 01:46:49,430
that sums over
all the molecules for each assembly and

6326
01:46:49,430 --> 01:46:49,440
all the molecules for each assembly and
 

6327
01:46:49,440 --> 01:46:51,270
all the molecules for each assembly and
then you divide through so you make it

6328
01:46:51,270 --> 01:46:51,280
then you divide through so you make it
 

6329
01:46:51,280 --> 01:46:54,070
then you divide through so you make it
uh divided by the number of of molecules

6330
01:46:54,070 --> 01:46:54,080
uh divided by the number of of molecules
 

6331
01:46:54,080 --> 01:46:56,070
uh divided by the number of of molecules
so that's the assembly index for the box

6332
01:46:56,070 --> 01:46:56,080
so that's the assembly index for the box
 

6333
01:46:56,080 --> 01:46:57,590
so that's the assembly index for the box
so that will tell you some amount of

6334
01:46:57,590 --> 01:46:57,600
so that will tell you some amount of
 

6335
01:46:57,600 --> 01:46:59,669
so that will tell you some amount of
assembly in the box so basically the

6336
01:46:59,669 --> 01:46:59,679
assembly in the box so basically the
 

6337
01:46:59,679 --> 01:47:01,030
assembly in the box so basically the
assembly equation we come up with is

6338
01:47:01,030 --> 01:47:01,040
assembly equation we come up with is
 

6339
01:47:01,040 --> 01:47:03,350
assembly equation we come up with is
like basically the sum

6340
01:47:03,350 --> 01:47:03,360
like basically the sum
 

6341
01:47:03,360 --> 01:47:06,070
like basically the sum
of e to the power of the assembly index

6342
01:47:06,070 --> 01:47:06,080
of e to the power of the assembly index
 

6343
01:47:06,080 --> 01:47:08,390
of e to the power of the assembly index
for molecule i times the number of

6344
01:47:08,390 --> 01:47:08,400
for molecule i times the number of
 

6345
01:47:08,400 --> 01:47:10,390
for molecule i times the number of
copies of the molecule i

6346
01:47:10,390 --> 01:47:10,400
copies of the molecule i
 

6347
01:47:10,400 --> 01:47:11,830
copies of the molecule i
and then you normalize so you sum them

6348
01:47:11,830 --> 01:47:11,840
and then you normalize so you sum them
 

6349
01:47:11,840 --> 01:47:14,149
and then you normalize so you sum them
all up and then normalize so some boxes

6350
01:47:14,149 --> 01:47:14,159
all up and then normalize so some boxes
 

6351
01:47:14,159 --> 01:47:15,350
all up and then normalize so some boxes
are going to be more assembled than

6352
01:47:15,350 --> 01:47:15,360
are going to be more assembled than
 

6353
01:47:15,360 --> 01:47:16,310
are going to be more assembled than
others

6354
01:47:16,310 --> 01:47:16,320
others
 

6355
01:47:16,320 --> 01:47:18,070
others
yeah that's what they tell me so if you

6356
01:47:18,070 --> 01:47:18,080
yeah that's what they tell me so if you
 

6357
01:47:18,080 --> 01:47:20,390
yeah that's what they tell me so if you
were to look at me as a box the same a

6358
01:47:20,390 --> 01:47:20,400
were to look at me as a box the same a
 

6359
01:47:20,400 --> 01:47:21,590
were to look at me as a box the same a
box

6360
01:47:21,590 --> 01:47:21,600
box
 

6361
01:47:21,600 --> 01:47:24,310
box
uh am i some of my parts in terms of

6362
01:47:24,310 --> 01:47:24,320
uh am i some of my parts in terms of
 

6363
01:47:24,320 --> 01:47:25,990
uh am i some of my parts in terms of
like how do you know what what's my

6364
01:47:25,990 --> 01:47:26,000
like how do you know what what's my
 

6365
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,709
like how do you know what what's my
assembly index so i'm going to be gentle

6366
01:47:28,709 --> 01:47:28,719
assembly index so i'm going to be gentle
 

6367
01:47:28,719 --> 01:47:30,149
assembly index so i'm going to be gentle
so let's just we'll talk about the

6368
01:47:30,149 --> 01:47:30,159
so let's just we'll talk about the
 

6369
01:47:30,159 --> 01:47:31,830
so let's just we'll talk about the
molecules and use so let's just take a

6370
01:47:31,830 --> 01:47:31,840
molecules and use so let's just take a
 

6371
01:47:31,840 --> 01:47:34,390
molecules and use so let's just take a
pile of sand the same way as you mm-hmm

6372
01:47:34,390 --> 01:47:34,400
pile of sand the same way as you mm-hmm
 

6373
01:47:34,400 --> 01:47:35,590
pile of sand the same way as you mm-hmm
and

6374
01:47:35,590 --> 01:47:35,600
and
 

6375
01:47:35,600 --> 01:47:36,790
and
and i would

6376
01:47:36,790 --> 01:47:36,800
and i would
 

6377
01:47:36,800 --> 01:47:38,790
and i would
um take you and just cut up all the

6378
01:47:38,790 --> 01:47:38,800
um take you and just cut up all the
 

6379
01:47:38,800 --> 01:47:39,990
um take you and just cut up all the
molecules

6380
01:47:39,990 --> 01:47:40,000
molecules
 

6381
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,070
molecules
i mean and and look at the number of

6382
01:47:42,070 --> 01:47:42,080
i mean and and look at the number of
 

6383
01:47:42,080 --> 01:47:44,470
i mean and and look at the number of
copies an assembly number so in sand

6384
01:47:44,470 --> 01:47:44,480
copies an assembly number so in sand
 

6385
01:47:44,480 --> 01:47:45,910
copies an assembly number so in sand
let's say there's probably going to be

6386
01:47:45,910 --> 01:47:45,920
let's say there's probably going to be
 

6387
01:47:45,920 --> 01:47:47,270
let's say there's probably going to be
nothing more than a semi number of two

6388
01:47:47,270 --> 01:47:47,280
nothing more than a semi number of two
 

6389
01:47:47,280 --> 01:47:48,310
nothing more than a semi number of two
or three

6390
01:47:48,310 --> 01:47:48,320
or three
 

6391
01:47:48,320 --> 01:47:50,149
or three
but there might be trillions and

6392
01:47:50,149 --> 01:47:50,159
but there might be trillions and
 

6393
01:47:50,159 --> 01:47:52,550
but there might be trillions and
trillions of sand grains and your body

6394
01:47:52,550 --> 01:47:52,560
trillions of sand grains and your body
 

6395
01:47:52,560 --> 01:47:54,629
trillions of sand grains and your body
there might be the assembly numbers

6396
01:47:54,629 --> 01:47:54,639
there might be the assembly numbers
 

6397
01:47:54,639 --> 01:47:56,629
there might be the assembly numbers
going to be higher but there might not

6398
01:47:56,629 --> 01:47:56,639
going to be higher but there might not
 

6399
01:47:56,639 --> 01:47:59,270
going to be higher but there might not
be quite as many copies because the the

6400
01:47:59,270 --> 01:47:59,280
be quite as many copies because the the
 

6401
01:47:59,280 --> 01:48:01,030
be quite as many copies because the the
molecular weight is higher

6402
01:48:01,030 --> 01:48:01,040
molecular weight is higher
 

6403
01:48:01,040 --> 01:48:03,030
molecular weight is higher
so you do want to average it out you

6404
01:48:03,030 --> 01:48:03,040
so you do want to average it out you
 

6405
01:48:03,040 --> 01:48:05,030
so you do want to average it out you
kind of you can do averages i'm not i'm

6406
01:48:05,030 --> 01:48:05,040
kind of you can do averages i'm not i'm
 

6407
01:48:05,040 --> 01:48:07,030
kind of you can do averages i'm not i'm
not defined by the most impressive model

6408
01:48:07,030 --> 01:48:07,040
not defined by the most impressive model
 

6409
01:48:07,040 --> 01:48:08,550
not defined by the most impressive model
no no you're an average in your volley

6410
01:48:08,550 --> 01:48:08,560
no no you're an average in your volley
 

6411
01:48:08,560 --> 01:48:10,310
no no you're an average in your volley
what i mean we're just working this out

6412
01:48:10,310 --> 01:48:10,320
what i mean we're just working this out
 

6413
01:48:10,320 --> 01:48:11,990
what i mean we're just working this out
but what's really cool

6414
01:48:11,990 --> 01:48:12,000
but what's really cool
 

6415
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:13,750
but what's really cool
is they're you're going to have a really

6416
01:48:13,750 --> 01:48:13,760
is they're you're going to have a really
 

6417
01:48:13,760 --> 01:48:15,910
is they're you're going to have a really
high assembly the sand will have a very

6418
01:48:15,910 --> 01:48:15,920
high assembly the sand will have a very
 

6419
01:48:15,920 --> 01:48:18,470
high assembly the sand will have a very
low assembly your causal power

6420
01:48:18,470 --> 01:48:18,480
low assembly your causal power
 

6421
01:48:18,480 --> 01:48:20,709
low assembly your causal power
is much higher you get to make decisions

6422
01:48:20,709 --> 01:48:20,719
is much higher you get to make decisions
 

6423
01:48:20,719 --> 01:48:23,350
is much higher you get to make decisions
you're alive you're aspiring assembly

6424
01:48:23,350 --> 01:48:23,360
you're alive you're aspiring assembly
 

6425
01:48:23,360 --> 01:48:25,430
you're alive you're aspiring assembly
says something about causal power in the

6426
01:48:25,430 --> 01:48:25,440
says something about causal power in the
 

6427
01:48:25,440 --> 01:48:27,669
says something about causal power in the
universe and that's not supposed to

6428
01:48:27,669 --> 01:48:27,679
universe and that's not supposed to
 

6429
01:48:27,679 --> 01:48:28,709
universe and that's not supposed to
exist

6430
01:48:28,709 --> 01:48:28,719
exist
 

6431
01:48:28,719 --> 01:48:30,790
exist
because physicists don't accept that

6432
01:48:30,790 --> 01:48:30,800
because physicists don't accept that
 

6433
01:48:30,800 --> 01:48:33,350
because physicists don't accept that
causation exists at the bottom so i

6434
01:48:33,350 --> 01:48:33,360
causation exists at the bottom so i
 

6435
01:48:33,360 --> 01:48:35,109
causation exists at the bottom so i
understand at the chemical level why the

6436
01:48:35,109 --> 01:48:35,119
understand at the chemical level why the
 

6437
01:48:35,119 --> 01:48:36,709
understand at the chemical level why the
assemblies cause

6438
01:48:36,709 --> 01:48:36,719
assemblies cause
 

6439
01:48:36,719 --> 01:48:38,629
assemblies cause
causation why is it causation because

6440
01:48:38,629 --> 01:48:38,639
causation why is it causation because
 

6441
01:48:38,639 --> 01:48:40,790
causation why is it causation because
it's capturing the memory

6442
01:48:40,790 --> 01:48:40,800
it's capturing the memory
 

6443
01:48:40,800 --> 01:48:43,510
it's capturing the memory
exactly capturing memory but there's not

6444
01:48:43,510 --> 01:48:43,520
exactly capturing memory but there's not
 

6445
01:48:43,520 --> 01:48:45,590
exactly capturing memory but there's not
an action to it

6446
01:48:45,590 --> 01:48:45,600
an action to it
 

6447
01:48:45,600 --> 01:48:46,950
an action to it
so um

6448
01:48:46,950 --> 01:48:46,960
so um
 

6449
01:48:46,960 --> 01:48:48,629
so um
i'm trying to see

6450
01:48:48,629 --> 01:48:48,639
i'm trying to see
 

6451
01:48:48,639 --> 01:48:50,310
i'm trying to see
how it leads to

6452
01:48:50,310 --> 01:48:50,320
how it leads to
 

6453
01:48:50,320 --> 01:48:52,870
how it leads to
life well it's what life does

6454
01:48:52,870 --> 01:48:52,880
life well it's what life does
 

6455
01:48:52,880 --> 01:48:55,510
life well it's what life does
so i think it's we we don't know

6456
01:48:55,510 --> 01:48:55,520
so i think it's we we don't know
 

6457
01:48:55,520 --> 01:48:57,669
so i think it's we we don't know
so yeah that's a good question what is

6458
01:48:57,669 --> 01:48:57,679
so yeah that's a good question what is
 

6459
01:48:57,679 --> 01:49:00,470
so yeah that's a good question what is
life versus what does life do yeah so

6460
01:49:00,470 --> 01:49:00,480
life versus what does life do yeah so
 

6461
01:49:00,480 --> 01:49:02,310
life versus what does life do yeah so
that's this is the definition of life

6462
01:49:02,310 --> 01:49:02,320
that's this is the definition of life
 

6463
01:49:02,320 --> 01:49:04,470
that's this is the definition of life
the only definition we need right the

6464
01:49:04,470 --> 01:49:04,480
the only definition we need right the
 

6465
01:49:04,480 --> 01:49:07,030
the only definition we need right the
assembly is that life

6466
01:49:07,030 --> 01:49:07,040
assembly is that life
 

6467
01:49:07,040 --> 01:49:11,189
assembly is that life
is able to create objects in abundance

6468
01:49:11,189 --> 01:49:11,199
is able to create objects in abundance
 

6469
01:49:11,199 --> 01:49:12,870
is able to create objects in abundance
that are that are

6470
01:49:12,870 --> 01:49:12,880
that are that are
 

6471
01:49:12,880 --> 01:49:15,589
that are that are
so complex this semi number is so high

6472
01:49:15,589 --> 01:49:15,599
so complex this semi number is so high
 

6473
01:49:15,599 --> 01:49:18,070
so complex this semi number is so high
they can't possibly form by in around in

6474
01:49:18,070 --> 01:49:18,080
they can't possibly form by in around in
 

6475
01:49:18,080 --> 01:49:19,270
they can't possibly form by in around in
an environment where there's just random

6476
01:49:19,270 --> 01:49:19,280
an environment where there's just random
 

6477
01:49:19,280 --> 01:49:22,229
an environment where there's just random
interactions yeah so the so suddenly you

6478
01:49:22,229 --> 01:49:22,239
interactions yeah so the so suddenly you
 

6479
01:49:22,239 --> 01:49:25,270
interactions yeah so the so suddenly you
can put life on a scale um and then life

6480
01:49:25,270 --> 01:49:25,280
can put life on a scale um and then life
 

6481
01:49:25,280 --> 01:49:27,109
can put life on a scale um and then life
doesn't exist actually

6482
01:49:27,109 --> 01:49:27,119
doesn't exist actually
 

6483
01:49:27,119 --> 01:49:29,350
doesn't exist actually
in that can it's just how evolved you

6484
01:49:29,350 --> 01:49:29,360
in that can it's just how evolved you
 

6485
01:49:29,360 --> 01:49:30,229
in that can it's just how evolved you
are

6486
01:49:30,229 --> 01:49:30,239
are
 

6487
01:49:30,239 --> 01:49:31,510
are
and

6488
01:49:31,510 --> 01:49:31,520
and
 

6489
01:49:31,520 --> 01:49:33,669
and
you as an object because you have

6490
01:49:33,669 --> 01:49:33,679
you as an object because you have
 

6491
01:49:33,679 --> 01:49:36,709
you as an object because you have
incredible causal power you could go and

6492
01:49:36,709 --> 01:49:36,719
incredible causal power you could go and
 

6493
01:49:36,719 --> 01:49:38,470
incredible causal power you could go and
you can go and you know

6494
01:49:38,470 --> 01:49:38,480
you can go and you know
 

6495
01:49:38,480 --> 01:49:39,589
you can go and you know
um

6496
01:49:39,589 --> 01:49:39,599
um
 

6497
01:49:39,599 --> 01:49:42,629
um
launch rockets or build cars or

6498
01:49:42,629 --> 01:49:42,639
launch rockets or build cars or
 

6499
01:49:42,639 --> 01:49:45,510
launch rockets or build cars or
create drugs or you know it's you can do

6500
01:49:45,510 --> 01:49:45,520
create drugs or you know it's you can do
 

6501
01:49:45,520 --> 01:49:47,589
create drugs or you know it's you can do
so many things you can build stuff build

6502
01:49:47,589 --> 01:49:47,599
so many things you can build stuff build
 

6503
01:49:47,599 --> 01:49:50,629
so many things you can build stuff build
more artifacts that show that you have

6504
01:49:50,629 --> 01:49:50,639
more artifacts that show that you have
 

6505
01:49:50,639 --> 01:49:53,189
more artifacts that show that you have
had causal power and that causal power

6506
01:49:53,189 --> 01:49:53,199
had causal power and that causal power
 

6507
01:49:53,199 --> 01:49:55,510
had causal power and that causal power
was there's kind of a lineage and i

6508
01:49:55,510 --> 01:49:55,520
was there's kind of a lineage and i
 

6509
01:49:55,520 --> 01:49:57,669
was there's kind of a lineage and i
think that over time

6510
01:49:57,669 --> 01:49:57,679
think that over time
 

6511
01:49:57,679 --> 01:50:00,790
think that over time
i've been realizing that the physics

6512
01:50:00,790 --> 01:50:00,800
i've been realizing that the physics
 

6513
01:50:00,800 --> 01:50:02,470
i've been realizing that the physics
as a discipline

6514
01:50:02,470 --> 01:50:02,480
as a discipline
 

6515
01:50:02,480 --> 01:50:04,790
as a discipline
has a number of problems associated with

6516
01:50:04,790 --> 01:50:04,800
has a number of problems associated with
 

6517
01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:07,109
has a number of problems associated with
me as a chemist is kind of interesting

6518
01:50:07,109 --> 01:50:07,119
me as a chemist is kind of interesting
 

6519
01:50:07,119 --> 01:50:09,350
me as a chemist is kind of interesting
that assembly theory and i'm really

6520
01:50:09,350 --> 01:50:09,360
that assembly theory and i'm really
 

6521
01:50:09,360 --> 01:50:11,990
that assembly theory and i'm really
you know i want to maintain some some

6522
01:50:11,990 --> 01:50:12,000
you know i want to maintain some some
 

6523
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:13,510
you know i want to maintain some some
credibility in the physicist size but i

6524
01:50:13,510 --> 01:50:13,520
credibility in the physicist size but i
 

6525
01:50:13,520 --> 01:50:15,189
credibility in the physicist size but i
have to push them because they're

6526
01:50:15,189 --> 01:50:15,199
have to push them because they're
 

6527
01:50:15,199 --> 01:50:16,550
have to push them because they're
physics

6528
01:50:16,550 --> 01:50:16,560
physics
 

6529
01:50:16,560 --> 01:50:18,790
physics
is a really good discipline it's it's

6530
01:50:18,790 --> 01:50:18,800
is a really good discipline it's it's
 

6531
01:50:18,800 --> 01:50:20,629
is a really good discipline it's it's
reduced the number physics is about

6532
01:50:20,629 --> 01:50:20,639
reduced the number physics is about
 

6533
01:50:20,639 --> 01:50:22,390
reduced the number physics is about
reducing the belief system but they're

6534
01:50:22,390 --> 01:50:22,400
reducing the belief system but they're
 

6535
01:50:22,400 --> 01:50:23,830
reducing the belief system but they're
down to some things in their belief

6536
01:50:23,830 --> 01:50:23,840
down to some things in their belief
 

6537
01:50:23,840 --> 01:50:25,990
down to some things in their belief
system yeah which is kind of really

6538
01:50:25,990 --> 01:50:26,000
system yeah which is kind of really
 

6539
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,390
system yeah which is kind of really
makes me kind of grumpy number one is

6540
01:50:28,390 --> 01:50:28,400
makes me kind of grumpy number one is
 

6541
01:50:28,400 --> 01:50:29,990
makes me kind of grumpy number one is
requiring order at the beginning

6542
01:50:29,990 --> 01:50:30,000
requiring order at the beginning
 

6543
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,070
requiring order at the beginning
universe magically we don't need that

6544
01:50:32,070 --> 01:50:32,080
universe magically we don't need that
 

6545
01:50:32,080 --> 01:50:34,870
universe magically we don't need that
the second is the second law well we

6546
01:50:34,870 --> 01:50:34,880
the second is the second law well we
 

6547
01:50:34,880 --> 01:50:36,550
the second is the second law well we
don't actually need that

6548
01:50:36,550 --> 01:50:36,560
don't actually need that
 

6549
01:50:36,560 --> 01:50:39,430
don't actually need that
and i this is blasphemous

6550
01:50:39,430 --> 01:50:39,440
and i this is blasphemous
 

6551
01:50:39,440 --> 01:50:41,350
and i this is blasphemous
in a minute i i'll recover my career in

6552
01:50:41,350 --> 01:50:41,360
in a minute i i'll recover my career in
 

6553
01:50:41,360 --> 01:50:43,350
in a minute i i'll recover my career in
a second although i think the good the

6554
01:50:43,350 --> 01:50:43,360
a second although i think the good the
 

6555
01:50:43,360 --> 01:50:44,629
a second although i think the good the
only good thing about being the regis

6556
01:50:44,629 --> 01:50:44,639
only good thing about being the regis
 

6557
01:50:44,639 --> 01:50:46,070
only good thing about being the regis
chair means i think there has to be an

6558
01:50:46,070 --> 01:50:46,080
chair means i think there has to be an
 

6559
01:50:46,080 --> 01:50:48,170
chair means i think there has to be an
act of parliament to fire me

6560
01:50:48,170 --> 01:50:48,180
act of parliament to fire me
 

6561
01:50:48,180 --> 01:50:52,310
act of parliament to fire me
[Laughter]

6562
01:50:52,310 --> 01:50:52,320
[Laughter]
 

6563
01:50:52,320 --> 01:50:54,470
[Laughter]
so you know you can always go to lee's

6564
01:50:54,470 --> 01:50:54,480
so you know you can always go to lee's
 

6565
01:50:54,480 --> 01:50:56,550
so you know you can always go to lee's
twitter and protest

6566
01:50:56,550 --> 01:50:56,560
twitter and protest
 

6567
01:50:56,560 --> 01:50:58,629
twitter and protest
and i think the third thing is that so

6568
01:50:58,629 --> 01:50:58,639
and i think the third thing is that so
 

6569
01:50:58,639 --> 01:51:00,470
and i think the third thing is that so
we've got you know we've got the um the

6570
01:51:00,470 --> 01:51:00,480
we've got you know we've got the um the
 

6571
01:51:00,480 --> 01:51:02,709
we've got you know we've got the um the
order at the beginning yeah um second

6572
01:51:02,709 --> 01:51:02,719
order at the beginning yeah um second
 

6573
01:51:02,719 --> 01:51:04,310
order at the beginning yeah um second
law yeah the second law and the fact

6574
01:51:04,310 --> 01:51:04,320
law yeah the second law and the fact
 

6575
01:51:04,320 --> 01:51:06,629
law yeah the second law and the fact
that causation is emergent

6576
01:51:06,629 --> 01:51:06,639
that causation is emergent
 

6577
01:51:06,639 --> 01:51:09,189
that causation is emergent
right and that time is immersion

6578
01:51:09,189 --> 01:51:09,199
right and that time is immersion
 

6579
01:51:09,199 --> 01:51:12,070
right and that time is immersion
carol just turned off this program

6580
01:51:12,070 --> 01:51:12,080
carol just turned off this program
 

6581
01:51:12,080 --> 01:51:13,669
carol just turned off this program
i think he believes that it's immersion

6582
01:51:13,669 --> 01:51:13,679
i think he believes that it's immersion
 

6583
01:51:13,679 --> 01:51:16,070
i think he believes that it's immersion
so causation is not that's clearly

6584
01:51:16,070 --> 01:51:16,080
so causation is not that's clearly
 

6585
01:51:16,080 --> 01:51:17,750
so causation is not that's clearly
incorrect

6586
01:51:17,750 --> 01:51:17,760
incorrect
 

6587
01:51:17,760 --> 01:51:19,669
incorrect
because we wouldn't exist otherwise so

6588
01:51:19,669 --> 01:51:19,679
because we wouldn't exist otherwise so
 

6589
01:51:19,679 --> 01:51:21,589
because we wouldn't exist otherwise so
tight so physicists have kind of got

6590
01:51:21,589 --> 01:51:21,599
tight so physicists have kind of got
 

6591
01:51:21,599 --> 01:51:23,350
tight so physicists have kind of got
confused about time

6592
01:51:23,350 --> 01:51:23,360
confused about time
 

6593
01:51:23,360 --> 01:51:29,270
confused about time
time is a real thing well i mean so look

6594
01:51:29,270 --> 01:51:29,280

 

6595
01:51:29,280 --> 01:51:30,550

i'm very happy with the current

6596
01:51:30,550 --> 01:51:30,560
i'm very happy with the current
 

6597
01:51:30,560 --> 01:51:32,149
i'm very happy with the current
description of the universe as physics

6598
01:51:32,149 --> 01:51:32,159
description of the universe as physics
 

6599
01:51:32,159 --> 01:51:33,669
description of the universe as physics
give me because i do a lot of stuff

6600
01:51:33,669 --> 01:51:33,679
give me because i do a lot of stuff
 

6601
01:51:33,679 --> 01:51:34,629
give me because i do a lot of stuff
right i can go to the moon with

6602
01:51:34,629 --> 01:51:34,639
right i can go to the moon with
 

6603
01:51:34,639 --> 01:51:36,870
right i can go to the moon with
newtonian physics i think and i can

6604
01:51:36,870 --> 01:51:36,880
newtonian physics i think and i can
 

6605
01:51:36,880 --> 01:51:39,430
newtonian physics i think and i can
understand um the the orbit of mercury

6606
01:51:39,430 --> 01:51:39,440
understand um the the orbit of mercury
 

6607
01:51:39,440 --> 01:51:40,950
understand um the the orbit of mercury
with relativity

6608
01:51:40,950 --> 01:51:40,960
with relativity
 

6609
01:51:40,960 --> 01:51:42,870
with relativity
and so and i can build transistors with

6610
01:51:42,870 --> 01:51:42,880
and so and i can build transistors with
 

6611
01:51:42,880 --> 01:51:44,310
and so and i can build transistors with
quantum mechanics right and i can do all

6612
01:51:44,310 --> 01:51:44,320
quantum mechanics right and i can do all
 

6613
01:51:44,320 --> 01:51:46,310
quantum mechanics right and i can do all
this stuff yeah so i'm not saying the

6614
01:51:46,310 --> 01:51:46,320
this stuff yeah so i'm not saying the
 

6615
01:51:46,320 --> 01:51:48,550
this stuff yeah so i'm not saying the
physics is wrong i'm just saying

6616
01:51:48,550 --> 01:51:48,560
physics is wrong i'm just saying
 

6617
01:51:48,560 --> 01:51:50,629
physics is wrong i'm just saying
if we say that time is fundamental i.e

6618
01:51:50,629 --> 01:51:50,639
if we say that time is fundamental i.e
 

6619
01:51:50,639 --> 01:51:52,310
if we say that time is fundamental i.e
time is non-negotiable there's a global

6620
01:51:52,310 --> 01:51:52,320
time is non-negotiable there's a global
 

6621
01:51:52,320 --> 01:51:53,910
time is non-negotiable there's a global
clock

6622
01:51:53,910 --> 01:51:53,920
clock
 

6623
01:51:53,920 --> 01:51:56,470
clock
i don't neither i don't need to require

6624
01:51:56,470 --> 01:51:56,480
i don't neither i don't need to require
 

6625
01:51:56,480 --> 01:51:58,470
i don't neither i don't need to require
that there's order been magically made

6626
01:51:58,470 --> 01:51:58,480
that there's order been magically made
 

6627
01:51:58,480 --> 01:52:00,870
that there's order been magically made
in the past because that asymmetry is

6628
01:52:00,870 --> 01:52:00,880
in the past because that asymmetry is
 

6629
01:52:00,880 --> 01:52:05,350
in the past because that asymmetry is
built into the way the universe is

6630
01:52:05,350 --> 01:52:05,360

 

6631
01:52:05,360 --> 01:52:07,910

so if time's fundamental i mean

6632
01:52:07,910 --> 01:52:07,920
so if time's fundamental i mean
 

6633
01:52:07,920 --> 01:52:11,030
so if time's fundamental i mean
you've been referring to this kind of

6634
01:52:11,030 --> 01:52:11,040
you've been referring to this kind of
 

6635
01:52:11,040 --> 01:52:12,629
you've been referring to this kind of
an interesting formulation that is

6636
01:52:12,629 --> 01:52:12,639
an interesting formulation that is
 

6637
01:52:12,639 --> 01:52:13,750
an interesting formulation that is
memory

6638
01:52:13,750 --> 01:52:13,760
memory
 

6639
01:52:13,760 --> 01:52:14,629
memory
yeah

6640
01:52:14,629 --> 01:52:14,639
yeah
 

6641
01:52:14,639 --> 01:52:18,310
yeah
so uh time time is hard to like put a

6642
01:52:18,310 --> 01:52:18,320
so uh time time is hard to like put a
 

6643
01:52:18,320 --> 01:52:19,910
so uh time time is hard to like put a
finger on like what what the hell are we

6644
01:52:19,910 --> 01:52:19,920
finger on like what what the hell are we
 

6645
01:52:19,920 --> 01:52:21,589
finger on like what what the hell are we
talking about well it's just a direction

6646
01:52:21,589 --> 01:52:21,599
talking about well it's just a direction
 

6647
01:52:21,599 --> 01:52:22,870
talking about well it's just a direction
but memory

6648
01:52:22,870 --> 01:52:22,880
but memory
 

6649
01:52:22,880 --> 01:52:25,189
but memory
is a construction especially when you

6650
01:52:25,189 --> 01:52:25,199
is a construction especially when you
 

6651
01:52:25,199 --> 01:52:26,550
is a construction especially when you
have like

6652
01:52:26,550 --> 01:52:26,560
have like
 

6653
01:52:26,560 --> 01:52:28,149
have like
think about these local pockets of

6654
01:52:28,149 --> 01:52:28,159
think about these local pockets of
 

6655
01:52:28,159 --> 01:52:31,189
think about these local pockets of
complexity these um

6656
01:52:31,189 --> 01:52:31,199
complexity these um
 

6657
01:52:31,199 --> 01:52:34,149
complexity these um
non-zero assembly index entities that's

6658
01:52:34,149 --> 01:52:34,159
non-zero assembly index entities that's
 

6659
01:52:34,159 --> 01:52:37,189
non-zero assembly index entities that's
being constructed and they remember

6660
01:52:37,189 --> 01:52:37,199
being constructed and they remember
 

6661
01:52:37,199 --> 01:52:39,750
being constructed and they remember
never forget molecules but remember the

6662
01:52:39,750 --> 01:52:39,760
never forget molecules but remember the
 

6663
01:52:39,760 --> 01:52:42,390
never forget molecules but remember the
thing is i invented assembly theory

6664
01:52:42,390 --> 01:52:42,400
thing is i invented assembly theory
 

6665
01:52:42,400 --> 01:52:44,550
thing is i invented assembly theory
um i'll tell you i invented it when i

6666
01:52:44,550 --> 01:52:44,560
um i'll tell you i invented it when i
 

6667
01:52:44,560 --> 01:52:46,310
um i'll tell you i invented it when i
was a kid i mean i the thing is i keep

6668
01:52:46,310 --> 01:52:46,320
was a kid i mean i the thing is i keep
 

6669
01:52:46,320 --> 01:52:47,589
was a kid i mean i the thing is i keep
making fun of myself from a research

6670
01:52:47,589 --> 01:52:47,599
making fun of myself from a research
 

6671
01:52:47,599 --> 01:52:49,910
making fun of myself from a research
group i've only ever had one idea i keep

6672
01:52:49,910 --> 01:52:49,920
group i've only ever had one idea i keep
 

6673
01:52:49,920 --> 01:52:52,149
group i've only ever had one idea i keep
exploring that idea over the 40 years or

6674
01:52:52,149 --> 01:52:52,159
exploring that idea over the 40 years or
 

6675
01:52:52,159 --> 01:52:53,910
exploring that idea over the 40 years or
so since i had that idea

6676
01:52:53,910 --> 01:52:53,920
so since i had that idea
 

6677
01:52:53,920 --> 01:52:55,669
so since i had that idea
well aren't you the idea that the

6678
01:52:55,669 --> 01:52:55,679
well aren't you the idea that the
 

6679
01:52:55,679 --> 01:52:57,189
well aren't you the idea that the
universe had so it's very kind of

6680
01:52:57,189 --> 01:52:57,199
universe had so it's very kind of
 

6681
01:52:57,199 --> 01:52:59,589
universe had so it's very kind of
hierarchical anyway go ahead i'm sorry

6682
01:52:59,589 --> 01:52:59,599
hierarchical anyway go ahead i'm sorry
 

6683
01:52:59,599 --> 01:53:01,990
hierarchical anyway go ahead i'm sorry
that's that's very oh that's very poetic

6684
01:53:01,990 --> 01:53:02,000
that's that's very oh that's very poetic
 

6685
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:02,790
that's that's very oh that's very poetic
yeah

6686
01:53:02,790 --> 01:53:02,800
yeah
 

6687
01:53:02,800 --> 01:53:04,390
yeah
so i think i came up with assembly

6688
01:53:04,390 --> 01:53:04,400
so i think i came up with assembly
 

6689
01:53:04,400 --> 01:53:06,390
so i think i came up with assembly
theory the following idea when i was a

6690
01:53:06,390 --> 01:53:06,400
theory the following idea when i was a
 

6691
01:53:06,400 --> 01:53:09,350
theory the following idea when i was a
kid i was obsessed about survival kits

6692
01:53:09,350 --> 01:53:09,360
kid i was obsessed about survival kits
 

6693
01:53:09,360 --> 01:53:12,310
kid i was obsessed about survival kits
what is the minimum stuff i would need

6694
01:53:12,310 --> 01:53:12,320
what is the minimum stuff i would need
 

6695
01:53:12,320 --> 01:53:14,070
what is the minimum stuff i would need
to basically replicate my reality and i

6696
01:53:14,070 --> 01:53:14,080
to basically replicate my reality and i
 

6697
01:53:14,080 --> 01:53:15,510
to basically replicate my reality and i
love computers

6698
01:53:15,510 --> 01:53:15,520
love computers
 

6699
01:53:15,520 --> 01:53:17,189
love computers
and i love technology or what

6700
01:53:17,189 --> 01:53:17,199
and i love technology or what
 

6701
01:53:17,199 --> 01:53:19,589
and i love technology or what
technologies can become so i imagined

6702
01:53:19,589 --> 01:53:19,599
technologies can become so i imagined
 

6703
01:53:19,599 --> 01:53:21,030
technologies can become so i imagined
that i would have basically this really

6704
01:53:21,030 --> 01:53:21,040
that i would have basically this really
 

6705
01:53:21,040 --> 01:53:23,030
that i would have basically this really
big truck full of stuff and i thought

6706
01:53:23,030 --> 01:53:23,040
big truck full of stuff and i thought
 

6707
01:53:23,040 --> 01:53:25,270
big truck full of stuff and i thought
well can i delete some of that stuff out

6708
01:53:25,270 --> 01:53:25,280
well can i delete some of that stuff out
 

6709
01:53:25,280 --> 01:53:27,189
well can i delete some of that stuff out
can i have a blueprint and then and in

6710
01:53:27,189 --> 01:53:27,199
can i have a blueprint and then and in
 

6711
01:53:27,199 --> 01:53:28,950
can i have a blueprint and then and in
the end i kept making this making it

6712
01:53:28,950 --> 01:53:28,960
the end i kept making this making it
 

6713
01:53:28,960 --> 01:53:31,109
the end i kept making this making it
smaller i got to maybe half a truck and

6714
01:53:31,109 --> 01:53:31,119
smaller i got to maybe half a truck and
 

6715
01:53:31,119 --> 01:53:33,430
smaller i got to maybe half a truck and
into a suitcase and then went okay i'll

6716
01:53:33,430 --> 01:53:33,440
into a suitcase and then went okay i'll
 

6717
01:53:33,440 --> 01:53:35,589
into a suitcase and then went okay i'll
screw it i want to i want to carry my

6718
01:53:35,589 --> 01:53:35,599
screw it i want to i want to carry my
 

6719
01:53:35,599 --> 01:53:37,750
screw it i want to i want to carry my
entire technology in my pocket how do i

6720
01:53:37,750 --> 01:53:37,760
entire technology in my pocket how do i
 

6721
01:53:37,760 --> 01:53:40,390
entire technology in my pocket how do i
do it and i'm not like a launch interest

6722
01:53:40,390 --> 01:53:40,400
do it and i'm not like a launch interest
 

6723
01:53:40,400 --> 01:53:43,030
do it and i'm not like a launch interest
steve jobian you know i'm iplayer

6724
01:53:43,030 --> 01:53:43,040
steve jobian you know i'm iplayer
 

6725
01:53:43,040 --> 01:53:45,750
steve jobian you know i'm iplayer
i came up with a matchbox survival kit

6726
01:53:45,750 --> 01:53:45,760
i came up with a matchbox survival kit
 

6727
01:53:45,760 --> 01:53:47,350
i came up with a matchbox survival kit
in that matchbox survival kit i would

6728
01:53:47,350 --> 01:53:47,360
in that matchbox survival kit i would
 

6729
01:53:47,360 --> 01:53:48,790
in that matchbox survival kit i would
have the minimum stuff that would allow

6730
01:53:48,790 --> 01:53:48,800
have the minimum stuff that would allow
 

6731
01:53:48,800 --> 01:53:51,430
have the minimum stuff that would allow
me to interact the environment to build

6732
01:53:51,430 --> 01:53:51,440
me to interact the environment to build
 

6733
01:53:51,440 --> 01:53:54,310
me to interact the environment to build
my shelter to build a fishing rod to

6734
01:53:54,310 --> 01:53:54,320
my shelter to build a fishing rod to
 

6735
01:53:54,320 --> 01:53:57,270
my shelter to build a fishing rod to
build a water purification system and

6736
01:53:57,270 --> 01:53:57,280
build a water purification system and
 

6737
01:53:57,280 --> 01:53:58,790
build a water purification system and
it's kind of like so what did i use in

6738
01:53:58,790 --> 01:53:58,800
it's kind of like so what did i use in
 

6739
01:53:58,800 --> 01:54:00,470
it's kind of like so what did i use in
my box to assemble

6740
01:54:00,470 --> 01:54:00,480
my box to assemble
 

6741
01:54:00,480 --> 01:54:02,470
my box to assemble
in the environment to assemble to

6742
01:54:02,470 --> 01:54:02,480
in the environment to assemble to
 

6743
01:54:02,480 --> 01:54:04,470
in the environment to assemble to
assemble to assemble

6744
01:54:04,470 --> 01:54:04,480
assemble to assemble
 

6745
01:54:04,480 --> 01:54:06,629
assemble to assemble
and and i realized i could make a causal

6746
01:54:06,629 --> 01:54:06,639
and and i realized i could make a causal
 

6747
01:54:06,639 --> 01:54:08,629
and and i realized i could make a causal
chain in my survival kit so i guess

6748
01:54:08,629 --> 01:54:08,639
chain in my survival kit so i guess
 

6749
01:54:08,639 --> 01:54:09,990
chain in my survival kit so i guess
that's probably why i've been obsessed

6750
01:54:09,990 --> 01:54:10,000
that's probably why i've been obsessed
 

6751
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,070
that's probably why i've been obsessed
with assembly theory for so long and i

6752
01:54:12,070 --> 01:54:12,080
with assembly theory for so long and i
 

6753
01:54:12,080 --> 01:54:14,350
with assembly theory for so long and i
was just

6754
01:54:14,350 --> 01:54:14,360
was just
 

6755
01:54:14,360 --> 01:54:17,510
was just
pre-configured to find it somewhere

6756
01:54:17,510 --> 01:54:17,520
pre-configured to find it somewhere
 

6757
01:54:17,520 --> 01:54:19,910
pre-configured to find it somewhere
and when i saw it in molecules i i

6758
01:54:19,910 --> 01:54:19,920
and when i saw it in molecules i i
 

6759
01:54:19,920 --> 01:54:22,470
and when i saw it in molecules i i
realized that the causal structure that

6760
01:54:22,470 --> 01:54:22,480
realized that the causal structure that
 

6761
01:54:22,480 --> 01:54:24,149
realized that the causal structure that
we say emerges

6762
01:54:24,149 --> 01:54:24,159
we say emerges
 

6763
01:54:24,159 --> 01:54:26,310
we say emerges
and the physics kind of gets really

6764
01:54:26,310 --> 01:54:26,320
and the physics kind of gets really
 

6765
01:54:26,320 --> 01:54:28,310
and the physics kind of gets really
stuck because they're saying that time

6766
01:54:28,310 --> 01:54:28,320
stuck because they're saying that time
 

6767
01:54:28,320 --> 01:54:30,229
stuck because they're saying that time
you can go backwards in time i mean how

6768
01:54:30,229 --> 01:54:30,239
you can go backwards in time i mean how
 

6769
01:54:30,239 --> 01:54:32,629
you can go backwards in time i mean how
do we let physicists get away with the

6770
01:54:32,629 --> 01:54:32,639
do we let physicists get away with the
 

6771
01:54:32,639 --> 01:54:34,310
do we let physicists get away with the
notion that we can go back in time and

6772
01:54:34,310 --> 01:54:34,320
notion that we can go back in time and
 

6773
01:54:34,320 --> 01:54:36,709
notion that we can go back in time and
meet ourselves i mean that

6774
01:54:36,709 --> 01:54:36,719
meet ourselves i mean that
 

6775
01:54:36,719 --> 01:54:38,470
meet ourselves i mean that
that's clearly

6776
01:54:38,470 --> 01:54:38,480
that's clearly
 

6777
01:54:38,480 --> 01:54:39,990
that's clearly
a very

6778
01:54:39,990 --> 01:54:40,000
a very
 

6779
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:41,350
a very
hard thing

6780
01:54:41,350 --> 01:54:41,360
hard thing
 

6781
01:54:41,360 --> 01:54:44,149
hard thing
to let we physicists would not let

6782
01:54:44,149 --> 01:54:44,159
to let we physicists would not let
 

6783
01:54:44,159 --> 01:54:46,790
to let we physicists would not let
other scientists get away with

6784
01:54:46,790 --> 01:54:46,800
other scientists get away with
 

6785
01:54:46,800 --> 01:54:49,350
other scientists get away with
that kind of heresy right so why

6786
01:54:49,350 --> 01:54:49,360
that kind of heresy right so why
 

6787
01:54:49,360 --> 01:54:50,470
that kind of heresy right so why
physicists allowed to get away with it

6788
01:54:50,470 --> 01:54:50,480
physicists allowed to get away with it
 

6789
01:54:50,480 --> 01:54:52,709
physicists allowed to get away with it
let's so first of all to push back

6790
01:54:52,709 --> 01:54:52,719
let's so first of all to push back
 

6791
01:54:52,719 --> 01:54:55,430
let's so first of all to push back
to play devil's advocate you are clearly

6792
01:54:55,430 --> 01:54:55,440
to play devil's advocate you are clearly
 

6793
01:54:55,440 --> 01:54:58,390
to play devil's advocate you are clearly
married to the idea of memory

6794
01:54:58,390 --> 01:54:58,400
married to the idea of memory
 

6795
01:54:58,400 --> 01:55:00,310
married to the idea of memory
you see in this

6796
01:55:00,310 --> 01:55:00,320
you see in this
 

6797
01:55:00,320 --> 01:55:02,390
you see in this
again rick from rick and morty way you

6798
01:55:02,390 --> 01:55:02,400
again rick from rick and morty way you
 

6799
01:55:02,400 --> 01:55:04,950
again rick from rick and morty way you
see you you have these deep dreams of

6800
01:55:04,950 --> 01:55:04,960
see you you have these deep dreams of
 

6801
01:55:04,960 --> 01:55:07,910
see you you have these deep dreams of
the universe that is writing the story

6802
01:55:07,910 --> 01:55:07,920
the universe that is writing the story
 

6803
01:55:07,920 --> 01:55:09,270
the universe that is writing the story
through its memories those these

6804
01:55:09,270 --> 01:55:09,280
through its memories those these
 

6805
01:55:09,280 --> 01:55:11,109
through its memories those these
chemical compounds that are just

6806
01:55:11,109 --> 01:55:11,119
chemical compounds that are just
 

6807
01:55:11,119 --> 01:55:12,870
chemical compounds that are just
building on top of each other and and

6808
01:55:12,870 --> 01:55:12,880
building on top of each other and and
 

6809
01:55:12,880 --> 01:55:14,870
building on top of each other and and
then they they find useful components

6810
01:55:14,870 --> 01:55:14,880
then they they find useful components
 

6811
01:55:14,880 --> 01:55:16,870
then they they find useful components
they can reuse and then they're they're

6812
01:55:16,870 --> 01:55:16,880
they can reuse and then they're they're
 

6813
01:55:16,880 --> 01:55:18,550
they can reuse and then they're they're
reused components

6814
01:55:18,550 --> 01:55:18,560
reused components
 

6815
01:55:18,560 --> 01:55:20,550
reused components
uh create systems that themselves are

6816
01:55:20,550 --> 01:55:20,560
uh create systems that themselves are
 

6817
01:55:20,560 --> 01:55:22,550
uh create systems that themselves are
then reused and all in this way

6818
01:55:22,550 --> 01:55:22,560
then reused and all in this way
 

6819
01:55:22,560 --> 01:55:24,149

construct things

6820
01:55:24,149 --> 01:55:24,159
construct things
 

6821
01:55:24,159 --> 01:55:25,109
construct things
but

6822
01:55:25,109 --> 01:55:25,119
but
 

6823
01:55:25,119 --> 01:55:27,830
but
when you think of that as memory

6824
01:55:27,830 --> 01:55:27,840
when you think of that as memory
 

6825
01:55:27,840 --> 01:55:30,950
when you think of that as memory
it seems like quite sad that you can

6826
01:55:30,950 --> 01:55:30,960
it seems like quite sad that you can
 

6827
01:55:30,960 --> 01:55:33,030
it seems like quite sad that you can
walk that back but at the same time it

6828
01:55:33,030 --> 01:55:33,040
walk that back but at the same time it
 

6829
01:55:33,040 --> 01:55:35,350
walk that back but at the same time it
feels like that memory you can walk in

6830
01:55:35,350 --> 01:55:35,360
feels like that memory you can walk in
 

6831
01:55:35,360 --> 01:55:37,189
feels like that memory you can walk in
both directions on that memory in in

6832
01:55:37,189 --> 01:55:37,199
both directions on that memory in in
 

6833
01:55:37,199 --> 01:55:38,870
both directions on that memory in in
terms of time you could walk in both

6834
01:55:38,870 --> 01:55:38,880
terms of time you could walk in both
 

6835
01:55:38,880 --> 01:55:40,470
terms of time you could walk in both
directions but i don't i don't think

6836
01:55:40,470 --> 01:55:40,480
directions but i don't i don't think
 

6837
01:55:40,480 --> 01:55:42,870
directions but i don't i don't think
that that makes any sense because

6838
01:55:42,870 --> 01:55:42,880
that that makes any sense because
 

6839
01:55:42,880 --> 01:55:47,109
that that makes any sense because
um the problem that i have with time

6840
01:55:47,109 --> 01:55:47,119
um the problem that i have with time
 

6841
01:55:47,119 --> 01:55:48,629
um the problem that i have with time
being

6842
01:55:48,629 --> 01:55:48,639
being
 

6843
01:55:48,639 --> 01:55:49,990
being
reversible

6844
01:55:49,990 --> 01:55:50,000
reversible
 

6845
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:51,830
reversible
is that um

6846
01:55:51,830 --> 01:55:51,840
is that um
 

6847
01:55:51,840 --> 01:55:53,589
is that um
i mean i'm i'm just a you know i'm a

6848
01:55:53,589 --> 01:55:53,599
i mean i'm i'm just a you know i'm a
 

6849
01:55:53,599 --> 01:55:55,270
i mean i'm i'm just a you know i'm a
dumb experimental chemist right so i

6850
01:55:55,270 --> 01:55:55,280
dumb experimental chemist right so i
 

6851
01:55:55,280 --> 01:55:57,030
dumb experimental chemist right so i
love burning stuff you know burning

6852
01:55:57,030 --> 01:55:57,040
love burning stuff you know burning
 

6853
01:55:57,040 --> 01:55:58,709
love burning stuff you know burning
stuff and building stuff

6854
01:55:58,709 --> 01:55:58,719
stuff and building stuff
 

6855
01:55:58,719 --> 01:56:01,030
stuff and building stuff
but when i think of reversible phenomena

6856
01:56:01,030 --> 01:56:01,040
but when i think of reversible phenomena
 

6857
01:56:01,040 --> 01:56:03,270
but when i think of reversible phenomena
i imagine in my head i have to actually

6858
01:56:03,270 --> 01:56:03,280
i imagine in my head i have to actually
 

6859
01:56:03,280 --> 01:56:05,750
i imagine in my head i have to actually
manufacture some time i have to i have

6860
01:56:05,750 --> 01:56:05,760
manufacture some time i have to i have
 

6861
01:56:05,760 --> 01:56:07,350
manufacture some time i have to i have
to borrow time from the universe to do

6862
01:56:07,350 --> 01:56:07,360
to borrow time from the universe to do
 

6863
01:56:07,360 --> 01:56:10,229
to borrow time from the universe to do
that i can't when anyone says let's

6864
01:56:10,229 --> 01:56:10,239
that i can't when anyone says let's
 

6865
01:56:10,239 --> 01:56:12,229
that i can't when anyone says let's
imagine that we can go back in time or

6866
01:56:12,229 --> 01:56:12,239
imagine that we can go back in time or
 

6867
01:56:12,239 --> 01:56:13,750
imagine that we can go back in time or
reversibility you can't do that you

6868
01:56:13,750 --> 01:56:13,760
reversibility you can't do that you
 

6869
01:56:13,760 --> 01:56:15,430
reversibility you can't do that you
can't step out of time time is

6870
01:56:15,430 --> 01:56:15,440
can't step out of time time is
 

6871
01:56:15,440 --> 01:56:17,430
can't step out of time time is
non-negotiable it's happening no but see

6872
01:56:17,430 --> 01:56:17,440
non-negotiable it's happening no but see
 

6873
01:56:17,440 --> 01:56:20,390
non-negotiable it's happening no but see
you're assuming that time is fundamental

6874
01:56:20,390 --> 01:56:20,400
you're assuming that time is fundamental
 

6875
01:56:20,400 --> 01:56:23,109
you're assuming that time is fundamental
which most of us do when we go

6876
01:56:23,109 --> 01:56:23,119
which most of us do when we go
 

6877
01:56:23,119 --> 01:56:26,229
which most of us do when we go
day-to-day but it takes a leap of wild

6878
01:56:26,229 --> 01:56:26,239
day-to-day but it takes a leap of wild
 

6879
01:56:26,239 --> 01:56:28,390
day-to-day but it takes a leap of wild
imagination to think that time is

6880
01:56:28,390 --> 01:56:28,400
imagination to think that time is
 

6881
01:56:28,400 --> 01:56:31,030
imagination to think that time is
emergent um no time is not emergent yeah

6882
01:56:31,030 --> 01:56:31,040
emergent um no time is not emergent yeah
 

6883
01:56:31,040 --> 01:56:32,709
emergent um no time is not emergent yeah
i mean this is an argument we can have

6884
01:56:32,709 --> 01:56:32,719
i mean this is an argument we can have
 

6885
01:56:32,719 --> 01:56:33,990
i mean this is an argument we can have
but i believe

6886
01:56:33,990 --> 01:56:34,000
but i believe
 

6887
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:35,910
but i believe
i can come up with an experiment an

6888
01:56:35,910 --> 01:56:35,920
i can come up with an experiment an
 

6889
01:56:35,920 --> 01:56:37,669
i can come up with an experiment an
experiment that proves that time cannot

6890
01:56:37,669 --> 01:56:37,679
experiment that proves that time cannot
 

6891
01:56:37,679 --> 01:56:39,669
experiment that proves that time cannot
possibly be emerging experiment that

6892
01:56:39,669 --> 01:56:39,679
possibly be emerging experiment that
 

6893
01:56:39,679 --> 01:56:41,510
possibly be emerging experiment that
shows how

6894
01:56:41,510 --> 01:56:41,520
shows how
 

6895
01:56:41,520 --> 01:56:43,189
shows how
assembly theory

6896
01:56:43,189 --> 01:56:43,199
assembly theory
 

6897
01:56:43,199 --> 01:56:44,470
assembly theory
kind of

6898
01:56:44,470 --> 01:56:44,480
kind of
 

6899
01:56:44,480 --> 01:56:46,950
kind of
is the way that the universe produces

6900
01:56:46,950 --> 01:56:46,960
is the way that the universe produces
 

6901
01:56:46,960 --> 01:56:49,350
is the way that the universe produces
selection and that selection gives rise

6902
01:56:49,350 --> 01:56:49,360
selection and that selection gives rise
 

6903
01:56:49,360 --> 01:56:50,550
selection and that selection gives rise
to life

6904
01:56:50,550 --> 01:56:50,560
to life
 

6905
01:56:50,560 --> 01:56:53,430
to life
and also to say well hang on

6906
01:56:53,430 --> 01:56:53,440
and also to say well hang on
 

6907
01:56:53,440 --> 01:56:54,870
and also to say well hang on
we could allow ourselves to have a

6908
01:56:54,870 --> 01:56:54,880
we could allow ourselves to have a
 

6909
01:56:54,880 --> 01:56:56,870
we could allow ourselves to have a
theory that requires us to have these

6910
01:56:56,870 --> 01:56:56,880
theory that requires us to have these
 

6911
01:56:56,880 --> 01:56:59,109
theory that requires us to have these
these statements to be possible

6912
01:56:59,109 --> 01:56:59,119
these statements to be possible
 

6913
01:56:59,119 --> 01:57:01,510
these statements to be possible
like we need we need to have

6914
01:57:01,510 --> 01:57:01,520
like we need we need to have
 

6915
01:57:01,520 --> 01:57:03,910
like we need we need to have
order in the past or we can have use the

6916
01:57:03,910 --> 01:57:03,920
order in the past or we can have use the
 

6917
01:57:03,920 --> 01:57:05,750
order in the past or we can have use the
past hypothesis

6918
01:57:05,750 --> 01:57:05,760
past hypothesis
 

6919
01:57:05,760 --> 01:57:08,310
past hypothesis
um which is order in the past but

6920
01:57:08,310 --> 01:57:08,320
um which is order in the past but
 

6921
01:57:08,320 --> 01:57:09,430
um which is order in the past but
as well

6922
01:57:09,430 --> 01:57:09,440
as well
 

6923
01:57:09,440 --> 01:57:10,950
as well
okay

6924
01:57:10,950 --> 01:57:10,960
okay
 

6925
01:57:10,960 --> 01:57:12,790
okay
and we have to have an arrow of time we

6926
01:57:12,790 --> 01:57:12,800
and we have to have an arrow of time we
 

6927
01:57:12,800 --> 01:57:14,950
and we have to have an arrow of time we
have to require that entropy

6928
01:57:14,950 --> 01:57:14,960
have to require that entropy
 

6929
01:57:14,960 --> 01:57:17,350
have to require that entropy
it increases and we have to say and then

6930
01:57:17,350 --> 01:57:17,360
it increases and we have to say and then
 

6931
01:57:17,360 --> 01:57:18,550
it increases and we have to say and then
we can say look the universe is

6932
01:57:18,550 --> 01:57:18,560
we can say look the universe is
 

6933
01:57:18,560 --> 01:57:21,510
we can say look the universe is
completely closed and there's no novelty

6934
01:57:21,510 --> 01:57:21,520
completely closed and there's no novelty
 

6935
01:57:21,520 --> 01:57:23,990
completely closed and there's no novelty
or that novelty is predetermined what

6936
01:57:23,990 --> 01:57:24,000
or that novelty is predetermined what
 

6937
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:26,470
or that novelty is predetermined what
i'm saying is very very important that

6938
01:57:26,470 --> 01:57:26,480
i'm saying is very very important that
 

6939
01:57:26,480 --> 01:57:28,790
i'm saying is very very important that
time is fundamental which means if you

6940
01:57:28,790 --> 01:57:28,800
time is fundamental which means if you
 

6941
01:57:28,800 --> 01:57:31,189
time is fundamental which means if you
think about it the universe becomes more

6942
01:57:31,189 --> 01:57:31,199
think about it the universe becomes more
 

6943
01:57:31,199 --> 01:57:33,189
think about it the universe becomes more
and more novel each step it generates as

6944
01:57:33,189 --> 01:57:33,199
and more novel each step it generates as
 

6945
01:57:33,199 --> 01:57:34,950
and more novel each step it generates as
more states and next step than it was

6946
01:57:34,950 --> 01:57:34,960
more states and next step than it was
 

6947
01:57:34,960 --> 01:57:37,350
more states and next step than it was
before that means bigger search

6948
01:57:37,350 --> 01:57:37,360
before that means bigger search
 

6949
01:57:37,360 --> 01:57:39,350
before that means bigger search
so what i'm saying is that the universe

6950
01:57:39,350 --> 01:57:39,360
so what i'm saying is that the universe
 

6951
01:57:39,360 --> 01:57:41,109
so what i'm saying is that the universe
wasn't capable of consciousness at day

6952
01:57:41,109 --> 01:57:41,119
wasn't capable of consciousness at day
 

6953
01:57:41,119 --> 01:57:43,030
wasn't capable of consciousness at day
one

6954
01:57:43,030 --> 01:57:43,040
one
 

6955
01:57:43,040 --> 01:57:44,070
one
actually because it didn't have enough

6956
01:57:44,070 --> 01:57:44,080
actually because it didn't have enough
 

6957
01:57:44,080 --> 01:57:45,589
actually because it didn't have enough
states

6958
01:57:45,589 --> 01:57:45,599
states
 

6959
01:57:45,599 --> 01:57:48,070
states
but but today the universe is complex so

6960
01:57:48,070 --> 01:57:48,080
but but today the universe is complex so
 

6961
01:57:48,080 --> 01:57:49,669
but but today the universe is complex so
it's like all right all right hold on a

6962
01:57:49,669 --> 01:57:49,679
it's like all right all right hold on a
 

6963
01:57:49,679 --> 01:57:51,430
it's like all right all right hold on a
second

6964
01:57:51,430 --> 01:57:51,440
second
 

6965
01:57:51,440 --> 01:57:53,430
second
now we've pissed off the pant cycles too

6966
01:57:53,430 --> 01:57:53,440
now we've pissed off the pant cycles too
 

6967
01:57:53,440 --> 01:57:55,589
now we've pissed off the pant cycles too
okay

6968
01:57:55,589 --> 01:57:55,599
okay
 

6969
01:57:55,599 --> 01:57:57,350
okay
no just brilliant sorry i'm

6970
01:57:57,350 --> 01:57:57,360
no just brilliant sorry i'm
 

6971
01:57:57,360 --> 01:57:59,109
no just brilliant sorry i'm
a part of me is just you know joking

6972
01:57:59,109 --> 01:57:59,119
a part of me is just you know joking
 

6973
01:57:59,119 --> 01:58:00,709
a part of me is just you know joking
having fun with this thing but uh

6974
01:58:00,709 --> 01:58:00,719
having fun with this thing but uh
 

6975
01:58:00,719 --> 01:58:01,910
having fun with this thing but uh
because you're saying a lot of brilliant

6976
01:58:01,910 --> 01:58:01,920
because you're saying a lot of brilliant
 

6977
01:58:01,920 --> 01:58:03,990
because you're saying a lot of brilliant
stuff and i'm trying to slow it down

6978
01:58:03,990 --> 01:58:04,000
stuff and i'm trying to slow it down
 

6979
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:06,629
stuff and i'm trying to slow it down
before my brain explodes so because i

6980
01:58:06,629 --> 01:58:06,639
before my brain explodes so because i
 

6981
01:58:06,639 --> 01:58:08,629
before my brain explodes so because i
want to break break apart some of the

6982
01:58:08,629 --> 01:58:08,639
want to break break apart some of the
 

6983
01:58:08,639 --> 01:58:10,550
want to break break apart some of the
fascinating things you're saying so

6984
01:58:10,550 --> 01:58:10,560
fascinating things you're saying so
 

6985
01:58:10,560 --> 01:58:11,990
fascinating things you're saying so
novelty

6986
01:58:11,990 --> 01:58:12,000
novelty
 

6987
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:14,550
novelty
novelty is increasing in the universe

6988
01:58:14,550 --> 01:58:14,560
novelty is increasing in the universe
 

6989
01:58:14,560 --> 01:58:16,310
novelty is increasing in the universe
because the number of states is

6990
01:58:16,310 --> 01:58:16,320
because the number of states is
 

6991
01:58:16,320 --> 01:58:18,550
because the number of states is
increasing what do you mean by states so

6992
01:58:18,550 --> 01:58:18,560
increasing what do you mean by states so
 

6993
01:58:18,560 --> 01:58:19,990
increasing what do you mean by states so
i think the physicists almost got

6994
01:58:19,990 --> 01:58:20,000
i think the physicists almost got
 

6995
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:21,669
i think the physicists almost got
everything right i can't i can't fault

6996
01:58:21,669 --> 01:58:21,679
everything right i can't i can't fault
 

6997
01:58:21,679 --> 01:58:22,790
everything right i can't i can't fault
them at all

6998
01:58:22,790 --> 01:58:22,800
them at all
 

6999
01:58:22,800 --> 01:58:24,310
them at all
i just think there's a little bit of dog

7000
01:58:24,310 --> 01:58:24,320
i just think there's a little bit of dog
 

7001
01:58:24,320 --> 01:58:25,750
i just think there's a little bit of dog
i'm just trying to play devil's advocate

7002
01:58:25,750 --> 01:58:25,760
i'm just trying to play devil's advocate
 

7003
01:58:25,760 --> 01:58:27,510
i'm just trying to play devil's advocate
i'm very happy to be entirely wrong on

7004
01:58:27,510 --> 01:58:27,520
i'm very happy to be entirely wrong on
 

7005
01:58:27,520 --> 01:58:29,350
i'm very happy to be entirely wrong on
this right you know i'm not right on

7006
01:58:29,350 --> 01:58:29,360
this right you know i'm not right on
 

7007
01:58:29,360 --> 01:58:30,950
this right you know i'm not right on
many things at all

7008
01:58:30,950 --> 01:58:30,960
many things at all
 

7009
01:58:30,960 --> 01:58:31,910
many things at all
but

7010
01:58:31,910 --> 01:58:31,920
but
 

7011
01:58:31,920 --> 01:58:34,149
but
but if i can make less assumptions about

7012
01:58:34,149 --> 01:58:34,159
but if i can make less assumptions about
 

7013
01:58:34,159 --> 01:58:36,790
but if i can make less assumptions about
the universe with this then potentially

7014
01:58:36,790 --> 01:58:36,800
the universe with this then potentially
 

7015
01:58:36,800 --> 01:58:38,550
the universe with this then potentially
that's a more powerful way of looking at

7016
01:58:38,550 --> 01:58:38,560
that's a more powerful way of looking at
 

7017
01:58:38,560 --> 01:58:39,589
that's a more powerful way of looking at
things

7018
01:58:39,589 --> 01:58:39,599
things
 

7019
01:58:39,599 --> 01:58:41,669
things
if you think if time is fundamental yeah

7020
01:58:41,669 --> 01:58:41,679
if you think if time is fundamental yeah
 

7021
01:58:41,679 --> 01:58:43,430
if you think if time is fundamental yeah
you can make less assumptions overall

7022
01:58:43,430 --> 01:58:43,440
you can make less assumptions overall
 

7023
01:58:43,440 --> 01:58:44,470
you can make less assumptions overall
exactly

7024
01:58:44,470 --> 01:58:44,480
exactly
 

7025
01:58:44,480 --> 01:58:46,070
exactly
the time sunder meant i don't need to

7026
01:58:46,070 --> 01:58:46,080
the time sunder meant i don't need to
 

7027
01:58:46,080 --> 01:58:48,229
the time sunder meant i don't need to
add on a magical second law because the

7028
01:58:48,229 --> 01:58:48,239
add on a magical second law because the
 

7029
01:58:48,239 --> 01:58:49,510
add on a magical second law because the
second law comes out the fact the

7030
01:58:49,510 --> 01:58:49,520
second law comes out the fact the
 

7031
01:58:49,520 --> 01:58:51,750
second law comes out the fact the
universe is actually there's more states

7032
01:58:51,750 --> 01:58:51,760
universe is actually there's more states
 

7033
01:58:51,760 --> 01:58:53,669
universe is actually there's more states
available i mean we might even be able

7034
01:58:53,669 --> 01:58:53,679
available i mean we might even be able
 

7035
01:58:53,679 --> 01:58:55,350
available i mean we might even be able
to do weird things like dark energy in

7036
01:58:55,350 --> 01:58:55,360
to do weird things like dark energy in
 

7037
01:58:55,360 --> 01:58:58,149
to do weird things like dark energy in
the universe might actually just be time

7038
01:58:58,149 --> 01:58:58,159
the universe might actually just be time
 

7039
01:58:58,159 --> 01:58:59,830
the universe might actually just be time
right yeah but then you have to still

7040
01:58:59,830 --> 01:58:59,840
right yeah but then you have to still
 

7041
01:58:59,840 --> 01:59:02,390
right yeah but then you have to still
have to explain why time's fundamental

7042
01:59:02,390 --> 01:59:02,400
have to explain why time's fundamental
 

7043
01:59:02,400 --> 01:59:04,310
have to explain why time's fundamental
because i can give you one explanation

7044
01:59:04,310 --> 01:59:04,320
because i can give you one explanation
 

7045
01:59:04,320 --> 01:59:06,870
because i can give you one explanation
that's simply a time to say god

7046
01:59:06,870 --> 01:59:06,880
that's simply a time to say god
 

7047
01:59:06,880 --> 01:59:08,550
that's simply a time to say god
you know like just because it's simple

7048
01:59:08,550 --> 01:59:08,560
you know like just because it's simple
 

7049
01:59:08,560 --> 01:59:10,310
you know like just because it's simple
doesn't mean it's

7050
01:59:10,310 --> 01:59:10,320
doesn't mean it's
 

7051
01:59:10,320 --> 01:59:12,390
doesn't mean it's
but okay you still have to explain god

7052
01:59:12,390 --> 01:59:12,400
but okay you still have to explain god
 

7053
01:59:12,400 --> 01:59:14,229
but okay you still have to explain god
and you still have to explain time like

7054
01:59:14,229 --> 01:59:14,239
and you still have to explain time like
 

7055
01:59:14,239 --> 01:59:16,149
and you still have to explain time like
why is it fundamental so let's just say

7056
01:59:16,149 --> 01:59:16,159
why is it fundamental so let's just say
 

7057
01:59:16,159 --> 01:59:18,870
why is it fundamental so let's just say
existence is default which means time is

7058
01:59:18,870 --> 01:59:18,880
existence is default which means time is
 

7059
01:59:18,880 --> 01:59:20,470
existence is default which means time is
the default so

7060
01:59:20,470 --> 01:59:20,480
the default so
 

7061
01:59:20,480 --> 01:59:21,910
the default so
how did you go from the existence this

7062
01:59:21,910 --> 01:59:21,920
how did you go from the existence this
 

7063
01:59:21,920 --> 01:59:23,189
how did you go from the existence this
is the thing

7064
01:59:23,189 --> 01:59:23,199
is the thing
 

7065
01:59:23,199 --> 01:59:25,350
is the thing
well look we exist right so let's just

7066
01:59:25,350 --> 01:59:25,360
well look we exist right so let's just
 

7067
01:59:25,360 --> 01:59:27,350
well look we exist right so let's just
we'll just just take be very we're yet

7068
01:59:27,350 --> 01:59:27,360
we'll just just take be very we're yet
 

7069
01:59:27,360 --> 01:59:28,950
we'll just just take be very we're yet
to talk about what exists means all

7070
01:59:28,950 --> 01:59:28,960
to talk about what exists means all
 

7071
01:59:28,960 --> 01:59:30,390
to talk about what exists means all
right let's listen all the way back yeah

7072
01:59:30,390 --> 01:59:30,400
right let's listen all the way back yeah
 

7073
01:59:30,400 --> 01:59:32,070
right let's listen all the way back yeah
yeah okay i think it's very poetic and

7074
01:59:32,070 --> 01:59:32,080
yeah okay i think it's very poetic and
 

7075
01:59:32,080 --> 01:59:34,070
yeah okay i think it's very poetic and
beautiful what you're weaving into this

7076
01:59:34,070 --> 01:59:34,080
beautiful what you're weaving into this
 

7077
01:59:34,080 --> 01:59:35,669
beautiful what you're weaving into this
i i don't think this conversation is

7078
01:59:35,669 --> 01:59:35,679
i i don't think this conversation is
 

7079
01:59:35,679 --> 01:59:37,510
i i don't think this conversation is
even about the assembly

7080
01:59:37,510 --> 01:59:37,520
even about the assembly
 

7081
01:59:37,520 --> 01:59:40,390
even about the assembly
uh which is fascinating and we'll keep

7082
01:59:40,390 --> 01:59:40,400
uh which is fascinating and we'll keep
 

7083
01:59:40,400 --> 01:59:42,070
uh which is fascinating and we'll keep
mentioning it assembly index and this

7084
01:59:42,070 --> 01:59:42,080
mentioning it assembly index and this
 

7085
01:59:42,080 --> 01:59:43,109
mentioning it assembly index and this
idea

7086
01:59:43,109 --> 01:59:43,119
idea
 

7087
01:59:43,119 --> 01:59:45,109
idea
that i don't think is necessarily

7088
01:59:45,109 --> 01:59:45,119
that i don't think is necessarily
 

7089
01:59:45,119 --> 01:59:47,589
that i don't think is necessarily
connected to time oh i think it is

7090
01:59:47,589 --> 01:59:47,599
connected to time oh i think it is
 

7091
01:59:47,599 --> 01:59:49,910
connected to time oh i think it is
deeply connected like i can't explain it

7092
01:59:49,910 --> 01:59:49,920
deeply connected like i can't explain it
 

7093
01:59:49,920 --> 01:59:52,229
deeply connected like i can't explain it
yet so you don't think everything you've

7094
01:59:52,229 --> 01:59:52,239
yet so you don't think everything you've
 

7095
01:59:52,239 --> 01:59:54,950
yet so you don't think everything you've
said about assembly theory and assembly

7096
01:59:54,950 --> 01:59:54,960
said about assembly theory and assembly
 

7097
01:59:54,960 --> 01:59:55,910
said about assembly theory and assembly
index

7098
01:59:55,910 --> 01:59:55,920
index
 

7099
01:59:55,920 --> 01:59:57,910
index
can still be correct even if time is

7100
01:59:57,910 --> 01:59:57,920
can still be correct even if time is
 

7101
01:59:57,920 --> 02:00:00,390
can still be correct even if time is
emergent so yeah right now assembly

7102
02:00:00,390 --> 02:00:00,400
emergent so yeah right now assembly
 

7103
02:00:00,400 --> 02:00:02,310
emergent so yeah right now assembly
theory appears to work i appear to be

7104
02:00:02,310 --> 02:00:02,320
theory appears to work i appear to be
 

7105
02:00:02,320 --> 02:00:04,709
theory appears to work i appear to be
able to measure objects of high assembly

7106
02:00:04,709 --> 02:00:04,719
able to measure objects of high assembly
 

7107
02:00:04,719 --> 02:00:05,990
able to measure objects of high assembly
in a mass spectrometer and look at their

7108
02:00:05,990 --> 02:00:06,000
in a mass spectrometer and look at their
 

7109
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:07,430
in a mass spectrometer and look at their
abundance and you know all that's fine

7110
02:00:07,430 --> 02:00:07,440
abundance and you know all that's fine
 

7111
02:00:07,440 --> 02:00:09,669
abundance and you know all that's fine
right it's a it's a nice if nothing else

7112
02:00:09,669 --> 02:00:09,679
right it's a it's a nice if nothing else
 

7113
02:00:09,679 --> 02:00:11,270
right it's a it's a nice if nothing else
it's a nice way of looking at how

7114
02:00:11,270 --> 02:00:11,280
it's a nice way of looking at how
 

7115
02:00:11,280 --> 02:00:13,430
it's a nice way of looking at how
molecules can compress things

7116
02:00:13,430 --> 02:00:13,440
molecules can compress things
 

7117
02:00:13,440 --> 02:00:14,310
molecules can compress things
um

7118
02:00:14,310 --> 02:00:14,320
um
 

7119
02:00:14,320 --> 02:00:16,470
um
now am i saying that a time has to be

7120
02:00:16,470 --> 02:00:16,480
now am i saying that a time has to be
 

7121
02:00:16,480 --> 02:00:18,070
now am i saying that a time has to be
fundamental not immersion for assembly

7122
02:00:18,070 --> 02:00:18,080
fundamental not immersion for assembly
 

7123
02:00:18,080 --> 02:00:21,270
fundamental not immersion for assembly
theory to work no i'm i think i'm saying

7124
02:00:21,270 --> 02:00:21,280
theory to work no i'm i think i'm saying
 

7125
02:00:21,280 --> 02:00:23,189
theory to work no i'm i think i'm saying
that the universe

7126
02:00:23,189 --> 02:00:23,199
that the universe
 

7127
02:00:23,199 --> 02:00:25,109
that the universe
it appears that the universe has many

7128
02:00:25,109 --> 02:00:25,119
it appears that the universe has many
 

7129
02:00:25,119 --> 02:00:26,550
it appears that the universe has many
different ways of using time you could

7130
02:00:26,550 --> 02:00:26,560
different ways of using time you could
 

7131
02:00:26,560 --> 02:00:28,310
different ways of using time you could
have three different types of time you

7132
02:00:28,310 --> 02:00:28,320
have three different types of time you
 

7133
02:00:28,320 --> 02:00:29,830
have three different types of time you
could just have time that's

7134
02:00:29,830 --> 02:00:29,840
could just have time that's
 

7135
02:00:29,840 --> 02:00:31,350
could just have time that's
the way i'd think of it if you want if

7136
02:00:31,350 --> 02:00:31,360
the way i'd think of it if you want if
 

7137
02:00:31,360 --> 02:00:33,270
the way i'd think of it if you want if
you want to hold on to emergent time i

7138
02:00:33,270 --> 02:00:33,280
you want to hold on to emergent time i
 

7139
02:00:33,280 --> 02:00:34,709
you want to hold on to emergent time i
think that's fine let's do that for a

7140
02:00:34,709 --> 02:00:34,719
think that's fine let's do that for a
 

7141
02:00:34,719 --> 02:00:37,350
think that's fine let's do that for a
second hold on to emergent time

7142
02:00:37,350 --> 02:00:37,360
second hold on to emergent time
 

7143
02:00:37,360 --> 02:00:39,589
second hold on to emergent time
and the universe is just doing its thing

7144
02:00:39,589 --> 02:00:39,599
and the universe is just doing its thing
 

7145
02:00:39,599 --> 02:00:41,589
and the universe is just doing its thing
then assembly time only exists when the

7146
02:00:41,589 --> 02:00:41,599
then assembly time only exists when the
 

7147
02:00:41,599 --> 02:00:42,790
then assembly time only exists when the
universe starts to write memories

7148
02:00:42,790 --> 02:00:42,800
universe starts to write memories
 

7149
02:00:42,800 --> 02:00:44,550
universe starts to write memories
through bonds so let's just say there's

7150
02:00:44,550 --> 02:00:44,560
through bonds so let's just say there's
 

7151
02:00:44,560 --> 02:00:46,550
through bonds so let's just say there's
rocks running around you know there's

7152
02:00:46,550 --> 02:00:46,560
rocks running around you know there's
 

7153
02:00:46,560 --> 02:00:48,390
rocks running around you know there's
when when the bond happens and selection

7154
02:00:48,390 --> 02:00:48,400
when when the bond happens and selection
 

7155
02:00:48,400 --> 02:00:51,109
when when the bond happens and selection
starts suddenly

7156
02:00:51,109 --> 02:00:51,119
starts suddenly
 

7157
02:00:51,119 --> 02:00:53,030
starts suddenly
there are there the universe is

7158
02:00:53,030 --> 02:00:53,040
there are there the universe is
 

7159
02:00:53,040 --> 02:00:55,669
there are there the universe is
remembering causing in the past and

7160
02:00:55,669 --> 02:00:55,679
remembering causing in the past and
 

7161
02:00:55,679 --> 02:00:57,109
remembering causing in the past and
those structures will have effects in

7162
02:00:57,109 --> 02:00:57,119
those structures will have effects in
 

7163
02:00:57,119 --> 02:00:58,950
those structures will have effects in
the future so suddenly a new type of

7164
02:00:58,950 --> 02:00:58,960
the future so suddenly a new type of
 

7165
02:00:58,960 --> 02:01:01,510
the future so suddenly a new type of
time emerges at that point which has a

7166
02:01:01,510 --> 02:01:01,520
time emerges at that point which has a
 

7167
02:01:01,520 --> 02:01:03,750
time emerges at that point which has a
direction and i think sean carroll at

7168
02:01:03,750 --> 02:01:03,760
direction and i think sean carroll at
 

7169
02:01:03,760 --> 02:01:05,910
direction and i think sean carroll at
this point might even turn the podcast

7170
02:01:05,910 --> 02:01:05,920
this point might even turn the podcast
 

7171
02:01:05,920 --> 02:01:07,669
this point might even turn the podcast
back on and go okay i can deal with that

7172
02:01:07,669 --> 02:01:07,679
back on and go okay i can deal with that
 

7173
02:01:07,679 --> 02:01:09,510
back on and go okay i can deal with that
that's fine but i'm just basically

7174
02:01:09,510 --> 02:01:09,520
that's fine but i'm just basically
 

7175
02:01:09,520 --> 02:01:10,870
that's fine but i'm just basically
trying to condense the conversation and

7176
02:01:10,870 --> 02:01:10,880
trying to condense the conversation and
 

7177
02:01:10,880 --> 02:01:12,870
trying to condense the conversation and
say hey let's just have time fundamental

7178
02:01:12,870 --> 02:01:12,880
say hey let's just have time fundamental
 

7179
02:01:12,880 --> 02:01:14,470
say hey let's just have time fundamental
and see how that screws with people's

7180
02:01:14,470 --> 02:01:14,480
and see how that screws with people's
 

7181
02:01:14,480 --> 02:01:16,470
and see how that screws with people's
minds why you're triggering people by

7182
02:01:16,470 --> 02:01:16,480
minds why you're triggering people by
 

7183
02:01:16,480 --> 02:01:18,790
minds why you're triggering people by
saying fundamental why not we just say

7184
02:01:18,790 --> 02:01:18,800
saying fundamental why not we just say
 

7185
02:01:18,800 --> 02:01:20,950
saying fundamental why not we just say
like let's say why am i look i'm walking

7186
02:01:20,950 --> 02:01:20,960
like let's say why am i look i'm walking
 

7187
02:01:20,960 --> 02:01:22,950
like let's say why am i look i'm walking
through the wall why why

7188
02:01:22,950 --> 02:01:22,960
through the wall why why
 

7189
02:01:22,960 --> 02:01:24,550
through the wall why why
why should i

7190
02:01:24,550 --> 02:01:24,560
why should i
 

7191
02:01:24,560 --> 02:01:27,189
why should i
grow up in a world where time ty i don't

7192
02:01:27,189 --> 02:01:27,199
grow up in a world where time ty i don't
 

7193
02:01:27,199 --> 02:01:28,790
grow up in a world where time ty i don't
go back in time i don't mean i don't

7194
02:01:28,790 --> 02:01:28,800
go back in time i don't mean i don't
 

7195
02:01:28,800 --> 02:01:31,270
go back in time i don't mean i don't
meet myself in the past there are no one

7196
02:01:31,270 --> 02:01:31,280
meet myself in the past there are no one
 

7197
02:01:31,280 --> 02:01:33,030
meet myself in the past there are no one
there are no aliens coming from the

7198
02:01:33,030 --> 02:01:33,040
there are no aliens coming from the
 

7199
02:01:33,040 --> 02:01:34,550
there are no aliens coming from the
future right

7200
02:01:34,550 --> 02:01:34,560
future right
 

7201
02:01:34,560 --> 02:01:36,310
future right
you know it's just like oh no no but

7202
02:01:36,310 --> 02:01:36,320
you know it's just like oh no no but
 

7203
02:01:36,320 --> 02:01:39,030
you know it's just like oh no no but
that's not no no no no that's like

7204
02:01:39,030 --> 02:01:39,040
that's not no no no no that's like
 

7205
02:01:39,040 --> 02:01:39,990
that's not no no no no that's like
saying

7206
02:01:39,990 --> 02:01:40,000

i'm happy

to accept that it might be wrong but

02:02:51,599 --> 02:02:53,270
to accept that it might be wrong but
what i would like to do is imagine a

7276
02:02:53,270 --> 02:02:53,280
what i would like to do is imagine a
 

7277
02:02:53,280 --> 02:02:54,790
what i would like to do is imagine a
universe where time is fundamental and

universe where time is fundamental and
 

7279
02:02:54,800 --> 02:02:56,470
universe where time is fundamental and
time is emergent

time is emergent
 

7281
02:02:56,480 --> 02:02:57,750
time is emergent
and ask

7282
02:02:57,750 --> 02:02:57,760
and ask
 

7283
02:02:57,760 --> 02:03:00,149
and ask
let's just then talk about causation

7284
02:03:00,149 --> 02:03:00,159
let's just then talk about causation
 

7285
02:03:00,159 --> 02:03:01,750
let's just then talk about causation
because physicists require that

7286
02:03:01,750 --> 02:03:01,760
because physicists require that
 

7287
02:03:01,760 --> 02:03:03,669
because physicists require that
causation so this is where i'm going to

7288
02:03:03,669 --> 02:03:03,679
causation so this is where i'm going to
 

7289
02:03:03,679 --> 02:03:06,790
causation so this is where i'm going to
go causation emerges

7290
02:03:06,790 --> 02:03:06,800
go causation emerges
 

7291
02:03:06,800 --> 02:03:08,390
go causation emerges
and it doesn't exist at the micro scale

that clearly is wrong because if

02:03:10,149 --> 02:03:10,159
that clearly is wrong because if
 

7295
02:03:10,159 --> 02:03:11,750
that clearly is wrong because if

about it in a newtonian way in a quantum
 

7331
02:03:45,199 --> 02:03:47,830
about it in a newtonian way in a quantum
way and i'll add on an arrow time

way and i'll add on an arrow time
 

7333
02:03:47,840 --> 02:03:49,990
way and i'll add on an arrow time
so i can label things

7334
02:03:49,990 --> 02:03:50,000
so i can label things
 

7335
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:51,510
so i can label things
and causation will happen magically

later well how explain causation

later well how explain causation
 

7339
02:03:54,719 --> 02:03:56,550
later well how explain causation
and they can't the only way i can

7340

and they can't the only way i can
 

7341
02:03:56,560 --> 02:03:58,390
and they can't the only way i can
reconcile causation

7342
02:03:58,390 --> 02:03:58,400
reconcile causation
 

7343
02:03:58,400 --> 02:04:00,470
reconcile causation

7368
02:04:24,390 --> 02:04:24,400
space
 

7369
02:04:24,400 --> 02:04:25,990
space
and again what am i saying to bring it

7370
02:04:25,990 --> 02:04:26,000
and again what am i saying to bring it
 

7371
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:27,030
and again what am i saying to bring it
back

7372
02:04:27,030 --> 02:04:27,040
back
 

7373
02:04:27,040 --> 02:04:28,310
back
i can say

7374
02:04:28,310 --> 02:04:28,320
i can say
 

7375
02:04:28,320 --> 02:04:30,310
i can say
without fear you know take this water

7376
02:04:30,310 --> 02:04:30,320
without fear you know take this water
 

7377
02:04:30,320 --> 02:04:31,990
without fear you know take this water
bottle and look at this water bottle and

7378
02:04:31,990 --> 02:04:32,000
bottle and look at this water bottle and
 

7379
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:32,950
bottle and look at this water bottle and
look at the features on it there's

7380
02:04:32,950 --> 02:04:32,960
look at the features on it there's
 

7381
02:04:32,960 --> 02:04:35,830
look at the features on it there's
writing you've got a load of them um i

7382
02:04:35,830 --> 02:04:35,840
writing you've got a load of them um i
 

7383
02:04:35,840 --> 02:04:36,950
writing you've got a load of them um i
know that

7384
02:04:36,950 --> 02:04:36,960
know that
 

7385
02:04:36,960 --> 02:04:38,629
know that
causal structures gave rise to this in

7386
02:04:38,629 --> 02:04:38,639
causal structures gave rise to this in
 

7387
02:04:38,639 --> 02:04:40,229
causal structures gave rise to this in
fact i'm not looking at just one water

7388
02:04:40,229 --> 02:04:40,239
fact i'm not looking at just one water
 

7389
02:04:40,239 --> 02:04:41,750
fact i'm not looking at just one water
bottle here i'm looking at every water

7390
02:04:41,750 --> 02:04:41,760
bottle here i'm looking at every water
 

7391
02:04:41,760 --> 02:04:43,189
bottle here i'm looking at every water
bowl has ever been conceived of by

this here is a special

7396
02:04:46,149 --> 02:04:46,159
this here is a special
 

7397
02:04:46,159 --> 02:04:48,310
this here is a special
object in fact leibniz knew this you

7398
02:04:48,310 --> 02:04:48,320
object in fact leibniz knew this you
 

7399
02:04:48,320 --> 02:04:51,189
object in fact leibniz knew this you
know leibniz um it was at the same time

7400
02:04:51,189 --> 02:04:51,199
know leibniz um it was at the same time
 

7401
02:04:51,199 --> 02:04:53,350
know leibniz um it was at the same time
of newton he kind of got stuck i think

7402
02:04:53,350 --> 02:04:53,360
of newton he kind of got stuck i think
 

7403
02:04:53,360 --> 02:04:55,030
of newton he kind of got stuck i think
leibniz actually invented assembly

7404
02:04:55,030 --> 02:04:55,040
leibniz actually invented assembly
 

7405
02:04:55,040 --> 02:04:57,669
leibniz actually invented assembly
theory he gave soul the soul that you

7406
02:04:57,669 --> 02:04:57,679
theory he gave soul the soul that you
 

7407
02:04:57,679 --> 02:05:00,069
theory he gave soul the soul that you
see in objects wasn't the mystical soul

7408
02:05:00,069 --> 02:05:00,079
see in objects wasn't the mystical soul
 

7409
02:05:00,079 --> 02:05:01,990
see in objects wasn't the mystical soul
it is assembly it is a fact there's been

7410
02:05:01,990 --> 02:05:02,000
it is assembly it is a fact there's been
 

7411
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:04,790
it is assembly it is a fact there's been
a history of objects related and without

7412
02:05:04,790 --> 02:05:04,800
a history of objects related and without
 

7413
02:05:04,800 --> 02:05:06,870
a history of objects related and without
without the object in the past this

7414
02:05:06,870 --> 02:05:06,880
without the object in the past this
 

7415
02:05:06,880 --> 02:05:09,990
without the object in the past this
object wouldn't exist there is a lineage

7416
02:05:09,990 --> 02:05:10,000
object wouldn't exist there is a lineage
 

7417
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:12,950
object wouldn't exist there is a lineage
and there is conserved structures causal

7418
02:05:12,950 --> 02:05:12,960
and there is conserved structures causal
 

7419
02:05:12,960 --> 02:05:16,950
and there is conserved structures causal
structures have given rise to those

7420
02:05:16,950 --> 02:05:16,960

 

7421
02:05:16,960 --> 02:05:18,870

fair enough and uh you're saying it's

7422
02:05:18,870 --> 02:05:18,880
fair enough and uh you're saying it's
 

7423
02:05:18,880 --> 02:05:21,430
fair enough and uh you're saying it's
just a simpler view if time

7424
02:05:21,430 --> 02:05:21,440
just a simpler view if time
 

7425
02:05:21,440 --> 02:05:23,910
just a simpler view if time
is fundamental and it and it shakes the

7426
02:05:23,910 --> 02:05:23,920
is fundamental and it and it shakes the
 

7427
02:05:23,920 --> 02:05:25,830
is fundamental and it and it shakes the
physicist's cage a bit right because i'm

7428
02:05:25,830 --> 02:05:25,840
physicist's cage a bit right because i'm
 

7429
02:05:25,840 --> 02:05:28,950
physicist's cage a bit right because i'm
gonna say but i think that

7430
02:05:28,950 --> 02:05:28,960
gonna say but i think that
 

7431
02:05:28,960 --> 02:05:31,189
gonna say but i think that
i i just i just enjoy the fact that

7432
02:05:31,189 --> 02:05:31,199
i i just i just enjoy the fact that
 

7433
02:05:31,199 --> 02:05:33,189
i i just i just enjoy the fact that
physicists are in cages i think that i

7434
02:05:33,189 --> 02:05:33,199
physicists are in cages i think that i
 

7435
02:05:33,199 --> 02:05:35,510
physicists are in cages i think that i
mean i would say that you know

7436
02:05:35,510 --> 02:05:35,520
mean i would say that you know
 

7437
02:05:35,520 --> 02:05:37,830
mean i would say that you know
lee smolin i don't want to speak for lee

7438
02:05:37,830 --> 02:05:37,840
lee smolin i don't want to speak for lee
 

7439
02:05:37,840 --> 02:05:40,390
lee smolin i don't want to speak for lee
i'm talking to lee about this i think

7440
02:05:40,390 --> 02:05:40,400
i'm talking to lee about this i think
 

7441
02:05:40,400 --> 02:05:42,310
i'm talking to lee about this i think
lee also is in agreement that time is

7442
02:05:42,310 --> 02:05:42,320
lee also is in agreement that time is
 

7443
02:05:42,320 --> 02:05:44,069
lee also is in agreement that time is
has to be fundamental but i think he

7444
02:05:44,069 --> 02:05:44,079
has to be fundamental but i think he
 

7445
02:05:44,079 --> 02:05:45,910
has to be fundamental but i think he
goes further you know

7446
02:05:45,910 --> 02:05:45,920
goes further you know
 

7447
02:05:45,920 --> 02:05:47,430
goes further you know
even in space i don't think you can go

7448
02:05:47,430 --> 02:05:47,440
even in space i don't think you can go
 

7449
02:05:47,440 --> 02:05:49,750
even in space i don't think you can go
back to the same place in space

7450
02:05:49,750 --> 02:05:49,760
back to the same place in space
 

7451
02:05:49,760 --> 02:05:51,350
back to the same place in space
i've been to austin a few times now this

7452
02:05:51,350 --> 02:05:51,360
i've been to austin a few times now this
 

7453
02:05:51,360 --> 02:05:52,229
i've been to austin a few times now this
is my

7454
02:05:52,229 --> 02:05:52,239
is my
 

7455
02:05:52,239 --> 02:05:53,990
is my
i think third time i've been to austin

7456
02:05:53,990 --> 02:05:54,000
i think third time i've been to austin
 

7457
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:56,149
i think third time i've been to austin
is austin in the same place no

7458
02:05:56,149 --> 02:05:56,159
is austin in the same place no
 

7459
02:05:56,159 --> 02:05:59,589
is austin in the same place no
the solar system is moving through space

7460
02:05:59,589 --> 02:05:59,599
the solar system is moving through space
 

7461
02:05:59,599 --> 02:06:02,470
the solar system is moving through space
i'm not back in the same space locally i

every event in the universe is unique

7466
02:06:07,669 --> 02:06:07,679
every event in the universe is unique
 

7467
02:06:07,679 --> 02:06:11,510
every event in the universe is unique

in space and time and time doesn't mean
 

7469
02:06:11,520 --> 02:06:14,790
in space and time and time doesn't mean
we can't go back though i i mean uh you

7470
02:06:14,790 --> 02:06:14,800
we can't go back though i i mean uh you
 

7471
02:06:14,800 --> 02:06:16,709
we can't go back though i i mean uh you
know i mean let's just

7472
02:06:16,709 --> 02:06:16,719
know i mean let's just
 

7473
02:06:16,719 --> 02:06:18,709
know i mean let's just
you know rest this conversation which

7474
02:06:18,709 --> 02:06:18,719
you know rest this conversation which
 

7475
02:06:18,719 --> 02:06:19,430
you know rest this conversation which
was

7476
02:06:19,430 --> 02:06:19,440
was
 

7477
02:06:19,440 --> 02:06:20,470
was
beautiful

7478
02:06:20,470 --> 02:06:20,480
beautiful
 

7479
02:06:20,480 --> 02:06:22,470
beautiful
uh with a quote from the rolling stones

7480
02:06:22,470 --> 02:06:22,480
uh with a quote from the rolling stones
 

7481
02:06:22,480 --> 02:06:24,310
uh with a quote from the rolling stones
that uh you can't always get what you

7482
02:06:24,310 --> 02:06:24,320
that uh you can't always get what you
 

7483
02:06:24,320 --> 02:06:26,470
that uh you can't always get what you
want which is you want time to be

7484
02:06:26,470 --> 02:06:26,480
want which is you want time to be
 

7485
02:06:26,480 --> 02:06:27,669
want which is you want time to be
fundamental

7486
02:06:27,669 --> 02:06:27,679
fundamental
 

7487
02:06:27,679 --> 02:06:29,990
fundamental
but if you try you'll get what you need

7488
02:06:29,990 --> 02:06:30,000
but if you try you'll get what you need
 

7489
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:31,990
but if you try you'll get what you need
which is assembly theory

7490
02:06:31,990 --> 02:06:32,000
which is assembly theory
 

7491
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:34,629
which is assembly theory
okay let me ask you about continue

7492
02:06:34,629 --> 02:06:34,639
okay let me ask you about continue
 

7493
02:06:34,639 --> 02:06:36,709
okay let me ask you about continue
talking about complexity

7494
02:06:36,709 --> 02:06:36,719
talking about complexity
 

7495
02:06:36,719 --> 02:06:38,470
talking about complexity
and uh

7496
02:06:38,470 --> 02:06:38,480
and uh
 

7497
02:06:38,480 --> 02:06:40,709
and uh
to clarify with this

7498
02:06:40,709 --> 02:06:40,719
to clarify with this
 

7499
02:06:40,719 --> 02:06:42,870
to clarify with this
beautiful theory of yours that you're

7500
02:06:42,870 --> 02:06:42,880
beautiful theory of yours that you're
 

7501
02:06:42,880 --> 02:06:44,709
beautiful theory of yours that you're
developing and i'm sure we'll continue

7502
02:06:44,709 --> 02:06:44,719
developing and i'm sure we'll continue
 

7503
02:06:44,719 --> 02:06:48,629
developing and i'm sure we'll continue
developing both in the lab and in theory

7504
02:06:48,629 --> 02:06:48,639
developing both in the lab and in theory
 

7505
02:06:48,639 --> 02:06:49,589
developing both in the lab and in theory
um

7506
02:06:49,589 --> 02:06:49,599
um
 

7507
02:06:49,599 --> 02:06:50,629
um
yeah it's

7508
02:06:50,629 --> 02:06:50,639
yeah it's
 

7509
02:06:50,639 --> 02:06:52,149
yeah it's
can't be said enough

7510
02:06:52,149 --> 02:06:52,159
can't be said enough
 

7511
02:06:52,159 --> 02:06:54,390
can't be said enough
just the ideas you're playing with in

7512
02:06:54,390 --> 02:06:54,400
just the ideas you're playing with in
 

7513
02:06:54,400 --> 02:06:55,910
just the ideas you're playing with in
your head are just

7514
02:06:55,910 --> 02:06:55,920
your head are just
 

7515
02:06:55,920 --> 02:06:57,109
your head are just
and we've been talking about are just

7516
02:06:57,109 --> 02:06:57,119
and we've been talking about are just
 

7517
02:06:57,119 --> 02:06:59,109
and we've been talking about are just
beautiful so if we talk about complexity

7518
02:06:59,109 --> 02:06:59,119
beautiful so if we talk about complexity
 

7519
02:06:59,119 --> 02:07:02,550
beautiful so if we talk about complexity
a little bit more generally

7520
02:07:02,550 --> 02:07:02,560

 

7521
02:07:02,560 --> 02:07:05,750

maybe in an admiring romantic way how

7522
02:07:05,750 --> 02:07:05,760
maybe in an admiring romantic way how
 

7523
02:07:05,760 --> 02:07:09,030
maybe in an admiring romantic way how
does complexity emerge from simple rules

7524
02:07:09,030 --> 02:07:09,040
does complexity emerge from simple rules
 

7525
02:07:09,040 --> 02:07:11,189
does complexity emerge from simple rules
the why the how

7526
02:07:11,189 --> 02:07:11,199
the why the how
 

7527
02:07:11,199 --> 02:07:13,990
the why the how
okay the nice algorithm of assembly is

7528
02:07:13,990 --> 02:07:14,000
okay the nice algorithm of assembly is
 

7529
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:14,790
okay the nice algorithm of assembly is
there

7530
02:07:14,790 --> 02:07:14,800
there
 

7531
02:07:14,800 --> 02:07:16,790
there
i would say that the problem i have

7532
02:07:16,790 --> 02:07:16,800
i would say that the problem i have
 

7533
02:07:16,800 --> 02:07:18,390
i would say that the problem i have
right now is i mean you're right we can

7534
02:07:18,390 --> 02:07:18,400
right now is i mean you're right we can
 

7535
02:07:18,400 --> 02:07:20,069
right now is i mean you're right we can
about time as well

7536
02:07:20,069 --> 02:07:20,079
about time as well
 

7537
02:07:20,079 --> 02:07:21,430
about time as well
the problem is i have this hammer called

7538
02:07:21,430 --> 02:07:21,440
the problem is i have this hammer called
 

7539
02:07:21,440 --> 02:07:22,470
the problem is i have this hammer called
assembly

7540
02:07:22,470 --> 02:07:22,480
assembly
 

7541
02:07:22,480 --> 02:07:24,390
assembly
and everything i see is a nail

7542
02:07:24,390 --> 02:07:24,400
and everything i see is a nail
 

7543
02:07:24,400 --> 02:07:25,350
and everything i see is a nail
so now

7544
02:07:25,350 --> 02:07:25,360
so now
 

7545
02:07:25,360 --> 02:07:27,109
so now
let's just apply it to all sorts of

02:07:27,109 --> 02:07:27,119
let's just apply it to all sorts of
 

7547
02:07:27,119 --> 02:07:28,709
let's just apply it to all sorts of
things we take the bernard instability

7548
02:07:28,709 --> 02:07:28,719
things we take the bernard instability
 

7549
02:07:28,719 --> 02:07:31,430
things we take the bernard instability
the bernard instability is you have oil

7550
02:07:31,430 --> 02:07:31,440
the bernard instability is you have oil
 

7551
02:07:31,440 --> 02:07:33,669
the bernard instability is you have oil
uh if you heat up oil

7552
02:07:33,669 --> 02:07:33,679
uh if you heat up oil
 

7553
02:07:33,679 --> 02:07:35,270
uh if you heat up oil
let's say on a frying pan when you get

7554
02:07:35,270 --> 02:07:35,280
let's say on a frying pan when you get
 

7555
02:07:35,280 --> 02:07:37,350
let's say on a frying pan when you get
convection you get honeycomb patterns

7556
02:07:37,350 --> 02:07:37,360
convection you get honeycomb patterns
 

7557
02:07:37,360 --> 02:07:39,589
convection you get honeycomb patterns
take the formation of snowflakes

on assembly is entropy tells you how

7594
02:08:14,950 --> 02:08:14,960
on assembly is entropy tells you how
 

7595
02:08:14,960 --> 02:08:16,229
on assembly is entropy tells you how
much you've lost

7596

much you've lost
 

7597
02:08:16,239 --> 02:08:17,669
much you've lost
it doesn't tell you the microstates are

7598
02:08:17,669 --> 02:08:17,679
it doesn't tell you the microstates are
 

7599
02:08:17,679 --> 02:08:18,629
it doesn't tell you the microstates are
gone

7600
02:08:18,629 --> 02:08:18,639
gone
 

7601
02:08:18,639 --> 02:08:20,790
gone
but if you embrace the go the bottom up

7602
02:08:20,790 --> 02:08:20,800
but if you embrace the go the bottom up
 

7603
02:08:20,800 --> 02:08:23,830
but if you embrace the go the bottom up
with assembly those states and you you

7604
02:08:23,830 --> 02:08:23,840
with assembly those states and you you
 

7605
02:08:23,840 --> 02:08:26,149
with assembly those states and you you
you then understand the causal chain

7606
02:08:26,149 --> 02:08:26,159
you then understand the causal chain
 

7607
02:08:26,159 --> 02:08:28,870
you then understand the causal chain
that gives rise to the emergence so what

7608
02:08:28,870 --> 02:08:28,880
that gives rise to the emergence so what
 

7609
02:08:28,880 --> 02:08:29,910
that gives rise to the emergence so what
i think

7610
02:08:29,910 --> 02:08:29,920
i think
 

7611
02:08:29,920 --> 02:08:32,149
i think
assembly will help us do is understand

7612
02:08:32,149 --> 02:08:32,159
assembly will help us do is understand
 

7613
02:08:32,159 --> 02:08:34,229
assembly will help us do is understand
weak emergence at very least

7614
02:08:34,229 --> 02:08:34,239
weak emergence at very least
 

7615
02:08:34,239 --> 02:08:36,870
weak emergence at very least
and maybe allow us to

7616
02:08:36,870 --> 02:08:36,880
and maybe allow us to
 

7617
02:08:36,880 --> 02:08:39,510
and maybe allow us to

02:09:49,510 --> 02:09:49,520
so whether it's like you know
 

7691
02:09:49,520 --> 02:09:51,109
so whether it's like you know
if you take some particles and put them

7692
02:09:51,109 --> 02:09:51,119
if you take some particles and put them
 

7693
02:09:51,119 --> 02:09:52,470
if you take some particles and put them
in a box

7694
02:09:52,470 --> 02:09:52,480
in a box
 

7695
02:09:52,480 --> 02:09:54,350
in a box
at a certain box size you get

7696
02:09:54,350 --> 02:09:54,360
at a certain box size you get
 

7697
02:09:54,360 --> 02:09:56,870
at a certain box size you get
quasi-crystallinity coming out right

7698
02:09:56,870 --> 02:09:56,880
quasi-crystallinity coming out right
 

7699
02:09:56,880 --> 02:09:59,109
quasi-crystallinity coming out right
but that quite that emergence

7700
02:09:59,109 --> 02:09:59,119
but that quite that emergence
 

7701
02:09:59,119 --> 02:10:00,390
but that quite that emergence
it's not magic

7702
02:10:00,390 --> 02:10:00,400
it's not magic
 

7703
02:10:00,400 --> 02:10:01,910
it's not magic
it must come from the boundary

7704
02:10:01,910 --> 02:10:01,920
it must come from the boundary
 

7705
02:10:01,920 --> 02:10:03,589
it must come from the boundary
conditions you put in

7706
02:10:03,589 --> 02:10:03,599
conditions you put in
 

7707
02:10:03,599 --> 02:10:04,950
conditions you put in
so all i'm saying is a lot of the

7708
02:10:04,950 --> 02:10:04,960
so all i'm saying is a lot of the
 

7709
02:10:04,960 --> 02:10:06,950
so all i'm saying is a lot of the
complexity that we see

7710
02:10:06,950 --> 02:10:06,960
complexity that we see
 

7711
02:10:06,960 --> 02:10:09,750
complexity that we see
is a direct read of the constraints we

7712
02:10:09,750 --> 02:10:09,760
is a direct read of the constraints we
 

7713
02:10:09,760 --> 02:10:11,990
is a direct read of the constraints we
put in but we just don't understand so

7714
02:10:11,990 --> 02:10:12,000
put in but we just don't understand so
 

7715
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:13,589
put in but we just don't understand so
as i said earlier to the poor origin of

7716
02:10:13,589 --> 02:10:13,599
as i said earlier to the poor origin of
 

7717
02:10:13,599 --> 02:10:15,750
as i said earlier to the poor origin of
life chemists you know

7718
02:10:15,750 --> 02:10:15,760
life chemists you know
 

7719
02:10:15,760 --> 02:10:17,750
life chemists you know
origin of life is a scam i would say

7720
02:10:17,750 --> 02:10:17,760
origin of life is a scam i would say
 

7721
02:10:17,760 --> 02:10:20,149
origin of life is a scam i would say
lots of complexity calculation theories

7722
02:10:20,149 --> 02:10:20,159
lots of complexity calculation theories
 

7723
02:10:20,159 --> 02:10:22,069
lots of complexity calculation theories
a bit of a scam because we put the

7724
02:10:22,069 --> 02:10:22,079
a bit of a scam because we put the
 

7725
02:10:22,079 --> 02:10:23,589
a bit of a scam because we put the
constraints in but we don't count them

7726
02:10:23,589 --> 02:10:23,599
constraints in but we don't count them
 

7727
02:10:23,599 --> 02:10:25,109
constraints in but we don't count them
correctly

7728
02:10:25,109 --> 02:10:25,119
correctly
 

7729
02:10:25,119 --> 02:10:26,790
correctly
and i'm wondering if oh

7730
02:10:26,790 --> 02:10:26,800
and i'm wondering if oh
 

7731
02:10:26,800 --> 02:10:28,790
and i'm wondering if oh
you're thinking and starting to drop as

7732
02:10:28,790 --> 02:10:28,800
you're thinking and starting to drop as
 

7733
02:10:28,800 --> 02:10:31,750
you're thinking and starting to drop as
an assembly theory uh something index is

7734
02:10:31,750 --> 02:10:31,760
an assembly theory uh something index is
 

7735
02:10:31,760 --> 02:10:33,510
an assembly theory uh something index is
a way to counter the constraints yes

7736
02:10:33,510 --> 02:10:33,520
a way to counter the constraints yes
 

7737
02:10:33,520 --> 02:10:35,669
a way to counter the constraints yes
that's it it's all it is so assembly

7738
02:10:35,669 --> 02:10:35,679
that's it it's all it is so assembly
 

7739
02:10:35,679 --> 02:10:38,069
that's it it's all it is so assembly
theory doesn't do doesn't lower any of

7740
02:10:38,069 --> 02:10:38,079
theory doesn't do doesn't lower any of
 

7741
02:10:38,079 --> 02:10:40,069
theory doesn't do doesn't lower any of
the importance of complexity theory but

7742
02:10:40,069 --> 02:10:40,079
the importance of complexity theory but
 

7743
02:10:40,079 --> 02:10:42,149
the importance of complexity theory but
it allows us to go across domains and

7744
02:10:42,149 --> 02:10:42,159
it allows us to go across domains and
 

7745
02:10:42,159 --> 02:10:44,790
it allows us to go across domains and
start to compare things compare the

7746
02:10:44,790 --> 02:10:44,800
start to compare things compare the
 

7747
02:10:44,800 --> 02:10:46,229
start to compare things compare the
complexity of a molecule of a

7748
02:10:46,229 --> 02:10:46,239
complexity of a molecule of a
 

7749

02:10:53,350 --> 02:10:53,360
of this of the music you may compose
 

7753
02:10:53,360 --> 02:10:56,149

you've tweeted quote assembly theory

7754
02:10:56,149 --> 02:10:56,159
you've tweeted quote assembly theory
 

7755
02:10:56,159 --> 02:10:58,550
you've tweeted quote assembly theory
explains why nietzsche understood with

7756
02:10:58,550 --> 02:10:58,560
explains why nietzsche understood with
 

7757
02:10:58,560 --> 02:11:00,470
explains why nietzsche understood with
limited freedom rather than radical

7758
02:11:00,470 --> 02:11:00,480
limited freedom rather than radical
 

7759
02:11:00,480 --> 02:11:01,750
limited freedom rather than radical
freedom

7760
02:11:01,750 --> 02:11:01,760
freedom
 

7761
02:11:01,760 --> 02:11:03,510
freedom
so we've applied assembly theory to

7762
02:11:03,510 --> 02:11:03,520
so we've applied assembly theory to
 

7763
02:11:03,520 --> 02:11:06,390
so we've applied assembly theory to
cellular automata in life and chemistry

7764
02:11:06,390 --> 02:11:06,400
cellular automata in life and chemistry
 

7765
02:11:06,400 --> 02:11:08,790
cellular automata in life and chemistry
um what does nietzsche have to do with

7766
02:11:08,790 --> 02:11:08,800
um what does nietzsche have to do with
 

7767
02:11:08,800 --> 02:11:10,790
um what does nietzsche have to do with
uh somebody oh that gets me into free

7768
02:11:10,790 --> 02:11:10,800
uh somebody oh that gets me into free
 

7769
02:11:10,800 --> 02:11:13,030
uh somebody oh that gets me into free
will and everything

7770
02:11:13,030 --> 02:11:13,040
will and everything
 

7771
02:11:13,040 --> 02:11:15,030
will and everything
so let me say that again assembly theory

7772
02:11:15,030 --> 02:11:15,040
so let me say that again assembly theory
 

7773
02:11:15,040 --> 02:11:16,950
so let me say that again assembly theory
explains why nietzsche understood we had

7774
02:11:16,950 --> 02:11:16,960
explains why nietzsche understood we had
 

7775
02:11:16,960 --> 02:11:18,390
explains why nietzsche understood we had
limited freedom

7776
02:11:18,390 --> 02:11:18,400
limited freedom
 

7777
02:11:18,400 --> 02:11:20,790
limited freedom
rather than radical freedom limited

7778
02:11:20,790 --> 02:11:20,800
rather than radical freedom limited
 

7779
02:11:20,800 --> 02:11:22,790
rather than radical freedom limited
freedom freedom i suppose is referring

7780
02:11:22,790 --> 02:11:22,800
freedom freedom i suppose is referring
 

7781
02:11:22,800 --> 02:11:25,030
freedom freedom i suppose is referring
to the fact that there's constraints

7782
02:11:25,030 --> 02:11:25,040
to the fact that there's constraints
 

7783
02:11:25,040 --> 02:11:26,870
to the fact that there's constraints
or um

7784
02:11:26,870 --> 02:11:26,880
or um
 

7785
02:11:26,880 --> 02:11:29,990
or um
what is radical freedom what is freedom

7786
02:11:29,990 --> 02:11:30,000
what is radical freedom what is freedom
 

7787
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:32,790
what is radical freedom what is freedom
so sartre was like believed in absolute

7788
02:11:32,790 --> 02:11:32,800
so sartre was like believed in absolute
 

7789
02:11:32,800 --> 02:11:33,750
so sartre was like believed in absolute
freedom

7790
02:11:33,750 --> 02:11:33,760
freedom
 

7791
02:11:33,760 --> 02:11:35,589
freedom
um and that he could do whatever he

7792
02:11:35,589 --> 02:11:35,599
um and that he could do whatever he
 

7793
02:11:35,599 --> 02:11:38,550
um and that he could do whatever he
wanted in his imagination

7794
02:11:38,550 --> 02:11:38,560
wanted in his imagination
 

7795
02:11:38,560 --> 02:11:41,189
wanted in his imagination
and nietzsche understood that his

7796
02:11:41,189 --> 02:11:41,199
and nietzsche understood that his
 

7797
02:11:41,199 --> 02:11:43,910
and nietzsche understood that his
freedom was somewhat more limited

7798
02:11:43,910 --> 02:11:43,920
freedom was somewhat more limited
 

7799
02:11:43,920 --> 02:11:45,350
freedom was somewhat more limited
and it kind of takes me back to this

7800
02:11:45,350 --> 02:11:45,360
and it kind of takes me back to this
 

7801
02:11:45,360 --> 02:11:47,189
and it kind of takes me back to this
computer game that i played when i was

7802
02:11:47,189 --> 02:11:47,199
computer game that i played when i was
 

7803
02:11:47,199 --> 02:11:50,870
computer game that i played when i was
10. so i think it's called dragon's lair

7804
02:11:50,870 --> 02:11:50,880
10. so i think it's called dragon's lair
 

7805
02:11:50,880 --> 02:11:53,030
10. so i think it's called dragon's lair
okay do you know dragon slayer i think i

7806
02:11:53,030 --> 02:11:53,040
okay do you know dragon slayer i think i
 

7807
02:11:53,040 --> 02:11:54,950
okay do you know dragon slayer i think i
know dragons there yeah dragon slayer i

7808
02:11:54,950 --> 02:11:54,960
know dragons there yeah dragon slayer i
 

7809
02:11:54,960 --> 02:11:56,629
know dragons there yeah dragon slayer i
knew i was being conned right dragon's

7810
02:11:56,629 --> 02:11:56,639
knew i was being conned right dragon's
 

7811
02:11:56,639 --> 02:11:58,229
knew i was being conned right dragon's
lair when you play the game you're lucky

7812
02:11:58,229 --> 02:11:58,239
lair when you play the game you're lucky
 

7813
02:11:58,239 --> 02:11:59,669
lair when you play the game you're lucky
that you grew up in a basically

7814
02:11:59,669 --> 02:11:59,679
that you grew up in a basically
 

7815
02:11:59,679 --> 02:12:01,750
that you grew up in a basically
procedurally generated worlds that was

7816
02:12:01,750 --> 02:12:01,760
procedurally generated worlds that was
 

7817
02:12:01,760 --> 02:12:04,629
procedurally generated worlds that was
rpg a little bit no it's like uh is it

7818
02:12:04,629 --> 02:12:04,639
rpg a little bit no it's like uh is it
 

7819
02:12:04,639 --> 02:12:06,950
rpg a little bit no it's like uh is it
turn-based play was it it was a it was a

7820
02:12:06,950 --> 02:12:06,960
turn-based play was it it was a it was a
 

7821
02:12:06,960 --> 02:12:08,709
turn-based play was it it was a it was a
role-playing game but really good

7822
02:12:08,709 --> 02:12:08,719
role-playing game but really good
 

7823
02:12:08,719 --> 02:12:11,510
role-playing game but really good
graphics and won the first laserdiscs

7824
02:12:11,510 --> 02:12:11,520
graphics and won the first laserdiscs
 

7825
02:12:11,520 --> 02:12:13,430
graphics and won the first laserdiscs
and when you actually flicked the stick

7826
02:12:13,430 --> 02:12:13,440
and when you actually flicked the stick
 

7827
02:12:13,440 --> 02:12:15,030
and when you actually flicked the stick
you you took it's like it was like a

7828
02:12:15,030 --> 02:12:15,040
you you took it's like it was like a
 

7829
02:12:15,040 --> 02:12:17,830
you you took it's like it was like a
graphical adventure game with animation

7830
02:12:17,830 --> 02:12:17,840
graphical adventure game with animation
 

7831
02:12:17,840 --> 02:12:19,270
graphical adventure game with animation
yeah and when i played this game i

7832
02:12:19,270 --> 02:12:19,280
yeah and when i played this game i
 

7833
02:12:19,280 --> 02:12:20,470
yeah and when i played this game i
really you know you could get through

7834
02:12:20,470 --> 02:12:20,480
really you know you could get through
 

7835
02:12:20,480 --> 02:12:22,550
really you know you could get through
the game in 12 minutes if you knew what

7836
02:12:22,550 --> 02:12:22,560
the game in 12 minutes if you knew what
 

7837
02:12:22,560 --> 02:12:23,750
the game in 12 minutes if you knew what
you were doing for not making mistakes

7838
02:12:23,750 --> 02:12:23,760
you were doing for not making mistakes
 

7839
02:12:23,760 --> 02:12:25,830
you were doing for not making mistakes
just play the display display disc so it

7840
02:12:25,830 --> 02:12:25,840
just play the display display disc so it
 

7841
02:12:25,840 --> 02:12:28,149
just play the display display disc so it
was just about timing and actually was a

7842
02:12:28,149 --> 02:12:28,159
was just about timing and actually was a
 

7843
02:12:28,159 --> 02:12:31,109
was just about timing and actually was a
complete fraud because all the animation

7844
02:12:31,109 --> 02:12:31,119
complete fraud because all the animation
 

7845
02:12:31,119 --> 02:12:33,430
complete fraud because all the animation
has been pre-recorded on the disk yeah

7846
02:12:33,430 --> 02:12:33,440
has been pre-recorded on the disk yeah
 

7847
02:12:33,440 --> 02:12:35,430
has been pre-recorded on the disk yeah
it's like the black mirror the first

7848
02:12:35,430 --> 02:12:35,440
it's like the black mirror the first
 

7849
02:12:35,440 --> 02:12:37,030
it's like the black mirror the first

02:12:37,030 --> 02:12:37,040
interactive where they had all the you
 

7851
02:12:37,040 --> 02:12:39,669
interactive where they had all the you
know several million uh kind of uh

7852
02:12:39,669 --> 02:12:39,679
know several million uh kind of uh

permutations of the movie that you could

7854
02:12:41,669 --> 02:12:41,679
permutations of the movie that you could
 

7855
02:12:41,679 --> 02:12:43,189
permutations of the movie that you could
select on netflix i've forgotten the

7856
02:12:43,189 --> 02:12:43,199
select on netflix i've forgotten the
 

7857
02:12:43,199 --> 02:12:44,550
select on netflix i've forgotten the
name of it

7858
02:12:44,550 --> 02:12:44,560
name of it
 

7859
02:12:44,560 --> 02:12:46,950
name of it
so this was a exactly that in the

7860
02:12:46,950 --> 02:12:46,960
so this was a exactly that in the
 

7861
02:12:46,960 --> 02:12:48,470
so this was a exactly that in the
laserdisc so you basically go left go

7862
02:12:48,470 --> 02:12:48,480
laserdisc so you basically go left go
 

7863
02:12:48,480 --> 02:12:49,270
laserdisc so you basically go left go
right

7864
02:12:49,270 --> 02:12:49,280
right
 

7865
02:12:49,280 --> 02:12:50,790

02:12:52,709 --> 02:12:52,719
slay the dragon and when you flick the
 

7869
02:12:52,719 --> 02:12:54,229
slay the dragon and when you flick the
joystick at the right time it just goes

7870
02:12:54,229 --> 02:12:54,239
joystick at the right time it just goes
 

7871
02:12:54,239 --> 02:12:56,069
joystick at the right time it just goes
to the next animation to play yeah it's

7872
02:12:56,069 --> 02:12:56,079
to the next animation to play yeah it's
 

7873
02:12:56,079 --> 02:12:58,069
to the next animation to play yeah it's
not really generating it yeah and i

7874
02:12:58,069 --> 02:12:58,079
not really generating it yeah and i
 

7875
02:12:58,079 --> 02:12:59,750
not really generating it yeah and i
played that game and i knew i was being

7876
02:12:59,750 --> 02:12:59,760
played that game and i knew i was being
 

7877
02:12:59,760 --> 02:13:03,109
played that game and i knew i was being
had

7878
02:13:03,109 --> 02:13:03,119

 

7879
02:13:03,119 --> 02:13:05,030

so to you

7880
02:13:05,030 --> 02:13:05,040
so to you
 

7881
02:13:05,040 --> 02:13:06,709
so to you
uh dragon lair is the first time you

7882
02:13:06,709 --> 02:13:06,719
uh dragon lair is the first time you
 

7883
02:13:06,719 --> 02:13:09,589
uh dragon lair is the first time you
realize that free will is an illusion

7884
02:13:09,589 --> 02:13:09,599
realize that free will is an illusion
 

7885
02:13:09,599 --> 02:13:11,109
realize that free will is an illusion
yeah

7886
02:13:11,109 --> 02:13:11,119
yeah
 

7887
02:13:11,119 --> 02:13:11,990
yeah
and

7888
02:13:11,990 --> 02:13:12,000
and
 

7889
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:14,390
and
why why not does assembly theory give

7890
02:13:14,390 --> 02:13:14,400
why why not does assembly theory give
 

7891
02:13:14,400 --> 02:13:16,069
why why not does assembly theory give
you hints about free will whether it's

7892
02:13:16,069 --> 02:13:16,079
you hints about free will whether it's
 

7893
02:13:16,079 --> 02:13:18,310
you hints about free will whether it's
an illusion or not yeah so no so not

7894
02:13:18,310 --> 02:13:18,320
an illusion or not yeah so no so not
 

7895
02:13:18,320 --> 02:13:21,189
an illusion or not yeah so no so not
tightly if i do think i have some will

7896
02:13:21,189 --> 02:13:21,199
tightly if i do think i have some will
 

7897
02:13:21,199 --> 02:13:23,109
tightly if i do think i have some will
and i think i am an agent and i think i

7898
02:13:23,109 --> 02:13:23,119
and i think i am an agent and i think i
 

7899
02:13:23,119 --> 02:13:24,870
and i think i am an agent and i think i
can interact and i can play around with

7900
02:13:24,870 --> 02:13:24,880
can interact and i can play around with
 

7901
02:13:24,880 --> 02:13:26,950
can interact and i can play around with
my with the models i have of the world

7902
02:13:26,950 --> 02:13:26,960
my with the models i have of the world
 

7903
02:13:26,960 --> 02:13:28,550
my with the models i have of the world
and the cost functions right and i can

7904
02:13:28,550 --> 02:13:28,560
and the cost functions right and i can
 

7905
02:13:28,560 --> 02:13:30,629
and the cost functions right and i can
hack my own cost functions which means i

7906
02:13:30,629 --> 02:13:30,639
hack my own cost functions which means i
 

7907
02:13:30,639 --> 02:13:33,189
hack my own cost functions which means i
have a little bit of free will but

7908
02:13:33,189 --> 02:13:33,199
have a little bit of free will but
 

7909
02:13:33,199 --> 02:13:34,709
have a little bit of free will but
as much as i want to do stuff in the

7910
02:13:34,709 --> 02:13:34,719
as much as i want to do stuff in the
 

7911
02:13:34,719 --> 02:13:36,310
as much as i want to do stuff in the
universe i don't think i could suddenly

7912
02:13:36,310 --> 02:13:36,320
universe i don't think i could suddenly
 

7913
02:13:36,320 --> 02:13:37,109
universe i don't think i could suddenly
say

7914
02:13:37,109 --> 02:13:37,119
say
 

7915
02:13:37,119 --> 02:13:38,390
say
i mean actually this is ridiculous

7916
02:13:38,390 --> 02:13:38,400
i mean actually this is ridiculous
 

7917
02:13:38,400 --> 02:13:39,589
i mean actually this is ridiculous
because now i say i could try and do it

7918
02:13:39,589 --> 02:13:39,599
because now i say i could try and do it
 

7919
02:13:39,599 --> 02:13:40,790
because now i say i could try and do it
right it's like i'm suddenly give up

7920
02:13:40,790 --> 02:13:40,800
right it's like i'm suddenly give up
 

7921
02:13:40,800 --> 02:13:42,950
right it's like i'm suddenly give up
everything and become a rapper tomorrow

7922
02:13:42,950 --> 02:13:42,960
everything and become a rapper tomorrow
 

7923
02:13:42,960 --> 02:13:45,990
everything and become a rapper tomorrow
right maybe i i could try that but i

7924
02:13:45,990 --> 02:13:46,000
right maybe i i could try that but i
 

7925
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:49,030
right maybe i i could try that but i
don't have sufficient um agency to make

7926
02:13:49,030 --> 02:13:49,040
don't have sufficient um agency to make
 

7927
02:13:49,040 --> 02:13:50,229
don't have sufficient um agency to make
that necessarily happen i'm on a

7928
02:13:50,229 --> 02:13:50,239
that necessarily happen i'm on a
 

7929
02:13:50,239 --> 02:13:52,390
that necessarily happen i'm on a
trajectory so when in dragon's lair i

7930
02:13:52,390 --> 02:13:52,400
trajectory so when in dragon's lair i
 

7931
02:13:52,400 --> 02:13:54,950
trajectory so when in dragon's lair i
know that i have some trajectories that

7932
02:13:54,950 --> 02:13:54,960
know that i have some trajectories that
 

7933
02:13:54,960 --> 02:13:56,390
know that i have some trajectories that
i can play with

7934
02:13:56,390 --> 02:13:56,400
i can play with
 

7935
02:13:56,400 --> 02:13:58,790
i can play with
where where sartre realized he thought

7936
02:13:58,790 --> 02:13:58,800
where where sartre realized he thought
 

7937
02:13:58,800 --> 02:14:00,790
where where sartre realized he thought
that he had no assembly no memory he

7938
02:14:00,790 --> 02:14:00,800
that he had no assembly no memory he
 

7939
02:14:00,800 --> 02:14:03,270
that he had no assembly no memory he
could just leap across and do everything

7940
02:14:03,270 --> 02:14:03,280
could just leap across and do everything
 

7941
02:14:03,280 --> 02:14:05,270
could just leap across and do everything
and nietzsche said okay

7942
02:14:05,270 --> 02:14:05,280
and nietzsche said okay
 

7943
02:14:05,280 --> 02:14:07,510
and nietzsche said okay
i realize i don't have full freedom but

7944
02:14:07,510 --> 02:14:07,520
i realize i don't have full freedom but
 

7945
02:14:07,520 --> 02:14:09,189
i realize i don't have full freedom but
i have some freedom

7946
02:14:09,189 --> 02:14:09,199
i have some freedom
 

7947
02:14:09,199 --> 02:14:10,790
i have some freedom
and i and the assembly theory basically

7948
02:14:10,790 --> 02:14:10,800
and i and the assembly theory basically
 

7949
02:14:10,800 --> 02:14:12,870
and i and the assembly theory basically
says that it says if you have these

7950
02:14:12,870 --> 02:14:12,880
says that it says if you have these
 

7951
02:14:12,880 --> 02:14:14,790
says that it says if you have these
constraints in your past they limit what

7952
02:14:14,790 --> 02:14:14,800
constraints in your past they limit what
 

7953
02:14:14,800 --> 02:14:16,470
constraints in your past they limit what
you were able to do in the future but

7954
02:14:16,470 --> 02:14:16,480
you were able to do in the future but
 

7955
02:14:16,480 --> 02:14:19,109
you were able to do in the future but
you can use them to do amazing things

7956
02:14:19,109 --> 02:14:19,119
you can use them to do amazing things
 

7957
02:14:19,119 --> 02:14:21,430
you can use them to do amazing things
let's say i'm a poppy plant and i'm

7958
02:14:21,430 --> 02:14:21,440
let's say i'm a poppy plant and i'm
 

7959
02:14:21,440 --> 02:14:23,750
let's say i'm a poppy plant and i'm
creating some opiates

7960
02:14:23,750 --> 02:14:23,760
creating some opiates
 

7961
02:14:23,760 --> 02:14:25,589
creating some opiates
opiates are really interesting molecules

7962
02:14:25,589 --> 02:14:25,599
opiates are really interesting molecules
 

7963
02:14:25,599 --> 02:14:27,030
opiates are really interesting molecules
i mean they're obviously great for

7964
02:14:27,030 --> 02:14:27,040
i mean they're obviously great for
 

7965
02:14:27,040 --> 02:14:28,709
i mean they're obviously great for
medicine great product cause great

7966
02:14:28,709 --> 02:14:28,719
medicine great product cause great
 

7967
02:14:28,719 --> 02:14:30,550
medicine great product cause great
problems in society but let's let's

7968
02:14:30,550 --> 02:14:30,560
problems in society but let's let's
 

7969
02:14:30,560 --> 02:14:33,350
problems in society but let's let's
imagine we fast forward a billion years

7970
02:14:33,350 --> 02:14:33,360
imagine we fast forward a billion years
 

7971
02:14:33,360 --> 02:14:36,470
imagine we fast forward a billion years
what will opiate the opioids look like

7972
02:14:36,470 --> 02:14:36,480
what will opiate the opioids look like
 

7973
02:14:36,480 --> 02:14:38,390
what will opiate the opioids look like
in a billion years well we can guess

7974
02:14:38,390 --> 02:14:38,400
in a billion years well we can guess
 

7975
02:14:38,400 --> 02:14:40,069
in a billion years well we can guess
because we can see how those proteins

7976
02:14:40,069 --> 02:14:40,079
because we can see how those proteins
 

7977
02:14:40,079 --> 02:14:41,990
because we can see how those proteins
will evolve and we can see how the

7978
02:14:41,990 --> 02:14:42,000
will evolve and we can see how the
 

7979
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:44,310
will evolve and we can see how the
secondary metabolites will change

7980
02:14:44,310 --> 02:14:44,320
secondary metabolites will change
 

7981
02:14:44,320 --> 02:14:46,629
secondary metabolites will change
and but they can't go radical they can't

7982
02:14:46,629 --> 02:14:46,639
and but they can't go radical they can't
 

7983
02:14:46,639 --> 02:14:48,470
and but they can't go radical they can't
they can't suddenly become i don't know

7984
02:14:48,470 --> 02:14:48,480
they can't suddenly become i don't know
 

7985
02:14:48,480 --> 02:14:49,270
they can't suddenly become i don't know
like

7986
02:14:49,270 --> 02:14:49,280
like
 

7987
02:14:49,280 --> 02:14:50,950
like
a molecule that you find in the oled in

7988
02:14:50,950 --> 02:14:50,960
a molecule that you find in the oled in
 

7989

8007
02:15:06,400 --> 02:15:08,229
unpredictable predictably unpredictable
within a constraint on the trajectory

8008
02:15:08,229 --> 02:15:08,239
within a constraint on the trajectory
 

8009
02:15:08,239 --> 02:15:10,149
within a constraint on the trajectory
we're on yeah so the predictably part is

8010
02:15:10,149 --> 02:15:10,159
we're on yeah so the predictably part is
 

8011
02:15:10,159 --> 02:15:11,830
we're on yeah so the predictably part is
the this is the constraints of the

8012
02:15:11,830 --> 02:15:11,840
the this is the constraints of the
 

8013
02:15:11,840 --> 02:15:14,069
the this is the constraints of the
trajectory and the unpredictable part

8014
02:15:14,069 --> 02:15:14,079
trajectory and the unpredictable part
 

8015
02:15:14,079 --> 02:15:15,589
trajectory and the unpredictable part
is the part that you still haven't

8016
02:15:15,589 --> 02:15:15,599
is the part that you still haven't
 

8017
02:15:15,599 --> 02:15:18,550
is the part that you still haven't
really clarified the origin of uh

8018
02:15:18,550 --> 02:15:18,560
really clarified the origin of uh
 

8019
02:15:18,560 --> 02:15:20,870
really clarified the origin of uh
of the little bit of freedom yeah so

8020
02:15:20,870 --> 02:15:20,880
of the little bit of freedom yeah so
 

8021
02:15:20,880 --> 02:15:22,870
of the little bit of freedom yeah so
you're you're just arguing you're you're

8022
02:15:22,870 --> 02:15:22,880
you're you're just arguing you're you're
 

8023
02:15:22,880 --> 02:15:24,310
you're you're just arguing you're you're
basically saying that

8024
02:15:24,310 --> 02:15:24,320
basically saying that
 

8025
02:15:24,320 --> 02:15:25,750
basically saying that
radical freedom

8026
02:15:25,750 --> 02:15:25,760
radical freedom
 

8027
02:15:25,760 --> 02:15:27,510
radical freedom
is impossible you're you're really

8028
02:15:27,510 --> 02:15:27,520
is impossible you're you're really
 

8029
02:15:27,520 --> 02:15:29,189
is impossible you're you're really
operating in a world of constraints that

8030
02:15:29,189 --> 02:15:29,199
operating in a world of constraints that
 

8031
02:15:29,199 --> 02:15:31,030
operating in a world of constraints that
are constrained by the memory of the

8036
02:15:35,430 --> 02:15:35,440
who you are okay but
 

8037
02:15:35,440 --> 02:15:37,990
who you are okay but
uh you know even just a tiny bit of

8038
02:15:37,990 --> 02:15:38,000
uh you know even just a tiny bit of
 

8039
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:38,950
uh you know even just a tiny bit of
freedom

8040
02:15:38,950 --> 02:15:38,960
freedom
 

8041
02:15:38,960 --> 02:15:42,390
freedom
even if everything if everywhere

8042
02:15:42,390 --> 02:15:42,400
even if everything if everywhere
 

8043
02:15:42,400 --> 02:15:43,750
even if everything if everywhere
you are

8044
02:15:43,750 --> 02:15:43,760
you are
 

8045
02:15:43,760 --> 02:15:45,910
you are
in cages

8046
02:15:45,910 --> 02:15:45,920
in cages
 

8047
02:15:45,920 --> 02:15:48,310
in cages
if you can move around in that cage a

8048
02:15:48,310 --> 02:15:48,320
if you can move around in that cage a
 

8049
02:15:48,320 --> 02:15:50,390
if you can move around in that cage a
little bit yeah you're free

8050
02:15:50,390 --> 02:15:50,400
little bit yeah you're free
 

8051
02:15:50,400 --> 02:15:53,430
little bit yeah you're free
i agree and so the question is

8052
02:15:53,430 --> 02:15:53,440
i agree and so the question is
 

8053
02:15:53,440 --> 02:15:55,510
i agree and so the question is
in assembly theory

8054
02:15:55,510 --> 02:15:55,520
in assembly theory
 

8055
02:15:55,520 --> 02:15:57,430
in assembly theory
if we're thinking about free will

8056
02:15:57,430 --> 02:15:57,440
if we're thinking about free will
 

8057
02:15:57,440 --> 02:15:59,030
if we're thinking about free will
where does the little bit of freedom

8058
02:15:59,030 --> 02:15:59,040
where does the little bit of freedom
 

8059
02:15:59,040 --> 02:16:01,669
where does the little bit of freedom
come from what is the i

8060
02:16:01,669 --> 02:16:01,679
come from what is the i
 

8061
02:16:01,679 --> 02:16:06,149
come from what is the i
that can decide to be a rapper what why

8062
02:16:06,149 --> 02:16:06,159
that can decide to be a rapper what why
 

8063
02:16:06,159 --> 02:16:08,550
that can decide to be a rapper what why
what is that that's a cute little trick

8064
02:16:08,550 --> 02:16:08,560
what is that that's a cute little trick
 

8065
02:16:08,560 --> 02:16:09,669
what is that that's a cute little trick
we've convinced

8066
02:16:09,669 --> 02:16:09,679
we've convinced
 

8067
02:16:09,679 --> 02:16:11,910
we've convinced
each other of so we can

8068
02:16:11,910 --> 02:16:11,920
each other of so we can
 

8069
02:16:11,920 --> 02:16:14,069
each other of so we can
do fun tricks at parties or is there

8070
02:16:14,069 --> 02:16:14,079
do fun tricks at parties or is there
 

8071
02:16:14,079 --> 02:16:16,390
do fun tricks at parties or is there
something fundamental that allows us to

8072
02:16:16,390 --> 02:16:16,400
something fundamental that allows us to
 

8073
02:16:16,400 --> 02:16:18,709
something fundamental that allows us to
feel free to be free

8074
02:16:18,709 --> 02:16:18,719
feel free to be free
 

8075
02:16:18,719 --> 02:16:21,109
feel free to be free
i think that that's the question that i

8076
02:16:21,109 --> 02:16:21,119
i think that that's the question that i
 

8077
02:16:21,119 --> 02:16:22,790
i think that that's the question that i
want to answer i know you want to answer

8078
02:16:22,790 --> 02:16:22,800
want to answer i know you want to answer
 

8079
02:16:22,800 --> 02:16:25,669
want to answer i know you want to answer
it and i think it's so profound i'd

8080
02:16:25,669 --> 02:16:25,679
it and i think it's so profound i'd
 

8081
02:16:25,679 --> 02:16:27,830
it and i think it's so profound i'd
let me have a go at it i would say that

8082
02:16:27,830 --> 02:16:27,840
let me have a go at it i would say that
 

8083
02:16:27,840 --> 02:16:30,069
let me have a go at it i would say that
i don't take the stance of sam harris

8084
02:16:30,069 --> 02:16:30,079
i don't take the stance of sam harris
 

8085
02:16:30,079 --> 02:16:31,589
i don't take the stance of sam harris
because i think sam harris when he said

8086
02:16:31,589 --> 02:16:31,599
because i think sam harris when he said
 

8087
02:16:31,599 --> 02:16:33,429
because i think sam harris when he said
the way he says it is almost it's really

8088
02:16:33,429 --> 02:16:33,439
the way he says it is almost it's really
 

8089
02:16:33,439 --> 02:16:34,549
the way he says it is almost it's really
interesting i'd love to talk to him

8090
02:16:34,549 --> 02:16:34,559
interesting i'd love to talk to him
 

8091
02:16:34,559 --> 02:16:36,150
interesting i'd love to talk to him
about it sam harris almost thinks

8092
02:16:36,150 --> 02:16:36,160
about it sam harris almost thinks
 

8093
02:16:36,160 --> 02:16:38,549
about it sam harris almost thinks
himself out of existence right because

8094
02:16:38,549 --> 02:16:38,559
himself out of existence right because
 

8095
02:16:38,559 --> 02:16:39,669
himself out of existence right because
because

8096
02:16:39,669 --> 02:16:39,679
because
 

8097
02:16:39,679 --> 02:16:41,990
because
do you know what i mean yeah well i mean

8098
02:16:41,990 --> 02:16:42,000
do you know what i mean yeah well i mean
 

8099
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:44,150
do you know what i mean yeah well i mean
he has different views on consciousness

8100
02:16:44,150 --> 02:16:44,160
he has different views on consciousness
 

8101
02:16:44,160 --> 02:16:45,990
he has different views on consciousness
versus free will i think he saves

8102
02:16:45,990 --> 02:16:46,000
versus free will i think he saves
 

8103
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:47,750
versus free will i think he saves
himself with consciousness he thinks

8104
02:16:47,750 --> 02:16:47,760
himself with consciousness he thinks
 

8105
02:16:47,760 --> 02:16:49,910
himself with consciousness he thinks
himself out of existence with free will

8106
02:16:49,910 --> 02:16:49,920
himself out of existence with free will
 

8107
02:16:49,920 --> 02:16:51,750
himself out of existence with free will
yeah yeah exactly so that means there's

8108
02:16:51,750 --> 02:16:51,760
yeah yeah exactly so that means there's
 

8109
02:16:51,760 --> 02:16:53,110
yeah yeah exactly so that means there's
no point right

8110
02:16:53,110 --> 02:16:53,120
no point right
 

8111
02:16:53,120 --> 02:16:55,750
no point right
so he's a leaf floating on a river

8112
02:16:55,750 --> 02:16:55,760
so he's a leaf floating on a river
 

8113
02:16:55,760 --> 02:16:59,030
so he's a leaf floating on a river
yeah uh um i i think that

8114
02:16:59,030 --> 02:16:59,040
yeah uh um i i think that
 

8115
02:16:59,040 --> 02:17:02,150
yeah uh um i i think that
he he he's i don't know i'd love to ask

8116
02:17:02,150 --> 02:17:02,160
he he he's i don't know i'd love to ask
 

8117
02:17:02,160 --> 02:17:03,509
he he he's i don't know i'd love to ask
him whether he really believes that and

8118
02:17:03,509 --> 02:17:03,519
him whether he really believes that and
 

8119
02:17:03,519 --> 02:17:05,349
him whether he really believes that and
then we could play some games oh yeah no

8120
02:17:05,349 --> 02:17:05,359
then we could play some games oh yeah no
 

8121
02:17:05,359 --> 02:17:07,190
then we could play some games oh yeah no
no i then would say i'll get him to play

8122
02:17:07,190 --> 02:17:07,200
no i then would say i'll get him to play
 

8123
02:17:07,200 --> 02:17:09,270
no i then would say i'll get him to play
a game of cards with me and i'll work

8124
02:17:09,270 --> 02:17:09,280
a game of cards with me and i'll work
 

8125
02:17:09,280 --> 02:17:11,349
a game of cards with me and i'll work
out the conditions on which he says no

8126
02:17:11,349 --> 02:17:11,359
out the conditions on which he says no
 

8127
02:17:11,359 --> 02:17:12,629
out the conditions on which he says no
and then i'll get him to the conditions

8128
02:17:12,629 --> 02:17:12,639
and then i'll get him to the conditions
 

8129
02:17:12,639 --> 02:17:14,230
and then i'll get him to the conditions
he says yes and then i'll trap him in

8130
02:17:14,230 --> 02:17:14,240
he says yes and then i'll trap him in
 

8131
02:17:14,240 --> 02:17:15,750
he says yes and then i'll trap him in
his logical inconsistency with that

8132
02:17:15,750 --> 02:17:15,760
his logical inconsistency with that
 

8133
02:17:15,760 --> 02:17:17,030
his logical inconsistency with that
argument

8134
02:17:17,030 --> 02:17:17,040
argument
 

8135
02:17:17,040 --> 02:17:18,790
argument
because at some point at some point when

8136
02:17:18,790 --> 02:17:18,800
because at some point at some point when
 

8137
02:17:18,800 --> 02:17:20,709
because at some point at some point when
he loses enough money or the prospect of

8138
02:17:20,709 --> 02:17:20,719
he loses enough money or the prospect of
 

8139
02:17:20,719 --> 02:17:22,150
he loses enough money or the prospect of
losing enough money

8140
02:17:22,150 --> 02:17:22,160
losing enough money
 

8141
02:17:22,160 --> 02:17:23,349
losing enough money
um

8142
02:17:23,349 --> 02:17:23,359
um
 

8143
02:17:23,359 --> 02:17:25,429
um
there's a way of basically mapping out a

8144
02:17:25,429 --> 02:17:25,439
there's a way of basically mapping out a
 

8145
02:17:25,439 --> 02:17:26,790
there's a way of basically mapping out a
series of

8146
02:17:26,790 --> 02:17:26,800
series of
 

8147
02:17:26,800 --> 02:17:29,589
series of
so what what what will is about let's

8148
02:17:29,589 --> 02:17:29,599
so what what what will is about let's
 

8149
02:17:29,599 --> 02:17:31,349
so what what what will is about let's
not call it free will that what will us

8150
02:17:31,349 --> 02:17:31,359
not call it free will that what will us
 

8151
02:17:31,359 --> 02:17:33,750
not call it free will that what will us
about is to have a series of

8152
02:17:33,750 --> 02:17:33,760
about is to have a series of
 

8153
02:17:33,760 --> 02:17:35,750
about is to have a series of
decisions equally weighted in front of

8154
02:17:35,750 --> 02:17:35,760
decisions equally weighted in front of
 

8155
02:17:35,760 --> 02:17:36,629
decisions equally weighted in front of
you

8156
02:17:36,629 --> 02:17:36,639
you
 

8157
02:17:36,639 --> 02:17:38,309
you
and those decisions aren't necessarily

8158
02:17:38,309 --> 02:17:38,319
and those decisions aren't necessarily
 

8159
02:17:38,319 --> 02:17:41,349
and those decisions aren't necessarily
energy minimization those decisions

8160
02:17:41,349 --> 02:17:41,359
energy minimization those decisions
 

8161
02:17:41,359 --> 02:17:43,589
energy minimization those decisions
are a function of the model you've made

8162
02:17:43,589 --> 02:17:43,599
are a function of the model you've made
 

8163
02:17:43,599 --> 02:17:45,830
are a function of the model you've made
in your mind you're in your simulation

8164
02:17:45,830 --> 02:17:45,840
in your mind you're in your simulation
 

8165
02:17:45,840 --> 02:17:48,629
in your mind you're in your simulation
and the way you've interacted in reality

8166
02:17:48,629 --> 02:17:48,639
and the way you've interacted in reality
 

8167
02:17:48,639 --> 02:17:50,230
and the way you've interacted in reality
and also

8168
02:17:50,230 --> 02:17:50,240
and also
 

8169
02:17:50,240 --> 02:17:52,150
and also
other interactions you're having with

8170
02:17:52,150 --> 02:17:52,160
other interactions you're having with
 

8171
02:17:52,160 --> 02:17:55,190
other interactions you're having with
other individuals and happenstance

8172
02:17:55,190 --> 02:17:55,200
other individuals and happenstance
 

8173
02:17:55,200 --> 02:17:56,549
other individuals and happenstance
and

8174
02:17:56,549 --> 02:17:56,559
and
 

8175
02:17:56,559 --> 02:17:58,309
and
i think that you have there's a little

8176
02:17:58,309 --> 02:17:58,319
i think that you have there's a little
 

8177
02:17:58,319 --> 02:18:01,429
i think that you have there's a little
bit of delay in time so i think what

8178
02:18:01,429 --> 02:18:01,439
bit of delay in time so i think what
 

8179
02:18:01,439 --> 02:18:04,389
bit of delay in time so i think what
what you're able to do is say well i'm

8180
02:18:04,389 --> 02:18:04,399
what you're able to do is say well i'm
 

8181
02:18:04,399 --> 02:18:06,389
what you're able to do is say well i'm
going to do the counterfactual

8182
02:18:06,389 --> 02:18:06,399
going to do the counterfactual
 

8183
02:18:06,399 --> 02:18:08,070
going to do the counterfactual
i've done all of them

8184
02:18:08,070 --> 02:18:08,080
i've done all of them
 

8185
02:18:08,080 --> 02:18:10,629
i've done all of them
and i'm going to i'm gonna go this way

8186
02:18:10,629 --> 02:18:10,639
and i'm going to i'm gonna go this way
 

8187
02:18:10,639 --> 02:18:12,709
and i'm going to i'm gonna go this way
and you probably don't know why i think

8188
02:18:12,709 --> 02:18:12,719
and you probably don't know why i think
 

8189
02:18:12,719 --> 02:18:14,230
and you probably don't know why i think
free will is actually very complex

8190
02:18:14,230 --> 02:18:14,240
free will is actually very complex
 

8191
02:18:14,240 --> 02:18:15,990
free will is actually very complex
interaction between your conscious

8192
02:18:15,990 --> 02:18:16,000
interaction between your conscious
 

8193
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:17,750
interaction between your conscious
your unconscious and your conscious

8194
02:18:17,750 --> 02:18:17,760
your unconscious and your conscious
 

8195

8196
02:18:18,629 --> 02:18:18,639
brain
 

8197
02:18:18,639 --> 02:18:20,309
brain
and i think the reason why we're arguing

8198
02:18:20,309 --> 02:18:20,319
and i think the reason why we're arguing
 

8199
02:18:20,319 --> 02:18:22,950
and i think the reason why we're arguing
about it so it's so interesting in the

8200
02:18:22,950 --> 02:18:22,960
about it so it's so interesting in the
 

8201
02:18:22,960 --> 02:18:25,270
about it so it's so interesting in the
and we just some people

8202
02:18:25,270 --> 02:18:25,280
and we just some people
 

8203
02:18:25,280 --> 02:18:27,110
and we just some people
um outsource their free will to that

8204
02:18:27,110 --> 02:18:27,120
um outsource their free will to that
 

8205
02:18:27,120 --> 02:18:28,629
um outsource their free will to that
unconscious brain

8206
02:18:28,629 --> 02:18:28,639
unconscious brain
 

8207
02:18:28,639 --> 02:18:30,469
unconscious brain
and some people try and

8208
02:18:30,469 --> 02:18:30,479
and some people try and
 

8209
02:18:30,479 --> 02:18:31,910
and some people try and
overthink the free will in the conscious

8210
02:18:31,910 --> 02:18:31,920
overthink the free will in the conscious
 

8211
02:18:31,920 --> 02:18:32,950
overthink the free will in the conscious
brain

8212
02:18:32,950 --> 02:18:32,960
brain
 

8213
02:18:32,960 --> 02:18:34,150
brain
i would say that

8214
02:18:34,150 --> 02:18:34,160
i would say that
 

8215
02:18:34,160 --> 02:18:35,750
i would say that
sam harris has realized his conscious

8216
02:18:35,750 --> 02:18:35,760
sam harris has realized his conscious
 

8217
02:18:35,760 --> 02:18:37,030
sam harris has realized his conscious
brain doesn't have free will but his

8218
02:18:37,030 --> 02:18:37,040
brain doesn't have free will but his
 

8219
02:18:37,040 --> 02:18:38,389
brain doesn't have free will but his
unconscious brain does

8220
02:18:38,389 --> 02:18:38,399
unconscious brain does
 

8221
02:18:38,399 --> 02:18:40,469
unconscious brain does
that's my guess right and that he can't

8222
02:18:40,469 --> 02:18:40,479
that's my guess right and that he can't
 

8223
02:18:40,479 --> 02:18:41,990
that's my guess right and that he can't
have access to the unconscious yeah and

8224
02:18:41,990 --> 02:18:42,000
have access to the unconscious yeah and
 

8225
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:43,750
have access to the unconscious yeah and
that's kind of annoying and but then so

8226
02:18:43,750 --> 02:18:43,760
that's kind of annoying and but then so
 

8227
02:18:43,760 --> 02:18:45,509
that's kind of annoying and but then so
he's just he's going to through

8228
02:18:45,509 --> 02:18:45,519
he's just he's going to through
 

8229
02:18:45,519 --> 02:18:47,429
he's just he's going to through
meditation come to acceptance with that

8230
02:18:47,429 --> 02:18:47,439
meditation come to acceptance with that
 

8231
02:18:47,439 --> 02:18:49,750

fact yeah just which is maybe okay i

8232
02:18:49,750 --> 02:18:49,760
fact yeah just which is maybe okay i

maybe but i do think that i have
 

8235
02:18:53,519 --> 02:18:55,270
maybe but i do think that i have
the ability to make decisions and i like

8236
02:18:55,270 --> 02:18:55,280
the ability to make decisions and i like
 

8237
02:18:55,280 --> 02:18:57,509
the ability to make decisions and i like
my decisions in fact i mean this is an

8238
02:18:57,509 --> 02:18:57,519
my decisions in fact i mean this is an
 

8239
02:18:57,519 --> 02:18:59,190
my decisions in fact i mean this is an
argument i have with

8240
02:18:59,190 --> 02:18:59,200
argument i have with
 

8241
02:18:59,200 --> 02:19:01,669
argument i have with
with uh some people that um some days i

8242
02:19:01,669 --> 02:19:01,679
with uh some people that um some days i
 

8243
02:19:01,679 --> 02:19:03,589
with uh some people that um some days i
feel i have no free will and it's just

8244
02:19:03,589 --> 02:19:03,599
feel i have no free will and it's just
 

8245
02:19:03,599 --> 02:19:05,669
feel i have no free will and it's just
an illusion and this is one and it makes

8246
02:19:05,669 --> 02:19:05,679
an illusion and this is one and it makes
 

8247
02:19:05,679 --> 02:19:08,150
an illusion and this is one and it makes
me more radical if you like you know as

8248
02:19:08,150 --> 02:19:08,160
me more radical if you like you know as
 

8249
02:19:08,160 --> 02:19:09,429
me more radical if you like you know as
a

8250
02:19:09,429 --> 02:19:09,439
a
 

8251
02:19:09,439 --> 02:19:11,429
a
i get to explore more of the state space

8252
02:19:11,429 --> 02:19:11,439
i get to explore more of the state space
 

8253
02:19:11,439 --> 02:19:12,870
i get to explore more of the state space
and i'm like i'm going to try and affect

8254
02:19:12,870 --> 02:19:12,880
and i'm like i'm going to try and affect
 

8255
02:19:12,880 --> 02:19:14,549
and i'm like i'm going to try and affect
the world now i'm really going to ask

8256
02:19:14,549 --> 02:19:14,559
the world now i'm really going to ask
 

8257
02:19:14,559 --> 02:19:16,950
the world now i'm really going to ask
the question that maybe i dare not ask

8258
02:19:16,950 --> 02:19:16,960
the question that maybe i dare not ask
 

8259
02:19:16,960 --> 02:19:18,709
the question that maybe i dare not ask
or dare not or do the thing i dare not

8260
02:19:18,709 --> 02:19:18,719
or dare not or do the thing i dare not
 

8261
02:19:18,719 --> 02:19:19,509
or dare not or do the thing i dare not
do

8262
02:19:19,509 --> 02:19:19,519
do
 

8263
02:19:19,519 --> 02:19:21,270
do
and that allows me to kind of explore

8264
02:19:21,270 --> 02:19:21,280
and that allows me to kind of explore
 

8265
02:19:21,280 --> 02:19:23,669
and that allows me to kind of explore
more it's funny that um

8266
02:19:23,669 --> 02:19:23,679
more it's funny that um
 

8267
02:19:23,679 --> 02:19:26,309
more it's funny that um
if you truly accept that there's no free

8268
02:19:26,309 --> 02:19:26,319
if you truly accept that there's no free
 

8269
02:19:26,319 --> 02:19:28,709
if you truly accept that there's no free
will

8270

8271
02:19:28,719 --> 02:19:31,509

that is a kind of radical freedom

8272
02:19:31,509 --> 02:19:31,519
that is a kind of radical freedom
 

8273
02:19:31,519 --> 02:19:32,790
that is a kind of radical freedom
it's funny

8274
02:19:32,790 --> 02:19:32,800
it's funny
 

8275
02:19:32,800 --> 02:19:35,669
it's funny
but you're because

8276
02:19:35,669 --> 02:19:35,679
but you're because
 

8277
02:19:35,679 --> 02:19:37,830
but you're because
the little bit of the illusion in under

02:19:37,840 --> 02:19:38,629
the little bit of the illusion in under
that

8280
02:19:38,629 --> 02:19:38,639
that
 

8281
02:19:38,639 --> 02:19:40,150
that
framework that you have that you can

8282
02:19:40,150 --> 02:19:40,160
framework that you have that you can
 

8283
02:19:40,160 --> 02:19:41,830
framework that you have that you can
make choices

8284
02:19:41,830 --> 02:19:41,840
make choices
 

8285
02:19:41,840 --> 02:19:43,990
make choices
if choice is just an illusion of

02:19:43,990 --> 02:19:44,000
if choice is just an illusion of

you can do whatever the hell you want

8290
02:19:46,629 --> 02:19:46,639
you can do whatever the hell you want
 

8291
02:19:46,639 --> 02:19:48,950
you can do whatever the hell you want
that's the but we don't do we and i

8292
02:19:48,950 --> 02:19:48,960
that's the but we don't do we and i
 

8293
02:19:48,960 --> 02:19:51,429
that's the but we don't do we and i
think but because you don't truly accept

that
 

8297
02:19:52,240 --> 02:19:54,950
that
you you think that there's

8298
02:19:54,950 --> 02:19:54,960
you you think that there's
 

8299
02:19:54,960 --> 02:19:57,190
you you think that there's
like you think there's a choice which is

8300
02:19:57,190 --> 02:19:57,200
like you think there's a choice which is
 

8301
02:19:57,200 --> 02:19:58,309
like you think there's a choice which is
why

8302
02:19:58,309 --> 02:19:58,319
why
 

8303
02:19:58,319 --> 02:20:00,389
why
you don't uh just do whatever the hell

8304
02:20:00,389 --> 02:20:00,399
you don't uh just do whatever the hell
 

8305
02:20:00,399 --> 02:20:02,230
you don't uh just do whatever the hell
you want like you feel like there's some

8306
02:20:02,230 --> 02:20:02,240
you want like you feel like there's some
 

8307
02:20:02,240 --> 02:20:03,670
you want like you feel like there's some
responsibility for making the wrong

8308
02:20:03,670 --> 02:20:03,680
responsibility for making the wrong
 

8309
02:20:03,680 --> 02:20:05,590
responsibility for making the wrong
choice which is why you don't do it but

8310
02:20:05,590 --> 02:20:05,600
choice which is why you don't do it but
 

8311
02:20:05,600 --> 02:20:07,510
choice which is why you don't do it but
if you truly accept that the choice has

8312
02:20:07,510 --> 02:20:07,520
if you truly accept that the choice has
 

8313
02:20:07,520 --> 02:20:09,830
if you truly accept that the choice has
already been made

8314
02:20:09,830 --> 02:20:09,840
already been made
 

8315
02:20:09,840 --> 02:20:11,990
already been made
then you can go

8316
02:20:11,990 --> 02:20:12,000
then you can go
 

8317
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:13,510
then you can go
i don't know what is the most radical

8318
02:20:13,510 --> 02:20:13,520
i don't know what is the most radical
 

8319
02:20:13,520 --> 02:20:14,830
i don't know what is the most radical
thing

8320
02:20:14,830 --> 02:20:14,840
thing
 

8321
02:20:14,840 --> 02:20:17,750
thing

um i mean but
yeah i don't i wonder what what am i

8324
02:20:20,150 --> 02:20:20,160
yeah i don't i wonder what what am i
 

8325
02:20:20,160 --> 02:20:21,990
yeah i don't i wonder what what am i
preventing myself from doing that i

8326
02:20:21,990 --> 02:20:22,000
preventing myself from doing that i
 

8327
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:24,550
preventing myself from doing that i
would really want to do um

8328
02:20:24,550 --> 02:20:24,560
would really want to do um
 

8329
02:20:24,560 --> 02:20:27,030
would really want to do um
probably like humor stuff like

8330
02:20:27,030 --> 02:20:27,040
probably like humor stuff like
 

8331
02:20:27,040 --> 02:20:28,150
probably like humor stuff like
i would

8332
02:20:28,150 --> 02:20:28,160
i would
 

8333
02:20:28,160 --> 02:20:30,790
i would
i would love to if i could like save a

8334
02:20:30,790 --> 02:20:30,800
i would love to if i could like save a
 

8335
02:20:30,800 --> 02:20:31,750
i would love to if i could like save a
game

8336
02:20:31,750 --> 02:20:31,760
game
 

8337
02:20:31,760 --> 02:20:34,389
game
do the thing and then reload it later

8338
02:20:34,389 --> 02:20:34,399
do the thing and then reload it later
 

8339
02:20:34,399 --> 02:20:37,830
do the thing and then reload it later
like do undo it'd probably be humor just

8340
02:20:37,830 --> 02:20:37,840
like do undo it'd probably be humor just
 

8341
02:20:37,840 --> 02:20:39,349
like do undo it'd probably be humor just
just to do something like super

8342
02:20:39,349 --> 02:20:39,359
just to do something like super
 

8343
02:20:39,359 --> 02:20:40,660
just to do something like super
hilarious

8344
02:20:40,660 --> 02:20:40,670
hilarious
 

8345
02:20:40,670 --> 02:20:42,389
hilarious
[Laughter]

8346
02:20:42,389 --> 02:20:42,399
[Laughter]
 

8347
02:20:42,399 --> 02:20:44,309
[Laughter]
that's super embarrassing and then just

8348
02:20:44,309 --> 02:20:44,319
that's super embarrassing and then just
 

8349
02:20:44,319 --> 02:20:46,630
that's super embarrassing and then just
go i mean it's basically just fun i

8350
02:20:46,630 --> 02:20:46,640
go i mean it's basically just fun i
 

8351
02:20:46,640 --> 02:20:48,230
go i mean it's basically just fun i
would add more fun to the world i mean i

8352
02:20:48,230 --> 02:20:48,240
would add more fun to the world i mean i
 

8353
02:20:48,240 --> 02:20:50,950
would add more fun to the world i mean i
sometimes do that because i you know um

8354
02:20:50,950 --> 02:20:50,960
sometimes do that because i you know um
 

8355
02:20:50,960 --> 02:20:53,349
sometimes do that because i you know um
i sometimes um

8356
02:20:53,349 --> 02:20:53,359
i sometimes um
 

8357
02:20:53,359 --> 02:20:55,429
i sometimes um
i try and i try and mess up my reality

8358
02:20:55,429 --> 02:20:55,439
i try and i try and mess up my reality
 

8359
02:20:55,439 --> 02:20:57,110
i try and i try and mess up my reality
in unusual ways by just doing things

8360
02:20:57,110 --> 02:20:57,120
in unusual ways by just doing things
 

8361
02:20:57,120 --> 02:20:59,429
in unusual ways by just doing things
because i'm bored but not bored i'm not

8362
02:20:59,429 --> 02:20:59,439
because i'm bored but not bored i'm not
 

8363
02:20:59,439 --> 02:21:00,950
because i'm bored but not bored i'm not
expressing this very well i think that

8364
02:21:00,950 --> 02:21:00,960
expressing this very well i think that
 

8365
02:21:00,960 --> 02:21:02,389
expressing this very well i think that
this is a really interesting problem

8366
02:21:02,389 --> 02:21:02,399
this is a really interesting problem
 

8367
02:21:02,399 --> 02:21:04,550
this is a really interesting problem
that perhaps the hard sciences don't

8368
02:21:04,550 --> 02:21:04,560
that perhaps the hard sciences don't
 

8369
02:21:04,560 --> 02:21:05,750
that perhaps the hard sciences don't
really understand that they are

8370
02:21:05,750 --> 02:21:05,760
really understand that they are
 

8371
02:21:05,760 --> 02:21:07,349
really understand that they are
responsible for because

8372
02:21:07,349 --> 02:21:07,359
responsible for because
 

8373
02:21:07,359 --> 02:21:09,429
responsible for because
the question about how life emerged and

8374
02:21:09,429 --> 02:21:09,439
the question about how life emerged and
 

8375
02:21:09,439 --> 02:21:10,630
the question about how life emerged and
how intelligence emerges and

8376
02:21:10,630 --> 02:21:10,640
how intelligence emerges and
 

8377
02:21:10,640 --> 02:21:12,950
how intelligence emerges and
consciousness and free will they're all

8378
02:21:12,950 --> 02:21:12,960
consciousness and free will they're all
 

8379
02:21:12,960 --> 02:21:14,790
consciousness and free will they're all
ultimately boiling down to some of the

8380
02:21:14,790 --> 02:21:14,800
ultimately boiling down to some of the
 

8381
02:21:14,800 --> 02:21:16,630
ultimately boiling down to some of the
same mechanics i think

8382
02:21:16,630 --> 02:21:16,640
same mechanics i think
 

8383
02:21:16,640 --> 02:21:18,389
same mechanics i think
my feeling is that they are

8384
02:21:18,389 --> 02:21:18,399
my feeling is that they are
 

8385
02:21:18,399 --> 02:21:19,830
my feeling is that they are
the same problem again and again and

8386
02:21:19,830 --> 02:21:19,840
the same problem again and again and
 

8387
02:21:19,840 --> 02:21:20,790
the same problem again and again and
again

8388
02:21:20,790 --> 02:21:20,800
again
 

8389
02:21:20,800 --> 02:21:22,630
again
the transition from a

8390
02:21:22,630 --> 02:21:22,640
the transition from a
 

8391
02:21:22,640 --> 02:21:25,110
the transition from a
you know a a boring world or a world in

8392
02:21:25,110 --> 02:21:25,120
you know a a boring world or a world in
 

8393
02:21:25,120 --> 02:21:27,110
you know a a boring world or a world in
which there is no selection so i wonder

8394
02:21:27,110 --> 02:21:27,120
which there is no selection so i wonder
 

8395
02:21:27,120 --> 02:21:28,630
which there is no selection so i wonder
if free will has something to do with

8396
02:21:28,630 --> 02:21:28,640
if free will has something to do with
 

8397
02:21:28,640 --> 02:21:30,790
if free will has something to do with
selection and models and and also the

8398
02:21:30,790 --> 02:21:30,800
selection and models and and also the
 

8399
02:21:30,800 --> 02:21:32,469
selection and models and and also the
models you're generating the brain and

8400
02:21:32,469 --> 02:21:32,479
models you're generating the brain and
 

8401
02:21:32,479 --> 02:21:34,070
models you're generating the brain and
also your the amount of memory your

8402
02:21:34,070 --> 02:21:34,080
also your the amount of memory your
 

8403
02:21:34,080 --> 02:21:35,590
also your the amount of memory your
working memory have available any one

8404
02:21:35,590 --> 02:21:35,600
working memory have available any one
 

8405
02:21:35,600 --> 02:21:37,429
working memory have available any one
time to generate counter factuals well

8406
02:21:37,429 --> 02:21:37,439
time to generate counter factuals well
 

8407
02:21:37,439 --> 02:21:39,030
time to generate counter factuals well
that's fascinating so the decision

8408
02:21:39,030 --> 02:21:39,040
that's fascinating so the decision
 

8409
02:21:39,040 --> 02:21:40,469
that's fascinating so the decision
making process

8410
02:21:40,469 --> 02:21:40,479
making process
 

8411
02:21:40,479 --> 02:21:42,630
making process
is a kind of selection yeah that could

8412
02:21:42,630 --> 02:21:42,640
is a kind of selection yeah that could
 

8413
02:21:42,640 --> 02:21:44,950
is a kind of selection yeah that could
be just absolutely yet another

8414
02:21:44,950 --> 02:21:44,960
be just absolutely yet another
 

8415
02:21:44,960 --> 02:21:47,110
be just absolutely yet another
you get another manifestation of the

8416
02:21:47,110 --> 02:21:47,120
you get another manifestation of the
 

8417
02:21:47,120 --> 02:21:49,349
you get another manifestation of the
selection mechanism that's uh pervasive

8418
02:21:49,349 --> 02:21:49,359
selection mechanism that's uh pervasive
 

8419
02:21:49,359 --> 02:21:51,110
selection mechanism that's uh pervasive
throughout the universe okay that's

8420
02:21:51,110 --> 02:21:51,120
throughout the universe okay that's
 

8421
02:21:51,120 --> 02:21:54,790
throughout the universe okay that's
fascinating to think about

8422
02:21:54,790 --> 02:21:54,800
fascinating to think about
 

8423
02:21:54,800 --> 02:21:56,309
fascinating to think about
yeah there's not some kind of

8424
02:21:56,309 --> 02:21:56,319
yeah there's not some kind of
 

8425
02:21:56,319 --> 02:21:58,150
yeah there's not some kind of
fundamental its own thing or something

8426
02:21:58,150 --> 02:21:58,160
fundamental its own thing or something
 

8427
02:21:58,160 --> 02:21:59,110
fundamental its own thing or something
like that

8428
02:21:59,110 --> 02:21:59,120
like that
 

8429
02:21:59,120 --> 02:22:01,110
like that
that is just yet another example of

8430
02:22:01,110 --> 02:22:01,120
that is just yet another example of
 

8431
02:22:01,120 --> 02:22:03,590
that is just yet another example of
selection yeah

8432
02:22:03,590 --> 02:22:03,600
selection yeah
 

8433
02:22:03,600 --> 02:22:05,349
selection yeah
and in the universe that's intrinsically

8434
02:22:05,349 --> 02:22:05,359
and in the universe that's intrinsically
 

8435
02:22:05,359 --> 02:22:07,270
and in the universe that's intrinsically
open you want to do that because you

8436
02:22:07,270 --> 02:22:07,280
open you want to do that because you
 

8437
02:22:07,280 --> 02:22:09,349
open you want to do that because you
generate novelty you mentioned something

8438
02:22:09,349 --> 02:22:09,359
generate novelty you mentioned something
 

8439
02:22:09,359 --> 02:22:10,550
generate novelty you mentioned something
about

8440
02:22:10,550 --> 02:22:10,560
about
 

8441
02:22:10,560 --> 02:22:12,550
about
do cellular automata exist outside the

8442
02:22:12,550 --> 02:22:12,560
do cellular automata exist outside the
 

8443
02:22:12,560 --> 02:22:13,750
do cellular automata exist outside the
human mind

8444
02:22:13,750 --> 02:22:13,760
human mind

in our little offline conversation
 

8447
02:22:16,319 --> 02:22:18,710
in our little offline conversation
um why is that an interesting question

8448
02:22:18,710 --> 02:22:18,720
um why is that an interesting question
 

8449
02:22:18,720 --> 02:22:22,389
um why is that an interesting question
so uh cellular automata complexity

8450
02:22:22,389 --> 02:22:22,399
so uh cellular automata complexity
 

8451
02:22:22,399 --> 02:22:23,590
so uh cellular automata complexity
what's the relationship between

8452
02:22:23,590 --> 02:22:23,600
what's the relationship between
 

8453
02:22:23,600 --> 02:22:26,070
what's the relationship between
complexity and the human mind

8454
02:22:26,070 --> 02:22:26,080
complexity and the human mind
 

8455
02:22:26,080 --> 02:22:28,790
complexity and the human mind
and uh trees falling in the forest

8456
02:22:28,790 --> 02:22:28,800

02:22:38,710 --> 02:22:38,720
just drawing them on paper
 

8465
02:22:38,720 --> 02:22:40,550
just drawing them on paper
how awesome is that that they were doing

8466
02:22:40,550 --> 02:22:40,560
how awesome is that that they were doing
 

8467
02:22:40,560 --> 02:22:42,710
how awesome is that that they were doing
cellular automata on paper yeah and then

8468
02:22:42,710 --> 02:22:42,720
cellular automata on paper yeah and then
 

8469
02:22:42,720 --> 02:22:45,349
cellular automata on paper yeah and then
they were doing a computer that takes

8470
02:22:45,349 --> 02:22:45,359
they were doing a computer that takes
 

8471
02:22:45,359 --> 02:22:47,910
they were doing a computer that takes

02:22:55,280 --> 02:22:56,950
don't understand how amazing it is to
just play with cellular automata

02:23:35,280 --> 02:23:37,590
a few years ago i made some robots that
talk to each other chemical robots that

talk to each other chemical robots that
 

8525
02:23:37,600 --> 02:23:39,510
talk to each other chemical robots that
played the game of hex

8539
02:23:49,680 --> 02:23:51,349
had a look up table of experiments and
robot one said i'm doing experiment 10.

8540
02:23:51,349 --> 02:23:51,359
robot one said i'm doing experiment 10.
 

8541
02:23:51,359 --> 02:23:52,710
robot one said i'm doing experiment 10.
and the others wrote about okay i'll do

8542
02:23:52,710 --> 02:23:52,720
and the others wrote about okay i'll do
 

8543

yeah yeah yeah oh
 

8549
02:23:58,560 --> 02:24:00,070
yeah yeah yeah oh
can you maybe quickly explain what the

8550
02:24:00,070 --> 02:24:00,080
can you maybe quickly explain what the
 

8551
02:24:00,080 --> 02:24:01,910
can you maybe quickly explain what the
game of hex is uh yes so it's a

8552
02:24:01,910 --> 02:24:01,920
game of hex is uh yes so it's a
 

8553
02:24:01,920 --> 02:24:04,230
game of hex is uh yes so it's a
basically a bought a hexagonal board and

8554
02:24:04,230 --> 02:24:04,240
basically a bought a hexagonal board and
 

8555
02:24:04,240 --> 02:24:06,150
basically a bought a hexagonal board and
you try and basically you color each

8556
02:24:06,150 --> 02:24:06,160
you try and basically you color each
 

8557
02:24:06,160 --> 02:24:07,990
you try and basically you color each
hexagon each element on the board it's

8558
02:24:07,990 --> 02:24:08,000
hexagon each element on the board it's
 

8559
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:09,750
hexagon each element on the board it's
hexagon and you try and get from one

8560
02:24:09,750 --> 02:24:09,760
hexagon and you try and get from one
 

8561
02:24:09,760 --> 02:24:10,870
hexagon and you try and get from one
side to the other and the other one

8562
02:24:10,870 --> 02:24:10,880
side to the other and the other one
 

8563
02:24:10,880 --> 02:24:12,790
side to the other and the other one
tries to block you wait uh how are they

8564
02:24:12,790 --> 02:24:12,800
tries to block you wait uh how are they
 

8565
02:24:12,800 --> 02:24:16,230
tries to block you wait uh how are they
connected uh so what they're wrote

8566
02:24:16,230 --> 02:24:16,240
connected uh so what they're wrote
 

8567
02:24:16,240 --> 02:24:17,830
connected uh so what they're wrote
uh yeah let's go back so they wrote two

8568
02:24:17,830 --> 02:24:17,840
uh yeah let's go back so they wrote two
 

8569
02:24:17,840 --> 02:24:19,910
uh yeah let's go back so they wrote two
robots yeah each robot was doing die

8570
02:24:19,910 --> 02:24:19,920
robots yeah each robot was doing die
 

8571
02:24:19,920 --> 02:24:22,309
robots yeah each robot was doing die
chemistry so making rgb red green blue

8572
02:24:22,309 --> 02:24:22,319
chemistry so making rgb red green blue
 

8573
02:24:22,319 --> 02:24:24,469
chemistry so making rgb red green blue
red green blue red green blue and they

8574
02:24:24,469 --> 02:24:24,479
red green blue red green blue and they
 

8575
02:24:24,479 --> 02:24:26,710
red green blue red green blue and they
could just choose from experiments to do

8576
02:24:26,710 --> 02:24:26,720
could just choose from experiments to do
 

8577
02:24:26,720 --> 02:24:29,110
could just choose from experiments to do
red green blue um initially i said to my

8578
02:24:29,110 --> 02:24:29,120
red green blue um initially i said to my
 

8579
02:24:29,120 --> 02:24:30,309
red green blue um initially i said to my
group we need to make two chemical

8580
02:24:30,309 --> 02:24:30,319
group we need to make two chemical
 

8581
02:24:30,319 --> 02:24:31,910
group we need to make two chemical
robots that play chess and my group were

8582
02:24:31,910 --> 02:24:31,920
robots that play chess and my group were
 

8583
02:24:31,920 --> 02:24:32,630
robots that play chess and my group were
like

8584
02:24:32,630 --> 02:24:32,640
like
 

8585
02:24:32,640 --> 02:24:34,870
like
that's too hard no complicated go away

8586
02:24:34,870 --> 02:24:34,880
that's too hard no complicated go away
 

8587
02:24:34,880 --> 02:24:38,950
that's too hard no complicated go away
um but anyways we had the robot

8588
02:24:38,950 --> 02:24:38,960

 

8589
02:24:38,960 --> 02:24:40,630

people listening to this uh should

8590
02:24:40,630 --> 02:24:40,640
people listening to this uh should
 

8591
02:24:40,640 --> 02:24:44,710
people listening to this uh should
probably know that lee cronin is a as a

8592
02:24:44,710 --> 02:24:44,720
probably know that lee cronin is a as a
 

8593
02:24:44,720 --> 02:24:46,950
probably know that lee cronin is a as a
amazing group of brilliant people

02:25:11,680 --> 02:25:13,670
talking about serious science
we're back to uh

8618
02:25:13,670 --> 02:25:13,680
we're back to uh
 

8619
02:25:13,680 --> 02:25:16,230
we're back to uh
your group rejecting your idea of

so you went to a simpler game of hex

8628
02:25:24,469 --> 02:25:24,479
so you went to a simpler game of hex
 

8629
02:25:24,479 --> 02:25:26,870
so you went to a simpler game of hex
okay so what else the team that did it

8630
02:25:26,870 --> 02:25:26,880
okay so what else the team that did it
 

8631
02:25:26,880 --> 02:25:28,790
okay so what else the team that did it
were brilliant i really think

8632
02:25:28,790 --> 02:25:28,800
were brilliant i really think
 

8633
02:25:28,800 --> 02:25:30,950
were brilliant i really think
the i think they still have ptsd from

8634
02:25:30,950 --> 02:25:30,960
the i think they still have ptsd from
 

8635
02:25:30,960 --> 02:25:31,990
the i think they still have ptsd from
doing it because i said this is a

8636
02:25:31,990 --> 02:25:32,000
doing it because i said this is a
 

8637
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:34,550
doing it because i said this is a
workshop what i'd often do is i'd so i

8638
02:25:34,550 --> 02:25:34,560
workshop what i'd often do is i'd so i
 

8639
02:25:34,560 --> 02:25:36,630
workshop what i'd often do is i'd so i
have about 60 people on my team

8640
02:25:36,630 --> 02:25:36,640
have about 60 people on my team
 

8641
02:25:36,640 --> 02:25:38,389
have about 60 people on my team
and occasionally before lockdown i would

8642
02:25:38,389 --> 02:25:38,399
and occasionally before lockdown i would
 

8643
02:25:38,399 --> 02:25:39,190
and occasionally before lockdown i would
say

8644
02:25:39,190 --> 02:25:39,200
say
 

8645
02:25:39,200 --> 02:25:40,389
say
i'm a bit bored we're gonna we're gonna

8646
02:25:40,389 --> 02:25:40,399
i'm a bit bored we're gonna we're gonna
 

8647
02:25:40,399 --> 02:25:41,910
i'm a bit bored we're gonna we're gonna
have a workshop on something who wants

8648
02:25:41,910 --> 02:25:41,920
have a workshop on something who wants
 

8649
02:25:41,920 --> 02:25:43,590
have a workshop on something who wants
to come and then basically about 20

8650
02:25:43,590 --> 02:25:43,600
to come and then basically about 20
 

8651
02:25:43,600 --> 02:25:44,950
to come and then basically about 20
people turn up to my office and i say

8652
02:25:44,950 --> 02:25:44,960
people turn up to my office and i say
 

8653
02:25:44,960 --> 02:25:46,550
people turn up to my office and i say
we're gonna do this mad thing

8654
02:25:46,550 --> 02:25:46,560
we're gonna do this mad thing
 

8655
02:25:46,560 --> 02:25:49,270
we're gonna do this mad thing
and then it would just self organize and

8656
02:25:49,270 --> 02:25:49,280
and then it would just self organize and
 

8657
02:25:49,280 --> 02:25:50,710
and then it would just self organize and
some of them were like no i'm not doing

8658
02:25:50,710 --> 02:25:50,720
some of them were like no i'm not doing
 

8659
02:25:50,720 --> 02:25:52,550
some of them were like no i'm not doing
this and then you get lu you get left

8660
02:25:52,550 --> 02:25:52,560
this and then you get lu you get left
 

8661
02:25:52,560 --> 02:25:54,630
this and then you get lu you get left
with the the happy dozen yeah and what

8662
02:25:54,630 --> 02:25:54,640
with the the happy dozen yeah and what
 

8663
02:25:54,640 --> 02:25:56,389
with the the happy dozen yeah and what
we did is we built this robot and doing

8664
02:25:56,389 --> 02:25:56,399
we did is we built this robot and doing
 

8665
02:25:56,399 --> 02:25:57,990
we did is we built this robot and doing
die chemistry is really easy you can

8666
02:25:57,990 --> 02:25:58,000
die chemistry is really easy you can
 

8667
02:25:58,000 --> 02:25:59,270
die chemistry is really easy you can
just take two molecules react them

8668
02:25:59,270 --> 02:25:59,280
just take two molecules react them
 

8669
02:25:59,280 --> 02:26:00,790
just take two molecules react them
together and change color

8670
02:26:00,790 --> 02:26:00,800
together and change color
 

8671
02:26:00,800 --> 02:26:02,389
together and change color
and what i wanted to do is have a

8672
02:26:02,389 --> 02:26:02,399
and what i wanted to do is have a
 

8673
02:26:02,399 --> 02:26:04,630
and what i wanted to do is have a
palette of different molecules you could

8674
02:26:04,630 --> 02:26:04,640
palette of different molecules you could
 

8675
02:26:04,640 --> 02:26:06,150
palette of different molecules you could
react commentarily and get different

8676
02:26:06,150 --> 02:26:06,160
react commentarily and get different
 

8677
02:26:06,160 --> 02:26:08,070
react commentarily and get different
colors so you've got two robots and i

8678
02:26:08,070 --> 02:26:08,080
colors so you've got two robots and i
 

8679
02:26:08,080 --> 02:26:10,469
colors so you've got two robots and i
went wouldn't it be cool if the robots

8680
02:26:10,469 --> 02:26:10,479
went wouldn't it be cool if the robots
 

8681
02:26:10,479 --> 02:26:12,630
went wouldn't it be cool if the robots
basically shared the same list of

8682
02:26:12,630 --> 02:26:12,640
basically shared the same list of
 

8683
02:26:12,640 --> 02:26:15,110
basically shared the same list of
reactions to do and they said oh and

8684
02:26:15,110 --> 02:26:15,120
reactions to do and they said oh and
 

8685
02:26:15,120 --> 02:26:16,790
reactions to do and they said oh and
because then you could do a kind of

8686
02:26:16,790 --> 02:26:16,800
because then you could do a kind of
 

8687
02:26:16,800 --> 02:26:18,070
because then you could do a kind of
multi-core

8688
02:26:18,070 --> 02:26:18,080
multi-core
 

8689
02:26:18,080 --> 02:26:19,510
multi-core
chemistry like they weren't so you have

8690
02:26:19,510 --> 02:26:19,520
chemistry like they weren't so you have
 

8691
02:26:19,520 --> 02:26:21,750
chemistry like they weren't so you have
two chemical reactions going on at once

8692
02:26:21,750 --> 02:26:21,760
two chemical reactions going on at once
 

8693
02:26:21,760 --> 02:26:23,110
two chemical reactions going on at once
and they could basically outsource the

8694
02:26:23,110 --> 02:26:23,120
and they could basically outsource the
 

8695
02:26:23,120 --> 02:26:24,790
and they could basically outsource the
problem but they're sharing the same

8696
02:26:24,790 --> 02:26:24,800
problem but they're sharing the same
 

8697
02:26:24,800 --> 02:26:27,110
problem but they're sharing the same
tape exactly okay so robot one would say

8698
02:26:27,110 --> 02:26:27,120
tape exactly okay so robot one would say
 

8699
02:26:27,120 --> 02:26:28,790
tape exactly okay so robot one would say
i'm gonna do i'm gonna do experiment one

8700
02:26:28,790 --> 02:26:28,800
i'm gonna do i'm gonna do experiment one
 

8701
02:26:28,800 --> 02:26:29,750
i'm gonna do i'm gonna do experiment one
and the other robot says how to

8702
02:26:29,750 --> 02:26:29,760
and the other robot says how to
 

8703
02:26:29,760 --> 02:26:31,830
and the other robot says how to
experiment 100. and then they co they

8704
02:26:31,830 --> 02:26:31,840
experiment 100. and then they co they
 

8705
02:26:31,840 --> 02:26:33,429
experiment 100. and then they co they
cross it off but i wanted to make it

8706
02:26:33,429 --> 02:26:33,439
cross it off but i wanted to make it
 

8707
02:26:33,439 --> 02:26:35,510
cross it off but i wanted to make it
that's brilliant by the way that is

8708
02:26:35,510 --> 02:26:35,520
that's brilliant by the way that is
 

8709
02:26:35,520 --> 02:26:37,670
that's brilliant by the way that is
genius sorry well i wanted to make it

8710
02:26:37,670 --> 02:26:37,680
genius sorry well i wanted to make it
 

8711
02:26:37,680 --> 02:26:39,750
genius sorry well i wanted to make it
groovier and i said look let's have him

8712
02:26:39,750 --> 02:26:39,760
groovier and i said look let's have him
 

8713
02:26:39,760 --> 02:26:42,469
groovier and i said look let's have him
competing yeah to make to so playing a

8714
02:26:42,469 --> 02:26:42,479
competing yeah to make to so playing a
 

8715
02:26:42,479 --> 02:26:44,950
competing yeah to make to so playing a
game of hex and so when the robot does

8716
02:26:44,950 --> 02:26:44,960
game of hex and so when the robot does
 

8717
02:26:44,960 --> 02:26:47,349
game of hex and so when the robot does
it does an experiment and the more blue

8718
02:26:47,349 --> 02:26:47,359
it does an experiment and the more blue
 

8719
02:26:47,359 --> 02:26:50,230
it does an experiment and the more blue
the die the more it gets the the chart

8720
02:26:50,230 --> 02:26:50,240
the die the more it gets the the chart
 

8721
02:26:50,240 --> 02:26:51,429
the die the more it gets the the chart
the higher chance it gets to make the

8722
02:26:51,429 --> 02:26:51,439
the higher chance it gets to make the
 

8723
02:26:51,439 --> 02:26:53,349
the higher chance it gets to make the
move it wants on the hex board

8724
02:26:53,349 --> 02:26:53,359
move it wants on the hex board
 

8725
02:26:53,359 --> 02:26:55,510
move it wants on the hex board
so if it gets a red color it's like it

8726
02:26:55,510 --> 02:26:55,520
so if it gets a red color it's like it
 

8727
02:26:55,520 --> 02:26:57,590
so if it gets a red color it's like it
gets down weighted in the other robot

8728
02:26:57,590 --> 02:26:57,600
gets down weighted in the other robot
 

8729
02:26:57,600 --> 02:26:59,030
gets down weighted in the other robot
and so what the robots could do is they

8730
02:26:59,030 --> 02:26:59,040
and so what the robots could do is they
 

8731
02:26:59,040 --> 02:27:00,870
and so what the robots could do is they
play each player move

8732
02:27:00,870 --> 02:27:00,880
play each player move
 

8733
02:27:00,880 --> 02:27:02,630
play each player move
and because the fitness function or the

8734
02:27:02,630 --> 02:27:02,640
and because the fitness function or the
 

8735
02:27:02,640 --> 02:27:04,230
and because the fitness function or the
the optimization function was to make

8736
02:27:04,230 --> 02:27:04,240
the optimization function was to make
 

8737
02:27:04,240 --> 02:27:08,550
the optimization function was to make
the color blue they started to invent um

8738
02:27:08,550 --> 02:27:08,560
the color blue they started to invent um
 

8739
02:27:08,560 --> 02:27:10,950
the color blue they started to invent um
reactions we didn't weren't on the list

8740
02:27:10,950 --> 02:27:10,960
reactions we didn't weren't on the list
 

8741
02:27:10,960 --> 02:27:12,950
reactions we didn't weren't on the list
and they did this by not cleaning

8742
02:27:12,950 --> 02:27:12,960
and they did this by not cleaning
 

8743
02:27:12,960 --> 02:27:14,790
and they did this by not cleaning
because we made cleaning optional so

8744
02:27:14,790 --> 02:27:14,800
because we made cleaning optional so
 

8745
02:27:14,800 --> 02:27:16,550
because we made cleaning optional so
when one robot realized if it didn't

8746
02:27:16,550 --> 02:27:16,560
when one robot realized if it didn't
 

8747
02:27:16,560 --> 02:27:18,230
when one robot realized if it didn't
clean its pipes it could get blue more

8748
02:27:18,230 --> 02:27:18,240
clean its pipes it could get blue more
 

8749
02:27:18,240 --> 02:27:19,750
clean its pipes it could get blue more
quickly yeah and the other robot

8750
02:27:19,750 --> 02:27:19,760
quickly yeah and the other robot
 

8751
02:27:19,760 --> 02:27:21,190
quickly yeah and the other robot
realized that so it's like getting dirty

8752
02:27:21,190 --> 02:27:21,200
realized that so it's like getting dirty
 

8753
02:27:21,200 --> 02:27:23,830
realized that so it's like getting dirty
as well and they

8754
02:27:23,830 --> 02:27:23,840
as well and they
 

8755
02:27:23,840 --> 02:27:25,590
as well and they
unintend the consequences of super

8756
02:27:25,590 --> 02:27:25,600
unintend the consequences of super
 

8757
02:27:25,600 --> 02:27:27,190
unintend the consequences of super
intelligence okay

8758
02:27:27,190 --> 02:27:27,200
intelligence okay
 

8759
02:27:27,200 --> 02:27:28,950
intelligence okay
but that was the game and we

8760
02:27:28,950 --> 02:27:28,960
but that was the game and we
 

8761
02:27:28,960 --> 02:27:30,309
but that was the game and we
communicating through twitter though

8762
02:27:30,309 --> 02:27:30,319
communicating through twitter though
 

8763
02:27:30,319 --> 02:27:31,270
communicating through twitter though
they were they were doing it through

8764
02:27:31,270 --> 02:27:31,280
they were they were doing it through
 

8765
02:27:31,280 --> 02:27:32,870
they were they were doing it through
twitter and twitter blamed them a couple

8766
02:27:32,870 --> 02:27:32,880
twitter and twitter blamed them a couple
 

8767
02:27:32,880 --> 02:27:34,070
twitter and twitter blamed them a couple
of times i said come on you've got a

8768
02:27:34,070 --> 02:27:34,080
of times i said come on you've got a
 

8769
02:27:34,080 --> 02:27:35,429
of times i said come on you've got a
couple of robots doing chemistry it's

8770
02:27:35,429 --> 02:27:35,439
couple of robots doing chemistry it's
 

8771
02:27:35,439 --> 02:27:37,349
couple of robots doing chemistry it's
really cool stop banning them yeah but

8772
02:27:37,349 --> 02:27:37,359
really cool stop banning them yeah but
 

8773
02:27:37,359 --> 02:27:38,550
really cool stop banning them yeah but
and then in the end they have we had to

8774
02:27:38,550 --> 02:27:38,560
and then in the end they have we had to
 

8775
02:27:38,560 --> 02:27:39,590
and then in the end they have we had to
take them off twitter and they just

8776
02:27:39,590 --> 02:27:39,600
take them off twitter and they just
 

8777
02:27:39,600 --> 02:27:41,429
take them off twitter and they just
communicated virus server because it was

8778
02:27:41,429 --> 02:27:41,439
communicated virus server because it was
 

8779
02:27:41,439 --> 02:27:43,190
communicated virus server because it was
just there were people saying you could

8780
02:27:43,190 --> 02:27:43,200
just there were people saying you could
 

8781
02:27:43,200 --> 02:27:45,429
just there were people saying you could
still find it cronin lab 1 and cronin

8782
02:27:45,429 --> 02:27:45,439
still find it cronin lab 1 and cronin
 

8783
02:27:45,439 --> 02:27:47,349
still find it cronin lab 1 and cronin
lab 2 on twitter and it was like make

8784
02:27:47,349 --> 02:27:47,359
lab 2 on twitter and it was like make
 

8785
02:27:47,359 --> 02:27:50,309
lab 2 on twitter and it was like make
move wait you know mix a and b wait 10

8786
02:27:50,309 --> 02:27:50,319
move wait you know mix a and b wait 10
 

8787
02:27:50,319 --> 02:27:53,910
move wait you know mix a and b wait 10
seconds yeah answer blue you know i i

8788
02:27:53,910 --> 02:27:53,920
seconds yeah answer blue you know i i
 

8789
02:27:53,920 --> 02:27:57,190
seconds yeah answer blue you know i i
really find it super compelling that

8790
02:27:57,190 --> 02:27:57,200
really find it super compelling that
 

8791
02:27:57,200 --> 02:28:00,550
really find it super compelling that
you would have a chemical entity

8792
02:28:00,550 --> 02:28:00,560
you would have a chemical entity
 

8793
02:28:00,560 --> 02:28:02,950
you would have a chemical entity
that's communicating with the world

8794
02:28:02,950 --> 02:28:02,960
that's communicating with the world
 

8795
02:28:02,960 --> 02:28:04,070
that's communicating with the world
that was one of the things i want to do

8796
02:28:04,070 --> 02:28:04,080
that was one of the things i want to do
 

8797
02:28:04,080 --> 02:28:05,910
that was one of the things i want to do
in my origin of life reaction right is

8798
02:28:05,910 --> 02:28:05,920
in my origin of life reaction right is
 

8799
02:28:05,920 --> 02:28:08,309
in my origin of life reaction right is
basically have a

8800
02:28:08,309 --> 02:28:08,319
basically have a
 

8801
02:28:08,319 --> 02:28:09,990
basically have a
have a reactor

8802
02:28:09,990 --> 02:28:10,000
have a reactor
 

8803
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:11,349
have a reactor
that's basically just randomly

8804
02:28:11,349 --> 02:28:11,359
that's basically just randomly
 

8805
02:28:11,359 --> 02:28:12,790
that's basically just randomly
enumerating through chemical space and

8806
02:28:12,790 --> 02:28:12,800
enumerating through chemical space and
 

8807
02:28:12,800 --> 02:28:14,630
enumerating through chemical space and
have some kind of cycle

8808
02:28:14,630 --> 02:28:14,640
have some kind of cycle
 

8809
02:28:14,640 --> 02:28:16,710
have some kind of cycle
and then read out what the molecules

8810
02:28:16,710 --> 02:28:16,720
and then read out what the molecules
 

8811
02:28:16,720 --> 02:28:18,710
and then read out what the molecules
reading out using a mass spectrometer

8812
02:28:18,710 --> 02:28:18,720
reading out using a mass spectrometer
 

8813
02:28:18,720 --> 02:28:20,790
reading out using a mass spectrometer
and then convert that to text and

8814
02:28:20,790 --> 02:28:20,800
and then convert that to text and
 

8815
02:28:20,800 --> 02:28:22,309
and then convert that to text and
publish it on twitter

8816
02:28:22,309 --> 02:28:22,319
publish it on twitter
 

8817
02:28:22,319 --> 02:28:25,830
publish it on twitter
and then wait until it says i'm alive

8818
02:28:25,830 --> 02:28:25,840
and then wait until it says i'm alive
 

8819
02:28:25,840 --> 02:28:27,190
and then wait until it says i'm alive
reckon that would i reckon that that

8820
02:28:27,190 --> 02:28:27,200
reckon that would i reckon that that
 

8821
02:28:27,200 --> 02:28:28,150
reckon that would i reckon that that
twitter account will get a lot of

8822
02:28:28,150 --> 02:28:28,160
twitter account will get a lot of
 

8823
02:28:28,160 --> 02:28:29,590
twitter account will get a lot of
followers yeah and i'm still trying to

8824
02:28:29,590 --> 02:28:29,600
followers yeah and i'm still trying to
 

8825
02:28:29,600 --> 02:28:30,710
followers yeah and i'm still trying to
convince my group that we should just

8826
02:28:30,710 --> 02:28:30,720
convince my group that we should just
 

8827
02:28:30,720 --> 02:28:32,469
convince my group that we should just
make an origin of life twitter account

8828
02:28:32,469 --> 02:28:32,479
make an origin of life twitter account
 

8829
02:28:32,479 --> 02:28:33,830
make an origin of life twitter account
where it's going

8830
02:28:33,830 --> 02:28:33,840
where it's going
 

8831
02:28:33,840 --> 02:28:35,910
where it's going
to be like hello testing

8832
02:28:35,910 --> 02:28:35,920
to be like hello testing
 

8833
02:28:35,920 --> 02:28:37,190
to be like hello testing
i'm here

8834
02:28:37,190 --> 02:28:37,200
i'm here
 

8835
02:28:37,200 --> 02:28:39,110
i'm here
well i'll share it i like it i

8836
02:28:39,110 --> 02:28:39,120
well i'll share it i like it i
 

8837
02:28:39,120 --> 02:28:42,790
well i'll share it i like it i
particularly enjoy this idea

8838
02:28:42,790 --> 02:28:42,800

 

8839
02:28:42,800 --> 02:28:45,990

of a non-human entity communicating with

8840
02:28:45,990 --> 02:28:46,000
of a non-human entity communicating with
 

8841
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:48,230
of a non-human entity communicating with
the world via a human designed social

8842
02:28:48,230 --> 02:28:48,240
the world via a human designed social
 

8843
02:28:48,240 --> 02:28:50,150
the world via a human designed social
network it's quite a

8844
02:28:50,150 --> 02:28:50,160
network it's quite a
 

8845
02:28:50,160 --> 02:28:55,270
network it's quite a
quite a beautiful idea

8846
02:28:55,270 --> 02:28:55,280

 

8847
02:28:55,280 --> 02:28:57,670

how we were talking about

8848
02:28:57,670 --> 02:28:57,680
how we were talking about
 

8849
02:28:57,680 --> 02:29:00,150
how we were talking about
uh ca's existing outside the human mind

8850
02:29:00,150 --> 02:29:00,160
uh ca's existing outside the human mind
 

8851
02:29:00,160 --> 02:29:02,469
uh ca's existing outside the human mind
yeah so i really admire stephen wolfram

8852
02:29:02,469 --> 02:29:02,479
yeah so i really admire stephen wolfram
 

8853
02:29:02,479 --> 02:29:04,790
yeah so i really admire stephen wolfram
i think he's a genius clearly

8854
02:29:04,790 --> 02:29:04,800
i think he's a genius clearly
 

8855
02:29:04,800 --> 02:29:06,230
i think he's a genius clearly
a genius and trapped in his actually

8856
02:29:06,230 --> 02:29:06,240
a genius and trapped in his actually
 

8857
02:29:06,240 --> 02:29:08,150
a genius and trapped in his actually
it's like a problem with being so smart

8858
02:29:08,150 --> 02:29:08,160
it's like a problem with being so smart
 

8859
02:29:08,160 --> 02:29:10,309
it's like a problem with being so smart
is you get trapped in your own you know

8860
02:29:10,309 --> 02:29:10,319
is you get trapped in your own you know
 

8861
02:29:10,319 --> 02:29:11,510
is you get trapped in your own you know
mind right

8862
02:29:11,510 --> 02:29:11,520
mind right
 

8863
02:29:11,520 --> 02:29:13,670
mind right
and i've i tried to actually i tried to

8864
02:29:13,670 --> 02:29:13,680
and i've i tried to actually i tried to
 

8865
02:29:13,680 --> 02:29:15,110
and i've i tried to actually i tried to
convince stephen that assembly theory

8866
02:29:15,110 --> 02:29:15,120
convince stephen that assembly theory
 

8867
02:29:15,120 --> 02:29:16,389
convince stephen that assembly theory
wasn't nonsense he was like no it's just

8868
02:29:16,389 --> 02:29:16,399
wasn't nonsense he was like no it's just
 

8869
02:29:16,399 --> 02:29:17,590
wasn't nonsense he was like no it's just
nonsense

8870
02:29:17,590 --> 02:29:17,600
nonsense
 

8871
02:29:17,600 --> 02:29:18,950
nonsense
i was a little bit sad by that so

8872
02:29:18,950 --> 02:29:18,960
i was a little bit sad by that so
 

8873
02:29:18,960 --> 02:29:20,870
i was a little bit sad by that so
nonsense applied even if we applied to

8874
02:29:20,870 --> 02:29:20,880
nonsense applied even if we applied to
 

8875
02:29:20,880 --> 02:29:23,190
nonsense applied even if we applied to
the simple surprise construct of a

8876
02:29:23,190 --> 02:29:23,200
the simple surprise construct of a
 

8877
02:29:23,200 --> 02:29:24,630
the simple surprise construct of a
one-dimensional cellular automata for

8878
02:29:24,630 --> 02:29:24,640
one-dimensional cellular automata for
 

8879
02:29:24,640 --> 02:29:26,150
one-dimensional cellular automata for
example yeah yeah but i mean actually

8880
02:29:26,150 --> 02:29:26,160
example yeah yeah but i mean actually
 

8881
02:29:26,160 --> 02:29:28,309
example yeah yeah but i mean actually
maybe i'm doing myself a bit too down it

8882
02:29:28,309 --> 02:29:28,319
maybe i'm doing myself a bit too down it
 

8883
02:29:28,319 --> 02:29:30,070
maybe i'm doing myself a bit too down it
was it was like it was just as a theory

8884
02:29:30,070 --> 02:29:30,080
was it was like it was just as a theory
 

8885
02:29:30,080 --> 02:29:31,349
was it was like it was just as a theory
was coming through and i didn't really

8886
02:29:31,349 --> 02:29:31,359
was coming through and i didn't really
 

8887
02:29:31,359 --> 02:29:33,830
was coming through and i didn't really
know how to explain it but but we are

8888
02:29:33,830 --> 02:29:33,840
know how to explain it but but we are
 

8889
02:29:33,840 --> 02:29:35,990
know how to explain it but but we are
going to use assembly theory cas instead

8890
02:29:35,990 --> 02:29:36,000
going to use assembly theory cas instead
 

8891
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:38,469
going to use assembly theory cas instead
of automata but i'm i wanted to

8892
02:29:38,469 --> 02:29:38,479
of automata but i'm i wanted to
 

8893
02:29:38,479 --> 02:29:40,950
of automata but i'm i wanted to
what i was really curious about is why

8894
02:29:40,950 --> 02:29:40,960
what i was really curious about is why
 

8895
02:29:40,960 --> 02:29:43,270
what i was really curious about is why
people are marvel i mean you marvel at

8896
02:29:43,270 --> 02:29:43,280
people are marvel i mean you marvel at
 

8897
02:29:43,280 --> 02:29:45,349
people are marvel i mean you marvel at
cas and their complexity and i say well

8898
02:29:45,349 --> 02:29:45,359
cas and their complexity and i say well
 

8899
02:29:45,359 --> 02:29:47,110
cas and their complexity and i say well
hang on that complexity is baked in

8900
02:29:47,110 --> 02:29:47,120
hang on that complexity is baked in
 

8901
02:29:47,120 --> 02:29:47,910
hang on that complexity is baked in
because

8902
02:29:47,910 --> 02:29:47,920
because
 

8903
02:29:47,920 --> 02:29:49,750
because
if you play the game of life

8904
02:29:49,750 --> 02:29:49,760
if you play the game of life
 

8905
02:29:49,760 --> 02:29:52,309
if you play the game of life
in a ca you have to run it on a computer

8906
02:29:52,309 --> 02:29:52,319
in a ca you have to run it on a computer
 

8907
02:29:52,319 --> 02:29:54,630
in a ca you have to run it on a computer
like you have to have a you have to do a

8908
02:29:54,630 --> 02:29:54,640
like you have to have a you have to do a
 

8909
02:29:54,640 --> 02:29:56,150
like you have to have a you have to do a
number of operations put in the boundary

8910
02:29:56,150 --> 02:29:56,160
number of operations put in the boundary
 

8911
02:29:56,160 --> 02:29:58,710
number of operations put in the boundary
conditions so is it surprising that you

8912
02:29:58,710 --> 02:29:58,720
conditions so is it surprising that you
 

8913
02:29:58,720 --> 02:30:00,070
conditions so is it surprising that you
get this structure out is it

8914
02:30:00,070 --> 02:30:00,080
get this structure out is it
 

8915
02:30:00,080 --> 02:30:02,790
get this structure out is it
manufactured by the boundary conditions

8916
02:30:02,790 --> 02:30:02,800
manufactured by the boundary conditions
 

8917
02:30:02,800 --> 02:30:05,670
manufactured by the boundary conditions
and and it is interesting because i

8918
02:30:05,670 --> 02:30:05,680
and and it is interesting because i
 

8919
02:30:05,680 --> 02:30:07,670
and and it is interesting because i
think i said um

8920
02:30:07,670 --> 02:30:07,680
think i said um
 

8921
02:30:07,680 --> 02:30:09,910
think i said um
cetera automata running them

8922
02:30:09,910 --> 02:30:09,920
cetera automata running them
 

8923
02:30:09,920 --> 02:30:11,830
cetera automata running them
uh is teaching me something about what

8924
02:30:11,830 --> 02:30:11,840
uh is teaching me something about what
 

8925
02:30:11,840 --> 02:30:13,830
uh is teaching me something about what
real numbers are and aren't

8926
02:30:13,830 --> 02:30:13,840
real numbers are and aren't
 

8927
02:30:13,840 --> 02:30:15,270
real numbers are and aren't
and i haven't quite got there yet i was

8928
02:30:15,270 --> 02:30:15,280
and i haven't quite got there yet i was
 

8929
02:30:15,280 --> 02:30:16,790
and i haven't quite got there yet i was
playing on the airplane coming over and

8930
02:30:16,790 --> 02:30:16,800
playing on the airplane coming over and
 

8931
02:30:16,800 --> 02:30:18,469
playing on the airplane coming over and
just realized i have no idea what real

8932
02:30:18,469 --> 02:30:18,479
just realized i have no idea what real
 

8933
02:30:18,479 --> 02:30:19,910
just realized i have no idea what real
numbers are really

8934
02:30:19,910 --> 02:30:19,920
numbers are really
 

8935
02:30:19,920 --> 02:30:21,190
numbers are really
and they'll say well i do actually have

8936
02:30:21,190 --> 02:30:21,200
and they'll say well i do actually have
 

8937
02:30:21,200 --> 02:30:23,190
and they'll say well i do actually have
some notion what real numbers are

8938
02:30:23,190 --> 02:30:23,200
some notion what real numbers are
 

8939
02:30:23,200 --> 02:30:24,070
some notion what real numbers are
um

8940
02:30:24,070 --> 02:30:24,080
um
 

8941
02:30:24,080 --> 02:30:26,150
um
and i think

8942
02:30:26,150 --> 02:30:26,160
and i think
 

8943
02:30:26,160 --> 02:30:28,790
and i think
thinking about real numbers as functions

8944
02:30:28,790 --> 02:30:28,800
thinking about real numbers as functions
 

8945
02:30:28,800 --> 02:30:30,870
thinking about real numbers as functions
rather than numbers is more appropriate

8946
02:30:30,870 --> 02:30:30,880
rather than numbers is more appropriate
 

8947
02:30:30,880 --> 02:30:33,349
rather than numbers is more appropriate
and then if you then apply that to cas

8948
02:30:33,349 --> 02:30:33,359
and then if you then apply that to cas
 

8949
02:30:33,359 --> 02:30:35,510
and then if you then apply that to cas
then you're saying well actually

8950
02:30:35,510 --> 02:30:35,520
then you're saying well actually
 

8951
02:30:35,520 --> 02:30:38,070
then you're saying well actually
um why am i seeing this complexity in

8952
02:30:38,070 --> 02:30:38,080
um why am i seeing this complexity in
 

8953
02:30:38,080 --> 02:30:39,830
um why am i seeing this complexity in
this in this rule

8954
02:30:39,830 --> 02:30:39,840
this in this rule
 

8955
02:30:39,840 --> 02:30:42,630
this in this rule
is it is it you know is it is it deter

8956
02:30:42,630 --> 02:30:42,640
is it is it you know is it is it deter
 

8957
02:30:42,640 --> 02:30:44,710
is it is it you know is it is it deter
you've got this deterministic system and

8958
02:30:44,710 --> 02:30:44,720
you've got this deterministic system and
 

8959
02:30:44,720 --> 02:30:47,030
you've got this deterministic system and
yet you get this incredible structure

8960
02:30:47,030 --> 02:30:47,040
yet you get this incredible structure
 

8961
02:30:47,040 --> 02:30:48,710
yet you get this incredible structure
coming out well

8962
02:30:48,710 --> 02:30:48,720
coming out well
 

8963
02:30:48,720 --> 02:30:50,630
coming out well
isn't that what you'd get with any real

8964
02:30:50,630 --> 02:30:50,640
isn't that what you'd get with any real
 

8965
02:30:50,640 --> 02:30:52,150
isn't that what you'd get with any real
number as you

8966
02:30:52,150 --> 02:30:52,160
number as you
 

8967
02:30:52,160 --> 02:30:54,150
number as you
as you apply as a function

8968
02:30:54,150 --> 02:30:54,160
as you apply as a function
 

8969
02:30:54,160 --> 02:30:55,990
as you apply as a function
and you're trying to read it out to an

8970
02:30:55,990 --> 02:30:56,000
and you're trying to read it out to an
 

8971
02:30:56,000 --> 02:30:58,309
and you're trying to read it out to an
arbitrary position

8972
02:30:58,309 --> 02:30:58,319
arbitrary position
 

8973
02:30:58,319 --> 02:31:00,150
arbitrary position
and i wonder if cas are just helping me

8974
02:31:00,150 --> 02:31:00,160
and i wonder if cas are just helping me
 

8975
02:31:00,160 --> 02:31:02,389
and i wonder if cas are just helping me
well my my misunderstanding of cas might

8976
02:31:02,389 --> 02:31:02,399
well my my misunderstanding of cas might
 

8977
02:31:02,399 --> 02:31:03,750
well my my misunderstanding of cas might
be helping me understand them in terms

8978
02:31:03,750 --> 02:31:03,760
be helping me understand them in terms
 

8979
02:31:03,760 --> 02:31:04,710
be helping me understand them in terms
of real numbers i don't know what you

8980
02:31:04,710 --> 02:31:04,720
of real numbers i don't know what you
 

8981
02:31:04,720 --> 02:31:07,429
of real numbers i don't know what you
think yeah well the funk is

8982
02:31:07,429 --> 02:31:07,439
think yeah well the funk is
 

8983
02:31:07,439 --> 02:31:08,469
think yeah well the funk is
but

8984
02:31:08,469 --> 02:31:08,479
but
 

8985
02:31:08,479 --> 02:31:11,670
but
uh the devil's in the function

8986
02:31:11,670 --> 02:31:11,680
uh the devil's in the function
 

8987
02:31:11,680 --> 02:31:13,510
uh the devil's in the function
it's like which is the function that's

8988
02:31:13,510 --> 02:31:13,520
it's like which is the function that's
 

8989
02:31:13,520 --> 02:31:15,349
it's like which is the function that's
generating your real

8990
02:31:15,349 --> 02:31:15,359
generating your real
 

8991
02:31:15,359 --> 02:31:16,870
generating your real
number

8992
02:31:16,870 --> 02:31:16,880
number
 

8993
02:31:16,880 --> 02:31:17,750
number
like

8994
02:31:17,750 --> 02:31:17,760
like
 

8995
02:31:17,760 --> 02:31:20,710
like
that it seems like it's very important

8996
02:31:20,710 --> 02:31:20,720
that it seems like it's very important
 

8997
02:31:20,720 --> 02:31:22,550
that it seems like it's very important
the specific algorithm of that function

8998
02:31:22,550 --> 02:31:22,560
the specific algorithm of that function
 

8999
02:31:22,560 --> 02:31:24,550
the specific algorithm of that function
because some lead to something super

9000
02:31:24,550 --> 02:31:24,560
because some lead to something super
 

9001
02:31:24,560 --> 02:31:26,389
because some lead to something super
trivial some lead to something that's

9002
02:31:26,389 --> 02:31:26,399
trivial some lead to something that's
 

9003
02:31:26,399 --> 02:31:28,309
trivial some lead to something that's
all chaotic and some lead to things that

9004
02:31:28,309 --> 02:31:28,319
all chaotic and some lead to things that
 

9005
02:31:28,319 --> 02:31:29,750
all chaotic and some lead to things that
are

9006
02:31:29,750 --> 02:31:29,760
are
 

9007
02:31:29,760 --> 02:31:31,910
are
just walk that

9008
02:31:31,910 --> 02:31:31,920
just walk that
 

9009
02:31:31,920 --> 02:31:34,230
just walk that
fine line of complexity and we'll take a

9010
02:31:34,230 --> 02:31:34,240
fine line of complexity and we'll take a
 

9011
02:31:34,240 --> 02:31:36,070
fine line of complexity and we'll take a
look at structure i think we agree so

9012
02:31:36,070 --> 02:31:36,080
look at structure i think we agree so
 

9013
02:31:36,080 --> 02:31:37,429
look at structure i think we agree so
let's take it back a second so take the

9014
02:31:37,429 --> 02:31:37,439
let's take it back a second so take the
 

9015
02:31:37,439 --> 02:31:39,590
let's take it back a second so take the
logistic map or something logistic

9016
02:31:39,590 --> 02:31:39,600
logistic map or something logistic
 

9017
02:31:39,600 --> 02:31:40,630
logistic map or something logistic
equation

9018
02:31:40,630 --> 02:31:40,640
equation
 

9019
02:31:40,640 --> 02:31:43,270
equation
where you have this equation which is

9020
02:31:43,270 --> 02:31:43,280
where you have this equation which is
 

9021
02:31:43,280 --> 02:31:44,230
where you have this equation which is
um

9022
02:31:44,230 --> 02:31:44,240
um
 

9023
02:31:44,240 --> 02:31:45,590
um
you don't you don't know what's gonna

9024
02:31:45,590 --> 02:31:45,600
you don't you don't know what's gonna
 

9025
02:31:45,600 --> 02:31:46,790
you don't you don't know what's gonna
happen at n plus one but once you've

9026
02:31:46,790 --> 02:31:46,800
happen at n plus one but once you've
 

9027
02:31:46,800 --> 02:31:48,870
happen at n plus one but once you've
done n plus one you know full time you

9028
02:31:48,870 --> 02:31:48,880
done n plus one you know full time you
 

9029
02:31:48,880 --> 02:31:50,309
done n plus one you know full time you
can't predict it

9030
02:31:50,309 --> 02:31:50,319
can't predict it
 

9031
02:31:50,319 --> 02:31:52,550
can't predict it
for me cas and logistic equation feel

9032
02:31:52,550 --> 02:31:52,560
for me cas and logistic equation feel
 

9033
02:31:52,560 --> 02:31:53,510
for me cas and logistic equation feel
similar

9034
02:31:53,510 --> 02:31:53,520
similar
 

9035
02:31:53,520 --> 02:31:54,309
similar
and

9036
02:31:54,309 --> 02:31:54,319
and
 

9037
02:31:54,319 --> 02:31:56,230
and
and i think what's incredibly

9038
02:31:56,230 --> 02:31:56,240
and i think what's incredibly
 

9039
02:31:56,240 --> 02:31:57,270
and i think what's incredibly
interesting

9040
02:31:57,270 --> 02:31:57,280
interesting
 

9041
02:31:57,280 --> 02:31:58,710
interesting
and i share

9042
02:31:58,710 --> 02:31:58,720
and i share
 

9043
02:31:58,720 --> 02:31:59,990
and i share
your

9044
02:31:59,990 --> 02:32:00,000
your
 

9045
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:00,870
your
kind of

9046
02:32:00,870 --> 02:32:00,880
kind of
 

9047
02:32:00,880 --> 02:32:03,750
kind of
wonder at running a ca

9048
02:32:03,750 --> 02:32:03,760
wonder at running a ca
 

9049
02:32:03,760 --> 02:32:05,349
wonder at running a ca
but also i'm saying well what is it

9050
02:32:05,349 --> 02:32:05,359
but also i'm saying well what is it
 

9051
02:32:05,359 --> 02:32:06,630
but also i'm saying well what is it
about the boundary conditions and the

9052
02:32:06,630 --> 02:32:06,640
about the boundary conditions and the
 

9053
02:32:06,640 --> 02:32:08,870
about the boundary conditions and the
way i'm running that calculation so in

9054
02:32:08,870 --> 02:32:08,880
way i'm running that calculation so in
 

9055
02:32:08,880 --> 02:32:10,710
way i'm running that calculation so in
my group with my team we actually made a

9056
02:32:10,710 --> 02:32:10,720
my group with my team we actually made a
 

9057
02:32:10,720 --> 02:32:13,110
my group with my team we actually made a
chemical ca we made game of life we

9058
02:32:13,110 --> 02:32:13,120
chemical ca we made game of life we
 

9059
02:32:13,120 --> 02:32:15,270
chemical ca we made game of life we
actually made a physical grid i haven't

9060
02:32:15,270 --> 02:32:15,280
actually made a physical grid i haven't
 

9061
02:32:15,280 --> 02:32:16,389
actually made a physical grid i haven't
been able to publish this paper it's

9062
02:32:16,389 --> 02:32:16,399
been able to publish this paper it's
 

9063
02:32:16,399 --> 02:32:18,389
been able to publish this paper it's
been trapped in purgatory for a long

9064
02:32:18,389 --> 02:32:18,399
been trapped in purgatory for a long
 

9065
02:32:18,399 --> 02:32:20,630
been trapped in purgatory for a long
time but we wrote up a paper how to do a

9066
02:32:20,630 --> 02:32:20,640
time but we wrote up a paper how to do a
 

9067
02:32:20,640 --> 02:32:22,870
time but we wrote up a paper how to do a
chemical formulation of the game of life

9068
02:32:22,870 --> 02:32:22,880
chemical formulation of the game of life
 

9069
02:32:22,880 --> 02:32:24,469
chemical formulation of the game of life
which we made a chemical computer and

9070
02:32:24,469 --> 02:32:24,479
which we made a chemical computer and
 

9071
02:32:24,479 --> 02:32:26,230
which we made a chemical computer and
one of little cells and i was playing

9072
02:32:26,230 --> 02:32:26,240
one of little cells and i was playing
 

9073
02:32:26,240 --> 02:32:28,389
one of little cells and i was playing
game of life with a bz reaction so each

9074
02:32:28,389 --> 02:32:28,399
game of life with a bz reaction so each
 

9075
02:32:28,399 --> 02:32:30,309
game of life with a bz reaction so each
cell would pulse on and off on and off

9076
02:32:30,309 --> 02:32:30,319
cell would pulse on and off on and off
 

9077
02:32:30,319 --> 02:32:32,630
cell would pulse on and off on and off
on and off we have little stirrer bars

9078
02:32:32,630 --> 02:32:32,640
on and off we have little stirrer bars
 

9079
02:32:32,640 --> 02:32:34,550
on and off we have little stirrer bars
and we have little gates yeah and we

9080
02:32:34,550 --> 02:32:34,560
and we have little gates yeah and we
 

9081
02:32:34,560 --> 02:32:36,870
and we have little gates yeah and we
actually played conway's game of life in

9082
02:32:36,870 --> 02:32:36,880
actually played conway's game of life in
 

9083
02:32:36,880 --> 02:32:38,870
actually played conway's game of life in
there and we got structures in that we

9084
02:32:38,870 --> 02:32:38,880
there and we got structures in that we
 

9085
02:32:38,880 --> 02:32:41,270
there and we got structures in that we
got structures in that game from the

9086
02:32:41,270 --> 02:32:41,280
got structures in that game from the
 

9087
02:32:41,280 --> 02:32:42,790
got structures in that game from the
chemistry that you wouldn't expect from

9088
02:32:42,790 --> 02:32:42,800
chemistry that you wouldn't expect from
 

9089
02:32:42,800 --> 02:32:44,230
chemistry that you wouldn't expect from
the actual ca

9090
02:32:44,230 --> 02:32:44,240
the actual ca
 

9091
02:32:44,240 --> 02:32:46,550
the actual ca
so that's kind of cool in the um because

9092
02:32:46,550 --> 02:32:46,560
so that's kind of cool in the um because
 

9093
02:32:46,560 --> 02:32:48,230
so that's kind of cool in the um because
they're they're they're interacting

9094
02:32:48,230 --> 02:32:48,240
they're they're they're interacting
 

9095
02:32:48,240 --> 02:32:50,790
they're they're they're interacting
outside of the cell smile or so what's

9096
02:32:50,790 --> 02:32:50,800
outside of the cell smile or so what's
 

9097
02:32:50,800 --> 02:32:52,389
outside of the cell smile or so what's
happening is you're getting noise so the

9098
02:32:52,389 --> 02:32:52,399
happening is you're getting noise so the
 

9099
02:32:52,399 --> 02:32:53,510
happening is you're getting noise so the
thing is

9100
02:32:53,510 --> 02:32:53,520
thing is
 

9101
02:32:53,520 --> 02:32:55,349
thing is
that you've got this bz reaction that

9102
02:32:55,349 --> 02:32:55,359
that you've got this bz reaction that
 

9103
02:32:55,359 --> 02:32:57,190
that you've got this bz reaction that
gives on off on off on off but there's

9104
02:32:57,190 --> 02:32:57,200
gives on off on off on off but there's
 

9105
02:32:57,200 --> 02:32:58,710
gives on off on off on off but there's
also a wake

9106
02:32:58,710 --> 02:32:58,720
also a wake
 

9107
02:32:58,720 --> 02:33:00,790
also a wake
and those wakes constructively interfere

9108
02:33:00,790 --> 02:33:00,800
and those wakes constructively interfere
 

9109
02:33:00,800 --> 02:33:01,510
and those wakes constructively interfere
or

9110
02:33:01,510 --> 02:33:01,520
or
 

9111
02:33:01,520 --> 02:33:03,830
or
in such a non-trivial way

9112
02:33:03,830 --> 02:33:03,840
in such a non-trivial way
 

9113
02:33:03,840 --> 02:33:05,510
in such a non-trivial way
that that's

9114
02:33:05,510 --> 02:33:05,520
that that's
 

9115
02:33:05,520 --> 02:33:07,590
that that's
non-deterministic

9116
02:33:07,590 --> 02:33:07,600
non-deterministic
 

9117
02:33:07,600 --> 02:33:09,990
non-deterministic
and the non-determinism in in in the

9118
02:33:09,990 --> 02:33:10,000
and the non-determinism in in in the

was wondering if i could physically make

9122
02:33:14,070 --> 02:33:14,080
was wondering if i could physically make
 

9123
02:33:14,080 --> 02:33:18,469
was wondering if i could physically make
a chemical computer with this ca um that

9124
02:33:18,469 --> 02:33:18,479
a chemical computer with this ca um that
 

9125
02:33:18,479 --> 02:33:20,309
a chemical computer with this ca um that
gives me something different that i

9126
02:33:20,309 --> 02:33:20,319
gives me something different that i
 

9127
02:33:20,319 --> 02:33:22,870
gives me something different that i

because you don't have the noise

9134
02:33:28,870 --> 02:33:28,880
because you don't have the noise
 

9135
02:33:28,880 --> 02:33:30,870
because you don't have the noise
trailing into the next round you just

9136
02:33:30,870 --> 02:33:30,880
trailing into the next round you just
 

9137
02:33:30,880 --> 02:33:33,110
trailing into the next round you just
have the state so the the paper in

9138
02:33:33,110 --> 02:33:33,120
have the state so the the paper in
 

9139
02:33:33,120 --> 02:33:35,750
have the state so the the paper in
particular so it's just a beautiful idea

discretely as they come the bz reaction
 

9187
02:34:26,880 --> 02:34:28,710
discretely as they come the bz reaction
so just to say the bz reaction is a

9188
02:34:28,710 --> 02:34:28,720
so just to say the bz reaction is a
 

9189
02:34:28,720 --> 02:34:30,870
so just to say the bz reaction is a
chemical oscillator and what happens in

9190
02:34:30,870 --> 02:34:30,880
chemical oscillator and what happens in
 

9191
02:34:30,880 --> 02:34:32,710
chemical oscillator and what happens in
each cell is it goes between red and

02:34:32,710 --> 02:34:32,720
each cell is it goes between red and
 

9193
02:34:32,720 --> 02:34:35,110
each cell is it goes between red and
blue so two russians discovered it blues

proposed it and everyone said you're

9198
02:34:39,110 --> 02:34:39,120
proposed it and everyone said you're
 

9199
02:34:39,120 --> 02:34:40,630
proposed it and everyone said you're
crazy it breaks the second law and

9200
02:34:40,630 --> 02:34:40,640
crazy it breaks the second law and
 

9201
02:34:40,640 --> 02:34:42,230
crazy it breaks the second law and
zabasinski said no it doesn't break the

9202
02:34:42,230 --> 02:34:42,240
zabasinski said no it doesn't break the
 

9203
02:34:42,240 --> 02:34:45,110
zabasinski said no it doesn't break the
second law it's consuming a fuel

9204
02:34:45,110 --> 02:34:45,120
second law it's consuming a fuel
 

9205
02:34:45,120 --> 02:34:47,429
second law it's consuming a fuel
and so and then and and it's a like

9206
02:34:47,429 --> 02:34:47,439
and so and then and and it's a like
 

9207
02:34:47,439 --> 02:34:49,990
and so and then and and it's a like
there's a lot of uh um uh chemistry

9208

there's a lot of uh um uh chemistry
 

9209
02:34:50,000 --> 02:34:51,190
there's a lot of uh um uh chemistry
hidden in the russian literature

9210
02:34:51,190 --> 02:34:51,200
hidden in the russian literature
 

9211
02:34:51,200 --> 02:34:53,429
hidden in the russian literature
actually that just because

9212
02:34:53,429 --> 02:34:53,439
actually that just because
 

9213
02:34:53,439 --> 02:34:54,710
actually that just because
russians just wrote it in russian they

9214
02:34:54,710 --> 02:34:54,720
russians just wrote it in russian they
 

9215
02:34:54,720 --> 02:34:55,830
russians just wrote it in russian they
didn't publish in english speaking

9216
02:34:55,830 --> 02:34:55,840
didn't publish in english speaking
 

9217
02:34:55,840 --> 02:34:57,750
didn't publish in english speaking
journalism it's heartbreaking actually

9218
02:34:57,750 --> 02:34:57,760

9219
02:34:57,760 --> 02:34:58,950
journalism it's heartbreaking actually
yeah it's

9220
02:34:58,950 --> 02:34:58,960
yeah it's
 

9221
02:34:58,960 --> 02:35:00,469
yeah it's
yeah sad and

9222
02:35:00,469 --> 02:35:00,479
yeah sad and
 

9223
02:35:00,479 --> 02:35:01,910
yeah sad and
it's great it's there right it's not

9224
02:35:01,910 --> 02:35:01,920
it's great it's there right it's not
 

9225
02:35:01,920 --> 02:35:03,510
it's great it's there right it's not
lost i'm sure we will find a way of

9226
02:35:03,510 --> 02:35:03,520
lost i'm sure we will find a way of
 

9227
02:35:03,520 --> 02:35:06,230
lost i'm sure we will find a way of
translating it properly well the

9228
02:35:06,230 --> 02:35:06,240

02:35:08,790 --> 02:35:08,800
silver lining slash greater sadness of
 

9231
02:35:08,800 --> 02:35:11,110
silver lining slash greater sadness of
all of this is there's probably ideas in

9232
02:35:11,110 --> 02:35:11,120
all of this is there's probably ideas in
 

9233
02:35:11,120 --> 02:35:13,990
all of this is there's probably ideas in
in english speaking like there's ideas

9234
02:35:13,990 --> 02:35:14,000
in english speaking like there's ideas
 

9235
02:35:14,000 --> 02:35:16,230
in english speaking like there's ideas
in certain disciplines

9236
02:35:16,230 --> 02:35:16,240
in certain disciplines
 

9237
02:35:16,240 --> 02:35:17,190
in certain disciplines
that

9238
02:35:17,190 --> 02:35:17,200
that
 

9239
02:35:17,200 --> 02:35:19,990
that
if discovered by other disciplines

9240
02:35:19,990 --> 02:35:20,000
if discovered by other disciplines
 

9241
02:35:20,000 --> 02:35:21,750
if discovered by other disciplines
would crack open some of the biggest

9242
02:35:21,750 --> 02:35:21,760
would crack open some of the biggest
 

9243
02:35:21,760 --> 02:35:24,309
would crack open some of the biggest
mysteries in those disciplines like

9244
02:35:24,309 --> 02:35:24,319
mysteries in those disciplines like
 

9245
02:35:24,319 --> 02:35:27,270
mysteries in those disciplines like
computer science for example it's

9246
02:35:27,270 --> 02:35:27,280
computer science for example it's
 

9247
02:35:27,280 --> 02:35:28,150
computer science for example it's
uh

9248
02:35:28,150 --> 02:35:28,160
uh
 

9249
02:35:28,160 --> 02:35:29,510
uh
trying to solve

9250
02:35:29,510 --> 02:35:29,520
trying to solve
 

9251
02:35:29,520 --> 02:35:31,270
trying to solve
problems like nobody else has ever tried

9252
02:35:31,270 --> 02:35:31,280
problems like nobody else has ever tried
 

9253
02:35:31,280 --> 02:35:32,710
problems like nobody else has ever tried
to solve problems

9254
02:35:32,710 --> 02:35:32,720
to solve problems
 

9255
02:35:32,720 --> 02:35:34,630
to solve problems
as as if it's not already been all

9256
02:35:34,630 --> 02:35:34,640
as as if it's not already been all
 

9257
02:35:34,640 --> 02:35:36,469
as as if it's not already been all
addressed in cognitive science and

9258
02:35:36,469 --> 02:35:36,479
addressed in cognitive science and
 

9259
02:35:36,479 --> 02:35:39,670

and uh just whatever you want to

9262
02:35:41,349 --> 02:35:41,359
and uh just whatever you want to
 

9263
02:35:41,359 --> 02:35:43,910
and uh just whatever you want to
economics even but if if you look into

9264
02:35:43,910 --> 02:35:43,920
economics even but if if you look into
 

9265
02:35:43,920 --> 02:35:45,190
economics even but if if you look into
that literature you might be able to

9266
02:35:45,190 --> 02:35:45,200
that literature you might be able to
 

9267
02:35:45,200 --> 02:35:47,510
that literature you might be able to
just discover some beautiful ideas

9268
02:35:47,510 --> 02:35:47,520
just discover some beautiful ideas
 

9269
02:35:47,520 --> 02:35:49,910
just discover some beautiful ideas
obviously russian is uh

9270
02:35:49,910 --> 02:35:49,920
obviously russian is uh
 

9271
02:35:49,920 --> 02:35:51,510
obviously russian is uh
is an interesting case of that's because

9272
02:35:51,510 --> 02:35:51,520
is an interesting case of that's because
 

9273
02:35:51,520 --> 02:35:53,670
is an interesting case of that's because
there's a lawson translation but he said

9274
02:35:53,670 --> 02:35:53,680
there's a lawson translation but he said
 

9275
02:35:53,680 --> 02:35:55,830
there's a lawson translation but he said
there's a source of

9276
02:35:55,830 --> 02:35:55,840
there's a source of
 

9277
02:35:55,840 --> 02:35:58,150
there's a source of
fuel source of energy yeah yeah so with

9278
02:35:58,150 --> 02:35:58,160
fuel source of energy yeah yeah so with
 

9279
02:35:58,160 --> 02:36:00,309
fuel source of energy yeah yeah so with
the bz reaction you have a you have a an

9280
02:36:00,309 --> 02:36:00,319
the bz reaction you have a you have a an
 

9281
02:36:00,319 --> 02:36:02,309
the bz reaction you have a you have a an
acid in there called malonic acid yeah

9282
02:36:02,309 --> 02:36:02,319
acid in there called malonic acid yeah
 

9283
02:36:02,319 --> 02:36:04,469
acid in there called malonic acid yeah
and what happens is it it when it react

9284
02:36:04,469 --> 02:36:04,479
and what happens is it it when it react
 

9285
02:36:04,479 --> 02:36:05,510
and what happens is it it when it react
when it

9286
02:36:05,510 --> 02:36:05,520
when it
 

9287
02:36:05,520 --> 02:36:07,349
when it
power it's basically like a battery that

9288
02:36:07,349 --> 02:36:07,359
power it's basically like a battery that
 

9289
02:36:07,359 --> 02:36:08,389
power it's basically like a battery that
powers it

9290
02:36:08,389 --> 02:36:08,399
powers it
 

9291
02:36:08,399 --> 02:36:10,630
powers it
and it loses co2 so decarboxylates it's

9292
02:36:10,630 --> 02:36:10,640
and it loses co2 so decarboxylates it's
 

9293
02:36:10,640 --> 02:36:12,309
and it loses co2 so decarboxylates it's
just a chemical reaction what that means

9294
02:36:12,309 --> 02:36:12,319
just a chemical reaction what that means
 

9295
02:36:12,319 --> 02:36:14,710
just a chemical reaction what that means
we have to do is continuously feed or we

9296
02:36:14,710 --> 02:36:14,720
we have to do is continuously feed or we
 

9297
02:36:14,720 --> 02:36:16,950
we have to do is continuously feed or we
just keep the bz reaction going in a in

9298
02:36:16,950 --> 02:36:16,960
just keep the bz reaction going in a in
 

9299
02:36:16,960 --> 02:36:19,590
just keep the bz reaction going in a in
a long enough time so it's it's like

9300
02:36:19,590 --> 02:36:19,600
a long enough time so it's it's like
 

9301
02:36:19,600 --> 02:36:22,469
a long enough time so it's it's like
it's reversible in time

9302
02:36:22,469 --> 02:36:22,479
it's reversible in time
 

9303
02:36:22,479 --> 02:36:24,790
it's reversible in time
but only like yeah

9304
02:36:24,790 --> 02:36:24,800
but only like yeah
 

9305
02:36:24,800 --> 02:36:26,790
but only like yeah
but um but it's fascinating i mean the

9306
02:36:26,790 --> 02:36:26,800
but um but it's fascinating i mean the
 

9307
02:36:26,800 --> 02:36:28,790
but um but it's fascinating i mean the
team that did it i'm really proud of

9308
02:36:28,790 --> 02:36:28,800
team that did it i'm really proud of
 

9309
02:36:28,800 --> 02:36:30,950
team that did it i'm really proud of
their persistence we made a we made a

9310
02:36:30,950 --> 02:36:30,960
their persistence we made a we made a
 

9311
02:36:30,960 --> 02:36:33,110
their persistence we made a we made a
chemical computer um

9312
02:36:33,110 --> 02:36:33,120
chemical computer um
 

9313
02:36:33,120 --> 02:36:34,389
chemical computer um
it can solve little problems it can

9314
02:36:34,389 --> 02:36:34,399
it can solve little problems it can
 

9315
02:36:34,399 --> 02:36:35,830
it can solve little problems it can
solve travelling salesman problems

9316
02:36:35,830 --> 02:36:35,840
solve travelling salesman problems
 

9317
02:36:35,840 --> 02:36:38,550
solve travelling salesman problems
actually nice um but like i said it's co

9318
02:36:38,550 --> 02:36:38,560
actually nice um but like i said it's co
 

9319
02:36:38,560 --> 02:36:40,070
actually nice um but like i said it's co
it's not any faster than a regular

9320
02:36:40,070 --> 02:36:40,080
it's not any faster than a regular
 

9321
02:36:40,080 --> 02:36:42,630
it's not any faster than a regular
computer is there is there something you

9322
02:36:42,630 --> 02:36:42,640
computer is there is there something you
 

9323
02:36:42,640 --> 02:36:45,270
computer is there is there something you
can do maybe i'm not sure

9324
02:36:45,270 --> 02:36:45,280
can do maybe i'm not sure
 

9325
02:36:45,280 --> 02:36:47,429
can do maybe i'm not sure
i'm not i think we can come up with a

9326
02:36:47,429 --> 02:36:47,439
i'm not i think we can come up with a
 

9327
02:36:47,439 --> 02:36:49,590
i'm not i think we can come up with a
way of solving problems

9328
02:36:49,590 --> 02:36:49,600
way of solving problems
 

9329
02:36:49,600 --> 02:36:52,469
way of solving problems
also really complex hard ones

9330
02:36:52,469 --> 02:36:52,479
also really complex hard ones
 

9331
02:36:52,479 --> 02:36:53,990
also really complex hard ones
um

9332
02:36:53,990 --> 02:36:54,000
um
 

9333
02:36:54,000 --> 02:36:55,750
um
because it's an analog computer and we

9334
02:36:55,750 --> 02:36:55,760
because it's an analog computer and we
 

9335
02:36:55,760 --> 02:36:57,349
because it's an analog computer and we
can we can

9336
02:36:57,349 --> 02:36:57,359
can we can
 

9337
02:36:57,359 --> 02:36:59,110
can we can
the it can energy minimize really

9338
02:36:59,110 --> 02:36:59,120
the it can energy minimize really
 

9339
02:36:59,120 --> 02:37:00,550
the it can energy minimize really
quickly it doesn't have to basically go

9340
02:37:00,550 --> 02:37:00,560
quickly it doesn't have to basically go
 

9341
02:37:00,560 --> 02:37:02,469
quickly it doesn't have to basically go
through every element in the matrix

9342
02:37:02,469 --> 02:37:02,479
through every element in the matrix
 

9343
02:37:02,479 --> 02:37:03,270
through every element in the matrix
like

9344
02:37:03,270 --> 02:37:03,280
like
 

9345
02:37:03,280 --> 02:37:05,750
like
flip it it just reads out so we can

9346
02:37:05,750 --> 02:37:05,760
flip it it just reads out so we can
 

9347
02:37:05,760 --> 02:37:08,710
flip it it just reads out so we can
actually do monte carlo by just

9348
02:37:08,710 --> 02:37:08,720
actually do monte carlo by just
 

9349
02:37:08,720 --> 02:37:10,469
actually do monte carlo by just
shaking the box

9350
02:37:10,469 --> 02:37:10,479
shaking the box
 

9351
02:37:10,479 --> 02:37:12,870
shaking the box
it's literally a box shaker

9352
02:37:12,870 --> 02:37:12,880
it's literally a box shaker
 

9353
02:37:12,880 --> 02:37:13,990
it's literally a box shaker
you don't actually have to encode the

9354
02:37:13,990 --> 02:37:14,000
you don't actually have to encode the
 

9355
02:37:14,000 --> 02:37:15,750
you don't actually have to encode the
shaking of the box in a silicon memory

9356
02:37:15,750 --> 02:37:15,760
shaking of the box in a silicon memory
 

9357
02:37:15,760 --> 02:37:17,349
shaking of the box in a silicon memory
and then just shuffle everything around

9358
02:37:17,349 --> 02:37:17,359
and then just shuffle everything around
 

9359
02:37:17,359 --> 02:37:19,190
and then just shuffle everything around
yeah and you can tell analog it's

9360
02:37:19,190 --> 02:37:19,200
yeah and you can tell analog it's
 

9361
02:37:19,200 --> 02:37:20,309
yeah and you can tell analog it's
natural so

9362
02:37:20,309 --> 02:37:20,319
natural so
 

9363
02:37:20,319 --> 02:37:23,349
natural so
it's a uh it's an organic computer

9364
02:37:23,349 --> 02:37:23,359
it's a uh it's an organic computer
 

9365
02:37:23,359 --> 02:37:25,030
it's a uh it's an organic computer
yeah yeah so we're so i was playing

9366
02:37:25,030 --> 02:37:25,040
yeah yeah so we're so i was playing
 

9367
02:37:25,040 --> 02:37:26,230
yeah yeah so we're so i was playing
around with this and i was kind of

9368
02:37:26,230 --> 02:37:26,240
around with this and i was kind of
 

9369
02:37:26,240 --> 02:37:27,429
around with this and i was kind of
annoying some of my colleagues i'm

9370
02:37:27,429 --> 02:37:27,439
annoying some of my colleagues i'm
 

9371
02:37:27,439 --> 02:37:29,110
annoying some of my colleagues i'm
wondering if we could get to chemical

9372
02:37:29,110 --> 02:37:29,120
wondering if we could get to chemical
 

9373
02:37:29,120 --> 02:37:31,670
wondering if we could get to chemical
supremacy like quantum supremacy and i

9374
02:37:31,670 --> 02:37:31,680
supremacy like quantum supremacy and i
 

9375
02:37:31,680 --> 02:37:34,150
supremacy like quantum supremacy and i
kind of calculated how big

9376
02:37:34,150 --> 02:37:34,160
kind of calculated how big
 

9377
02:37:34,160 --> 02:37:34,870
kind of calculated how big
the

9378
02:37:34,870 --> 02:37:34,880
the
 

9379
02:37:34,880 --> 02:37:36,790
the
grid has to be so we can actually start

9380
02:37:36,790 --> 02:37:36,800
grid has to be so we can actually start
 

9381
02:37:36,800 --> 02:37:38,389
grid has to be so we can actually start
to solve problems faster than the

9382
02:37:38,389 --> 02:37:38,399
to solve problems faster than the
 

9383
02:37:38,399 --> 02:37:41,590
to solve problems faster than the
silicon computer but i'm not willing to

9384
02:37:41,590 --> 02:37:41,600
silicon computer but i'm not willing to
 

9385
02:37:41,600 --> 02:37:43,510
silicon computer but i'm not willing to
um to state how that is yet because i'm

9386
02:37:43,510 --> 02:37:43,520
um to state how that is yet because i'm
 

9387
02:37:43,520 --> 02:37:45,830
um to state how that is yet because i'm
probably wrong it's not that i'm it's

9388
02:37:45,830 --> 02:37:45,840
probably wrong it's not that i'm it's
 

9389
02:37:45,840 --> 02:37:47,910
probably wrong it's not that i'm it's
any top secret thing is i want i think i

9390
02:37:47,910 --> 02:37:47,920
any top secret thing is i want i think i
 

9391
02:37:47,920 --> 02:37:49,670
any top secret thing is i want i think i
can make a chemical computer that can

9392
02:37:49,670 --> 02:37:49,680
can make a chemical computer that can
 

9393
02:37:49,680 --> 02:37:51,750
can make a chemical computer that can
solve optimization problems faster than

9394
02:37:51,750 --> 02:37:51,760
solve optimization problems faster than
 

9395
02:37:51,760 --> 02:37:53,990
solve optimization problems faster than
the silicon computer

9396
02:37:53,990 --> 02:37:54,000
the silicon computer
 

9397
02:37:54,000 --> 02:37:56,230
the silicon computer
that's fascinating and but then you're

9398
02:37:56,230 --> 02:37:56,240
that's fascinating and but then you're
 

9399
02:37:56,240 --> 02:37:58,150
that's fascinating and but then you're
unsure how big that has to be yeah i

9400
02:37:58,150 --> 02:37:58,160
unsure how big that has to be yeah i
 

9401
02:37:58,160 --> 02:37:59,910
unsure how big that has to be yeah i
think i mean it might be a big box hard

9402
02:37:59,910 --> 02:37:59,920
think i mean it might be a big box hard
 

9403
02:37:59,920 --> 02:38:02,309
think i mean it might be a big box hard
to shake it might be exactly a big box

9404
02:38:02,309 --> 02:38:02,319
to shake it might be exactly a big box
 

9405
02:38:02,319 --> 02:38:05,030
to shake it might be exactly a big box
hard to shake and basically a bit sloppy

9406
02:38:05,030 --> 02:38:05,040
hard to shake and basically a bit sloppy
 

9407
02:38:05,040 --> 02:38:08,230
hard to shake and basically a bit sloppy
did we answer the the question about uh

9408
02:38:08,230 --> 02:38:08,240
did we answer the the question about uh
 

9409
02:38:08,240 --> 02:38:11,190
did we answer the the question about uh
do uh cellular exist outside the mind

9410
02:38:11,190 --> 02:38:11,200
do uh cellular exist outside the mind
 

9411
02:38:11,200 --> 02:38:13,510
do uh cellular exist outside the mind
we didn't but i would i would posit that

9412
02:38:13,510 --> 02:38:13,520
we didn't but i would i would posit that
 

9413
02:38:13,520 --> 02:38:14,389
we didn't but i would i would posit that
they don't

9414
02:38:14,389 --> 02:38:14,399
they don't
 

9415
02:38:14,399 --> 02:38:15,830
they don't
and i i and

9416
02:38:15,830 --> 02:38:15,840
and i i and
 

9417
02:38:15,840 --> 02:38:18,230
and i i and
but i think minds can well so the mind

9418
02:38:18,230 --> 02:38:18,240
but i think minds can well so the mind
 

9419
02:38:18,240 --> 02:38:19,670
but i think minds can well so the mind
is fundamental

9420
02:38:19,670 --> 02:38:19,680
is fundamental
 

9421
02:38:19,680 --> 02:38:22,230
is fundamental
what's the what i mean well i mean sorry

9422
02:38:22,230 --> 02:38:22,240
what's the what i mean well i mean sorry
 

9423
02:38:22,240 --> 02:38:24,389
what's the what i mean well i mean sorry
let's go to the back so as a physical

9424
02:38:24,389 --> 02:38:24,399
let's go to the back so as a physical
 

9425
02:38:24,399 --> 02:38:26,710
let's go to the back so as a physical
phenomena do cas exist in physical

9426
02:38:26,710 --> 02:38:26,720
phenomena do cas exist in physical
 

9427
02:38:26,720 --> 02:38:29,830
phenomena do cas exist in physical
reality right i would say they probably

9428
02:38:29,830 --> 02:38:29,840
reality right i would say they probably
 

9429
02:38:29,840 --> 02:38:31,990
reality right i would say they probably
don't exist outside the human mind but

9430
02:38:31,990 --> 02:38:32,000
don't exist outside the human mind but
 

9431
02:38:32,000 --> 02:38:33,429
don't exist outside the human mind but
now i've constructed them they exist in

9432
02:38:33,429 --> 02:38:33,439
now i've constructed them they exist in
 

9433
02:38:33,439 --> 02:38:35,590
now i've constructed them they exist in
computer memories they exist in my lab

9434
02:38:35,590 --> 02:38:35,600
computer memories they exist in my lab
 

9435
02:38:35,600 --> 02:38:38,230
computer memories they exist in my lab
they exist on paper so they are they

9436

emerge from the human mind

9438
02:38:40,550 --> 02:38:40,560

i'm just interested in because stephen

9440
02:38:42,550 --> 02:38:42,560
i'm just interested in because stephen
 

9441
02:38:42,560 --> 02:38:44,389
i'm just interested in because stephen
wolfram likes cas a lot of people like

9442
02:38:44,389 --> 02:38:44,399
wolfram likes cas a lot of people like
 

9443
02:38:44,399 --> 02:38:46,389
wolfram likes cas a lot of people like
cas and likes to think of them as

9444
02:38:46,389 --> 02:38:46,399
cas and likes to think of them as
 

9445
02:38:46,399 --> 02:38:49,190
cas and likes to think of them as
minimal computational elements

9446
02:38:49,190 --> 02:38:49,200
minimal computational elements
 

9447
02:38:49,200 --> 02:38:51,349
minimal computational elements
i'm just saying well do they exist in

9448
02:38:51,349 --> 02:38:51,359
i'm just saying well do they exist in
 

9449
02:38:51,359 --> 02:38:53,270
i'm just saying well do they exist in
reality or are they a representation of

9450
02:38:53,270 --> 02:38:53,280
reality or are they a representation of
 

9451
02:38:53,280 --> 02:38:54,710
reality or are they a representation of
a simple machine that's just very

9452
02:38:54,710 --> 02:38:54,720
a simple machine that's just very
 

9453
02:38:54,720 --> 02:38:57,349
a simple machine that's just very
elegant to implement

9454
02:38:57,349 --> 02:38:57,359
elegant to implement
 

9455
02:38:57,359 --> 02:38:59,110
elegant to implement
so it's a platonic question i guess yeah

9456
02:38:59,110 --> 02:38:59,120
so it's a platonic question i guess yeah
 

9457
02:38:59,120 --> 02:39:01,270
so it's a platonic question i guess yeah
i mean it's

9458
02:39:01,270 --> 02:39:01,280
i mean it's
 

9459
02:39:01,280 --> 02:39:03,030
i mean it's
there's initial conditions

9460
02:39:03,030 --> 02:39:03,040
there's initial conditions
 

9461
02:39:03,040 --> 02:39:05,190
there's initial conditions
there's a memory in the system

9462
02:39:05,190 --> 02:39:05,200
there's a memory in the system
 

9463
02:39:05,200 --> 02:39:07,349
there's a memory in the system
there are simple rules that dictate the

9464
02:39:07,349 --> 02:39:07,359
there are simple rules that dictate the
 

9465
02:39:07,359 --> 02:39:09,030
there are simple rules that dictate the
evolution of the system

9466
02:39:09,030 --> 02:39:09,040
evolution of the system
 

9467
02:39:09,040 --> 02:39:12,710
evolution of the system
so what exists the idea the rules the

9468
02:39:12,710 --> 02:39:12,720
so what exists the idea the rules the
 

9469
02:39:12,720 --> 02:39:15,349
so what exists the idea the rules the
yeah people are using cas as models for

9470
02:39:15,349 --> 02:39:15,359
yeah people are using cas as models for
 

9471
02:39:15,359 --> 02:39:17,830
yeah people are using cas as models for
things in reality to say hey

9472
02:39:17,830 --> 02:39:17,840
things in reality to say hey
 

9473
02:39:17,840 --> 02:39:20,230
things in reality to say hey
look you can you can do this thing in a

9474
02:39:20,230 --> 02:39:20,240
look you can you can do this thing in a
 

9475
02:39:20,240 --> 02:39:21,429
look you can you can do this thing in a
ca

9476
02:39:21,429 --> 02:39:21,439
ca
 

9477
02:39:21,439 --> 02:39:23,750
ca
and my my when i see this i'm saying oh

9478
02:39:23,750 --> 02:39:23,760
and my my when i see this i'm saying oh
 

9479
02:39:23,760 --> 02:39:25,270
and my my when i see this i'm saying oh
that's cool but what does that tell me

9480
02:39:25,270 --> 02:39:25,280
that's cool but what does that tell me
 

9481
02:39:25,280 --> 02:39:28,790
that's cool but what does that tell me
about reality where's the ca in in space

9482
02:39:28,790 --> 02:39:28,800
about reality where's the ca in in space
 

9483
02:39:28,800 --> 02:39:30,950
about reality where's the ca in in space
right it's a mathematical object so for

02:39:30,950 --> 02:39:30,960
right it's a mathematical object so for
 

9485
02:39:30,960 --> 02:39:32,870
right it's a mathematical object so for
people who don't know cellular automata

people who don't know cellular automata
there's a is usually a grid whether it's

one-dimensional two-dimensional or
 

9491
02:39:36,080 --> 02:39:38,150
one-dimensional two-dimensional or
three-dimensional and it evolves by

02:39:38,150 --> 02:39:38,160
three-dimensional and it evolves by
 

9493
02:39:38,160 --> 02:39:40,870
three-dimensional and it evolves by
simple local rules like you die or born

9494
02:39:40,870 --> 02:39:40,880
simple local rules like you die or born
 

9495
02:39:40,880 --> 02:39:43,030
simple local rules like you die or born
if the neighbors

9496
02:39:43,030 --> 02:39:43,040
if the neighbors
 

9497
02:39:43,040 --> 02:39:45,270
if the neighbors
are alive or dead and

are alive or dead and
 

9499
02:39:45,280 --> 02:39:49,830
are alive or dead and
it turns out if you have

9500
02:39:49,830 --> 02:39:49,840

um
you know whether uh

02:40:02,160 --> 02:40:05,030
you know whether uh
drugs are involved or not i can sit back

02:40:15,030 --> 02:40:15,040
it gives me almost like you know people
 

9523
02:40:15,040 --> 02:40:17,269
it gives me almost like you know people
talk about religious experiences

talk about religious experiences
 

9525
02:40:17,279 --> 02:40:19,750
talk about religious experiences
it gives me a sense

02:40:19,750 --> 02:40:19,760
it gives me a sense
 

9527
02:40:19,760 --> 02:40:21,429
it gives me a sense
that you get to

9528
02:40:21,429 --> 02:40:21,439
that you get to
 

9529
02:40:21,439 --> 02:40:23,349
that you get to
have a glimpse

02:40:36,720 --> 02:40:37,910
is the very thing that brought my mind
to life

yes

02:40:45,429 --> 02:40:45,439
yes
 

9553
02:40:45,439 --> 02:40:47,670
yes
those constructs are pretty trivial

02:40:47,670 --> 02:40:47,680
those constructs are pretty trivial
 

9555
02:40:47,680 --> 02:40:48,790
those constructs are pretty trivial
they're

02:40:48,790 --> 02:40:48,800
they're
 

9557
02:40:48,800 --> 02:40:51,429
they're
i mean that's part of their magic is

9558
02:40:51,429 --> 02:40:51,439
i mean that's part of their magic is
 

9559
02:40:51,439 --> 02:40:53,429
i mean that's part of their magic is
even in this trivial

02:40:53,429 --> 02:40:53,439
even in this trivial
 

9561
02:40:53,439 --> 02:40:56,550
even in this trivial
framework you could see the emergence or

9562
02:40:56,550 --> 02:40:56,560
framework you could see the emergence or
 

9563
02:40:56,560 --> 02:40:58,790
framework you could see the emergence or
especially in this trivial framework you

9564
02:40:58,790 --> 02:40:58,800
especially in this trivial framework you
 

9565
02:40:58,800 --> 02:41:00,469
especially in this trivial framework you
could see the emergence of complexity

9566
02:41:00,469 --> 02:41:00,479
could see the emergence of complexity
 

9567
02:41:00,479 --> 02:41:03,110
could see the emergence of complexity
from simplicity i guess what lee you're

9568
02:41:03,110 --> 02:41:03,120
from simplicity i guess what lee you're
 

9569
02:41:03,120 --> 02:41:04,950
from simplicity i guess what lee you're
saying is that

9570
02:41:04,950 --> 02:41:04,960
saying is that
 

9571
02:41:04,960 --> 02:41:07,110
saying is that
this is not you know

9572
02:41:07,110 --> 02:41:07,120
this is not you know
 

9573
02:41:07,120 --> 02:41:08,630
this is not you know
um

9574
02:41:08,630 --> 02:41:08,640
um
 

9575
02:41:08,640 --> 02:41:09,750
um
this is

9576
02:41:09,750 --> 02:41:09,760
this is
 

9577
02:41:09,760 --> 02:41:11,269
this is
highly unlike

9578
02:41:11,269 --> 02:41:11,279
highly unlike
 

9579
02:41:11,279 --> 02:41:13,030
highly unlike
systems we've seen the physical world

9580
02:41:13,030 --> 02:41:13,040
systems we've seen the physical world
 

9581
02:41:13,040 --> 02:41:15,030
systems we've seen the physical world
even though they probably carry some of

9582
02:41:15,030 --> 02:41:15,040
even though they probably carry some of
 

9583
02:41:15,040 --> 02:41:16,630
even though they probably carry some of
the same

9584
02:41:16,630 --> 02:41:16,640
the same
 

9585
02:41:16,640 --> 02:41:19,110
the same
magic like mechanistically

9586
02:41:19,110 --> 02:41:19,120
magic like mechanistically
 

9587
02:41:19,120 --> 02:41:21,349
magic like mechanistically
i mean i'm saying that the the the

9588
02:41:21,349 --> 02:41:21,359
i mean i'm saying that the the the
 

9589
02:41:21,359 --> 02:41:23,990
i mean i'm saying that the the the
operating system that ca has to exist on

9590
02:41:23,990 --> 02:41:24,000
operating system that ca has to exist on
 

9591
02:41:24,000 --> 02:41:25,990
operating system that ca has to exist on
is quite complex right

9592
02:41:25,990 --> 02:41:26,000
is quite complex right
 

9593
02:41:26,000 --> 02:41:28,230
is quite complex right
and so i wonder if you're getting the

9594
02:41:28,230 --> 02:41:28,240
and so i wonder if you're getting the
 

9595
02:41:28,240 --> 02:41:29,590
and so i wonder if you're getting the
complexity out of the ca from the

9596
02:41:29,590 --> 02:41:29,600
complexity out of the ca from the
 

9597
02:41:29,600 --> 02:41:31,830
complexity out of the ca from the
boundary conditions the operating system

9598
02:41:31,830 --> 02:41:31,840
boundary conditions the operating system
 

9599
02:41:31,840 --> 02:41:34,230
boundary conditions the operating system
the underlying digital computer oh wow

9600
02:41:34,230 --> 02:41:34,240
the underlying digital computer oh wow
 

9601
02:41:34,240 --> 02:41:35,830
the underlying digital computer oh wow
so you those are some strong words

9602
02:41:35,830 --> 02:41:35,840
so you those are some strong words
 

9603
02:41:35,840 --> 02:41:37,910
so you those are some strong words
against ca's then i didn't know again i

9604
02:41:37,910 --> 02:41:37,920
against ca's then i didn't know again i
 

9605
02:41:37,920 --> 02:41:39,830
against ca's then i didn't know again i
mean i'm in the i'm in love with cas as

9606
02:41:39,830 --> 02:41:39,840
mean i'm in the i'm in love with cas as
 

9607
02:41:39,840 --> 02:41:42,150
mean i'm in the i'm in love with cas as
well right i'm just saying

9608
02:41:42,150 --> 02:41:42,160
well right i'm just saying
 

9609
02:41:42,160 --> 02:41:44,389
well right i'm just saying
they aren't as trivial as people think

9610
02:41:44,389 --> 02:41:44,399
they aren't as trivial as people think
 

9611
02:41:44,399 --> 02:41:45,910
they aren't as trivial as people think
they are incredible

9612
02:41:45,910 --> 02:41:45,920
they are incredible
 

9613
02:41:45,920 --> 02:41:47,590
they are incredible
you get to that richness you have to

9614
02:41:47,590 --> 02:41:47,600
you get to that richness you have to
 

9615
02:41:47,600 --> 02:41:50,870
you get to that richness you have to
iterate billions of times

9616
02:41:50,870 --> 02:41:50,880
iterate billions of times
 

9617
02:41:50,880 --> 02:41:52,710
iterate billions of times
and you need a display

9618
02:41:52,710 --> 02:41:52,720
and you need a display
 

9619
02:41:52,720 --> 02:41:55,190
and you need a display
and you need a math coprocessor and you

9620
02:41:55,190 --> 02:41:55,200
and you need a math coprocessor and you
 

9621
02:41:55,200 --> 02:41:57,590
and you need a math coprocessor and you
need a von neumann machine

9622
02:41:57,590 --> 02:41:57,600
need a von neumann machine
 

9623
02:41:57,600 --> 02:41:59,429
need a von neumann machine
based on a turing machine with digital

9624
02:41:59,429 --> 02:41:59,439
based on a turing machine with digital
 

9625
02:41:59,439 --> 02:42:02,870
based on a turing machine with digital
error correction and states wow to think

9626
02:42:02,870 --> 02:42:02,880
error correction and states wow to think
 

9627
02:42:02,880 --> 02:42:05,670
error correction and states wow to think
that for the simplicity of a grid

9628
02:42:05,670 --> 02:42:05,680
that for the simplicity of a grid
 

9629
02:42:05,680 --> 02:42:07,990
that for the simplicity of a grid
you're basically saying a grid is not

9630
02:42:07,990 --> 02:42:08,000
you're basically saying a grid is not
 

9631
02:42:08,000 --> 02:42:09,670
you're basically saying a grid is not
simple yeah

9632
02:42:09,670 --> 02:42:09,680
simple yeah
 

9633
02:42:09,680 --> 02:42:11,670
simple yeah
it requires incredible complexity to

9634
02:42:11,670 --> 02:42:11,680
it requires incredible complexity to
 

9635
02:42:11,680 --> 02:42:15,110
it requires incredible complexity to
bring a grid to life yeah

9636
02:42:15,110 --> 02:42:15,120

 

9637
02:42:15,120 --> 02:42:17,190

yeah that's what then what is simple

9638
02:42:17,190 --> 02:42:17,200
yeah that's what then what is simple
 

9639
02:42:17,200 --> 02:42:18,870
yeah that's what then what is simple
that's all i wanted to say i agree with

9640
02:42:18,870 --> 02:42:18,880
that's all i wanted to say i agree with
 

9641
02:42:18,880 --> 02:42:20,309
that's all i wanted to say i agree with
you with a wonder of cas i just think

9642
02:42:20,309 --> 02:42:20,319
you with a wonder of cas i just think
 

9643
02:42:20,319 --> 02:42:21,990
you with a wonder of cas i just think
but remember this we take so much for

9644
02:42:21,990 --> 02:42:22,000
but remember this we take so much for
 

9645
02:42:22,000 --> 02:42:24,630
but remember this we take so much for
granted what the ca is resting on

9646
02:42:24,630 --> 02:42:24,640
granted what the ca is resting on
 

9647
02:42:24,640 --> 02:42:27,269
granted what the ca is resting on
because von neumann and and uh firemen

9648
02:42:27,269 --> 02:42:27,279
because von neumann and and uh firemen
 

9649
02:42:27,279 --> 02:42:28,950
because von neumann and and uh firemen
weren't showing weren't seeing these

9650
02:42:28,950 --> 02:42:28,960
weren't showing weren't seeing these
 

9651
02:42:28,960 --> 02:42:30,469
weren't showing weren't seeing these
elaborate structures they could not get

9652
02:42:30,469 --> 02:42:30,479
elaborate structures they could not get
 

9653
02:42:30,479 --> 02:42:33,030
elaborate structures they could not get
that far

9654
02:42:33,030 --> 02:42:33,040
that far
 

9655
02:42:33,040 --> 02:42:34,389
that far
yeah but that's the limitation of their

9656
02:42:34,389 --> 02:42:34,399
yeah but that's the limitation of their
 

9657
02:42:34,399 --> 02:42:37,269
yeah but that's the limitation of their
mind yeah exactly

9658
02:42:37,269 --> 02:42:37,279
mind yeah exactly
 

9659
02:42:37,279 --> 02:42:39,190
mind yeah exactly
but i i think that's

9660
02:42:39,190 --> 02:42:39,200
but i i think that's
 

9661
02:42:39,200 --> 02:42:40,550
but i i think that's
the question is

9662
02:42:40,550 --> 02:42:40,560
the question is
 

9663
02:42:40,560 --> 02:42:43,030
the question is
whether the essential elements of the

9664
02:42:43,030 --> 02:42:43,040
whether the essential elements of the
 

9665
02:42:43,040 --> 02:42:45,030
whether the essential elements of the
cellular automata

9666
02:42:45,030 --> 02:42:45,040
cellular automata
 

9667
02:42:45,040 --> 02:42:47,190
cellular automata
is um

9668
02:42:47,190 --> 02:42:47,200
is um
 

9669
02:42:47,200 --> 02:42:49,269
is um
is present

9670
02:42:49,269 --> 02:42:49,279
is present
 

9671
02:42:49,279 --> 02:42:51,269
is present
without all the complexities required to

9672
02:42:51,269 --> 02:42:51,279
without all the complexities required to
 

9673
02:42:51,279 --> 02:42:54,150
without all the complexities required to
build a computer

9674
02:42:54,150 --> 02:42:54,160

 

9675
02:42:54,160 --> 02:42:56,469

the reason i find it incredible is that

9676
02:42:56,469 --> 02:42:56,479
the reason i find it incredible is that
 

9677
02:42:56,479 --> 02:42:59,269
the reason i find it incredible is that
yeah my intuition is yes it might look

9678
02:42:59,269 --> 02:42:59,279
yeah my intuition is yes it might look
 

9679
02:42:59,279 --> 02:43:00,389
yeah my intuition is yes it might look
different

9680
02:43:00,389 --> 02:43:00,399
different
 

9681
02:43:00,399 --> 02:43:02,550
different
uh there might not be a grill structure

9682
02:43:02,550 --> 02:43:02,560
uh there might not be a grill structure
 

9683
02:43:02,560 --> 02:43:05,110
uh there might not be a grill structure
a grid like structure

9684
02:43:05,110 --> 02:43:05,120
a grid like structure
 

9685
02:43:05,120 --> 02:43:05,910
a grid like structure
but

9686
02:43:05,910 --> 02:43:05,920
but
 

9687
02:43:05,920 --> 02:43:07,990
but
local interactions operating under

9688
02:43:07,990 --> 02:43:08,000
local interactions operating under
 

9689
02:43:08,000 --> 02:43:09,670
local interactions operating under
simple rules

9690
02:43:09,670 --> 02:43:09,680
simple rules
 

9691
02:43:09,680 --> 02:43:11,830
simple rules
and resulting in

9692
02:43:11,830 --> 02:43:11,840
and resulting in
 

9693
02:43:11,840 --> 02:43:13,349
and resulting in
multi-hierarchical

9694
02:43:13,349 --> 02:43:13,359
multi-hierarchical
 

9695
02:43:13,359 --> 02:43:15,510
multi-hierarchical
complex structures feels like a thing

9696
02:43:15,510 --> 02:43:15,520
complex structures feels like a thing
 

9697
02:43:15,520 --> 02:43:17,990
complex structures feels like a thing
that's doesn't require a computer i

9698
02:43:17,990 --> 02:43:18,000
that's doesn't require a computer i
 

9699
02:43:18,000 --> 02:43:20,389
that's doesn't require a computer i
agree but coming back to von neumann and

9700
02:43:20,389 --> 02:43:20,399
agree but coming back to von neumann and
 

9701
02:43:20,399 --> 02:43:22,389
agree but coming back to von neumann and
feynman and wolfram

9702
02:43:22,389 --> 02:43:22,399
feynman and wolfram
 

9703
02:43:22,399 --> 02:43:24,710
feynman and wolfram
their their minds the non-trivial minds

9704
02:43:24,710 --> 02:43:24,720
their their minds the non-trivial minds
 

9705
02:43:24,720 --> 02:43:26,469
their their minds the non-trivial minds
to create those architectures and do it

9706
02:43:26,469 --> 02:43:26,479
to create those architectures and do it
 

9707
02:43:26,479 --> 02:43:27,269
to create those architectures and do it
and

9708
02:43:27,269 --> 02:43:27,279
and
 

9709
02:43:27,279 --> 02:43:28,870
and
to put on those

9710
02:43:28,870 --> 02:43:28,880
to put on those
 

9711
02:43:28,880 --> 02:43:30,630
to put on those
state transitions

9712
02:43:30,630 --> 02:43:30,640
state transitions
 

9713
02:43:30,640 --> 02:43:32,630
state transitions
and i think that something that's really

9714
02:43:32,630 --> 02:43:32,640
and i think that something that's really
 

9715
02:43:32,640 --> 02:43:34,469
and i think that something that's really
incredibly interesting

9716
02:43:34,469 --> 02:43:34,479
incredibly interesting
 

9717
02:43:34,479 --> 02:43:37,670
incredibly interesting
that um is understanding how the human

9718
02:43:37,670 --> 02:43:37,680
that um is understanding how the human
 

9719
02:43:37,680 --> 02:43:39,269
that um is understanding how the human
mind builds those straight those state

9720
02:43:39,269 --> 02:43:39,279
mind builds those straight those state
 

9721
02:43:39,279 --> 02:43:41,269
mind builds those straight those state
transition machines

9722
02:43:41,269 --> 02:43:41,279
transition machines
 

9723
02:43:41,279 --> 02:43:43,349
transition machines
you i could see how deeply in love with

9724
02:43:43,349 --> 02:43:43,359
you i could see how deeply in love with
 

9725
02:43:43,359 --> 02:43:45,830
you i could see how deeply in love with
the idea of memory you are so it's it's

9726
02:43:45,830 --> 02:43:45,840
the idea of memory you are so it's it's
 

9727
02:43:45,840 --> 02:43:46,710
the idea of memory you are so it's it's
like

9728
02:43:46,710 --> 02:43:46,720
like
 

9729
02:43:46,720 --> 02:43:50,870
like
how much of e equals mc squared

9730
02:43:50,870 --> 02:43:50,880
how much of e equals mc squared
 

9731
02:43:50,880 --> 02:43:51,750
how much of e equals mc squared
like

9732
02:43:51,750 --> 02:43:51,760
like
 

9733
02:43:51,760 --> 02:43:55,030
like
is more than an equation it has albert

9734
02:43:55,030 --> 02:43:55,040
is more than an equation it has albert
 

9735
02:43:55,040 --> 02:43:57,269
is more than an equation it has albert
einstein in it

9736
02:43:57,269 --> 02:43:57,279
einstein in it
 

9737
02:43:57,279 --> 02:43:59,110
einstein in it
like you're saying like you can't just

9738
02:43:59,110 --> 02:43:59,120
like you're saying like you can't just
 

9739
02:43:59,120 --> 02:44:00,790
like you're saying like you can't just
say this is a

9740
02:44:00,790 --> 02:44:00,800
say this is a
 

9741
02:44:00,800 --> 02:44:02,150
say this is a
uh like

9742
02:44:02,150 --> 02:44:02,160
uh like
 

9743
02:44:02,160 --> 02:44:05,349
uh like
the equations of physics are a really

9744
02:44:05,349 --> 02:44:05,359
the equations of physics are a really
 

9745
02:44:05,359 --> 02:44:06,469
the equations of physics are a really
good

9746
02:44:06,469 --> 02:44:06,479
good
 

9747
02:44:06,479 --> 02:44:08,389
good
simple capture

02:44:14,960 --> 02:44:16,630
of the humans
absolutely

absolutely
 

9757
02:44:16,640 --> 02:44:18,630
absolutely
absolutely yeah

9758
02:44:18,630 --> 02:44:18,640
absolutely yeah
 

9759
02:44:18,640 --> 02:44:20,389
absolutely yeah
but i don't i don't know if you're

9760
02:44:20,389 --> 02:44:20,399
but i don't i don't know if you're
 

9761
02:44:20,399 --> 02:44:23,110
but i don't i don't know if you're
implying this i don't uh that's a

9762
02:44:23,110 --> 02:44:23,120
implying this i don't uh that's a
 

9763
02:44:23,120 --> 02:44:24,469
implying this i don't uh that's a

i'm comfortable with that

9768
02:44:28,389 --> 02:44:28,399
i'm comfortable with that
 

9769
02:44:28,399 --> 02:44:29,910
i'm comfortable with that

firemen to find lots of solutions for

9784
02:44:44,550 --> 02:44:44,560
firemen to find lots of solutions for
 

9785
02:44:44,560 --> 02:44:46,150
firemen to find lots of solutions for
gravity but isn't it wonderful that the

9786
02:44:46,150 --> 02:44:46,160
gravity but isn't it wonderful that the
 

9787
02:44:46,160 --> 02:44:47,990
gravity but isn't it wonderful that the
laws that we do find are the maximally

9788
02:44:47,990 --> 02:44:48,000
laws that we do find are the maximally

9790
02:44:50,870 --> 02:44:50,880
compressed representations
 

9791
02:44:50,880 --> 02:44:53,349
compressed representations
yeah but that representation you can now

9792
02:44:53,349 --> 02:44:53,359
yeah but that representation you can now
 

9793
02:44:53,359 --> 02:44:54,469
yeah but that representation you can now
give it as

9794
02:44:54,469 --> 02:44:54,479
give it as
 

9795
02:44:54,479 --> 02:44:55,990
give it as
i guess the universe has the memory of

9796
02:44:55,990 --> 02:44:56,000
i guess the universe has the memory of
 

9797
02:44:56,000 --> 02:44:58,309
i guess the universe has the memory of
einstein with that representation

9798
02:44:58,309 --> 02:44:58,319
einstein with that representation
 

9799
02:44:58,319 --> 02:44:59,990
einstein with that representation
but then you can now give it as a gift

9800
02:44:59,990 --> 02:45:00,000
but then you can now give it as a gift
 

9801
02:45:00,000 --> 02:45:01,910
but then you can now give it as a gift
for free yeah yeah it's very memorable

9802
02:45:01,910 --> 02:45:01,920
for free yeah yeah it's very memorable
 

9803
02:45:01,920 --> 02:45:03,590
for free yeah yeah it's very memorable
civilizations i had to go through a lot

9804
02:45:03,590 --> 02:45:03,600
civilizations i had to go through a lot
 

9805
02:45:03,600 --> 02:45:05,030
civilizations i had to go through a lot
of pain together but it's low memory so

9806
02:45:05,030 --> 02:45:05,040
of pain together but it's low memory so
 

9807
02:45:05,040 --> 02:45:06,710
of pain together but it's low memory so
physic i say that physics and chemistry

9808
02:45:06,710 --> 02:45:06,720
physic i say that physics and chemistry
 

9809
02:45:06,720 --> 02:45:08,630
physic i say that physics and chemistry
and biology are the same discipline

9810
02:45:08,630 --> 02:45:08,640
and biology are the same discipline
 

9811
02:45:08,640 --> 02:45:10,630
and biology are the same discipline
they're just physics

9812
02:45:10,630 --> 02:45:10,640
they're just physics
 

9813
02:45:10,640 --> 02:45:12,469
they're just physics
laws in physics there's no such thing as

9814
02:45:12,469 --> 02:45:12,479
laws in physics there's no such thing as
 

9815
02:45:12,479 --> 02:45:14,230
laws in physics there's no such thing as
a law in physics it's just low memory

9816
02:45:14,230 --> 02:45:14,240
a law in physics it's just low memory
 

9817
02:45:14,240 --> 02:45:15,429
a law in physics it's just low memory
stuff

9818
02:45:15,429 --> 02:45:15,439
stuff
 

9819
02:45:15,439 --> 02:45:16,950
stuff
because you've got low memory stuff you

9820
02:45:16,950 --> 02:45:16,960
because you've got low memory stuff you
 

9821
02:45:16,960 --> 02:45:19,670
because you've got low memory stuff you
can things reoccur quickly

9822
02:45:19,670 --> 02:45:19,680
can things reoccur quickly
 

9823
02:45:19,680 --> 02:45:21,429
can things reoccur quickly
as you get build in more memory you get

9824
02:45:21,429 --> 02:45:21,439
as you get build in more memory you get
 

9825
02:45:21,439 --> 02:45:22,950
as you get build in more memory you get
to chemistry so things become more

9826
02:45:22,950 --> 02:45:22,960
to chemistry so things become more
 

9827
02:45:22,960 --> 02:45:25,269
to chemistry so things become more
contingent when you get to biology more

9828
02:45:25,269 --> 02:45:25,279
contingent when you get to biology more
 

9829
02:45:25,279 --> 02:45:27,429
contingent when you get to biology more
contingent still and then technology so

9830
02:45:27,429 --> 02:45:27,439
contingent still and then technology so
 

9831
02:45:27,439 --> 02:45:29,190
contingent still and then technology so
the more memory you need the more that

9832
02:45:29,190 --> 02:45:29,200
the more memory you need the more that
 

9833
02:45:29,200 --> 02:45:31,349
the more memory you need the more that
your laws are local

9834
02:45:31,349 --> 02:45:31,359
your laws are local
 

9835
02:45:31,359 --> 02:45:33,510
your laws are local
that's all i'm saying and that the

9836
02:45:33,510 --> 02:45:33,520
that's all i'm saying and that the
 

9837
02:45:33,520 --> 02:45:34,870
that's all i'm saying and that the
the less memory the more the laws are

9838
02:45:34,870 --> 02:45:34,880
the less memory the more the laws are
 

9839
02:45:34,880 --> 02:45:36,309
the less memory the more the laws are
universal because they're not laws they

9840
02:45:36,309 --> 02:45:36,319
universal because they're not laws they
 

9841
02:45:36,319 --> 02:45:40,070
universal because they're not laws they
are just low memory states

9842
02:45:40,070 --> 02:45:40,080

 

9843
02:45:40,080 --> 02:45:42,389

we have to talk about

9844
02:45:42,389 --> 02:45:42,399
we have to talk about
 

9845
02:45:42,399 --> 02:45:44,230
we have to talk about
a thing you've kind of mentioned already

9846
02:45:44,230 --> 02:45:44,240
a thing you've kind of mentioned already
 

9847
02:45:44,240 --> 02:45:46,150
a thing you've kind of mentioned already
a bunch of times but

9848
02:45:46,150 --> 02:45:46,160
a bunch of times but
 

9849
02:45:46,160 --> 02:45:48,389
a bunch of times but
doing computation

9850
02:45:48,389 --> 02:45:48,399
doing computation
 

9851
02:45:48,399 --> 02:45:50,309
doing computation
through chemistry chemical based

9852
02:45:50,309 --> 02:45:50,319
through chemistry chemical based
 

9853
02:45:50,319 --> 02:45:51,670
through chemistry chemical based
computation

9854
02:45:51,670 --> 02:45:51,680
computation
 

9855
02:45:51,680 --> 02:45:53,030
computation
i've seen you

9856
02:45:53,030 --> 02:45:53,040
i've seen you
 

9857
02:45:53,040 --> 02:45:55,110
i've seen you
refer to it as

9858
02:45:55,110 --> 02:45:55,120
refer to it as
 

9859
02:45:55,120 --> 02:45:57,670
refer to it as
in in a sexy title of

9860
02:45:57,670 --> 02:45:57,680
in in a sexy title of
 

9861
02:45:57,680 --> 02:45:58,550
in in a sexy title of

mutation computation

9864
02:46:00,870 --> 02:46:00,880
mutation computation
 

9865
02:46:00,880 --> 02:46:03,030
mutation computation
so what is computation what is

9866
02:46:03,030 --> 02:46:03,040
so what is computation what is
 

9867
02:46:03,040 --> 02:46:06,150
so what is computation what is
chemically uh chemical based computation

9868
02:46:06,150 --> 02:46:06,160
chemically uh chemical based computation
 

9869
02:46:06,160 --> 02:46:09,510
chemically uh chemical based computation
okay so computation is a a name i gave

9870
02:46:09,510 --> 02:46:09,520
okay so computation is a a name i gave
 

9871
02:46:09,520 --> 02:46:11,349
okay so computation is a a name i gave
to the process of

9872
02:46:11,349 --> 02:46:11,359
to the process of
 

9873
02:46:11,359 --> 02:46:13,590
to the process of
um building a state machine to make any

9874
02:46:13,590 --> 02:46:13,600
um building a state machine to make any
 

9875
02:46:13,600 --> 02:46:15,750
um building a state machine to make any
molecule physically in the lab

9876
02:46:15,750 --> 02:46:15,760
molecule physically in the lab
 

9877
02:46:15,760 --> 02:46:17,750
molecule physically in the lab
and so as a chemist chemists make

9878
02:46:17,750 --> 02:46:17,760
and so as a chemist chemists make
 

9879
02:46:17,760 --> 02:46:19,349
and so as a chemist chemists make
molecules by hand

9880
02:46:19,349 --> 02:46:19,359
molecules by hand
 

9881
02:46:19,359 --> 02:46:21,590
molecules by hand
and um

9882
02:46:21,590 --> 02:46:21,600
and um
 

9883
02:46:21,600 --> 02:46:23,670
and um
and they're quite hard chemists have a

9884
02:46:23,670 --> 02:46:23,680
and they're quite hard chemists have a
 

9885
02:46:23,680 --> 02:46:25,510
and they're quite hard chemists have a
lot of tacit knowledge a lot of

9886
02:46:25,510 --> 02:46:25,520
lot of tacit knowledge a lot of
 

9887
02:46:25,520 --> 02:46:26,790
lot of tacit knowledge a lot of
ambiguity

9888
02:46:26,790 --> 02:46:26,800
ambiguity
 

9889
02:46:26,800 --> 02:46:29,190
ambiguity
it's not possible to go uniformly to the

9890
02:46:29,190 --> 02:46:29,200
it's not possible to go uniformly to the
 

9891
02:46:29,200 --> 02:46:31,110
it's not possible to go uniformly to the
literature and read a recipe to make a

9892
02:46:31,110 --> 02:46:31,120
literature and read a recipe to make a
 

9893
02:46:31,120 --> 02:46:32,309
literature and read a recipe to make a
molecule

9894
02:46:32,309 --> 02:46:32,319
molecule
 

9895
02:46:32,319 --> 02:46:34,630
molecule
and then go and make it in the lab

9896
02:46:34,630 --> 02:46:34,640
and then go and make it in the lab
 

9897
02:46:34,640 --> 02:46:36,710
and then go and make it in the lab
every time some recipes are better than

9898
02:46:36,710 --> 02:46:36,720
every time some recipes are better than
 

9899
02:46:36,720 --> 02:46:39,750
every time some recipes are better than
others but they all assume

9900
02:46:39,750 --> 02:46:39,760
others but they all assume
 

9901
02:46:39,760 --> 02:46:41,429
others but they all assume
some

9902
02:46:41,429 --> 02:46:41,439
some
 

9903
02:46:41,439 --> 02:46:42,950
some
knowledge

9904
02:46:42,950 --> 02:46:42,960
knowledge
 

9905
02:46:42,960 --> 02:46:44,950
knowledge
and it's not universal what that is like

9906
02:46:44,950 --> 02:46:44,960
and it's not universal what that is like
 

9907
02:46:44,960 --> 02:46:48,070
and it's not universal what that is like
so it's uh carried from

9908
02:46:48,070 --> 02:46:48,080
so it's uh carried from
 

9909
02:46:48,080 --> 02:46:49,990
so it's uh carried from
from human to human yeah some of that

9910
02:46:49,990 --> 02:46:50,000
from human to human yeah some of that
 

9911
02:46:50,000 --> 02:46:51,670
from human to human yeah some of that
implicit knowledge and you're saying can

9912
02:46:51,670 --> 02:46:51,680
implicit knowledge and you're saying can
 

9913
02:46:51,680 --> 02:46:53,190
implicit knowledge and you're saying can
we remove the humor from the picture can

9914
02:46:53,190 --> 02:46:53,200
we remove the humor from the picture can
 

9915
02:46:53,200 --> 02:46:55,750
we remove the humor from the picture can
we like uh program

9916
02:46:55,750 --> 02:46:55,760
we like uh program
 

9917
02:46:55,760 --> 02:46:58,469
we like uh program
by the way what is a state machine

9918
02:46:58,469 --> 02:46:58,479
by the way what is a state machine
 

9919
02:46:58,479 --> 02:47:02,710
by the way what is a state machine
so a state machine is a i suppose a

9920
02:47:02,710 --> 02:47:02,720
so a state machine is a i suppose a
 

9921
02:47:02,720 --> 02:47:05,590
so a state machine is a i suppose a
a a object either abstract or mechanical

9922
02:47:05,590 --> 02:47:05,600
a a object either abstract or mechanical
 

9923
02:47:05,600 --> 02:47:07,269
a a object either abstract or mechanical
where you can do

9924
02:47:07,269 --> 02:47:07,279
where you can do
 

9925
02:47:07,279 --> 02:47:08,469
where you can do
you can

9926
02:47:08,469 --> 02:47:08,479
you can
 

9927
02:47:08,479 --> 02:47:10,790
you can
um do a unit operation on it and flick

9928
02:47:10,790 --> 02:47:10,800
um do a unit operation on it and flick
 

9929
02:47:10,800 --> 02:47:12,710
um do a unit operation on it and flick
it from one state to another so a turn

9930
02:47:12,710 --> 02:47:12,720
it from one state to another so a turn
 

9931
02:47:12,720 --> 02:47:14,469
it from one state to another so a turn
style would be a good example of a state

9932
02:47:14,469 --> 02:47:14,479
style would be a good example of a state
 

9933
02:47:14,479 --> 02:47:15,349
style would be a good example of a state
machine

9934
02:47:15,349 --> 02:47:15,359
machine
 

9935
02:47:15,359 --> 02:47:17,510
machine
uh there's some kinds of states and some

9936
02:47:17,510 --> 02:47:17,520
uh there's some kinds of states and some
 

9937
02:47:17,520 --> 02:47:19,750
uh there's some kinds of states and some
kind of transitions between states and

9938
02:47:19,750 --> 02:47:19,760
kind of transitions between states and
 

9939
02:47:19,760 --> 02:47:21,429
kind of transitions between states and
it's um

9940
02:47:21,429 --> 02:47:21,439
it's um
 

9941
02:47:21,439 --> 02:47:22,389
it's um
very

9942
02:47:22,389 --> 02:47:22,399
very
 

9943
02:47:22,399 --> 02:47:24,309
very
formal in nature in terms of like it's

9944
02:47:24,309 --> 02:47:24,319
formal in nature in terms of like it's
 

9945
02:47:24,319 --> 02:47:26,790
formal in nature in terms of like it's
precise yes you can mathematically

9946
02:47:26,790 --> 02:47:26,800
precise yes you can mathematically
 

9947
02:47:26,800 --> 02:47:27,990
precise yes you can mathematically
precisely

9948
02:47:27,990 --> 02:47:28,000
precisely
 

9949
02:47:28,000 --> 02:47:30,070
precisely
describe a state machine so i mean you

9950
02:47:30,070 --> 02:47:30,080
describe a state machine so i mean you
 

9951
02:47:30,080 --> 02:47:32,230
describe a state machine so i mean you
know a very simple boolean

9952
02:47:32,230 --> 02:47:32,240
know a very simple boolean
 

9953
02:47:32,240 --> 02:47:35,349
know a very simple boolean
um gates are a very good way of building

9954
02:47:35,349 --> 02:47:35,359
um gates are a very good way of building
 

9955
02:47:35,359 --> 02:47:38,230
um gates are a very good way of building
kind of logic based state machines

9956
02:47:38,230 --> 02:47:38,240
kind of logic based state machines
 

9957
02:47:38,240 --> 02:47:40,469
kind of logic based state machines
obviously a turing machine the concept

9958
02:47:40,469 --> 02:47:40,479
obviously a turing machine the concept
 

9959
02:47:40,479 --> 02:47:41,910
obviously a turing machine the concept
of a turing machine where you have a

9960
02:47:41,910 --> 02:47:41,920
of a turing machine where you have a
 

9961
02:47:41,920 --> 02:47:44,550
of a turing machine where you have a
tape and a read head and a series of

9962
02:47:44,550 --> 02:47:44,560
tape and a read head and a series of
 

9963
02:47:44,560 --> 02:47:47,590
tape and a read head and a series of
rules in a table and you would basically

9964
02:47:47,590 --> 02:47:47,600
rules in a table and you would basically
 

9965
02:47:47,600 --> 02:47:49,269
rules in a table and you would basically
look at what's on the tape

9966
02:47:49,269 --> 02:47:49,279
look at what's on the tape
 

9967
02:47:49,279 --> 02:47:50,710
look at what's on the tape
and if you're shifting the tape from

9968
02:47:50,710 --> 02:47:50,720
and if you're shifting the tape from
 

9969
02:47:50,720 --> 02:47:52,710
and if you're shifting the tape from
left to right and if you see a zero or

9970
02:47:52,710 --> 02:47:52,720
left to right and if you see a zero or
 

9971
02:47:52,720 --> 02:47:54,630
left to right and if you see a zero or
one you look in your lookup table and

9972
02:47:54,630 --> 02:47:54,640
one you look in your lookup table and
 

9973
02:47:54,640 --> 02:47:57,269
one you look in your lookup table and
say right i've seen a zero and a one um

9974
02:47:57,269 --> 02:47:57,279
say right i've seen a zero and a one um
 

9975
02:47:57,279 --> 02:48:00,230
say right i've seen a zero and a one um
i then do

9976
02:48:00,230 --> 02:48:00,240

 

9977
02:48:00,240 --> 02:48:02,870

i then respond to that so the turn style

9978
02:48:02,870 --> 02:48:02,880
i then respond to that so the turn style
 

9979
02:48:02,880 --> 02:48:05,190
i then respond to that so the turn style
would be is there a human being pushing

9980
02:48:05,190 --> 02:48:05,200
would be is there a human being pushing
 

9981
02:48:05,200 --> 02:48:06,550
would be is there a human being pushing
the turnstile

9982
02:48:06,550 --> 02:48:06,560
the turnstile
 

9983
02:48:06,560 --> 02:48:09,190
the turnstile
in direction clockwise

9984
02:48:09,190 --> 02:48:09,200
in direction clockwise
 

9985
02:48:09,200 --> 02:48:11,590
in direction clockwise
if yes i will open let them go if it's

9986
02:48:11,590 --> 02:48:11,600
if yes i will open let them go if it's
 

9987
02:48:11,600 --> 02:48:13,750
if yes i will open let them go if it's
anti-clockwise no so yes so state

9988
02:48:13,750 --> 02:48:13,760
anti-clockwise no so yes so state
 

9989
02:48:13,760 --> 02:48:16,150
anti-clockwise no so yes so state
machine has some labels and a transition

9990
02:48:16,150 --> 02:48:16,160
machine has some labels and a transition
 

9991
02:48:16,160 --> 02:48:17,830
machine has some labels and a transition
transition diagram

9992
02:48:17,830 --> 02:48:17,840
transition diagram
 

9993
02:48:17,840 --> 02:48:19,910
transition diagram
so you're looking to

9994
02:48:19,910 --> 02:48:19,920
so you're looking to
 

9995
02:48:19,920 --> 02:48:21,190
so you're looking to
come up with a

9996
02:48:21,190 --> 02:48:21,200
come up with a
 

9997
02:48:21,200 --> 02:48:23,830
come up with a
chemical computer to form state machines

9998
02:48:23,830 --> 02:48:23,840
chemical computer to form state machines
 

9999
02:48:23,840 --> 02:48:27,030
chemical computer to form state machines
to to create molecules or yeah so

10000
02:48:27,030 --> 02:48:27,040
to to create molecules or yeah so
 

10001
02:48:27,040 --> 02:48:27,910
to to create molecules or yeah so
which

10002
02:48:27,910 --> 02:48:27,920
which
 

10003
02:48:27,920 --> 02:48:29,429
which
what's the chicken in the egg so

10004
02:48:29,429 --> 02:48:29,439
what's the chicken in the egg so
 

10005
02:48:29,439 --> 02:48:31,349
what's the chicken in the egg so
computation is not a chemical computer

10006
02:48:31,349 --> 02:48:31,359
computation is not a chemical computer
 

10007
02:48:31,359 --> 02:48:33,110
computation is not a chemical computer
because we talked a few moments about

10008
02:48:33,110 --> 02:48:33,120
because we talked a few moments about
 

10009
02:48:33,120 --> 02:48:34,309
because we talked a few moments about
actually doing computations with

10010
02:48:34,309 --> 02:48:34,319
actually doing computations with
 

10011
02:48:34,319 --> 02:48:36,230
actually doing computations with
chemicals yeah what i'm now saying is i

10012
02:48:36,230 --> 02:48:36,240
chemicals yeah what i'm now saying is i
 

10013
02:48:36,240 --> 02:48:38,630
chemicals yeah what i'm now saying is i
want to use state machines to transform

10014
02:48:38,630 --> 02:48:38,640
want to use state machines to transform
 

10015
02:48:38,640 --> 02:48:41,670
want to use state machines to transform
chemicals and so so build chemicals

10016
02:48:41,670 --> 02:48:41,680
chemicals and so so build chemicals
 

10017
02:48:41,680 --> 02:48:43,670
chemicals and so so build chemicals
programmatically yeah i mean i get in

10018
02:48:43,670 --> 02:48:43,680
programmatically yeah i mean i get in
 

10019
02:48:43,680 --> 02:48:45,750
programmatically yeah i mean i get in
trouble saying this i i said to my my

10020
02:48:45,750 --> 02:48:45,760
trouble saying this i i said to my my
 

10021
02:48:45,760 --> 02:48:47,590
trouble saying this i i said to my my
group oh i shouldn't say it because this

10022
02:48:47,590 --> 02:48:47,600
group oh i shouldn't say it because this
 

10023
02:48:47,600 --> 02:48:48,710
group oh i shouldn't say it because this
but i said look we should make the

10024
02:48:48,710 --> 02:48:48,720
but i said look we should make the
 

10025
02:48:48,720 --> 02:48:51,190
but i said look we should make the
crackbot is it in the crack robot the

10026
02:48:51,190 --> 02:48:51,200
crackbot is it in the crack robot the
 

10027
02:48:51,200 --> 02:48:53,269
crackbot is it in the crack robot the
real what the mixture the crackpot

10028
02:48:53,269 --> 02:48:53,279
real what the mixture the crackpot
 

10029
02:48:53,279 --> 02:48:54,230
real what the mixture the crackpot
oh

10030
02:48:54,230 --> 02:48:54,240
oh
 

10031
02:48:54,240 --> 02:48:56,630
oh
crackbot the robot that makes crack but

10032
02:48:56,630 --> 02:48:56,640
crackbot the robot that makes crack but
 

10033
02:48:56,640 --> 02:48:58,469
crackbot the robot that makes crack but
maybe we should scrub this from

10034
02:48:58,469 --> 02:48:58,479
maybe we should scrub this from
 

10035
02:48:58,479 --> 02:49:00,469
maybe we should scrub this from
but

10036
02:49:00,469 --> 02:49:00,479
but
 

10037
02:49:00,479 --> 02:49:03,030
but
or uh well so maybe you can educate me

10038
02:49:03,030 --> 02:49:03,040
or uh well so maybe you can educate me
 

10039
02:49:03,040 --> 02:49:05,990
or uh well so maybe you can educate me
on uh breaking bad with like maths right

10040
02:49:05,990 --> 02:49:06,000
on uh breaking bad with like maths right
 

10041
02:49:06,000 --> 02:49:08,230
on uh breaking bad with like maths right
yeah so in breaking bad you want to make

10042
02:49:08,230 --> 02:49:08,240
yeah so in breaking bad you want to make
 

10043
02:49:08,240 --> 02:49:10,230
yeah so in breaking bad you want to make
you want to make um

10044
02:49:10,230 --> 02:49:10,240
you want to make um
 

10045
02:49:10,240 --> 02:49:11,670
you want to make um
basically some kind of

10046
02:49:11,670 --> 02:49:11,680
basically some kind of
 

10047
02:49:11,680 --> 02:49:15,190
basically some kind of
mix of ex machina and breaking bad

10048
02:49:15,190 --> 02:49:15,200
mix of ex machina and breaking bad
 

10049
02:49:15,200 --> 02:49:17,510
mix of ex machina and breaking bad
no i don't i don't i record i don't but

10050
02:49:17,510 --> 02:49:17,520
no i don't i don't i record i don't but
 

10051
02:49:17,520 --> 02:49:19,349
no i don't i don't i record i don't but
you don't i said that's what i'm going

10052
02:49:19,349 --> 02:49:19,359
you don't i said that's what i'm going
 

10053
02:49:19,359 --> 02:49:23,510
you don't i said that's what i'm going
to do once you release the papers

10054
02:49:23,510 --> 02:49:23,520

 

10055
02:49:23,520 --> 02:49:25,510

but i shaved my head

10056
02:49:25,510 --> 02:49:25,520
but i shaved my head
 

10057
02:49:25,520 --> 02:49:27,830
but i shaved my head
and i'm going to uh

10058
02:49:27,830 --> 02:49:27,840
and i'm going to uh
 

10059
02:49:27,840 --> 02:49:29,750
and i'm going to uh
live a life of crime anyway i'm sorry no

10060
02:49:29,750 --> 02:49:29,760
live a life of crime anyway i'm sorry no
 

10061
02:49:29,760 --> 02:49:32,790
live a life of crime anyway i'm sorry no
no um so so yeah let's get back to so

10062
02:49:32,790 --> 02:49:32,800
no um so so yeah let's get back to so
 

10063
02:49:32,800 --> 02:49:34,550
no um so so yeah let's get back to so
indeed it is about making drugs but

10064
02:49:34,550 --> 02:49:34,560
indeed it is about making drugs but
 

10065
02:49:34,560 --> 02:49:36,870
indeed it is about making drugs but
importantly making important drugs

10066
02:49:36,870 --> 02:49:36,880
importantly making important drugs
 

10067
02:49:36,880 --> 02:49:37,830
importantly making important drugs
um

10068
02:49:37,830 --> 02:49:37,840
um
 

10069
02:49:37,840 --> 02:49:40,950
um
so drugs matter yeah but let's go let's

10070
02:49:40,950 --> 02:49:40,960
so drugs matter yeah but let's go let's
 

10071
02:49:40,960 --> 02:49:42,230
so drugs matter yeah but let's go let's
go back so

10072
02:49:42,230 --> 02:49:42,240
go back so
 

10073
02:49:42,240 --> 02:49:44,710
go back so
the basic thesis is chemistry is very

10074
02:49:44,710 --> 02:49:44,720
the basic thesis is chemistry is very
 

10075
02:49:44,720 --> 02:49:45,830
the basic thesis is chemistry is very
analog

10076
02:49:45,830 --> 02:49:45,840
analog
 

10077
02:49:45,840 --> 02:49:47,590
analog
there is no state machine

10078
02:49:47,590 --> 02:49:47,600
there is no state machine
 

10079
02:49:47,600 --> 02:49:48,870
there is no state machine
um

10080
02:49:48,870 --> 02:49:48,880
um
 

10081
02:49:48,880 --> 02:49:51,429
um
and i wandered into the

10082
02:49:51,429 --> 02:49:51,439
and i wandered into the
 

10083
02:49:51,439 --> 02:49:53,190
and i wandered into the
through the paper walls in the in the

10084
02:49:53,190 --> 02:49:53,200
through the paper walls in the in the
 

10085
02:49:53,200 --> 02:49:54,870
through the paper walls in the in the
japanese house a few years ago and said

10086
02:49:54,870 --> 02:49:54,880
japanese house a few years ago and said
 

10087
02:49:54,880 --> 02:49:56,870
japanese house a few years ago and said
okay hey organic chemist why are you why

10088
02:49:56,870 --> 02:49:56,880
okay hey organic chemist why are you why
 

10089
02:49:56,880 --> 02:49:58,790
okay hey organic chemist why are you why
are you doing this analog they said well

10090
02:49:58,790 --> 02:49:58,800
are you doing this analog they said well
 

10091
02:49:58,800 --> 02:50:00,469
are you doing this analog they said well
chemistry is really hard you ha you

10092
02:50:00,469 --> 02:50:00,479
chemistry is really hard you ha you
 

10093
02:50:00,479 --> 02:50:03,110
chemistry is really hard you ha you
can't automate it it's impossible

10094
02:50:03,110 --> 02:50:03,120
can't automate it it's impossible
 

10095
02:50:03,120 --> 02:50:04,469
can't automate it it's impossible
i said but

10096
02:50:04,469 --> 02:50:04,479
i said but
 

10097
02:50:04,479 --> 02:50:06,070
i said but
is it impossible says yeah and they said

10098
02:50:06,070 --> 02:50:06,080
is it impossible says yeah and they said
 

10099
02:50:06,080 --> 02:50:07,510
is it impossible says yeah and they said
they said you know i got the impression

10100
02:50:07,510 --> 02:50:07,520
they said you know i got the impression
 

10101
02:50:07,520 --> 02:50:09,349
they said you know i got the impression
they were saying it's magic

10102
02:50:09,349 --> 02:50:09,359
they were saying it's magic
 

10103
02:50:09,359 --> 02:50:10,790
they were saying it's magic
and so when people tell me things are

10104
02:50:10,790 --> 02:50:10,800
and so when people tell me things are
 

10105
02:50:10,800 --> 02:50:12,550
and so when people tell me things are
magic

10106
02:50:12,550 --> 02:50:12,560
magic
 

10107
02:50:12,560 --> 02:50:13,990
magic
it's like no no they can't be magic

10108
02:50:13,990 --> 02:50:14,000
it's like no no they can't be magic
 

10109
02:50:14,000 --> 02:50:15,830
it's like no no they can't be magic
right so let's break this down and so

10110
02:50:15,830 --> 02:50:15,840
right so let's break this down and so
 

10111
02:50:15,840 --> 02:50:18,389
right so let's break this down and so
what i did is um i went to my my group

10112
02:50:18,389 --> 02:50:18,399
what i did is um i went to my my group
 

10113
02:50:18,399 --> 02:50:19,429
what i did is um i went to my my group
one day

10114
02:50:19,429 --> 02:50:19,439
one day
 

10115
02:50:19,439 --> 02:50:21,269
one day
about about eight years ago and said hey

10116
02:50:21,269 --> 02:50:21,279
about about eight years ago and said hey
 

10117
02:50:21,279 --> 02:50:22,550
about about eight years ago and said hey
guys i've written this new programming

10118
02:50:22,550 --> 02:50:22,560
guys i've written this new programming
 

10119
02:50:22,560 --> 02:50:24,230
guys i've written this new programming
language for you

10120
02:50:24,230 --> 02:50:24,240
language for you
 

10121
02:50:24,240 --> 02:50:26,710
language for you
um and so everything is clear and you

10122
02:50:26,710 --> 02:50:26,720
um and so everything is clear and you
 

10123
02:50:26,720 --> 02:50:28,309
um and so everything is clear and you
know you have to you're not allowed to

10124
02:50:28,309 --> 02:50:28,319
know you have to you're not allowed to
 

10125
02:50:28,319 --> 02:50:29,990
know you have to you're not allowed to
just wander around the lab willy-nilly

10126
02:50:29,990 --> 02:50:30,000
just wander around the lab willy-nilly
 

10127
02:50:30,000 --> 02:50:31,510
just wander around the lab willy-nilly
you have to pick up things in order go

10128
02:50:31,510 --> 02:50:31,520
you have to pick up things in order go
 

10129
02:50:31,520 --> 02:50:33,590
you have to pick up things in order go
to the balance at the right time and all

10130
02:50:33,590 --> 02:50:33,600
to the balance at the right time and all
 

10131
02:50:33,600 --> 02:50:35,269
to the balance at the right time and all
this stuff and they looked at me as if i

10132
02:50:35,269 --> 02:50:35,279
this stuff and they looked at me as if i
 

10133
02:50:35,279 --> 02:50:36,790
this stuff and they looked at me as if i
was insane and basically kicked me out

10134
02:50:36,790 --> 02:50:36,800
was insane and basically kicked me out
 

10135
02:50:36,800 --> 02:50:38,070
was insane and basically kicked me out
of the lab and said no don't do that

10136
02:50:38,070 --> 02:50:38,080
of the lab and said no don't do that
 

10137
02:50:38,080 --> 02:50:39,750
of the lab and said no don't do that
we're not doing that yeah and i said

10138
02:50:39,750 --> 02:50:39,760
we're not doing that yeah and i said
 

10139
02:50:39,760 --> 02:50:41,110
we're not doing that yeah and i said
okay so i went back the next day and

10140
02:50:41,110 --> 02:50:41,120
okay so i went back the next day and
 

10141
02:50:41,120 --> 02:50:43,030
okay so i went back the next day and
said

10142
02:50:43,030 --> 02:50:43,040
said
 

10143
02:50:43,040 --> 02:50:44,950
said
i'm gonna find some money so we can make

10144
02:50:44,950 --> 02:50:44,960
i'm gonna find some money so we can make
 

10145
02:50:44,960 --> 02:50:46,630
i'm gonna find some money so we can make
cool robots do chemical reactions

10146
02:50:46,630 --> 02:50:46,640
cool robots do chemical reactions
 

10147
02:50:46,640 --> 02:50:48,790
cool robots do chemical reactions
everyone went that's cool yeah

10148
02:50:48,790 --> 02:50:48,800
everyone went that's cool yeah
 

10149
02:50:48,800 --> 02:50:51,349
everyone went that's cool yeah
and so in that process

10150
02:50:51,349 --> 02:50:51,359
and so in that process
 

10151
02:50:51,359 --> 02:50:53,030
and so in that process
the first to try to convert the humans

10152
02:50:53,030 --> 02:50:53,040
the first to try to convert the humans
 

10153
02:50:53,040 --> 02:50:54,790
the first to try to convert the humans
to become robots and

10154
02:50:54,790 --> 02:50:54,800
to become robots and
 

10155
02:50:54,800 --> 02:50:56,469
to become robots and
next you agree you might as well just

10156
02:50:56,469 --> 02:50:56,479
next you agree you might as well just
 

10157
02:50:56,479 --> 02:50:59,030
next you agree you might as well just
create the robots yes but so in that in

10158
02:50:59,030 --> 02:50:59,040
create the robots yes but so in that in
 

10159
02:50:59,040 --> 02:51:00,630
create the robots yes but so in that in
the formalization process yeah so what i

10160
02:51:00,630 --> 02:51:00,640
the formalization process yeah so what i
 

10161
02:51:00,640 --> 02:51:02,710
the formalization process yeah so what i
did i said look a react chemical to make

10162
02:51:02,710 --> 02:51:02,720
did i said look a react chemical to make
 

10163
02:51:02,720 --> 02:51:04,230
did i said look a react chemical to make
a molecule you need to do four things

10164
02:51:04,230 --> 02:51:04,240
a molecule you need to do four things
 

10165
02:51:04,240 --> 02:51:05,750
a molecule you need to do four things
abstractly i want to make a chemical

10166
02:51:05,750 --> 02:51:05,760
abstractly i want to make a chemical
 

10167
02:51:05,760 --> 02:51:07,910
abstractly i want to make a chemical
turing machine because a turing machine

10168
02:51:07,910 --> 02:51:07,920
turing machine because a turing machine
 

10169
02:51:07,920 --> 02:51:09,349
turing machine because a turing machine
you think about this imagine a turing

10170
02:51:09,349 --> 02:51:09,359
you think about this imagine a turing
 

10171
02:51:09,359 --> 02:51:12,389
you think about this imagine a turing
machine turing machine is the ultimate

10172
02:51:12,389 --> 02:51:12,399
machine turing machine is the ultimate
 

10173
02:51:12,399 --> 02:51:15,110
machine turing machine is the ultimate
abstraction of of a computation because

10174
02:51:15,110 --> 02:51:15,120
abstraction of of a computation because
 

10175
02:51:15,120 --> 02:51:17,910
abstraction of of a computation because
it's been shown by turing in others that

10176
02:51:17,910 --> 02:51:17,920
it's been shown by turing in others that
 

10177
02:51:17,920 --> 02:51:19,830
it's been shown by turing in others that
basically a universal turing machine

10178
02:51:19,830 --> 02:51:19,840
basically a universal turing machine
 

10179
02:51:19,840 --> 02:51:22,150
basically a universal turing machine
should be able to do all computations

10180
02:51:22,150 --> 02:51:22,160
should be able to do all computations
 

10181
02:51:22,160 --> 02:51:24,070
should be able to do all computations
that you can imagine it's like wow

10182
02:51:24,070 --> 02:51:24,080
that you can imagine it's like wow
 

10183
02:51:24,080 --> 02:51:25,429
that you can imagine it's like wow
why don't i think of a turing machine

10184
02:51:25,429 --> 02:51:25,439
why don't i think of a turing machine
 

10185
02:51:25,439 --> 02:51:27,030
why don't i think of a turing machine
for chemistry let's think of a magic

10186
02:51:27,030 --> 02:51:27,040
for chemistry let's think of a magic
 

10187
02:51:27,040 --> 02:51:29,510
for chemistry let's think of a magic
robot that can make any molecule

10188
02:51:29,510 --> 02:51:29,520
robot that can make any molecule
 

10189
02:51:29,520 --> 02:51:31,670
robot that can make any molecule
let's think about that for a second okay

10190
02:51:31,670 --> 02:51:31,680
let's think about that for a second okay
 

10191
02:51:31,680 --> 02:51:33,590
let's think about that for a second okay
great how do we then implement it and i

10192
02:51:33,590 --> 02:51:33,600
great how do we then implement it and i
 

10193
02:51:33,600 --> 02:51:34,630
great how do we then implement it and i
think it's right so what is the

10194
02:51:34,630 --> 02:51:34,640
think it's right so what is the
 

10195
02:51:34,640 --> 02:51:36,790
think it's right so what is the
abstraction so to do

10196
02:51:36,790 --> 02:51:36,800
abstraction so to do
 

10197
02:51:36,800 --> 02:51:38,150
abstraction so to do
to make any molecule you have to do a

10198
02:51:38,150 --> 02:51:38,160
to make any molecule you have to do a
 

10199
02:51:38,160 --> 02:51:39,990
to make any molecule you have to do a
reaction so you have to put reagents

10200
02:51:39,990 --> 02:51:40,000
reaction so you have to put reagents
 

10201
02:51:40,000 --> 02:51:41,429
reaction so you have to put reagents
together do a reaction

10202
02:51:41,429 --> 02:51:41,439
together do a reaction
 

10203
02:51:41,439 --> 02:51:42,790
together do a reaction
in a flask

10204
02:51:42,790 --> 02:51:42,800
in a flask
 

10205
02:51:42,800 --> 02:51:44,790
in a flask
typically then you after the reaction

10206
02:51:44,790 --> 02:51:44,800
typically then you after the reaction
 

10207
02:51:44,800 --> 02:51:45,990
typically then you after the reaction
you have to stop the reactions you do

10208
02:51:45,990 --> 02:51:46,000
you have to stop the reactions you do
 

10209
02:51:46,000 --> 02:51:48,630
you have to stop the reactions you do
what's called a workup so whatever cool

10210
02:51:48,630 --> 02:51:48,640
what's called a workup so whatever cool
 

10211
02:51:48,640 --> 02:51:51,510
what's called a workup so whatever cool
it down add some liquid to it extract so

10212
02:51:51,510 --> 02:51:51,520
it down add some liquid to it extract so
 

10213
02:51:51,520 --> 02:51:52,710
it down add some liquid to it extract so
then after you do the workup you

10214
02:51:52,710 --> 02:51:52,720
then after you do the workup you
 

10215
02:51:52,720 --> 02:51:54,790
then after you do the workup you
separate so you then remove the molecule

10216
02:51:54,790 --> 02:51:54,800
separate so you then remove the molecule
 

10217
02:51:54,800 --> 02:51:56,550
separate so you then remove the molecule
separate them all out and then the final

10218
02:51:56,550 --> 02:51:56,560
separate them all out and then the final
 

10219
02:51:56,560 --> 02:51:59,910
separate them all out and then the final
step is purification so reaction uh work

10220
02:51:59,910 --> 02:51:59,920
step is purification so reaction uh work
 

10221
02:51:59,920 --> 02:52:02,550
step is purification so reaction uh work
up separate purify so this is basically

10222
02:52:02,550 --> 02:52:02,560
up separate purify so this is basically
 

10223
02:52:02,560 --> 02:52:05,429
up separate purify so this is basically
like my exactly like a um a turing

10224
02:52:05,429 --> 02:52:05,439
like my exactly like a um a turing
 

10225
02:52:05,439 --> 02:52:07,110
like my exactly like a um a turing
machine where you have your tape you

10226
02:52:07,110 --> 02:52:07,120
machine where you have your tape you
 

10227
02:52:07,120 --> 02:52:09,190
machine where you have your tape you
have your tape head you have some rules

10228
02:52:09,190 --> 02:52:09,200
have your tape head you have some rules
 

10229
02:52:09,200 --> 02:52:11,510
have your tape head you have some rules
and then you run it so i thought cool

10230
02:52:11,510 --> 02:52:11,520
and then you run it so i thought cool
 

10231
02:52:11,520 --> 02:52:13,110
and then you run it so i thought cool
i went to all the chemists and said look

10232
02:52:13,110 --> 02:52:13,120
i went to all the chemists and said look
 

10233
02:52:13,120 --> 02:52:16,550
i went to all the chemists and said look
chemistry isn't that hard reaction work

10234
02:52:16,550 --> 02:52:16,560
chemistry isn't that hard reaction work
 

10235
02:52:16,560 --> 02:52:18,550
chemistry isn't that hard reaction work
up separation purification do that in

10236
02:52:18,550 --> 02:52:18,560
up separation purification do that in
 

10237
02:52:18,560 --> 02:52:21,030
up separation purification do that in
cycles forever for any molecule all the

10238
02:52:21,030 --> 02:52:21,040
cycles forever for any molecule all the
 

10239
02:52:21,040 --> 02:52:22,150
cycles forever for any molecule all the
chemistry

10240
02:52:22,150 --> 02:52:22,160
chemistry
 

10241
02:52:22,160 --> 02:52:22,950
chemistry
done

10242
02:52:22,950 --> 02:52:22,960
done
 

10243
02:52:22,960 --> 02:52:25,990
done
and they said um chemistry is that hard

10244
02:52:25,990 --> 02:52:26,000
and they said um chemistry is that hard
 

10245
02:52:26,000 --> 02:52:28,630
and they said um chemistry is that hard
i said but but just in principle and i

10246
02:52:28,630 --> 02:52:28,640
i said but but just in principle and i
 

10247
02:52:28,640 --> 02:52:30,389
i said but but just in principle and i
got a few very enlightened people to say

10248
02:52:30,389 --> 02:52:30,399
got a few very enlightened people to say
 

10249
02:52:30,399 --> 02:52:31,670
got a few very enlightened people to say
yeah okay in principle but it ain't

10250
02:52:31,670 --> 02:52:31,680
yeah okay in principle but it ain't
 

10251
02:52:31,680 --> 02:52:32,950
yeah okay in principle but it ain't
gonna work

10252
02:52:32,950 --> 02:52:32,960
gonna work
 

10253
02:52:32,960 --> 02:52:36,469
gonna work
and this was in about 2013 2014

10254
02:52:36,469 --> 02:52:36,479
and this was in about 2013 2014
 

10255
02:52:36,479 --> 02:52:37,349
and this was in about 2013 2014
and i

10256
02:52:37,349 --> 02:52:37,359
and i
 

10257
02:52:37,359 --> 02:52:39,269
and i
i found myself going to an architecture

10258
02:52:39,269 --> 02:52:39,279
i found myself going to an architecture
 

10259
02:52:39,279 --> 02:52:41,269
i found myself going to an architecture
conference almost by accident it's like

10260
02:52:41,269 --> 02:52:41,279
conference almost by accident it's like
 

10261
02:52:41,279 --> 02:52:42,790
conference almost by accident it's like
why i'm at this random conference on

10262
02:52:42,790 --> 02:52:42,800
why i'm at this random conference on
 

10263
02:52:42,800 --> 02:52:44,230
why i'm at this random conference on
architecture

10264
02:52:44,230 --> 02:52:44,240
architecture
 

10265
02:52:44,240 --> 02:52:45,830
architecture
and that was because i published a paper

10266
02:52:45,830 --> 02:52:45,840
and that was because i published a paper
 

10267
02:52:45,840 --> 02:52:48,070
and that was because i published a paper
on inorganic architecture and they said

10268
02:52:48,070 --> 02:52:48,080
on inorganic architecture and they said
 

10269
02:52:48,080 --> 02:52:49,510
on inorganic architecture and they said
come to the architecture conference but

10270
02:52:49,510 --> 02:52:49,520
come to the architecture conference but
 

10271
02:52:49,520 --> 02:52:51,030
come to the architecture conference but
the inorganic architecture nano

10272
02:52:51,030 --> 02:52:51,040
the inorganic architecture nano
 

10273
02:52:51,040 --> 02:52:53,030
the inorganic architecture nano
architecture it's not and i went okay

10274
02:52:53,030 --> 02:52:53,040
architecture it's not and i went okay
 

10275
02:52:53,040 --> 02:52:54,230
architecture it's not and i went okay
and then i found these guys at the

10276
02:52:54,230 --> 02:52:54,240
and then i found these guys at the
 

10277
02:52:54,240 --> 02:52:56,790
and then i found these guys at the
conference 3d printing ping-pong balls

10278
02:52:56,790 --> 02:52:56,800
conference 3d printing ping-pong balls
 

10279
02:52:56,800 --> 02:52:58,230
conference 3d printing ping-pong balls
and shapes and this is through it 3d

10280
02:52:58,230 --> 02:52:58,240
and shapes and this is through it 3d
 

10281
02:52:58,240 --> 02:52:59,830
and shapes and this is through it 3d
printing was cool and it's like this is

10282
02:52:59,830 --> 02:52:59,840
printing was cool and it's like this is
 

10283
02:52:59,840 --> 02:53:01,349
printing was cool and it's like this is
ridiculous why are you 3d printing ping

10284
02:53:01,349 --> 02:53:01,359
ridiculous why are you 3d printing ping
 

10285
02:53:01,359 --> 02:53:02,790
ridiculous why are you 3d printing ping
pong balls and i gave them a whole load

10286
02:53:02,790 --> 02:53:02,800
pong balls and i gave them a whole load
 

10287
02:53:02,800 --> 02:53:04,389
pong balls and i gave them a whole load
of abuse like i normally do when i first

10288
02:53:04,389 --> 02:53:04,399
of abuse like i normally do when i first
 

10289
02:53:04,399 --> 02:53:06,070
of abuse like i normally do when i first
meet people how to win friends and

10290
02:53:06,070 --> 02:53:06,080
meet people how to win friends and
 

10291
02:53:06,080 --> 02:53:07,990
meet people how to win friends and
influence people and then i was like oh

10292
02:53:07,990 --> 02:53:08,000
influence people and then i was like oh
 

10293
02:53:08,000 --> 02:53:10,309
influence people and then i was like oh
my god you guys are geniuses yeah and so

10294
02:53:10,309 --> 02:53:10,319
my god you guys are geniuses yeah and so
 

10295
02:53:10,319 --> 02:53:11,830
my god you guys are geniuses yeah and so
i got from they were a bit confused

10296
02:53:11,830 --> 02:53:11,840
i got from they were a bit confused
 

10297
02:53:11,840 --> 02:53:12,950
i got from they were a bit confused
because i was calling them idiots and

10298
02:53:12,950 --> 02:53:12,960
because i was calling them idiots and
 

10299
02:53:12,960 --> 02:53:14,790
because i was calling them idiots and
then call them geniuses it's like

10300
02:53:14,790 --> 02:53:14,800
then call them geniuses it's like
 

10301
02:53:14,800 --> 02:53:16,309
then call them geniuses it's like
will you come to my lab and we're going

10302
02:53:16,309 --> 02:53:16,319
will you come to my lab and we're going
 

10303
02:53:16,319 --> 02:53:18,309
will you come to my lab and we're going
to build a robot to do chemistry with a

10304
02:53:18,309 --> 02:53:18,319
to build a robot to do chemistry with a
 

10305
02:53:18,319 --> 02:53:19,990
to build a robot to do chemistry with a
3d printer and say well that's cool all

10306
02:53:19,990 --> 02:53:20,000
3d printer and say well that's cool all
 

10307
02:53:20,000 --> 02:53:20,790
3d printer and say well that's cool all
right

10308
02:53:20,790 --> 02:53:20,800
right
 

10309
02:53:20,800 --> 02:53:22,389
right
so i had them come to the lab and we

10310
02:53:22,389 --> 02:53:22,399
so i had them come to the lab and we
 

10311
02:53:22,399 --> 02:53:24,389
so i had them come to the lab and we
started to 3d print test tubes so you

10312
02:53:24,389 --> 02:53:24,399
started to 3d print test tubes so you
 

10313
02:53:24,399 --> 02:53:26,710
started to 3d print test tubes so you
imagine you know 3d printer bottle and

10314
02:53:26,710 --> 02:53:26,720
imagine you know 3d printer bottle and
 

10315
02:53:26,720 --> 02:53:29,190
imagine you know 3d printer bottle and
then and then and then use the same

10316
02:53:29,190 --> 02:53:29,200
then and then and then use the same
 

10317
02:53:29,200 --> 02:53:31,590
then and then and then use the same
gantry to basically rather than to

10318
02:53:31,590 --> 02:53:31,600
gantry to basically rather than to
 

10319
02:53:31,600 --> 02:53:32,870
gantry to basically rather than to
squirt out

10320
02:53:32,870 --> 02:53:32,880
squirt out
 

10321
02:53:32,880 --> 02:53:34,389
squirt out
plastic out of a nozzle have a little

10322
02:53:34,389 --> 02:53:34,399
plastic out of a nozzle have a little
 

10323
02:53:34,399 --> 02:53:36,710
plastic out of a nozzle have a little
syringe and chemicals in so we had the

10324
02:53:36,710 --> 02:53:36,720
syringe and chemicals in so we had the
 

10325
02:53:36,720 --> 02:53:38,630
syringe and chemicals in so we had the
3d printer that could simultaneously

10326
02:53:38,630 --> 02:53:38,640
3d printer that could simultaneously
 

10327
02:53:38,640 --> 02:53:39,910
3d printer that could simultaneously
print the test tube and then put

10328
02:53:39,910 --> 02:53:39,920
print the test tube and then put
 

10329
02:53:39,920 --> 02:53:41,910
print the test tube and then put
chemicals into the test tube

10330
02:53:41,910 --> 02:53:41,920
chemicals into the test tube
 

10331
02:53:41,920 --> 02:53:44,309
chemicals into the test tube
and then oh it says really end to end

10332
02:53:44,309 --> 02:53:44,319
and then oh it says really end to end
 

10333
02:53:44,319 --> 02:53:45,670
and then oh it says really end to end
yeah i was like that'll be because

10334
02:53:45,670 --> 02:53:45,680
yeah i was like that'll be because
 

10335
02:53:45,680 --> 02:53:47,030
yeah i was like that'll be because
they've got g-code to do it all it's

10336
02:53:47,030 --> 02:53:47,040
they've got g-code to do it all it's
 

10337
02:53:47,040 --> 02:53:49,349
they've got g-code to do it all it's
like yeah that's cool so i got my group

10338
02:53:49,349 --> 02:53:49,359
like yeah that's cool so i got my group
 

10339
02:53:49,359 --> 02:53:50,790
like yeah that's cool so i got my group
doing this and i developed it a bit and

10340
02:53:50,790 --> 02:53:50,800
doing this and i developed it a bit and
 

10341
02:53:50,800 --> 02:53:53,590
doing this and i developed it a bit and
i realized that we could take those unit

10342
02:53:53,590 --> 02:53:53,600
i realized that we could take those unit
 

10343
02:53:53,600 --> 02:53:55,670
i realized that we could take those unit
operations and we built a whole bunch of

10344
02:53:55,670 --> 02:53:55,680
operations and we built a whole bunch of
 

10345
02:53:55,680 --> 02:53:58,070
operations and we built a whole bunch of
pumps and valves and i realized that i

10346
02:53:58,070 --> 02:53:58,080
pumps and valves and i realized that i
 

10347
02:53:58,080 --> 02:54:00,630
pumps and valves and i realized that i
could basically take the literature

10348
02:54:00,630 --> 02:54:00,640
could basically take the literature
 

10349
02:54:00,640 --> 02:54:01,990
could basically take the literature
and i made the first version of the

10350
02:54:01,990 --> 02:54:02,000
and i made the first version of the
 

10351
02:54:02,000 --> 02:54:05,750
and i made the first version of the
computer in 2016-17

10352
02:54:05,750 --> 02:54:05,760
computer in 2016-17
 

10353
02:54:05,760 --> 02:54:07,590
computer in 2016-17
i made some architectural decisions so i

10354
02:54:07,590 --> 02:54:07,600
i made some architectural decisions so i
 

10355
02:54:07,600 --> 02:54:09,030
i made some architectural decisions so i
designed the pumps and valves in my

10356
02:54:09,030 --> 02:54:09,040
designed the pumps and valves in my
 

10357
02:54:09,040 --> 02:54:10,389
designed the pumps and valves in my
group i did all the electronics in my

10358
02:54:10,389 --> 02:54:10,399
group i did all the electronics in my
 

10359
02:54:10,399 --> 02:54:12,150
group i did all the electronics in my
group they were brilliant

10360
02:54:12,150 --> 02:54:12,160
group they were brilliant
 

10361
02:54:12,160 --> 02:54:12,950
group they were brilliant
i

10362
02:54:12,950 --> 02:54:12,960
i
 

10363
02:54:12,960 --> 02:54:14,870
i
i cannot pay tribute to my group enough

10364
02:54:14,870 --> 02:54:14,880
i cannot pay tribute to my group enough
 

10365
02:54:14,880 --> 02:54:16,550
i cannot pay tribute to my group enough
in doing this they were just brilliant

10366
02:54:16,550 --> 02:54:16,560
in doing this they were just brilliant
 

10367
02:54:16,560 --> 02:54:17,910
in doing this they were just brilliant
and there were some poor souls there

10368
02:54:17,910 --> 02:54:17,920
and there were some poor souls there
 

10369
02:54:17,920 --> 02:54:19,190
and there were some poor souls there
that said lee

10370
02:54:19,190 --> 02:54:19,200
that said lee
 

10371
02:54:19,200 --> 02:54:21,190
that said lee
why are you making us design electronics

10372
02:54:21,190 --> 02:54:21,200
why are you making us design electronics
 

10373
02:54:21,200 --> 02:54:23,349
why are you making us design electronics
i'm like well because i don't understand

10374
02:54:23,349 --> 02:54:23,359
i'm like well because i don't understand
 

10375
02:54:23,359 --> 02:54:24,309
i'm like well because i don't understand
it

10376
02:54:24,309 --> 02:54:24,319
it
 

10377
02:54:24,319 --> 02:54:25,830
it
like so you're making us design stuff

10378
02:54:25,830 --> 02:54:25,840
like so you're making us design stuff
 

10379
02:54:25,840 --> 02:54:26,790
like so you're making us design stuff
because you don't understand it's like

10380
02:54:26,790 --> 02:54:26,800
because you don't understand it's like
 

10381
02:54:26,800 --> 02:54:28,550
because you don't understand it's like
yeah it's like but can we not just buy

10382
02:54:28,550 --> 02:54:28,560
yeah it's like but can we not just buy
 

10383
02:54:28,560 --> 02:54:29,429
yeah it's like but can we not just buy
some

10384
02:54:29,429 --> 02:54:29,439
some
 

10385
02:54:29,439 --> 02:54:31,030
some
i said well we can but then i don't

10386
02:54:31,030 --> 02:54:31,040
i said well we can but then i don't
 

10387
02:54:31,040 --> 02:54:33,110
i said well we can but then i don't
understand how to you know

10388
02:54:33,110 --> 02:54:33,120
understand how to you know
 

10389
02:54:33,120 --> 02:54:34,710
understand how to you know
what bus they're gonna use and the

10390
02:54:34,710 --> 02:54:34,720
what bus they're gonna use and the
 

10391
02:54:34,720 --> 02:54:36,150
what bus they're gonna use and the
serial ports and all this stuff i just

10392
02:54:36,150 --> 02:54:36,160
serial ports and all this stuff i just
 

10393
02:54:36,160 --> 02:54:38,870
serial ports and all this stuff i just
wanted and i made i came up the decision

10394
02:54:38,870 --> 02:54:38,880
wanted and i made i came up the decision
 

10395
02:54:38,880 --> 02:54:40,870
wanted and i made i came up the decision
to design a bunch of pumps and valves

10396
02:54:40,870 --> 02:54:40,880
to design a bunch of pumps and valves
 

10397
02:54:40,880 --> 02:54:42,550
to design a bunch of pumps and valves
and use power of the ethernet so you've

10398
02:54:42,550 --> 02:54:42,560
and use power of the ethernet so you've
 

10399
02:54:42,560 --> 02:54:45,429
and use power of the ethernet so you've
got one cable for power and data plug

10400
02:54:45,429 --> 02:54:45,439
got one cable for power and data plug
 

10401
02:54:45,439 --> 02:54:47,990
got one cable for power and data plug
them all in plug them all into a router

10402
02:54:47,990 --> 02:54:48,000
them all in plug them all into a router
 

10403
02:54:48,000 --> 02:54:51,269
them all in plug them all into a router
and um and then i made the state machine

10404
02:54:51,269 --> 02:54:51,279
and um and then i made the state machine
 

10405
02:54:51,279 --> 02:54:52,950
and um and then i made the state machine
and there was a couple of cool things i

10406
02:54:52,950 --> 02:54:52,960
and there was a couple of cool things i
 

10407
02:54:52,960 --> 02:54:55,590
and there was a couple of cool things i
did all they did actually um

10408
02:54:55,590 --> 02:54:55,600
did all they did actually um
 

10409
02:54:55,600 --> 02:54:58,630
did all they did actually um
we got the the abstraction so reaction

10410
02:54:58,630 --> 02:54:58,640
we got the the abstraction so reaction
 

10411
02:54:58,640 --> 02:55:02,469
we got the the abstraction so reaction
uh work up separation um purification

10412
02:55:02,469 --> 02:55:02,479
uh work up separation um purification
 

10413
02:55:02,479 --> 02:55:03,510
uh work up separation um purification
and then i

10414
02:55:03,510 --> 02:55:03,520
and then i
 

10415
02:55:03,520 --> 02:55:05,910
and then i
made the decision to do it in batch

10416
02:55:05,910 --> 02:55:05,920
made the decision to do it in batch
 

10417
02:55:05,920 --> 02:55:07,750
made the decision to do it in batch
now as in batch

10418
02:55:07,750 --> 02:55:07,760
now as in batch
 

10419
02:55:07,760 --> 02:55:09,910
now as in batch
all chemistry had been digitized before

10420
02:55:09,910 --> 02:55:09,920
all chemistry had been digitized before
 

10421
02:55:09,920 --> 02:55:11,750
all chemistry had been digitized before
apparently every once it's been done but

10422
02:55:11,750 --> 02:55:11,760
apparently every once it's been done but
 

10423
02:55:11,760 --> 02:55:13,750
apparently every once it's been done but
everyone's been doing it in flow

10424
02:55:13,750 --> 02:55:13,760
everyone's been doing it in flow
 

10425
02:55:13,760 --> 02:55:15,269
everyone's been doing it in flow
and flow is continuous and there are

10426
02:55:15,269 --> 02:55:15,279
and flow is continuous and there are
 

10427
02:55:15,279 --> 02:55:16,469
and flow is continuous and there are
infinity is everywhere and you have to

10428
02:55:16,469 --> 02:55:16,479
infinity is everywhere and you have to
 

10429
02:55:16,479 --> 02:55:18,870
infinity is everywhere and you have to
just and i realized

10430
02:55:18,870 --> 02:55:18,880
just and i realized
 

10431
02:55:18,880 --> 02:55:20,230
just and i realized
that i could actually make a state

10432
02:55:20,230 --> 02:55:20,240
that i could actually make a state
 

10433
02:55:20,240 --> 02:55:22,870
that i could actually make a state
machine where i basically put stuff in

10434
02:55:22,870 --> 02:55:22,880
machine where i basically put stuff in
 

10435
02:55:22,880 --> 02:55:24,710
machine where i basically put stuff in
the reactor

10436
02:55:24,710 --> 02:55:24,720
the reactor
 

10437
02:55:24,720 --> 02:55:25,990
the reactor
turn it up from one state to another

10438
02:55:25,990 --> 02:55:26,000
turn it up from one state to another
 

10439
02:55:26,000 --> 02:55:28,389
turn it up from one state to another
state stop it and just read it out and

10440
02:55:28,389 --> 02:55:28,399
state stop it and just read it out and
 

10441
02:55:28,399 --> 02:55:30,710
state stop it and just read it out and
okay and i was kind of bitching at

10442
02:55:30,710 --> 02:55:30,720
okay and i was kind of bitching at
 

10443
02:55:30,720 --> 02:55:31,990
okay and i was kind of bitching at
electrical engineers saying you have it

10444
02:55:31,990 --> 02:55:32,000
electrical engineers saying you have it
 

10445
02:55:32,000 --> 02:55:33,030
electrical engineers saying you have it
easy you don't have to clean out the

10446
02:55:33,030 --> 02:55:33,040
easy you don't have to clean out the
 

10447
02:55:33,040 --> 02:55:35,190
easy you don't have to clean out the
electrons you know because electrons

10448
02:55:35,190 --> 02:55:35,200
electrons you know because electrons
 

10449
02:55:35,200 --> 02:55:36,790
electrons you know because electrons
don't leave a big mess they leave some

10450
02:55:36,790 --> 02:55:36,800
don't leave a big mess they leave some
 

10451
02:55:36,800 --> 02:55:39,110
don't leave a big mess they leave some
em waste but in my state machine i built

10452
02:55:39,110 --> 02:55:39,120
em waste but in my state machine i built
 

10453
02:55:39,120 --> 02:55:40,550
em waste but in my state machine i built
in cleaning so it's like would do all

10454
02:55:40,550 --> 02:55:40,560
in cleaning so it's like would do all
 

10455
02:55:40,560 --> 02:55:42,469
in cleaning so it's like would do all
operation then it cleans the backbone

10456
02:55:42,469 --> 02:55:42,479
operation then it cleans the backbone
 

10457
02:55:42,479 --> 02:55:43,590
operation then it cleans the backbone
then can do it again so there's no

10458
02:55:43,590 --> 02:55:43,600
then can do it again so there's no
 

10459
02:55:43,600 --> 02:55:45,910
then can do it again so there's no
there's any so what we managed to do

10460
02:55:45,910 --> 02:55:45,920
there's any so what we managed to do
 

10461
02:55:45,920 --> 02:55:48,469
there's any so what we managed to do
over a couple of years is is develop the

10462
02:55:48,469 --> 02:55:48,479
over a couple of years is is develop the
 

10463
02:55:48,479 --> 02:55:50,950
over a couple of years is is develop the
hardware develop state machine and we

10464
02:55:50,950 --> 02:55:50,960
hardware develop state machine and we
 

10465
02:55:50,960 --> 02:55:52,710
hardware develop state machine and we
encoded three molecules we did three the

10466
02:55:52,710 --> 02:55:52,720
encoded three molecules we did three the
 

10467
02:55:52,720 --> 02:55:54,550
encoded three molecules we did three the
first three we did nitol sleeping drug

10468
02:55:54,550 --> 02:55:54,560
first three we did nitol sleeping drug
 

10469
02:55:54,560 --> 02:55:57,030
first three we did nitol sleeping drug
rafinomide anti-seizure and viagra

10470
02:55:57,030 --> 02:55:57,040
rafinomide anti-seizure and viagra
 

10471
02:55:57,040 --> 02:55:59,110
rafinomide anti-seizure and viagra
you know and i i could make jokes on the

10472
02:55:59,110 --> 02:55:59,120
you know and i i could make jokes on the
 

10473
02:55:59,120 --> 02:56:02,070
you know and i i could make jokes on the
paper it's a hard problem blah blah blah

10474
02:56:02,070 --> 02:56:02,080
paper it's a hard problem blah blah blah
 

10475
02:56:02,080 --> 02:56:03,750
paper it's a hard problem blah blah blah
yeah that's very good

10476
02:56:03,750 --> 02:56:03,760
yeah that's very good
 

10477
02:56:03,760 --> 02:56:05,269
yeah that's very good
and then and then in the next one what

10478
02:56:05,269 --> 02:56:05,279
and then and then in the next one what
 

10479
02:56:05,279 --> 02:56:07,510
and then and then in the next one what
we did said okay my poor organic chemist

10480
02:56:07,510 --> 02:56:07,520
we did said okay my poor organic chemist
 

10481
02:56:07,520 --> 02:56:09,349
we did said okay my poor organic chemist
said look lee

10482
02:56:09,349 --> 02:56:09,359
said look lee
 

10483
02:56:09,359 --> 02:56:11,110
said look lee
we've we've worked with you this long

10484
02:56:11,110 --> 02:56:11,120
we've we've worked with you this long
 

10485
02:56:11,120 --> 02:56:12,870
we've we've worked with you this long
we've made a robot that looks like it's

10486
02:56:12,870 --> 02:56:12,880
we've made a robot that looks like it's
 

10487
02:56:12,880 --> 02:56:14,550
we've made a robot that looks like it's
going to take our jobs away

10488
02:56:14,550 --> 02:56:14,560
going to take our jobs away
 

10489
02:56:14,560 --> 02:56:15,910
going to take our jobs away
and

10490
02:56:15,910 --> 02:56:15,920
and
 

10491
02:56:15,920 --> 02:56:17,830
and
and not just take our jobs away that

10492
02:56:17,830 --> 02:56:17,840
and not just take our jobs away that
 

10493
02:56:17,840 --> 02:56:19,429
and not just take our jobs away that
what we love in the lab but now we have

10494
02:56:19,429 --> 02:56:19,439
what we love in the lab but now we have
 

10495
02:56:19,439 --> 02:56:21,190
what we love in the lab but now we have
to become programmers but we're not even

10496
02:56:21,190 --> 02:56:21,200
to become programmers but we're not even
 

10497
02:56:21,200 --> 02:56:22,630
to become programmers but we're not even
good programmers we just have to spend

10498
02:56:22,630 --> 02:56:22,640
good programmers we just have to spend
 

10499
02:56:22,640 --> 02:56:24,870
good programmers we just have to spend
ages writing lines of code

10500
02:56:24,870 --> 02:56:24,880
ages writing lines of code
 

10501
02:56:24,880 --> 02:56:27,269
ages writing lines of code
that are boring and it's not as elegant

10502
02:56:27,269 --> 02:56:27,279
that are boring and it's not as elegant
 

10503
02:56:27,279 --> 02:56:28,710
that are boring and it's not as elegant
and when you're right

10504
02:56:28,710 --> 02:56:28,720
and when you're right
 

10505
02:56:28,720 --> 02:56:29,910
and when you're right
so then

10506
02:56:29,910 --> 02:56:29,920
so then
 

10507
02:56:29,920 --> 02:56:31,190
so then
but i knew because i had this

10508
02:56:31,190 --> 02:56:31,200
but i knew because i had this
 

10509
02:56:31,200 --> 02:56:32,550
but i knew because i had this
abstraction

10510
02:56:32,550 --> 02:56:32,560
abstraction
 

10511
02:56:32,560 --> 02:56:34,710
abstraction
and i knew that there was language

10512
02:56:34,710 --> 02:56:34,720
and i knew that there was language
 

10513
02:56:34,720 --> 02:56:36,389
and i knew that there was language
i could suddenly develop a state machine

10514
02:56:36,389 --> 02:56:36,399
i could suddenly develop a state machine
 

10515
02:56:36,399 --> 02:56:37,670
i could suddenly develop a state machine
that would interpret the language which

10516
02:56:37,670 --> 02:56:37,680
that would interpret the language which
 

10517
02:56:37,680 --> 02:56:40,950
that would interpret the language which
was lossy and ambiguous and populate my

10518
02:56:40,950 --> 02:56:40,960
was lossy and ambiguous and populate my
 

10519
02:56:40,960 --> 02:56:42,950
was lossy and ambiguous and populate my
abstraction so i built a chemical

10520
02:56:42,950 --> 02:56:42,960
abstraction so i built a chemical
 

10521
02:56:42,960 --> 02:56:45,349
abstraction so i built a chemical
programming language that is is actually

10522
02:56:45,349 --> 02:56:45,359
programming language that is is actually
 

10523
02:56:45,359 --> 02:56:46,950
programming language that is is actually
going to be recursively enumerable it's

10524
02:56:46,950 --> 02:56:46,960
going to be recursively enumerable it's
 

10525
02:56:46,960 --> 02:56:48,230
going to be recursively enumerable it's
going to be a turing complete language

10526
02:56:48,230 --> 02:56:48,240
going to be a turing complete language
 

10527
02:56:48,240 --> 02:56:49,349
going to be a turing complete language
actually which is kind of cool which

10528
02:56:49,349 --> 02:56:49,359
actually which is kind of cool which
 

10529
02:56:49,359 --> 02:56:51,510
actually which is kind of cool which
means it's formally verifiable

10530
02:56:51,510 --> 02:56:51,520
means it's formally verifiable
 

10531
02:56:51,520 --> 02:56:52,309
means it's formally verifiable
so

10532
02:56:52,309 --> 02:56:52,319
so
 

10533
02:56:52,319 --> 02:56:54,710
so
where we are now is we can now read the

10534
02:56:54,710 --> 02:56:54,720
where we are now is we can now read the
 

10535
02:56:54,720 --> 02:56:55,910
where we are now is we can now read the
literature using a bit of natural

10536
02:56:55,910 --> 02:56:55,920
literature using a bit of natural
 

10537
02:56:55,920 --> 02:56:57,349
literature using a bit of natural
language processing it's not the best

10538
02:56:57,349 --> 02:56:57,359
language processing it's not the best
 

10539
02:56:57,359 --> 02:56:58,790
language processing it's not the best
that many other groups have done better

10540
02:56:58,790 --> 02:56:58,800
that many other groups have done better
 

10541
02:56:58,800 --> 02:57:01,110
that many other groups have done better
job but we can use that language reading

10542
02:57:01,110 --> 02:57:01,120
job but we can use that language reading
 

10543
02:57:01,120 --> 02:57:03,830
job but we can use that language reading
to populate the state machine

10544
02:57:03,830 --> 02:57:03,840
to populate the state machine
 

10545
02:57:03,840 --> 02:57:05,750
to populate the state machine
and basically add subtract there's a

10546
02:57:05,750 --> 02:57:05,760
and basically add subtract there's a
 

10547
02:57:05,760 --> 02:57:06,870
and basically add subtract there's a
we've got about

10548
02:57:06,870 --> 02:57:06,880
we've got about
 

10549
02:57:06,880 --> 02:57:08,630
we've got about
a number of primitives

10550
02:57:08,630 --> 02:57:08,640
a number of primitives
 

10551
02:57:08,640 --> 02:57:09,670
a number of primitives
that we

10552
02:57:09,670 --> 02:57:09,680
that we
 

10553
02:57:09,680 --> 02:57:10,469
that we
the

10554
02:57:10,469 --> 02:57:10,479
the
 

10555
02:57:10,479 --> 02:57:11,269
the
you know

10556
02:57:11,269 --> 02:57:11,279
you know
 

10557
02:57:11,279 --> 02:57:13,750
you know
basically program loops that we dovetail

10558
02:57:13,750 --> 02:57:13,760
basically program loops that we dovetail
 

10559
02:57:13,760 --> 02:57:15,190
basically program loops that we dovetail
together and we can make any molecule

10560
02:57:15,190 --> 02:57:15,200
together and we can make any molecule
 

10561
02:57:15,200 --> 02:57:17,190
together and we can make any molecule
with it okay so that's that's the kind

10562
02:57:17,190 --> 02:57:17,200
with it okay so that's that's the kind
 

10563
02:57:17,200 --> 02:57:19,349
with it okay so that's that's the kind
of program synthesis so you start like

10564
02:57:19,349 --> 02:57:19,359
of program synthesis so you start like
 

10565
02:57:19,359 --> 02:57:21,590
of program synthesis so you start like
literally you talk about like a paper

10566
02:57:21,590 --> 02:57:21,600
literally you talk about like a paper
 

10567
02:57:21,600 --> 02:57:23,429
literally you talk about like a paper
like a scientific paper

10568
02:57:23,429 --> 02:57:23,439
like a scientific paper
 

10569
02:57:23,439 --> 02:57:25,429
like a scientific paper
that's being read

10570
02:57:25,429 --> 02:57:25,439
that's being read
 

10571
02:57:25,439 --> 02:57:27,190
that's being read
from natural language processing

10572
02:57:27,190 --> 02:57:27,200
from natural language processing
 

10573
02:57:27,200 --> 02:57:28,710
from natural language processing
extracting

10574
02:57:28,710 --> 02:57:28,720
extracting
 

10575
02:57:28,720 --> 02:57:32,389
extracting
some kind of uh details about chemical

10576
02:57:32,389 --> 02:57:32,399
some kind of uh details about chemical
 

10577
02:57:32,399 --> 02:57:35,510
some kind of uh details about chemical
reactions and the the chemical

10578
02:57:35,510 --> 02:57:35,520
reactions and the the chemical
 

10579
02:57:35,520 --> 02:57:38,389
reactions and the the chemical
molecules and composites involved

10580
02:57:38,389 --> 02:57:38,399
molecules and composites involved
 

10581
02:57:38,399 --> 02:57:40,309
molecules and composites involved
and then that's

10582
02:57:40,309 --> 02:57:40,319
and then that's
 

10583
02:57:40,319 --> 02:57:43,110
and then that's
that uh in gpt

10584
02:57:43,110 --> 02:57:43,120
that uh in gpt
 

10585
02:57:43,120 --> 02:57:45,750
that uh in gpt
terms serves as a prompt

10586
02:57:45,750 --> 02:57:45,760
terms serves as a prompt
 

10587
02:57:45,760 --> 02:57:48,070
terms serves as a prompt
for the program synthesis that's kind of

10588
02:57:48,070 --> 02:57:48,080
for the program synthesis that's kind of
 

10589
02:57:48,080 --> 02:57:50,070
for the program synthesis that's kind of
trivial right now there you have a bunch

10590
02:57:50,070 --> 02:57:50,080
trivial right now there you have a bunch
 

10591
02:57:50,080 --> 02:57:51,990
trivial right now there you have a bunch
of different like for loops and so on

10592
02:57:51,990 --> 02:57:52,000
of different like for loops and so on
 

10593
02:57:52,000 --> 02:57:54,389
of different like for loops and so on
that creates a program in this

10594
02:57:54,389 --> 02:57:54,399
that creates a program in this
 

10595
02:57:54,399 --> 02:57:56,790
that creates a program in this
chemical language that can then be

10596
02:57:56,790 --> 02:57:56,800
chemical language that can then be
 

10597
02:57:56,800 --> 02:57:58,389
chemical language that can then be
interpreted by the

10598
02:57:58,389 --> 02:57:58,399
interpreted by the
 

10599
02:57:58,399 --> 02:57:59,990
interpreted by the
chemical computer

10600
02:57:59,990 --> 02:58:00,000
chemical computer
 

10601
02:58:00,000 --> 02:58:03,190
chemical computer
uh the computer yeah chem kickstarter

10602
02:58:03,190 --> 02:58:03,200
uh the computer yeah chem kickstarter
 

10603
02:58:03,200 --> 02:58:05,429
uh the computer yeah chem kickstarter
yeah

10604
02:58:05,429 --> 02:58:05,439
yeah
 

10605
02:58:05,439 --> 02:58:07,030
yeah
everything sounds better in your uh

10606
02:58:07,030 --> 02:58:07,040
everything sounds better in your uh
 

10607
02:58:07,040 --> 02:58:09,910
everything sounds better in your uh
british accent but it's i love it so the

10608
02:58:09,910 --> 02:58:09,920
british accent but it's i love it so the
 

10609
02:58:09,920 --> 02:58:11,429
british accent but it's i love it so the
into the computer and that's able to

10610
02:58:11,429 --> 02:58:11,439
into the computer and that's able to
 

10611
02:58:11,439 --> 02:58:13,269
into the computer and that's able to
then

10612
02:58:13,269 --> 02:58:13,279
then
 

10613
02:58:13,279 --> 02:58:15,349
then
basically be a 3d printer

10614
02:58:15,349 --> 02:58:15,359
basically be a 3d printer
 

10615
02:58:15,359 --> 02:58:17,349
basically be a 3d printer
for these for molecules yeah i wouldn't

10616
02:58:17,349 --> 02:58:17,359
for these for molecules yeah i wouldn't
 

10617
02:58:17,359 --> 02:58:18,950
for these for molecules yeah i wouldn't
call it a 3d printer i would call it a

10618
02:58:18,950 --> 02:58:18,960
call it a 3d printer i would call it a
 

10619
02:58:18,960 --> 02:58:20,870
call it a 3d printer i would call it a
universal chemical reaction system

10620
02:58:20,870 --> 02:58:20,880
universal chemical reaction system
 

10621
02:58:20,880 --> 02:58:22,230
universal chemical reaction system
because 3d printing gives the wrong

10622
02:58:22,230 --> 02:58:22,240
because 3d printing gives the wrong
 

10623
02:58:22,240 --> 02:58:25,030
because 3d printing gives the wrong
impression but yeah and and it purifies

10624
02:58:25,030 --> 02:58:25,040
impression but yeah and and it purifies
 

10625
02:58:25,040 --> 02:58:27,269
impression but yeah and and it purifies
and the nice thing is that that code now

10626
02:58:27,269 --> 02:58:27,279
and the nice thing is that that code now
 

10627
02:58:27,279 --> 02:58:30,389
and the nice thing is that that code now
that we call it chem the kdl code

10628
02:58:30,389 --> 02:58:30,399
that we call it chem the kdl code
 

10629
02:58:30,399 --> 02:58:31,429
that we call it chem the kdl code
is

10630
02:58:31,429 --> 02:58:31,439
is
 

10631
02:58:31,439 --> 02:58:33,590
is
is really interesting because

10632
02:58:33,590 --> 02:58:33,600
is really interesting because
 

10633
02:58:33,600 --> 02:58:36,150
is really interesting because
now so computation what is computation

10634
02:58:36,150 --> 02:58:36,160
now so computation what is computation
 

10635
02:58:36,160 --> 02:58:38,150
now so computation what is computation
computation is

10636
02:58:38,150 --> 02:58:38,160
computation is
 

10637
02:58:38,160 --> 02:58:41,190
computation is
what computing is to mathematics i think

10638
02:58:41,190 --> 02:58:41,200
what computing is to mathematics i think
 

10639
02:58:41,200 --> 02:58:43,429
what computing is to mathematics i think
computation is the process of taking

10640
02:58:43,429 --> 02:58:43,439
computation is the process of taking
 

10641
02:58:43,439 --> 02:58:46,230
computation is the process of taking
chemical code and some input reagents

10642
02:58:46,230 --> 02:58:46,240
chemical code and some input reagents
 

10643
02:58:46,240 --> 02:58:48,150
chemical code and some input reagents
and making the same molecule making the

10644
02:58:48,150 --> 02:58:48,160
and making the same molecule making the
 

10645
02:58:48,160 --> 02:58:49,510
and making the same molecule making the
molecule

10646
02:58:49,510 --> 02:58:49,520
molecule
 

10647
02:58:49,520 --> 02:58:51,910
molecule
reproducibly every time without fail

10648
02:58:51,910 --> 02:58:51,920
reproducibly every time without fail
 

10649
02:58:51,920 --> 02:58:54,070
reproducibly every time without fail
well it's computation it's the process

10650
02:58:54,070 --> 02:58:54,080
well it's computation it's the process
 

10651
02:58:54,080 --> 02:58:55,910
well it's computation it's the process
of taking a using a program to take some

10652
02:58:55,910 --> 02:58:55,920
of taking a using a program to take some
 

10653
02:58:55,920 --> 02:58:59,190
of taking a using a program to take some
input conditions and give you an output

10654
02:58:59,190 --> 02:58:59,200
input conditions and give you an output
 

10655
02:58:59,200 --> 02:59:00,630
input conditions and give you an output
same every time

10656
02:59:00,630 --> 02:59:00,640
same every time
 

10657
02:59:00,640 --> 02:59:02,150
same every time
right reliably

10658
02:59:02,150 --> 02:59:02,160
right reliably
 

10659
02:59:02,160 --> 02:59:05,030
right reliably
so the the problem is now maybe you can

10660
02:59:05,030 --> 02:59:05,040
so the the problem is now maybe you can
 

10661
02:59:05,040 --> 02:59:07,349
so the the problem is now maybe you can
push back and correct me on this

10662
02:59:07,349 --> 02:59:07,359
push back and correct me on this
 

10663
02:59:07,359 --> 02:59:09,750
push back and correct me on this
so i know biology is messy

10664
02:59:09,750 --> 02:59:09,760
so i know biology is messy
 

10665
02:59:09,760 --> 02:59:12,550
so i know biology is messy
my question is how messy is chemistry so

10666
02:59:12,550 --> 02:59:12,560
my question is how messy is chemistry so
 

10667
02:59:12,560 --> 02:59:15,510
my question is how messy is chemistry so
the if we use the analogy of a computer

10668
02:59:15,510 --> 02:59:15,520
the if we use the analogy of a computer
 

10669
02:59:15,520 --> 02:59:18,070
the if we use the analogy of a computer
it's easier to make

10670
02:59:18,070 --> 02:59:18,080
it's easier to make
 

10671
02:59:18,080 --> 02:59:20,870
it's easier to make
computation in a computer

10672
02:59:20,870 --> 02:59:20,880
computation in a computer
 

10673
02:59:20,880 --> 02:59:23,750
computation in a computer
very precise that it's repeatable

10674
02:59:23,750 --> 02:59:23,760
very precise that it's repeatable
 

10675
02:59:23,760 --> 02:59:26,950
very precise that it's repeatable
it makes errors almost never if it does

10676
02:59:26,950 --> 02:59:26,960
it makes errors almost never if it does
 

10677
02:59:26,960 --> 02:59:28,389
it makes errors almost never if it does
the exact same way over and over and

10678
02:59:28,389 --> 02:59:28,399
the exact same way over and over and
 

10679
02:59:28,399 --> 02:59:30,550
the exact same way over and over and
over and over what about chemistry is

10680
02:59:30,550 --> 02:59:30,560
over and over what about chemistry is
 

10681
02:59:30,560 --> 02:59:32,550
over and over what about chemistry is
there messiness in the whole thing it

10682
02:59:32,550 --> 02:59:32,560
there messiness in the whole thing it
 

10683
02:59:32,560 --> 02:59:34,150
there messiness in the whole thing it
can that be somehow leveraged can it be

10684
02:59:34,150 --> 02:59:34,160
can that be somehow leveraged can it be
 

10685
02:59:34,160 --> 02:59:36,389
can that be somehow leveraged can it be
controlled can be that removed do we

10686
02:59:36,389 --> 02:59:36,399
controlled can be that removed do we
 

10687
02:59:36,399 --> 02:59:38,630
controlled can be that removed do we
want to remove it from the system oh yes

10688
02:59:38,630 --> 02:59:38,640
want to remove it from the system oh yes
 

10689
02:59:38,640 --> 02:59:40,950
want to remove it from the system oh yes
no right is there messiness

10690
02:59:40,950 --> 02:59:40,960
no right is there messiness
 

10691
02:59:40,960 --> 02:59:42,550
no right is there messiness
there

10692
02:59:42,550 --> 02:59:42,560
there
 

10693
02:59:42,560 --> 02:59:44,630
there
there is messiness because chemistry is

10694
02:59:44,630 --> 02:59:44,640
there is messiness because chemistry is
 

10695
02:59:44,640 --> 02:59:45,990
there is messiness because chemistry is
like you're you're you're doing

10696
02:59:45,990 --> 02:59:46,000
like you're you're you're doing
 

10697
02:59:46,000 --> 02:59:49,030
like you're you're you're doing
reactions on on billions of molecules

10698
02:59:49,030 --> 02:59:49,040
reactions on on billions of molecules
 

10699
02:59:49,040 --> 02:59:50,230
reactions on on billions of molecules
and they don't always work but you've

10700
02:59:50,230 --> 02:59:50,240
and they don't always work but you've
 

10701
02:59:50,240 --> 02:59:51,910
and they don't always work but you've
got purification there

10702
02:59:51,910 --> 02:59:51,920
got purification there
 

10703
02:59:51,920 --> 02:59:53,990
got purification there
and so what we've found is at the

10704
02:59:53,990 --> 02:59:54,000
and so what we've found is at the
 

10705
02:59:54,000 --> 02:59:55,670
and so what we've found is at the
beginning everyone said it can't work

10706
02:59:55,670 --> 02:59:55,680
beginning everyone said it can't work
 

10707
02:59:55,680 --> 02:59:57,830
beginning everyone said it can't work
it's gonna be too messy it'll just fail

10708
02:59:57,830 --> 02:59:57,840
it's gonna be too messy it'll just fail
 

10709
02:59:57,840 --> 02:59:59,510
it's gonna be too messy it'll just fail
and i said but you managed to get

10710
02:59:59,510 --> 02:59:59,520
and i said but you managed to get
 

10711
02:59:59,520 --> 03:00:00,710
and i said but you managed to get
chemistry to work in the lab are you

10712
03:00:00,710 --> 03:00:00,720
chemistry to work in the lab are you
 

10713
03:00:00,720 --> 03:00:02,550
chemistry to work in the lab are you
magic are you doing something

10714
03:00:02,550 --> 03:00:02,560
magic are you doing something
 

10715
03:00:02,560 --> 03:00:03,990
magic are you doing something
so i would say

10716
03:00:03,990 --> 03:00:04,000
so i would say
 

10717
03:00:04,000 --> 03:00:05,750
so i would say
now go back to the first ever computer

10718
03:00:05,750 --> 03:00:05,760
now go back to the first ever computer
 

10719
03:00:05,760 --> 03:00:07,429
now go back to the first ever computer
or the eniac

10720
03:00:07,429 --> 03:00:07,439
or the eniac
 

10721
03:00:07,439 --> 03:00:09,349
or the eniac
five million soldered joints

10722
03:00:09,349 --> 03:00:09,359
five million soldered joints
 

10723
03:00:09,359 --> 03:00:11,830
five million soldered joints
400 000 uh valves that are exploding all

10724
03:00:11,830 --> 03:00:11,840
400 000 uh valves that are exploding all
 

10725
03:00:11,840 --> 03:00:14,309
400 000 uh valves that are exploding all
the time was that would you have gone

10726
03:00:14,309 --> 03:00:14,319
the time was that would you have gone
 

10727
03:00:14,319 --> 03:00:16,230
the time was that would you have gone
okay that's messy

10728
03:00:16,230 --> 03:00:16,240
okay that's messy
 

10729
03:00:16,240 --> 03:00:18,389
okay that's messy
so we've got the and

10730
03:00:18,389 --> 03:00:18,399
so we've got the and
 

10731
03:00:18,399 --> 03:00:19,750
so we've got the and
have we got the equivalent of the aniak

10732
03:00:19,750 --> 03:00:19,760
have we got the equivalent of the aniak
 

10733
03:00:19,760 --> 03:00:20,950
have we got the equivalent of the aniak
in my lab

10734
03:00:20,950 --> 03:00:20,960
in my lab
 

10735
03:00:20,960 --> 03:00:23,349
in my lab
we've got 15 computers in the lab now

10736
03:00:23,349 --> 03:00:23,359
we've got 15 computers in the lab now
 

10737
03:00:23,359 --> 03:00:25,269
we've got 15 computers in the lab now
and they are they unreliable yeah they

10738
03:00:25,269 --> 03:00:25,279
and they are they unreliable yeah they
 

10739
03:00:25,279 --> 03:00:27,269
and they are they unreliable yeah they
fall apart here and there but are they

10740
03:00:27,269 --> 03:00:27,279
fall apart here and there but are they
 

10741
03:00:27,279 --> 03:00:28,630
fall apart here and there but are they
getting better

10742
03:00:28,630 --> 03:00:28,640
getting better
 

10743
03:00:28,640 --> 03:00:31,190
getting better
really quickly yeah are they now able to

10744
03:00:31,190 --> 03:00:31,200
really quickly yeah are they now able to
 

10745
03:00:31,200 --> 03:00:32,950
really quickly yeah are they now able to
reliably make are we at the point in the

10746
03:00:32,950 --> 03:00:32,960
reliably make are we at the point in the
 

10747
03:00:32,960 --> 03:00:34,790
reliably make are we at the point in the
lab where there are some molecules we

10748
03:00:34,790 --> 03:00:34,800
lab where there are some molecules we
 

10749
03:00:34,800 --> 03:00:37,190
lab where there are some molecules we
would rather make on the computer

10750
03:00:37,190 --> 03:00:37,200
would rather make on the computer
 

10751
03:00:37,200 --> 03:00:38,790
would rather make on the computer
than have a human being make yeah we've

10752
03:00:38,790 --> 03:00:38,800
than have a human being make yeah we've
 

10753
03:00:38,800 --> 03:00:41,030
than have a human being make yeah we've
just done we've just made a

10754
03:00:41,030 --> 03:00:41,040
just done we've just made a
 

10755
03:00:41,040 --> 03:00:44,150
just done we've just made a
um anti-influenza molecule and some

10756
03:00:44,150 --> 03:00:44,160
um anti-influenza molecule and some
 

10757
03:00:44,160 --> 03:00:45,670
um anti-influenza molecule and some
antivirals

10758
03:00:45,670 --> 03:00:45,680
antivirals
 

10759
03:00:45,680 --> 03:00:47,990
antivirals
um six steps on the computer that would

10760
03:00:47,990 --> 03:00:48,000
um six steps on the computer that would
 

10761
03:00:48,000 --> 03:00:49,670
um six steps on the computer that would
take a human being

10762
03:00:49,670 --> 03:00:49,680
take a human being
 

10763
03:00:49,680 --> 03:00:52,710
take a human being
about one week to make arbor doll

10764
03:00:52,710 --> 03:00:52,720
about one week to make arbor doll
 

10765
03:00:52,720 --> 03:00:55,110
about one week to make arbor doll
um of continuous labor and all they do

10766
03:00:55,110 --> 03:00:55,120
um of continuous labor and all they do
 

10767
03:00:55,120 --> 03:00:56,389
um of continuous labor and all they do
now is load up the reagents press go

10768
03:00:56,389 --> 03:00:56,399
now is load up the reagents press go
 

10769
03:00:56,399 --> 03:00:58,150
now is load up the reagents press go
button and just go away and drink coffee

10770
03:00:58,150 --> 03:00:58,160
button and just go away and drink coffee
 

10771
03:00:58,160 --> 03:01:00,550
button and just go away and drink coffee
wow so this i mean

10772
03:01:00,550 --> 03:01:00,560
wow so this i mean
 

10773
03:01:00,560 --> 03:01:02,550
wow so this i mean
and this is uh you're saying this

10774
03:01:02,550 --> 03:01:02,560
and this is uh you're saying this
 

10775
03:01:02,560 --> 03:01:05,030
and this is uh you're saying this
computer is just the early days and so

10776
03:01:05,030 --> 03:01:05,040
computer is just the early days and so
 

10777
03:01:05,040 --> 03:01:06,550
computer is just the early days and so
like some of the criticisms just have to

10778
03:01:06,550 --> 03:01:06,560
like some of the criticisms just have to
 

10779
03:01:06,560 --> 03:01:08,950
like some of the criticisms just have to
do with the early days and yes i would

10780
03:01:08,950 --> 03:01:08,960
do with the early days and yes i would
 

10781
03:01:08,960 --> 03:01:11,190
do with the early days and yes i would
say that something like this is

10782
03:01:11,190 --> 03:01:11,200
say that something like this is
 

10783
03:01:11,200 --> 03:01:11,990
say that something like this is
uh

10784
03:01:11,990 --> 03:01:12,000
uh
 

10785
03:01:12,000 --> 03:01:14,389
uh
quite impossible

10786
03:01:14,389 --> 03:01:14,399
quite impossible
 

10787
03:01:14,399 --> 03:01:16,550
quite impossible
uh you know so the fact that you're

10788
03:01:16,550 --> 03:01:16,560
uh you know so the fact that you're
 

10789
03:01:16,560 --> 03:01:18,230
uh you know so the fact that you're
doing is is incredible not not

10790
03:01:18,230 --> 03:01:18,240
doing is is incredible not not
 

10791
03:01:18,240 --> 03:01:19,910
doing is is incredible not not
impossible of course but extremely

10792
03:01:19,910 --> 03:01:19,920
impossible of course but extremely
 

10793
03:01:19,920 --> 03:01:22,389
impossible of course but extremely
difficult it it did seem really

10794
03:01:22,389 --> 03:01:22,399
difficult it it did seem really
 

10795
03:01:22,399 --> 03:01:24,230
difficult it it did seem really
difficult and i do keep pinching myself

10796
03:01:24,230 --> 03:01:24,240
difficult and i do keep pinching myself
 

10797
03:01:24,240 --> 03:01:25,429
difficult and i do keep pinching myself
when i go in the lab i was like is it

10798
03:01:25,429 --> 03:01:25,439
when i go in the lab i was like is it
 

10799
03:01:25,439 --> 03:01:27,830
when i go in the lab i was like is it
working like yep and it it's not you

10800
03:01:27,830 --> 03:01:27,840
working like yep and it it's not you
 

10801
03:01:27,840 --> 03:01:29,110
working like yep and it it's not you
know it does clog

10802
03:01:29,110 --> 03:01:29,120
know it does clog
 

10803
03:01:29,120 --> 03:01:31,590
know it does clog
it does stop you've got to clean this is

10804
03:01:31,590 --> 03:01:31,600
it does stop you've got to clean this is
 

10805
03:01:31,600 --> 03:01:32,389
it does stop you've got to clean this is
great

10806
03:01:32,389 --> 03:01:32,399
great
 

10807
03:01:32,399 --> 03:01:34,469
great
you know but it's um it's getting more

10808
03:01:34,469 --> 03:01:34,479
you know but it's um it's getting more
 

10809
03:01:34,479 --> 03:01:36,710
you know but it's um it's getting more
reliable because i made some we just

10810
03:01:36,710 --> 03:01:36,720
reliable because i made some we just
 

10811
03:01:36,720 --> 03:01:38,389
reliable because i made some we just
made design decisions and said we are

10812
03:01:38,389 --> 03:01:38,399
made design decisions and said we are
 

10813
03:01:38,399 --> 03:01:40,469
made design decisions and said we are
not going to abandon the abstraction

10814
03:01:40,469 --> 03:01:40,479
not going to abandon the abstraction
 

10815
03:01:40,479 --> 03:01:42,630
not going to abandon the abstraction
think about it if the if you the von

10816
03:01:42,630 --> 03:01:42,640
think about it if the if you the von
 

10817
03:01:42,640 --> 03:01:43,590
think about it if the if you the von
neumann

10818
03:01:43,590 --> 03:01:43,600
neumann
 

10819
03:01:43,600 --> 03:01:45,990
neumann
implementation was abandoned i mean

10820
03:01:45,990 --> 03:01:46,000
implementation was abandoned i mean
 

10821
03:01:46,000 --> 03:01:47,670
implementation was abandoned i mean
think about what we do to semiconductors

10822
03:01:47,670 --> 03:01:47,680
think about what we do to semiconductors
 

10823
03:01:47,680 --> 03:01:50,710
think about what we do to semiconductors
to really constrain them to um what we

10824
03:01:50,710 --> 03:01:50,720
to really constrain them to um what we
 

10825
03:01:50,720 --> 03:01:53,349
to really constrain them to um what we
do to silicon in a fab lab

10826
03:01:53,349 --> 03:01:53,359
do to silicon in a fab lab
 

10827
03:01:53,359 --> 03:01:55,910
do to silicon in a fab lab
we take computation for granted silicon

10828
03:01:55,910 --> 03:01:55,920
we take computation for granted silicon
 

10829
03:01:55,920 --> 03:01:57,830
we take computation for granted silicon
is not in its natural state we are

10830
03:01:57,830 --> 03:01:57,840
is not in its natural state we are
 

10831
03:01:57,840 --> 03:01:59,030
is not in its natural state we are
doping the hell out of it it's

10832
03:01:59,030 --> 03:01:59,040
doping the hell out of it it's
 

10833
03:01:59,040 --> 03:02:00,230
doping the hell out of it it's
incredible what they're able to

10834
03:02:00,230 --> 03:02:00,240
incredible what they're able to
 

10835
03:02:00,240 --> 03:02:02,550
incredible what they're able to
accomplish and achieve that reliability

10836
03:02:02,550 --> 03:02:02,560
accomplish and achieve that reliability
 

10837
03:02:02,560 --> 03:02:04,630
accomplish and achieve that reliability
at the scale they do like you said

10838
03:02:04,630 --> 03:02:04,640
at the scale they do like you said
 

10839
03:02:04,640 --> 03:02:07,510
at the scale they do like you said
that's after moore's law we'll have now

10840
03:02:07,510 --> 03:02:07,520
that's after moore's law we'll have now
 

10841
03:02:07,520 --> 03:02:08,469
that's after moore's law we'll have now
and

10842
03:02:08,469 --> 03:02:08,479
and
 

10843
03:02:08,479 --> 03:02:10,550
and
so where we you know

10844
03:02:10,550 --> 03:02:10,560
so where we you know
 

10845
03:02:10,560 --> 03:02:11,349
so where we you know
uh

10846
03:02:11,349 --> 03:02:11,359
uh
 

10847
03:02:11,359 --> 03:02:14,150
uh
how it started you know now we started

10848
03:02:14,150 --> 03:02:14,160
how it started you know now we started
 

10849
03:02:14,160 --> 03:02:15,670
how it started you know now we started
at the bottom now we're here we have

10850
03:02:15,670 --> 03:02:15,680
at the bottom now we're here we have
 

10851
03:02:15,680 --> 03:02:17,590
at the bottom now we're here we have
only have 20 million molecules say 20

10852
03:02:17,590 --> 03:02:17,600
only have 20 million molecules say 20
 

10853
03:02:17,600 --> 03:02:19,750
only have 20 million molecules say 20
million molecules in one database maybe

10854
03:02:19,750 --> 03:02:19,760
million molecules in one database maybe
 

10855
03:02:19,760 --> 03:02:21,429
million molecules in one database maybe
a few hundred million in all the

10856
03:02:21,429 --> 03:02:21,439
a few hundred million in all the
 

10857
03:02:21,439 --> 03:02:23,269
a few hundred million in all the
pharmaceutical companies

10858
03:02:23,269 --> 03:02:23,279
pharmaceutical companies
 

10859
03:02:23,279 --> 03:02:24,870
pharmaceutical companies
um and those few hundred million

10860
03:02:24,870 --> 03:02:24,880
um and those few hundred million
 

10861
03:02:24,880 --> 03:02:26,950
um and those few hundred million
molecules are responsible for all the

10862
03:02:26,950 --> 03:02:26,960
molecules are responsible for all the
 

10863
03:02:26,960 --> 03:02:28,950
molecules are responsible for all the
drugs that we've had in humanity except

10864
03:02:28,950 --> 03:02:28,960
drugs that we've had in humanity except
 

10865
03:02:28,960 --> 03:02:32,150
drugs that we've had in humanity except
you know biologics for the last 50 years

10866
03:02:32,150 --> 03:02:32,160
you know biologics for the last 50 years
 

10867
03:02:32,160 --> 03:02:33,590
you know biologics for the last 50 years
now imagine what happens when a drug

10868
03:02:33,590 --> 03:02:33,600
now imagine what happens when a drug
 

10869
03:02:33,600 --> 03:02:35,190
now imagine what happens when a drug
goes out of print

10870
03:02:35,190 --> 03:02:35,200
goes out of print
 

10871
03:02:35,200 --> 03:02:36,550
goes out of print
it goes out of prints because there's

10872
03:02:36,550 --> 03:02:36,560
it goes out of prints because there's
 

10873
03:02:36,560 --> 03:02:37,910
it goes out of prints because there's
only a finite number of manufacturing

10874
03:02:37,910 --> 03:02:37,920
only a finite number of manufacturing
 

10875
03:02:37,920 --> 03:02:39,030
only a finite number of manufacturing
facilities in the world that make these

10876
03:02:39,030 --> 03:02:39,040
facilities in the world that make these
 

10877
03:02:39,040 --> 03:02:41,110
facilities in the world that make these
drugs is that a print yeah isn't that

10878
03:02:41,110 --> 03:02:41,120
drugs is that a print yeah isn't that
 

10879
03:02:41,120 --> 03:02:43,269
drugs is that a print yeah isn't that
computer the printing press the for

10880
03:02:43,269 --> 03:02:43,279
computer the printing press the for
 

10881
03:02:43,279 --> 03:02:44,950
computer the printing press the for
chemistry yeah

10882
03:02:44,950 --> 03:02:44,960
chemistry yeah
 

10883
03:02:44,960 --> 03:02:46,790
chemistry yeah
and and not only that we can protect the

10884
03:02:46,790 --> 03:02:46,800
and and not only that we can protect the
 

10885
03:02:46,800 --> 03:02:49,030
and and not only that we can protect the
kdl so we can stop bad actors doing it

10886
03:02:49,030 --> 03:02:49,040
kdl so we can stop bad actors doing it
 

10887
03:02:49,040 --> 03:02:50,469
kdl so we can stop bad actors doing it
we can encrypt them

10888
03:02:50,469 --> 03:02:50,479
we can encrypt them
 

10889
03:02:50,479 --> 03:02:51,990
we can encrypt them
and we can give people that's the name

10890
03:02:51,990 --> 03:02:52,000
and we can give people that's the name
 

10891
03:02:52,000 --> 03:02:53,429
and we can give people that's the name
of sorry to interrupt is the name of the

10892
03:02:53,429 --> 03:02:53,439
of sorry to interrupt is the name of the
 

10893
03:02:53,439 --> 03:02:55,269
of sorry to interrupt is the name of the
programming language the kydl is the

10894
03:02:55,269 --> 03:02:55,279
programming language the kydl is the
 

10895
03:02:55,279 --> 03:02:56,950
programming language the kydl is the
name of the programming language and the

10896
03:02:56,950 --> 03:02:56,960
name of the programming language and the
 

10897
03:02:56,960 --> 03:02:59,510
name of the programming language and the
pro code we give the chemicals so chi as

10898
03:02:59,510 --> 03:02:59,520
pro code we give the chemicals so chi as
 

10899
03:02:59,520 --> 03:03:02,550
pro code we give the chemicals so chi as
in you know just for it's like a it's

10900
03:03:02,550 --> 03:03:02,560
in you know just for it's like a it's
 

10901
03:03:02,560 --> 03:03:05,190
in you know just for it's like a it's
actually like an xml format but i've now

10902
03:03:05,190 --> 03:03:05,200
actually like an xml format but i've now
 

10903
03:03:05,200 --> 03:03:07,190
actually like an xml format but i've now
taken it from script to a

10904
03:03:07,190 --> 03:03:07,200
taken it from script to a
 

10905
03:03:07,200 --> 03:03:08,469
taken it from script to a
to a fully

10906
03:03:08,469 --> 03:03:08,479
to a fully
 

10907
03:03:08,479 --> 03:03:10,309
to a fully
expressible programming language so we

10908
03:03:10,309 --> 03:03:10,319
expressible programming language so we
 

10909
03:03:10,319 --> 03:03:12,150
expressible programming language so we
can do dynamics and there's four loops

10910
03:03:12,150 --> 03:03:12,160
can do dynamics and there's four loops
 

10911
03:03:12,160 --> 03:03:13,670
can do dynamics and there's four loops
in there and conditional statements

10912
03:03:13,670 --> 03:03:13,680
in there and conditional statements
 

10913
03:03:13,680 --> 03:03:15,429
in there and conditional statements
right but the structure it started out

10914
03:03:15,429 --> 03:03:15,439
right but the structure it started out
 

10915
03:03:15,439 --> 03:03:17,349
right but the structure it started out
as a um

10916
03:03:17,349 --> 03:03:17,359
as a um
 

10917
03:03:17,359 --> 03:03:19,510
as a um
like a like an xml thing yeah yeah yeah

10918
03:03:19,510 --> 03:03:19,520
like a like an xml thing yeah yeah yeah
 

10919
03:03:19,520 --> 03:03:21,190
like a like an xml thing yeah yeah yeah
yeah and now we also the chemist doesn't

10920
03:03:21,190 --> 03:03:21,200
yeah and now we also the chemist doesn't
 

10921
03:03:21,200 --> 03:03:22,790
yeah and now we also the chemist doesn't
need to program in kdl they can just go

10922
03:03:22,790 --> 03:03:22,800
need to program in kdl they can just go
 

10923
03:03:22,800 --> 03:03:25,030
need to program in kdl they can just go
to the software and type in add a to b

10924
03:03:25,030 --> 03:03:25,040
to the software and type in add a to b
 

10925
03:03:25,040 --> 03:03:27,030
to the software and type in add a to b
reflux do what they would normally do

10926
03:03:27,030 --> 03:03:27,040
reflux do what they would normally do
 

10927
03:03:27,040 --> 03:03:28,469
reflux do what they would normally do
and you just convert it to kindly l and

10928
03:03:28,469 --> 03:03:28,479
and you just convert it to kindly l and
 

10929
03:03:28,479 --> 03:03:29,910
and you just convert it to kindly l and
they have a linter to check it and

10930
03:03:29,910 --> 03:03:29,920
they have a linter to check it and
 

10931
03:03:29,920 --> 03:03:33,030
they have a linter to check it and
everything how do you um

10932
03:03:33,030 --> 03:03:33,040
everything how do you um
 

10933
03:03:33,040 --> 03:03:35,190
everything how do you um
you know not with ascii but because it's

10934
03:03:35,190 --> 03:03:35,200
you know not with ascii but because it's
 

10935
03:03:35,200 --> 03:03:37,910
you know not with ascii but because it's
a greek letter how do you go with

10936
03:03:37,910 --> 03:03:37,920
a greek letter how do you go with
 

10937
03:03:37,920 --> 03:03:41,030
a greek letter how do you go with
um how do you spell it just using the

10938
03:03:41,030 --> 03:03:41,040
um how do you spell it just using the
 

10939
03:03:41,040 --> 03:03:43,590
um how do you spell it just using the
english alphabet we're just like

10940
03:03:43,590 --> 03:03:43,600
english alphabet we're just like
 

10941
03:03:43,600 --> 03:03:46,070
english alphabet we're just like
xdl but all we use we put in kai and it

10942
03:03:46,070 --> 03:03:46,080
xdl but all we use we put in kai and it
 

10943
03:03:46,080 --> 03:03:47,990
xdl but all we use we put in kai and it
was named by one of my students and i

10944
03:03:47,990 --> 03:03:48,000
was named by one of my students and i
 

10945
03:03:48,000 --> 03:03:49,750
was named by one of my students and i
and one of my postdocs many years ago

10946
03:03:49,750 --> 03:03:49,760
and one of my postdocs many years ago
 

10947
03:03:49,760 --> 03:03:52,230
and one of my postdocs many years ago
and i quite liked it it's like

10948
03:03:52,230 --> 03:03:52,240
and i quite liked it it's like
 

10949
03:03:52,240 --> 03:03:53,910
and i quite liked it it's like
it's important i think when the team are

10950
03:03:53,910 --> 03:03:53,920
it's important i think when the team are
 

10951
03:03:53,920 --> 03:03:55,750
it's important i think when the team are
contributing to such big ideas because

10952
03:03:55,750 --> 03:03:55,760
contributing to such big ideas because
 

10953
03:03:55,760 --> 03:03:58,150
contributing to such big ideas because
their ideas as well isn't i try not to

10954
03:03:58,150 --> 03:03:58,160
their ideas as well isn't i try not to
 

10955
03:03:58,160 --> 03:04:00,630
their ideas as well isn't i try not to
just rename i didn't call it cronin or

10956
03:04:00,630 --> 03:04:00,640
just rename i didn't call it cronin or
 

10957
03:04:00,640 --> 03:04:02,150
just rename i didn't call it cronin or
anything that because they keep saying

10958
03:04:02,150 --> 03:04:02,160
anything that because they keep saying
 

10959
03:04:02,160 --> 03:04:05,110
anything that because they keep saying
you know is a

10960
03:04:05,110 --> 03:04:05,120
you know is a
 

10961
03:04:05,120 --> 03:04:06,790
you know is a
is it the the chemistry when they're

10962
03:04:06,790 --> 03:04:06,800
is it the the chemistry when they're
 

10963
03:04:06,800 --> 03:04:08,309
is it the the chemistry when they're
putting stuff in the computer one of my

10964
03:04:08,309 --> 03:04:08,319
putting stuff in the computer one of my
 

10965
03:04:08,319 --> 03:04:09,750
putting stuff in the computer one of my
students said we're asking now is it

10966
03:04:09,750 --> 03:04:09,760
students said we're asking now is it
 

10967
03:04:09,760 --> 03:04:11,030
students said we're asking now is it
cronin complete and i was like what does

10968
03:04:11,030 --> 03:04:11,040
cronin complete and i was like what does
 

10969
03:04:11,040 --> 03:04:12,790
cronin complete and i was like what does
that mean i said well can we make it on

10970
03:04:12,790 --> 03:04:12,800
that mean i said well can we make it on
 

10971
03:04:12,800 --> 03:04:15,190
that mean i said well can we make it on
the damn machine

10972
03:04:15,190 --> 03:04:15,200
the damn machine
 

10973
03:04:15,200 --> 03:04:16,630
the damn machine
and i was like oh is that is that a

10974
03:04:16,630 --> 03:04:16,640
and i was like oh is that is that a
 

10975
03:04:16,640 --> 03:04:18,550
and i was like oh is that is that a
compliment or a majority but they're

10976
03:04:18,550 --> 03:04:18,560
compliment or a majority but they're
 

10977
03:04:18,560 --> 03:04:19,670
compliment or a majority but they're
like well

10978
03:04:19,670 --> 03:04:19,680
like well
 

10979
03:04:19,680 --> 03:04:21,590
like well
it might be both

10980
03:04:21,590 --> 03:04:21,600
it might be both
 

10981
03:04:21,600 --> 03:04:25,030
it might be both
yeah so you tweeted quote why does

10982
03:04:25,030 --> 03:04:25,040
yeah so you tweeted quote why does
 

10983
03:04:25,040 --> 03:04:26,870
yeah so you tweeted quote why does
chemistry need a universal programming

10984
03:04:26,870 --> 03:04:26,880
chemistry need a universal programming
 

10985
03:04:26,880 --> 03:04:29,510
chemistry need a universal programming
language question mark

10986
03:04:29,510 --> 03:04:29,520
language question mark
 

10987
03:04:29,520 --> 03:04:31,750
language question mark
for all the reasons you can think of

10988
03:04:31,750 --> 03:04:31,760
for all the reasons you can think of
 

10989
03:04:31,760 --> 03:04:34,469
for all the reasons you can think of
reliability interoperability

10990
03:04:34,469 --> 03:04:34,479
reliability interoperability
 

10991
03:04:34,479 --> 03:04:37,429
reliability interoperability
collaboration remove ambiguity lower

10992
03:04:37,429 --> 03:04:37,439
collaboration remove ambiguity lower
 

10993
03:04:37,439 --> 03:04:40,630
collaboration remove ambiguity lower
cost increase safety open up discovery

10994
03:04:40,630 --> 03:04:40,640
cost increase safety open up discovery
 

10995
03:04:40,640 --> 03:04:43,750
cost increase safety open up discovery
molecular customization and publication

10996
03:04:43,750 --> 03:04:43,760
molecular customization and publication
 

10997
03:04:43,760 --> 03:04:47,190
molecular customization and publication
of executable chemical code

10998
03:04:47,190 --> 03:04:47,200
of executable chemical code
 

10999
03:04:47,200 --> 03:04:49,830
of executable chemical code
which is fascinating by the way just

11000
03:04:49,830 --> 03:04:49,840
which is fascinating by the way just
 

11001
03:04:49,840 --> 03:04:51,910
which is fascinating by the way just
publish code

11002
03:04:51,910 --> 03:04:51,920
publish code
 

11003
03:04:51,920 --> 03:04:53,910
publish code
and um

11004
03:04:53,910 --> 03:04:53,920
and um
 

11005
03:04:53,920 --> 03:04:55,910
and um
can you maybe elaborate a little bit

11006
03:04:55,910 --> 03:04:55,920
can you maybe elaborate a little bit
 

11007
03:04:55,920 --> 03:04:57,830
can you maybe elaborate a little bit
more about this kai dl

11008
03:04:57,830 --> 03:04:57,840
more about this kai dl
 

11009
03:04:57,840 --> 03:04:59,510
more about this kai dl
what does the universal language of

11010
03:04:59,510 --> 03:04:59,520
what does the universal language of
 

11011
03:04:59,520 --> 03:05:01,269
what does the universal language of
chemistry look like

11012
03:05:01,269 --> 03:05:01,279
chemistry look like
 

11013
03:05:01,279 --> 03:05:02,830
chemistry look like
a crone and

11014
03:05:02,830 --> 03:05:02,840
a crone and
 

11015
03:05:02,840 --> 03:05:05,670
a crone and
complete language it's a true incomplete

11016
03:05:05,670 --> 03:05:05,680
complete language it's a true incomplete
 

11017
03:05:05,680 --> 03:05:07,990
complete language it's a true incomplete
language really it's um but um so what

11018
03:05:07,990 --> 03:05:08,000
language really it's um but um so what
 

11019
03:05:08,000 --> 03:05:10,790
language really it's um but um so what
it has it has a series of operators in

11020
03:05:10,790 --> 03:05:10,800
it has it has a series of operators in
 

11021
03:05:10,800 --> 03:05:12,309
it has it has a series of operators in
it like add

11022
03:05:12,309 --> 03:05:12,319
it like add
 

11023
03:05:12,319 --> 03:05:14,389
it like add
heat stir

11024
03:05:14,389 --> 03:05:14,399
heat stir
 

11025
03:05:14,399 --> 03:05:15,349
heat stir
um

11026
03:05:15,349 --> 03:05:15,359
um
 

11027
03:05:15,359 --> 03:05:17,110
um
so there's a bunch of just unit

11028
03:05:17,110 --> 03:05:17,120
so there's a bunch of just unit
 

11029
03:05:17,120 --> 03:05:19,349
so there's a bunch of just unit
operations and all it is really is just

11030
03:05:19,349 --> 03:05:19,359
operations and all it is really is just
 

11031
03:05:19,359 --> 03:05:21,990
operations and all it is really is just
uh it's with chemical engineers why i

11032
03:05:21,990 --> 03:05:22,000
uh it's with chemical engineers why i
 

11033
03:05:22,000 --> 03:05:23,269
uh it's with chemical engineers why i
talked about this that you've just re

11034
03:05:23,269 --> 03:05:23,279
talked about this that you've just re
 

11035
03:05:23,279 --> 03:05:24,950
talked about this that you've just re
you've just you've just rediscovered

11036
03:05:24,950 --> 03:05:24,960
you've just you've just rediscovered
 

11037
03:05:24,960 --> 03:05:26,790
you've just you've just rediscovered
chemical engineering and i said well

11038
03:05:26,790 --> 03:05:26,800
chemical engineering and i said well
 

11039
03:05:26,800 --> 03:05:28,790
chemical engineering and i said well
yeah i know i said well

11040
03:05:28,790 --> 03:05:28,800
yeah i know i said well
 

11041
03:05:28,800 --> 03:05:30,230
yeah i know i said well
that's you know that's trivial i said

11042
03:05:30,230 --> 03:05:30,240
that's you know that's trivial i said
 

11043
03:05:30,240 --> 03:05:32,389
that's you know that's trivial i said
well well not real well yes it is

11044
03:05:32,389 --> 03:05:32,399
well well not real well yes it is
 

11045
03:05:32,399 --> 03:05:34,389
well well not real well yes it is
trivial and that's why it's good because

11046
03:05:34,389 --> 03:05:34,399
trivial and that's why it's good because
 

11047
03:05:34,399 --> 03:05:35,429
trivial and that's why it's good because
we've not only have we just got

11048
03:05:35,429 --> 03:05:35,439
we've not only have we just got
 

11049
03:05:35,439 --> 03:05:36,790
we've not only have we just got
rediscovered chemical engineering we've

11050
03:05:36,790 --> 03:05:36,800
rediscovered chemical engineering we've
 

11051
03:05:36,800 --> 03:05:38,389
rediscovered chemical engineering we've
made it implementable on universal

11052
03:05:38,389 --> 03:05:38,399
made it implementable on universal
 

11053
03:05:38,399 --> 03:05:39,750
made it implementable on universal
hardware that doesn't cost very much

11054
03:05:39,750 --> 03:05:39,760
hardware that doesn't cost very much
 

11055
03:05:39,760 --> 03:05:40,630
hardware that doesn't cost very much
money

11056
03:05:40,630 --> 03:05:40,640
money
 

11057
03:05:40,640 --> 03:05:43,510
money
and so the kdl has a series of

11058
03:05:43,510 --> 03:05:43,520
and so the kdl has a series of
 

11059
03:05:43,520 --> 03:05:46,230
and so the kdl has a series of
statements like define the reactor so it

11060
03:05:46,230 --> 03:05:46,240
statements like define the reactor so it
 

11061
03:05:46,240 --> 03:05:47,750
statements like define the reactor so it
defines

11062
03:05:47,750 --> 03:05:47,760
defines
 

11063
03:05:47,760 --> 03:05:50,630
defines
the reagents so they're all labels so

11064
03:05:50,630 --> 03:05:50,640
the reagents so they're all labels so
 

11065
03:05:50,640 --> 03:05:52,070
the reagents so they're all labels so
you assign them

11066
03:05:52,070 --> 03:05:52,080
you assign them
 

11067
03:05:52,080 --> 03:05:54,550
you assign them
and what we i also implemented at the

11068
03:05:54,550 --> 03:05:54,560
and what we i also implemented at the
 

11069
03:05:54,560 --> 03:05:56,469
and what we i also implemented at the
beginning is because i give all the

11070
03:05:56,469 --> 03:05:56,479
beginning is because i give all the
 

11071
03:05:56,479 --> 03:05:58,389
beginning is because i give all the
hardware i p address you put it on a

11072
03:05:58,389 --> 03:05:58,399
hardware i p address you put it on a
 

11073
03:05:58,399 --> 03:05:59,349
hardware i p address you put it on a
graph

11074
03:05:59,349 --> 03:05:59,359
graph
 

11075
03:05:59,359 --> 03:06:01,750
graph
and so what it does is like the graph is

11076
03:06:01,750 --> 03:06:01,760
and so what it does is like the graph is
 

11077
03:06:01,760 --> 03:06:03,510
and so what it does is like the graph is
equivalent to the the process of

11078
03:06:03,510 --> 03:06:03,520
equivalent to the the process of
 

11079
03:06:03,520 --> 03:06:04,790
equivalent to the the process of
firmware

11080
03:06:04,790 --> 03:06:04,800
firmware
 

11081
03:06:04,800 --> 03:06:07,349
firmware
the processor code so when you take your

11082
03:06:07,349 --> 03:06:07,359
the processor code so when you take your
 

11083
03:06:07,359 --> 03:06:08,469
the processor code so when you take your
kdl

11084
03:06:08,469 --> 03:06:08,479
kdl
 

11085
03:06:08,479 --> 03:06:10,070
kdl
and you go to run it on your computer

11086
03:06:10,070 --> 03:06:10,080
and you go to run it on your computer
 

11087
03:06:10,080 --> 03:06:11,590
and you go to run it on your computer
you can run it on any compatible

11088
03:06:11,590 --> 03:06:11,600
you can run it on any compatible
 

11089
03:06:11,600 --> 03:06:12,790
you can run it on any compatible
hardware in any configuration says

11090
03:06:12,790 --> 03:06:12,800
hardware in any configuration says
 

11091
03:06:12,800 --> 03:06:14,550
hardware in any configuration says
what's your what's your graph look like

11092
03:06:14,550 --> 03:06:14,560
what's your what's your graph look like
 

11093
03:06:14,560 --> 03:06:16,070
what's your what's your graph look like
as long as i can solve the problem on

11094
03:06:16,070 --> 03:06:16,080
as long as i can solve the problem on
 

11095
03:06:16,080 --> 03:06:18,070
as long as i can solve the problem on
the graph with these unit operations you

11096
03:06:18,070 --> 03:06:18,080
the graph with these unit operations you
 

11097
03:06:18,080 --> 03:06:20,230
the graph with these unit operations you
have the resources available compile

11098
03:06:20,230 --> 03:06:20,240
have the resources available compile
 

11099
03:06:20,240 --> 03:06:22,500
have the resources available compile
chem piles

11100
03:06:22,500 --> 03:06:22,510
chem piles
 

11101
03:06:22,510 --> 03:06:25,429
chem piles
[Laughter]

11102
03:06:25,429 --> 03:06:25,439
[Laughter]
 

11103
03:06:25,439 --> 03:06:26,950
[Laughter]
all right we can carry on for years i

11104
03:06:26,950 --> 03:06:26,960
all right we can carry on for years i
 

11105
03:06:26,960 --> 03:06:29,110
all right we can carry on for years i
but it is really it's compilation and

11106
03:06:29,110 --> 03:06:29,120
but it is really it's compilation and
 

11107
03:06:29,120 --> 03:06:31,429
but it is really it's compilation and
evolution and what it now does is it

11108
03:06:31,429 --> 03:06:31,439
evolution and what it now does is it
 

11109
03:06:31,439 --> 03:06:34,389
evolution and what it now does is it
says okay the problem we have before is

11110
03:06:34,389 --> 03:06:34,399
says okay the problem we have before is
 

11111
03:06:34,399 --> 03:06:37,110
says okay the problem we have before is
it was possible to do robotics for

11112
03:06:37,110 --> 03:06:37,120
it was possible to do robotics for
 

11113
03:06:37,120 --> 03:06:38,710
it was possible to do robotics for
chemistry but the robots were really

11114
03:06:38,710 --> 03:06:38,720
chemistry but the robots were really
 

11115
03:06:38,720 --> 03:06:42,630
chemistry but the robots were really
expensive they were unique they had

11116
03:06:42,630 --> 03:06:42,640
expensive they were unique they had
 

11117
03:06:42,640 --> 03:06:44,389
expensive they were unique they had
and what i want to do is to make sure

11118
03:06:44,389 --> 03:06:44,399
and what i want to do is to make sure
 

11119
03:06:44,399 --> 03:06:46,230
and what i want to do is to make sure
that every chemist in the world can get

11120
03:06:46,230 --> 03:06:46,240
that every chemist in the world can get
 

11121
03:06:46,240 --> 03:06:48,870
that every chemist in the world can get
access to machinery like this at

11122
03:06:48,870 --> 03:06:48,880
access to machinery like this at
 

11123
03:06:48,880 --> 03:06:50,630
access to machinery like this at
virtually no cost because it makes it

11124
03:06:50,630 --> 03:06:50,640
virtually no cost because it makes it
 

11125
03:06:50,640 --> 03:06:54,150
virtually no cost because it makes it
safer it makes it more reliable and then

11126
03:06:54,150 --> 03:06:54,160
safer it makes it more reliable and then
 

11127
03:06:54,160 --> 03:06:55,429
safer it makes it more reliable and then
if you go to the literature and you find

11128
03:06:55,429 --> 03:06:55,439
if you go to the literature and you find
 

11129
03:06:55,439 --> 03:06:57,110
if you go to the literature and you find
a molecule that could potentially cure

11130
03:06:57,110 --> 03:06:57,120
a molecule that could potentially cure
 

11131
03:06:57,120 --> 03:06:58,150
a molecule that could potentially cure
cancer

11132
03:06:58,150 --> 03:06:58,160
cancer
 

11133
03:06:58,160 --> 03:06:59,269
cancer
and let's say the molecule that could

11134
03:06:59,269 --> 03:06:59,279
and let's say the molecule that could
 

11135
03:06:59,279 --> 03:07:00,870
and let's say the molecule that could
potentially cure cancer takes you three

11136
03:07:00,870 --> 03:07:00,880
potentially cure cancer takes you three
 

11137
03:07:00,880 --> 03:07:02,870
potentially cure cancer takes you three
years to repeat

11138
03:07:02,870 --> 03:07:02,880
years to repeat
 

11139
03:07:02,880 --> 03:07:05,830
years to repeat
and maybe a student finishes their phd

11140
03:07:05,830 --> 03:07:05,840
and maybe a student finishes their phd
 

11141
03:07:05,840 --> 03:07:08,830
and maybe a student finishes their phd
in the time and they never get it back

11142
03:07:08,830 --> 03:07:08,840
in the time and they never get it back
 

11143
03:07:08,840 --> 03:07:11,429
in the time and they never get it back
um so it's really hard to

11144
03:07:11,429 --> 03:07:11,439
um so it's really hard to
 

11145
03:07:11,439 --> 03:07:12,870
um so it's really hard to
to kind of get all the way to that

11146
03:07:12,870 --> 03:07:12,880
to kind of get all the way to that
 

11147
03:07:12,880 --> 03:07:14,389
to kind of get all the way to that
molecule and it limits the ability of

11148
03:07:14,389 --> 03:07:14,399
molecule and it limits the ability of
 

11149
03:07:14,399 --> 03:07:16,230
molecule and it limits the ability of
humanity to build on it

11150
03:07:16,230 --> 03:07:16,240
humanity to build on it
 

11151
03:07:16,240 --> 03:07:17,670
humanity to build on it
if they just download the code and can

11152
03:07:17,670 --> 03:07:17,680
if they just download the code and can
 

11153
03:07:17,680 --> 03:07:20,230
if they just download the code and can
execute it it turns

11154
03:07:20,230 --> 03:07:20,240
execute it it turns
 

11155
03:07:20,240 --> 03:07:22,150
execute it it turns
i would say the electronic laboratory

11156
03:07:22,150 --> 03:07:22,160
i would say the electronic laboratory
 

11157
03:07:22,160 --> 03:07:24,389
i would say the electronic laboratory
notebook in chemistry is a data

11158
03:07:24,389 --> 03:07:24,399
notebook in chemistry is a data
 

11159
03:07:24,399 --> 03:07:26,230
notebook in chemistry is a data
symmetry

11160
03:07:26,230 --> 03:07:26,240
symmetry
 

11161
03:07:26,240 --> 03:07:28,389
symmetry
because no one will ever reproduce it

11162
03:07:28,389 --> 03:07:28,399
because no one will ever reproduce it
 

11163
03:07:28,399 --> 03:07:30,070
because no one will ever reproduce it
for now the data cemetery is a jupiter

11164
03:07:30,070 --> 03:07:30,080
for now the data cemetery is a jupiter
 

11165
03:07:30,080 --> 03:07:32,070
for now the data cemetery is a jupiter
notebook and you can just execute it and

11166
03:07:32,070 --> 03:07:32,080
notebook and you can just execute it and
 

11167
03:07:32,080 --> 03:07:34,150
notebook and you can just execute it and
people can play with it yeah the access

11168
03:07:34,150 --> 03:07:34,160
people can play with it yeah the access
 

11169
03:07:34,160 --> 03:07:36,389
people can play with it yeah the access
to it reverses the magnet huge is

11170
03:07:36,389 --> 03:07:36,399
to it reverses the magnet huge is
 

11171
03:07:36,399 --> 03:07:37,510
to it reverses the magnet huge is
increased

11172
03:07:37,510 --> 03:07:37,520
increased
 

11173
03:07:37,520 --> 03:07:40,230
increased
uh we'll talk about the so as with all

11174
03:07:40,230 --> 03:07:40,240
uh we'll talk about the so as with all
 

11175
03:07:40,240 --> 03:07:41,429
uh we'll talk about the so as with all
technologies

11176
03:07:41,429 --> 03:07:41,439
technologies
 

11177
03:07:41,439 --> 03:07:43,030
technologies
i think there's way more exciting

11178
03:07:43,030 --> 03:07:43,040
i think there's way more exciting
 

11179
03:07:43,040 --> 03:07:44,309
i think there's way more exciting
possibilities but they're also

11180
03:07:44,309 --> 03:07:44,319
possibilities but they're also
 

11181
03:07:44,319 --> 03:07:46,389
possibilities but they're also
terrifying possibilities and we'll talk

11182
03:07:46,389 --> 03:07:46,399
terrifying possibilities and we'll talk
 

11183
03:07:46,399 --> 03:07:48,389
terrifying possibilities and we'll talk
about all of them but let me just kind

11184
03:07:48,389 --> 03:07:48,399
about all of them but let me just kind
 

11185
03:07:48,399 --> 03:07:51,030
about all of them but let me just kind
of linger on the machine learning side

11186
03:07:51,030 --> 03:07:51,040
of linger on the machine learning side
 

11187
03:07:51,040 --> 03:07:53,349
of linger on the machine learning side
of this so you're describing programming

11188
03:07:53,349 --> 03:07:53,359
of this so you're describing programming
 

11189
03:07:53,359 --> 03:07:55,349
of this so you're describing programming
but

11190
03:07:55,349 --> 03:07:55,359
but
 

11191
03:07:55,359 --> 03:07:57,110
but
it's a language i don't know if you've

11192
03:07:57,110 --> 03:07:57,120
it's a language i don't know if you've
 

11193
03:07:57,120 --> 03:07:59,269
it's a language i don't know if you've
heard about open air codex which is uh

11194
03:07:59,269 --> 03:07:59,279
heard about open air codex which is uh
 

11195
03:07:59,279 --> 03:08:01,590
heard about open air codex which is uh
yeah i'm playing with it are you playing

11196
03:08:01,590 --> 03:08:01,600
yeah i'm playing with it are you playing
 

11197
03:08:01,600 --> 03:08:05,990
yeah i'm playing with it are you playing
of course you are

11198
03:08:05,990 --> 03:08:06,000

 

11199
03:08:06,000 --> 03:08:07,910

you really are rick from rick and morty

11200
03:08:07,910 --> 03:08:07,920
you really are rick from rick and morty
 

11201
03:08:07,920 --> 03:08:10,710
you really are rick from rick and morty
this is great okay uh

11202
03:08:10,710 --> 03:08:10,720
this is great okay uh
 

11203
03:08:10,720 --> 03:08:12,710
this is great okay uh
except philosophically d i mean he is i

11204
03:08:12,710 --> 03:08:12,720
except philosophically d i mean he is i
 

11205
03:08:12,720 --> 03:08:14,870
except philosophically d i mean he is i
guess kind of philosophically deep too

11206
03:08:14,870 --> 03:08:14,880
guess kind of philosophically deep too
 

11207
03:08:14,880 --> 03:08:18,309
guess kind of philosophically deep too
so for people who don't know gpt gpt3

11208
03:08:18,309 --> 03:08:18,319
so for people who don't know gpt gpt3
 

11209
03:08:18,319 --> 03:08:20,710
so for people who don't know gpt gpt3
that's the language model that can do

11210
03:08:20,710 --> 03:08:20,720
that's the language model that can do
 

11211
03:08:20,720 --> 03:08:22,870
that's the language model that can do
natural language generation so you can

11212
03:08:22,870 --> 03:08:22,880
natural language generation so you can
 

11213
03:08:22,880 --> 03:08:25,110
natural language generation so you can
give it a prompt and it can uh complete

11214
03:08:25,110 --> 03:08:25,120
give it a prompt and it can uh complete
 

11215
03:08:25,120 --> 03:08:27,110
give it a prompt and it can uh complete
the rest of it but it turns out that

11216
03:08:27,110 --> 03:08:27,120
the rest of it but it turns out that
 

11217
03:08:27,120 --> 03:08:29,510
the rest of it but it turns out that
that kind of prompt it's not just

11218
03:08:29,510 --> 03:08:29,520
that kind of prompt it's not just
 

11219
03:08:29,520 --> 03:08:32,870
that kind of prompt it's not just
completes the rest of it's generating

11220
03:08:32,870 --> 03:08:32,880
completes the rest of it's generating
 

11221
03:08:32,880 --> 03:08:34,469
completes the rest of it's generating
uh

11222
03:08:34,469 --> 03:08:34,479
uh
 

11223
03:08:34,479 --> 03:08:36,630
uh
like novel sounding text and then you

11224
03:08:36,630 --> 03:08:36,640
like novel sounding text and then you
 

11225
03:08:36,640 --> 03:08:38,710
like novel sounding text and then you
can apply that to generation of other

11226
03:08:38,710 --> 03:08:38,720
can apply that to generation of other
 

11227
03:08:38,720 --> 03:08:40,309
can apply that to generation of other
kinds of stuff

11228
03:08:40,309 --> 03:08:40,319
kinds of stuff
 

11229
03:08:40,319 --> 03:08:42,389
kinds of stuff
uh so these kinds of uh transformer

11230
03:08:42,389 --> 03:08:42,399
uh so these kinds of uh transformer
 

11231
03:08:42,399 --> 03:08:45,510
uh so these kinds of uh transformer
based language models are really good at

11232
03:08:45,510 --> 03:08:45,520
based language models are really good at
 

11233
03:08:45,520 --> 03:08:47,990
based language models are really good at
forming at uh uh forming deep

11234
03:08:47,990 --> 03:08:48,000
forming at uh uh forming deep
 

11235
03:08:48,000 --> 03:08:49,590
forming at uh uh forming deep
representations

11236
03:08:49,590 --> 03:08:49,600
representations
 

11237
03:08:49,600 --> 03:08:53,110
representations
of a particular space of like a medium

11238
03:08:53,110 --> 03:08:53,120
of a particular space of like a medium
 

11239
03:08:53,120 --> 03:08:55,110
of a particular space of like a medium
like language so you can then apply it

11240
03:08:55,110 --> 03:08:55,120
like language so you can then apply it
 

11241
03:08:55,120 --> 03:08:57,110
like language so you can then apply it
to a specific subset of language like

11242
03:08:57,110 --> 03:08:57,120
to a specific subset of language like
 

11243
03:08:57,120 --> 03:08:58,309
to a specific subset of language like
programming

11244
03:08:58,309 --> 03:08:58,319
programming
 

11245
03:08:58,319 --> 03:09:00,230
programming
so you can have it

11246
03:09:00,230 --> 03:09:00,240
so you can have it
 

11247
03:09:00,240 --> 03:09:02,150
so you can have it
learn the representation of the python

11248
03:09:02,150 --> 03:09:02,160
learn the representation of the python
 

11249
03:09:02,160 --> 03:09:03,990
learn the representation of the python
programming language and use it to then

11250
03:09:03,990 --> 03:09:04,000
programming language and use it to then
 

11251
03:09:04,000 --> 03:09:05,190
programming language and use it to then
generate

11252
03:09:05,190 --> 03:09:05,200
generate
 

11253
03:09:05,200 --> 03:09:07,349
generate
uh syntactically and semantically

11254
03:09:07,349 --> 03:09:07,359
uh syntactically and semantically
 

11255
03:09:07,359 --> 03:09:08,710
uh syntactically and semantically
correct

11256
03:09:08,710 --> 03:09:08,720
correct
 

11257
03:09:08,720 --> 03:09:11,429
correct
uh programs so you can start to make

11258
03:09:11,429 --> 03:09:11,439
uh programs so you can start to make
 

11259
03:09:11,439 --> 03:09:13,830
uh programs so you can start to make
progress on one of the hardest problems

11260
03:09:13,830 --> 03:09:13,840
progress on one of the hardest problems
 

11261
03:09:13,840 --> 03:09:15,429
progress on one of the hardest problems
in computer science which is program

11262
03:09:15,429 --> 03:09:15,439
in computer science which is program
 

11263
03:09:15,439 --> 03:09:17,750
in computer science which is program
synthesis how do you write programs that

11264
03:09:17,750 --> 03:09:17,760
synthesis how do you write programs that
 

11265
03:09:17,760 --> 03:09:19,590
synthesis how do you write programs that
accomplish different tasks

11266
03:09:19,590 --> 03:09:19,600
accomplish different tasks
 

11267
03:09:19,600 --> 03:09:21,510
accomplish different tasks
so what uh

11268
03:09:21,510 --> 03:09:21,520
so what uh
 

11269
03:09:21,520 --> 03:09:25,030
so what uh
openai codex does is it generate those

11270
03:09:25,030 --> 03:09:25,040
openai codex does is it generate those
 

11271
03:09:25,040 --> 03:09:26,790
openai codex does is it generate those
programs based on a

11272
03:09:26,790 --> 03:09:26,800
programs based on a
 

11273
03:09:26,800 --> 03:09:29,429
programs based on a
a prompt of some kind usually you can do

11274
03:09:29,429 --> 03:09:29,439
a prompt of some kind usually you can do
 

11275
03:09:29,439 --> 03:09:31,429
a prompt of some kind usually you can do
a natural language prompt so basically

11276
03:09:31,429 --> 03:09:31,439
a natural language prompt so basically
 

11277
03:09:31,439 --> 03:09:33,110
a natural language prompt so basically
as you do when you program you write

11278
03:09:33,110 --> 03:09:33,120
as you do when you program you write
 

11279
03:09:33,120 --> 03:09:34,630
as you do when you program you write
some

11280
03:09:34,630 --> 03:09:34,640
some
 

11281
03:09:34,640 --> 03:09:36,630
some
a comment which serves the basic

11282
03:09:36,630 --> 03:09:36,640
a comment which serves the basic
 

11283
03:09:36,640 --> 03:09:38,950
a comment which serves the basic
documentation of the inputs and the

11284
03:09:38,950 --> 03:09:38,960
documentation of the inputs and the
 

11285
03:09:38,960 --> 03:09:40,150
documentation of the inputs and the
outputs and the function of the

11286
03:09:40,150 --> 03:09:40,160
outputs and the function of the
 

11287
03:09:40,160 --> 03:09:41,670
outputs and the function of the
particular set of code and it's able to

11288
03:09:41,670 --> 03:09:41,680
particular set of code and it's able to
 

11289
03:09:41,680 --> 03:09:43,190
particular set of code and it's able to
generate that

11290
03:09:43,190 --> 03:09:43,200
generate that
 

11291
03:09:43,200 --> 03:09:46,710
generate that
point being is you can generate programs

11292
03:09:46,710 --> 03:09:46,720
point being is you can generate programs
 

11293
03:09:46,720 --> 03:09:48,790
point being is you can generate programs
using machine learning using neural

11294
03:09:48,790 --> 03:09:48,800
using machine learning using neural
 

11295
03:09:48,800 --> 03:09:51,030
using machine learning using neural
networks

11296
03:09:51,030 --> 03:09:51,040
networks
 

11297
03:09:51,040 --> 03:09:55,510
networks
those programs operate on the boring old

11298
03:09:55,510 --> 03:09:55,520
those programs operate on the boring old
 

11299
03:09:55,520 --> 03:09:56,870
those programs operate on the boring old
computer

11300
03:09:56,870 --> 03:09:56,880
computer
 

11301
03:09:56,880 --> 03:09:59,349
computer
can you generate programs that operate

11302
03:09:59,349 --> 03:09:59,359
can you generate programs that operate
 

11303
03:09:59,359 --> 03:10:00,790
can you generate programs that operate
there's got to be a clever version of

11304
03:10:00,790 --> 03:10:00,800
there's got to be a clever version of
 

11305
03:10:00,800 --> 03:10:02,950
there's got to be a clever version of
programs for this but uh can you write

11306
03:10:02,950 --> 03:10:02,960
programs for this but uh can you write
 

11307
03:10:02,960 --> 03:10:06,309
programs for this but uh can you write
programs that uh operate on a computer

11308
03:10:06,309 --> 03:10:06,319
programs that uh operate on a computer
 

11309
03:10:06,319 --> 03:10:08,309
programs that uh operate on a computer
yep there's actually software out there

11310
03:10:08,309 --> 03:10:08,319
yep there's actually software out there
 

11311
03:10:08,319 --> 03:10:10,150
yep there's actually software out there
right now we can go and do it

11312
03:10:10,150 --> 03:10:10,160
right now we can go and do it
 

11313
03:10:10,160 --> 03:10:12,550
right now we can go and do it
right so yeah it's a heuristic

11314
03:10:12,550 --> 03:10:12,560
right so yeah it's a heuristic
 

11315
03:10:12,560 --> 03:10:14,150
right so yeah it's a heuristic
it's rule based

11316
03:10:14,150 --> 03:10:14,160
it's rule based
 

11317
03:10:14,160 --> 03:10:15,510
it's rule based
but we have

11318
03:10:15,510 --> 03:10:15,520
but we have
 

11319
03:10:15,520 --> 03:10:16,870
but we have
what we've done

11320
03:10:16,870 --> 03:10:16,880
what we've done
 

11321
03:10:16,880 --> 03:10:18,389
what we've done
inspired by

11322
03:10:18,389 --> 03:10:18,399
inspired by
 

11323
03:10:18,399 --> 03:10:21,670
inspired by
codex actually is um over the summer i

11324
03:10:21,670 --> 03:10:21,680

ran a little workshop some of my groups

11326
03:10:23,990 --> 03:10:24,000
ran a little workshop some of my groups
 

11327
03:10:24,000 --> 03:10:25,190
ran a little workshop some of my groups
thought this inspired idea that we

11328
03:10:25,190 --> 03:10:25,200
thought this inspired idea that we
 

11329
03:10:25,200 --> 03:10:27,110
thought this inspired idea that we
should get a load of um

11330
03:10:27,110 --> 03:10:27,120
should get a load of um
 

11331
03:10:27,120 --> 03:10:29,750
should get a load of um
students and ask them to manually

11332
03:10:29,750 --> 03:10:29,760
students and ask them to manually
 

11333
03:10:29,760 --> 03:10:31,830
students and ask them to manually
collect data to label

11334
03:10:31,830 --> 03:10:31,840
collect data to label
 

11335
03:10:31,840 --> 03:10:35,110
collect data to label
chemical procedures into kdl

11336
03:10:35,110 --> 03:10:35,120
chemical procedures into kdl
 

11337
03:10:35,120 --> 03:10:38,870
chemical procedures into kdl
and um we have a called synth reader so

11338
03:10:38,870 --> 03:10:38,880
and um we have a called synth reader so
 

11339
03:10:38,880 --> 03:10:40,550
and um we have a called synth reader so
that so there's a lot bunch of people

11340
03:10:40,550 --> 03:10:40,560
that so there's a lot bunch of people
 

11341
03:10:40,560 --> 03:10:42,469
that so there's a lot bunch of people
doing this right now but they're doing

11342
03:10:42,469 --> 03:10:42,479
doing this right now but they're doing
 

11343
03:10:42,479 --> 03:10:43,830
doing this right now but they're doing
it without

11344
03:10:43,830 --> 03:10:43,840
it without
 

11345
03:10:43,840 --> 03:10:45,990
it without
uh abstraction

11346
03:10:45,990 --> 03:10:46,000
uh abstraction
 

11347
03:10:46,000 --> 03:10:47,269
uh abstraction
and because we have an abstraction

11348
03:10:47,269 --> 03:10:47,279
and because we have an abstraction
 

11349
03:10:47,279 --> 03:10:49,750
and because we have an abstraction
that's implementable in the hardware

11350
03:10:49,750 --> 03:10:49,760
that's implementable in the hardware
 

11351
03:10:49,760 --> 03:10:52,870
that's implementable in the hardware
um we've developed basically a chemical

11352
03:10:52,870 --> 03:10:52,880
um we've developed basically a chemical
 

11353
03:10:52,880 --> 03:10:54,790
um we've developed basically a chemical
analog of codecs

11354
03:10:54,790 --> 03:10:54,800
analog of codecs
 

11355
03:10:54,800 --> 03:10:56,790
analog of codecs
what you're doing we say sergeant trial

11356
03:10:56,790 --> 03:10:56,800
what you're doing we say sergeant trial
 

11357
03:10:56,800 --> 03:10:59,190
what you're doing we say sergeant trial
when you say abstraction in the hardware

11358
03:10:59,190 --> 03:10:59,200
when you say abstraction in the hardware
 

11359
03:10:59,200 --> 03:11:00,630
when you say abstraction in the hardware
what do you mean so right now a lot of

11360
03:11:00,630 --> 03:11:00,640
what do you mean so right now a lot of
 

11361
03:11:00,640 --> 03:11:01,830
what do you mean so right now a lot of
people doing machine learning and

11362
03:11:01,830 --> 03:11:01,840
people doing machine learning and
 

11363
03:11:01,840 --> 03:11:04,790
people doing machine learning and
reading chemistry and just and saying oh

11364
03:11:04,790 --> 03:11:04,800
reading chemistry and just and saying oh
 

11365
03:11:04,800 --> 03:11:06,630
reading chemistry and just and saying oh
you've all these operations add shake

11366
03:11:06,630 --> 03:11:06,640
you've all these operations add shake
 

11367
03:11:06,640 --> 03:11:07,670
you've all these operations add shake
whatever he

11368
03:11:07,670 --> 03:11:07,680
whatever he
 

11369
03:11:07,680 --> 03:11:09,590
whatever he
but they but because they don't have a

11370
03:11:09,590 --> 03:11:09,600
but they but because they don't have a
 

11371
03:11:09,600 --> 03:11:10,710
but they but because they don't have a
uniform

11372
03:11:10,710 --> 03:11:10,720
uniform
 

11373
03:11:10,720 --> 03:11:11,910
uniform
um i mean there's a couple of groups

11374
03:11:11,910 --> 03:11:11,920
um i mean there's a couple of groups
 

11375
03:11:11,920 --> 03:11:13,910
um i mean there's a couple of groups
doing it competitors actually and

11376
03:11:13,910 --> 03:11:13,920
doing it competitors actually and
 

11377
03:11:13,920 --> 03:11:15,510
doing it competitors actually and
they're good very good

11378
03:11:15,510 --> 03:11:15,520
they're good very good
 

11379
03:11:15,520 --> 03:11:16,870
they're good very good
but um

11380
03:11:16,870 --> 03:11:16,880
but um
 

11381
03:11:16,880 --> 03:11:19,830
but um
they can't run that code automatically

11382
03:11:19,830 --> 03:11:19,840
they can't run that code automatically
 

11383
03:11:19,840 --> 03:11:22,950
they can't run that code automatically
it they are losing

11384
03:11:22,950 --> 03:11:22,960
it they are losing
 

11385
03:11:22,960 --> 03:11:24,710
it they are losing
meaning

11386
03:11:24,710 --> 03:11:24,720
meaning
 

11387
03:11:24,720 --> 03:11:27,269
meaning
and and with and the really important

11388
03:11:27,269 --> 03:11:27,279
and and with and the really important
 

11389
03:11:27,279 --> 03:11:28,630
and and with and the really important
thing that you have to do is generate

11390
03:11:28,630 --> 03:11:28,640
thing that you have to do is generate
 

11391
03:11:28,640 --> 03:11:29,830
thing that you have to do is generate
context

11392
03:11:29,830 --> 03:11:29,840
context
 

11393
03:11:29,840 --> 03:11:32,070
context
and so what we've learned to do with our

11394
03:11:32,070 --> 03:11:32,080
and so what we've learned to do with our
 

11395
03:11:32,080 --> 03:11:34,070
and so what we've learned to do with our
abstraction is make sure we can pull the

11396
03:11:34,070 --> 03:11:34,080
abstraction is make sure we can pull the
 

11397
03:11:34,080 --> 03:11:37,510
abstraction is make sure we can pull the
context out of the text and so

11398
03:11:37,510 --> 03:11:37,520
context out of the text and so
 

11399
03:11:37,520 --> 03:11:39,110
context out of the text and so
can we take

11400
03:11:39,110 --> 03:11:39,120
can we take
 

11401
03:11:39,120 --> 03:11:40,950
can we take
a chemical procedure and read it and

11402
03:11:40,950 --> 03:11:40,960
a chemical procedure and read it and
 

11403
03:11:40,960 --> 03:11:43,830
a chemical procedure and read it and
generate our executable code yes

11404
03:11:43,830 --> 03:11:43,840
generate our executable code yes
 

11405
03:11:43,840 --> 03:11:45,349
generate our executable code yes
what's the hardest part about the whole

11406
03:11:45,349 --> 03:11:45,359
what's the hardest part about the whole
 

11407
03:11:45,359 --> 03:11:46,870
what's the hardest part about the whole
pipeline from the initial text

11408
03:11:46,870 --> 03:11:46,880
pipeline from the initial text
 

11409
03:11:46,880 --> 03:11:49,269
pipeline from the initial text
interpreting the initial text of a paper

11410
03:11:49,269 --> 03:11:49,279
interpreting the initial text of a paper
 

11411
03:11:49,279 --> 03:11:52,309
interpreting the initial text of a paper
extracting the meaningful context and

11412
03:11:52,309 --> 03:11:52,319
extracting the meaningful context and
 

11413
03:11:52,319 --> 03:11:54,389
extracting the meaningful context and
the meaningful chemical information to

11414
03:11:54,389 --> 03:11:54,399
the meaningful chemical information to
 

11415
03:11:54,399 --> 03:11:57,510
the meaningful chemical information to
then generating the the program to then

11416
03:11:57,510 --> 03:11:57,520
then generating the the program to then
 

11417
03:11:57,520 --> 03:12:00,150
then generating the the program to then
uh running that program in the hardware

11418
03:12:00,150 --> 03:12:00,160
uh running that program in the hardware
 

11419
03:12:00,160 --> 03:12:01,510
uh running that program in the hardware
what's what's the hardest part about

11420
03:12:01,510 --> 03:12:01,520
what's what's the hardest part about
 

11421
03:12:01,520 --> 03:12:03,750
what's what's the hardest part about
that pipeline as we look towards a

11422
03:12:03,750 --> 03:12:03,760
that pipeline as we look towards a
 

11423
03:12:03,760 --> 03:12:06,389
that pipeline as we look towards a
universal touring computer so the

11424
03:12:06,389 --> 03:12:06,399
universal touring computer so the
 

11425
03:12:06,399 --> 03:12:08,150
universal touring computer so the
hardest computer the heart the hardest

11426
03:12:08,150 --> 03:12:08,160
hardest computer the heart the hardest
 

11427
03:12:08,160 --> 03:12:09,510
hardest computer the heart the hardest
thing with the

11428
03:12:09,510 --> 03:12:09,520
thing with the
 

11429
03:12:09,520 --> 03:12:12,389
thing with the
uh the pipeline is that um

11430
03:12:12,389 --> 03:12:12,399
uh the pipeline is that um
 

11431
03:12:12,399 --> 03:12:13,910
uh the pipeline is that um
the software

11432
03:12:13,910 --> 03:12:13,920
the software
 

11433
03:12:13,920 --> 03:12:16,389
the software
the model gets confused

11434
03:12:16,389 --> 03:12:16,399
the model gets confused
 

11435
03:12:16,399 --> 03:12:19,349
the model gets confused
between some meanings right so if

11436
03:12:19,349 --> 03:12:19,359
between some meanings right so if
 

11437
03:12:19,359 --> 03:12:20,550
between some meanings right so if
you know chemists are very good at

11438
03:12:20,550 --> 03:12:20,560
you know chemists are very good at
 

11439
03:12:20,560 --> 03:12:22,710
you know chemists are very good at
inventing words that aren't broken down

11440
03:12:22,710 --> 03:12:22,720
inventing words that aren't broken down
 

11441
03:12:22,720 --> 03:12:25,269
inventing words that aren't broken down
so i would that the classic word that

11442
03:12:25,269 --> 03:12:25,279
so i would that the classic word that
 

11443
03:12:25,279 --> 03:12:26,710
so i would that the classic word that
you would use for boiling something is

11444
03:12:26,710 --> 03:12:26,720
you would use for boiling something is
 

11445
03:12:26,720 --> 03:12:29,510
you would use for boiling something is
called reflux so reflux is um you would

11446
03:12:29,510 --> 03:12:29,520
called reflux so reflux is um you would
 

11447
03:12:29,520 --> 03:12:31,030
called reflux so reflux is um you would
have a salt you'd have a solvent in a

11448
03:12:31,030 --> 03:12:31,040
have a salt you'd have a solvent in a
 

11449
03:12:31,040 --> 03:12:32,870
have a salt you'd have a solvent in a
round bottom flask at reflux it would be

11450
03:12:32,870 --> 03:12:32,880
round bottom flask at reflux it would be
 

11451
03:12:32,880 --> 03:12:34,870
round bottom flask at reflux it would be
boiling going up the reflux condenser

11452
03:12:34,870 --> 03:12:34,880
boiling going up the reflux condenser
 

11453
03:12:34,880 --> 03:12:38,150
boiling going up the reflux condenser
and coming down but that term reflux to

11454
03:12:38,150 --> 03:12:38,160
and coming down but that term reflux to
 

11455
03:12:38,160 --> 03:12:40,950
and coming down but that term reflux to
reflux could be changed you know to

11456
03:12:40,950 --> 03:12:40,960
reflux could be changed you know to
 

11457
03:12:40,960 --> 03:12:43,429
reflux could be changed you know to
people often make up words

11458
03:12:43,429 --> 03:12:43,439
people often make up words
 

11459
03:12:43,439 --> 03:12:45,990
people often make up words
new words and the and then the software

11460
03:12:45,990 --> 03:12:46,000
new words and the and then the software
 

11461
03:12:46,000 --> 03:12:48,469
new words and the and then the software
can fall over but what we've been able

11462
03:12:48,469 --> 03:12:48,479
can fall over but what we've been able
 

11463
03:12:48,479 --> 03:12:50,790
can fall over but what we've been able
to do is a bit like in python

11464
03:12:50,790 --> 03:12:50,800
to do is a bit like in python
 

11465
03:12:50,800 --> 03:12:53,269
to do is a bit like in python
or any programming language is identify

11466
03:12:53,269 --> 03:12:53,279
or any programming language is identify
 

11467
03:12:53,279 --> 03:12:55,429
or any programming language is identify
when things aren't matched so you

11468
03:12:55,429 --> 03:12:55,439
when things aren't matched so you
 

11469
03:12:55,439 --> 03:12:56,870
when things aren't matched so you
present the code you say this isn't

11470
03:12:56,870 --> 03:12:56,880
present the code you say this isn't
 

11471
03:12:56,880 --> 03:12:58,389
present the code you say this isn't
matched you may want to think about this

11472
03:12:58,389 --> 03:12:58,399
matched you may want to think about this
 

11473
03:12:58,399 --> 03:13:00,309
matched you may want to think about this
and then the user goes and says oh i

11474
03:13:00,309 --> 03:13:00,319
and then the user goes and says oh i
 

11475
03:13:00,319 --> 03:13:01,990
and then the user goes and says oh i
mean reflux and just ticks the box and

11476
03:13:01,990 --> 03:13:02,000
mean reflux and just ticks the box and
 

11477
03:13:02,000 --> 03:13:03,670
mean reflux and just ticks the box and
collects it so

11478
03:13:03,670 --> 03:13:03,680
collects it so
 

11479
03:13:03,680 --> 03:13:05,990
collects it so

and then the chemist goes and corrects

11490
03:13:13,830 --> 03:13:13,840
and then the chemist goes and corrects
 

11491
03:13:13,840 --> 03:13:15,190
and then the chemist goes and corrects
it and i really want the chemist to

11492
03:13:15,190 --> 03:13:15,200
it and i really want the chemist to
 

11493
03:13:15,200 --> 03:13:17,349
it and i really want the chemist to
correct it because

11494
03:13:17,349 --> 03:13:17,359
correct it because
 

11495
03:13:17,359 --> 03:13:20,950
correct it because
it's not safe i believe for for to allow

11496
03:13:20,950 --> 03:13:20,960
it's not safe i believe for for to allow
 

11497
03:13:20,960 --> 03:13:23,990
it's not safe i believe for for to allow
ai to just read literature and generate

11498
03:13:23,990 --> 03:13:24,000
ai to just read literature and generate
 

11499
03:13:24,000 --> 03:13:25,750
ai to just read literature and generate
code at this stage because now you're

11500
03:13:25,750 --> 03:13:25,760
code at this stage because now you're
 

11501
03:13:25,760 --> 03:13:29,429
code at this stage because now you're
having actual by the way chemex nice

11502
03:13:29,429 --> 03:13:29,439
having actual by the way chemex nice
 

11503
03:13:29,439 --> 03:13:31,110
having actual by the way chemex nice
uh

11504
03:13:31,110 --> 03:13:31,120
uh
 

11505
03:13:31,120 --> 03:13:33,429
uh
nice name uh

11506
03:13:33,429 --> 03:13:33,439
nice name uh
 

11507
03:13:33,439 --> 03:13:36,309
nice name uh
so you you are unlike

11508
03:13:36,309 --> 03:13:36,319
so you you are unlike
 

11509
03:13:36,319 --> 03:13:38,710
so you you are unlike
which is fascinating

11510
03:13:38,710 --> 03:13:38,720
which is fascinating
 

11511
03:13:38,720 --> 03:13:40,950
which is fascinating
if we live in a fascinating moment in

11512
03:13:40,950 --> 03:13:40,960
if we live in a fascinating moment in
 

11513
03:13:40,960 --> 03:13:43,830
if we live in a fascinating moment in
human history but yes you're

11514
03:13:43,830 --> 03:13:43,840
human history but yes you're
 

11515
03:13:43,840 --> 03:13:46,870
human history but yes you're
literally connecting ai

11516
03:13:46,870 --> 03:13:46,880
literally connecting ai
 

11517
03:13:46,880 --> 03:13:48,309
literally connecting ai
to some

11518
03:13:48,309 --> 03:13:48,319
to some
 

11519
03:13:48,319 --> 03:13:49,349
to some
physical

11520
03:13:49,349 --> 03:13:49,359
physical
 

11521
03:13:49,359 --> 03:13:50,229
physical
and

11522
03:13:50,229 --> 03:13:50,239
and
 

11523
03:13:50,239 --> 03:13:52,229
and
like it's building something in the

11524
03:13:52,229 --> 03:13:52,239
like it's building something in the
 

11525
03:13:52,239 --> 03:13:54,710
like it's building something in the
physical realm yeah especially in the

11526
03:13:54,710 --> 03:13:54,720
physical realm yeah especially in the
 

11527
03:13:54,720 --> 03:13:57,510
physical realm yeah especially in the
space of chemistry

11528
03:13:57,510 --> 03:13:57,520
space of chemistry
 

11529
03:13:57,520 --> 03:14:01,349
space of chemistry
that operates sort of

11530
03:14:01,349 --> 03:14:01,359
that operates sort of
 

11531
03:14:01,359 --> 03:14:03,510
that operates sort of
invisibly yeah

11532
03:14:03,510 --> 03:14:03,520
invisibly yeah
 

11533
03:14:03,520 --> 03:14:05,349
invisibly yeah
yeah i would say that's right

11534
03:14:05,349 --> 03:14:05,359
yeah i would say that's right
 

11535
03:14:05,359 --> 03:14:06,790
yeah i would say that's right
and it's it's really important to

11536
03:14:06,790 --> 03:14:06,800
and it's it's really important to
 

11537
03:14:06,800 --> 03:14:09,110
and it's it's really important to
understand those labeling schemes right

11538
03:14:09,110 --> 03:14:09,120
understand those labeling schemes right
 

11539
03:14:09,120 --> 03:14:11,429
understand those labeling schemes right
and one of the things i was never i was

11540
03:14:11,429 --> 03:14:11,439
and one of the things i was never i was
 

11541
03:14:11,439 --> 03:14:12,870
and one of the things i was never i was
always worried about the beginning that

11542
03:14:12,870 --> 03:14:12,880
always worried about the beginning that
 

11543
03:14:12,880 --> 03:14:15,110
always worried about the beginning that
the abstraction was going to fall over

11544
03:14:15,110 --> 03:14:15,120
the abstraction was going to fall over
 

11545
03:14:15,120 --> 03:14:17,269
the abstraction was going to fall over
and the way we did it was just by brute

11546
03:14:17,269 --> 03:14:17,279
and the way we did it was just by brute
 

11547
03:14:17,279 --> 03:14:18,950
and the way we did it was just by brute
force to start with we just kept reading

11548
03:14:18,950 --> 03:14:18,960
force to start with we just kept reading
 

11549
03:14:18,960 --> 03:14:19,910
force to start with we just kept reading
the literature and saying is there

11550
03:14:19,910 --> 03:14:19,920
the literature and saying is there
 

11551
03:14:19,920 --> 03:14:21,750
the literature and saying is there
anything new can we add a new rule in

11552
03:14:21,750 --> 03:14:21,760
anything new can we add a new rule in
 

11553
03:14:21,760 --> 03:14:23,990
anything new can we add a new rule in
and actually our kydl language expand

11554
03:14:23,990 --> 03:14:24,000
and actually our kydl language expand
 

11555
03:14:24,000 --> 03:14:25,349
and actually our kydl language expand
exploded

11556
03:14:25,349 --> 03:14:25,359
exploded
 

11557
03:14:25,359 --> 03:14:27,510
exploded
there was so many extra things we had to

11558
03:14:27,510 --> 03:14:27,520
there was so many extra things we had to
 

11559
03:14:27,520 --> 03:14:29,349
there was so many extra things we had to
keep adding and then i realized the

11560
03:14:29,349 --> 03:14:29,359
keep adding and then i realized the
 

11561
03:14:29,359 --> 03:14:31,190
keep adding and then i realized the
primitives still were maintained and i

11562
03:14:31,190 --> 03:14:31,200
primitives still were maintained and i
 

11563
03:14:31,200 --> 03:14:33,590
primitives still were maintained and i
could break them down again so

11564
03:14:33,590 --> 03:14:33,600
could break them down again so
 

11565
03:14:33,600 --> 03:14:35,590
could break them down again so
we get it's pretty good i mean there are

11566
03:14:35,590 --> 03:14:35,600
we get it's pretty good i mean there are
 

11567
03:14:35,600 --> 03:14:37,030
we get it's pretty good i mean there are
problems there problems of you know

11568
03:14:37,030 --> 03:14:37,040
problems there problems of you know
 

11569
03:14:37,040 --> 03:14:38,469
problems there problems of you know
interpreting any big sentence and

11570
03:14:38,469 --> 03:14:38,479
interpreting any big sentence and
 

11571
03:14:38,479 --> 03:14:40,630
interpreting any big sentence and
turning it into an actionable code and

11572
03:14:40,630 --> 03:14:40,640
turning it into an actionable code and
 

11573
03:14:40,640 --> 03:14:42,150
turning it into an actionable code and
then codex is not without its problems

11574
03:14:42,150 --> 03:14:42,160
then codex is not without its problems
 

11575
03:14:42,160 --> 03:14:43,750
then codex is not without its problems
you can you can crash it quite easily

11576
03:14:43,750 --> 03:14:43,760
you can you can crash it quite easily
 

11577
03:14:43,760 --> 03:14:46,229
you can you can crash it quite easily
right you can generate nonsense but boy

11578
03:14:46,229 --> 03:14:46,239
right you can generate nonsense but boy
 

11579
03:14:46,239 --> 03:14:49,110
right you can generate nonsense but boy
it's interesting i would love to learn

11580
03:14:49,110 --> 03:14:49,120
it's interesting i would love to learn
 

11581
03:14:49,120 --> 03:14:52,229
it's interesting i would love to learn
to program now using codex

11582
03:14:52,229 --> 03:14:52,239
to program now using codex
 

11583
03:14:52,239 --> 03:14:54,229
to program now using codex
right just hacking around right and i

11584
03:14:54,229 --> 03:14:54,239
right just hacking around right and i
 

11585
03:14:54,239 --> 03:14:55,510
right just hacking around right and i
wonder if chemist in the future will

11586
03:14:55,510 --> 03:14:55,520
wonder if chemist in the future will
 

11587
03:14:55,520 --> 03:14:57,110
wonder if chemist in the future will
learn to

11588
03:14:57,110 --> 03:14:57,120
learn to
 

11589
03:14:57,120 --> 03:15:00,550
learn to
do chemistry by just hacking around with

11590
03:15:00,550 --> 03:15:00,560
do chemistry by just hacking around with
 

11591
03:15:00,560 --> 03:15:01,990
do chemistry by just hacking around with
the system writing in different things

11592
03:15:01,990 --> 03:15:02,000
the system writing in different things
 

11593
03:15:02,000 --> 03:15:03,590
the system writing in different things
because the key thing that we're doing

11594
03:15:03,590 --> 03:15:03,600
because the key thing that we're doing
 

11595
03:15:03,600 --> 03:15:05,269
because the key thing that we're doing
with the chemistry is that where a lot

11596
03:15:05,269 --> 03:15:05,279
with the chemistry is that where a lot
 

11597
03:15:05,279 --> 03:15:07,269
with the chemistry is that where a lot
of mathematical chemistry went wrong is

11598
03:15:07,269 --> 03:15:07,279
of mathematical chemistry went wrong is
 

11599
03:15:07,279 --> 03:15:08,389
of mathematical chemistry went wrong is
people

11600
03:15:08,389 --> 03:15:08,399
people
 

11601
03:15:08,399 --> 03:15:10,710
people
and i think wolfram does this in

11602
03:15:10,710 --> 03:15:10,720
and i think wolfram does this in
 

11603
03:15:10,720 --> 03:15:12,950
and i think wolfram does this in
mathematica he assumes

11604
03:15:12,950 --> 03:15:12,960
mathematica he assumes
 

11605
03:15:12,960 --> 03:15:15,269
mathematica he assumes
that chemistry is a reaction where atom

11606
03:15:15,269 --> 03:15:15,279
that chemistry is a reaction where atom
 

11607
03:15:15,279 --> 03:15:17,269
that chemistry is a reaction where atom
a or molecule a reacts with molecule b

11608
03:15:17,269 --> 03:15:17,279
a or molecule a reacts with molecule b
 

11609
03:15:17,279 --> 03:15:18,790
a or molecule a reacts with molecule b
to give molecule c that's not what

11610
03:15:18,790 --> 03:15:18,800
to give molecule c that's not what
 

11611
03:15:18,800 --> 03:15:22,469
to give molecule c that's not what
chemistry is chemistry is take take some

11612
03:15:22,469 --> 03:15:22,479
chemistry is chemistry is take take some
 

11613
03:15:22,479 --> 03:15:25,349
chemistry is chemistry is take take some
molecule take a liquid and a solid

11614
03:15:25,349 --> 03:15:25,359
molecule take a liquid and a solid
 

11615
03:15:25,359 --> 03:15:27,590
molecule take a liquid and a solid
mix it up and heat it

11616
03:15:27,590 --> 03:15:27,600
mix it up and heat it
 

11617
03:15:27,600 --> 03:15:29,349
mix it up and heat it
and then extract it

11618
03:15:29,349 --> 03:15:29,359
and then extract it
 

11619
03:15:29,359 --> 03:15:31,830
and then extract it
so the programming language is actually

11620
03:15:31,830 --> 03:15:31,840
so the programming language is actually
 

11621
03:15:31,840 --> 03:15:35,190
so the programming language is actually
with respect to the process operations

11622
03:15:35,190 --> 03:15:35,200
with respect to the process operations
 

11623
03:15:35,200 --> 03:15:37,670
with respect to the process operations
and if you flick in process space

11624
03:15:37,670 --> 03:15:37,680
and if you flick in process space
 

11625
03:15:37,680 --> 03:15:39,830
and if you flick in process space
not in chemical graph space

11626
03:15:39,830 --> 03:15:39,840
not in chemical graph space
 

11627
03:15:39,840 --> 03:15:41,670
not in chemical graph space
you unlock everything because there's

11628
03:15:41,670 --> 03:15:41,680
you unlock everything because there's
 

11629
03:15:41,680 --> 03:15:43,190
you unlock everything because there's
only a finite number of processes you

11630
03:15:43,190 --> 03:15:43,200
only a finite number of processes you
 

11631
03:15:43,200 --> 03:15:45,030
only a finite number of processes you
need to do in chemistry

11632
03:15:45,030 --> 03:15:45,040
need to do in chemistry
 

11633
03:15:45,040 --> 03:15:47,349
need to do in chemistry
and that yeah and that's reassuring and

11634
03:15:47,349 --> 03:15:47,359
and that yeah and that's reassuring and
 

11635
03:15:47,359 --> 03:15:49,190
and that yeah and that's reassuring and
so so we're in the middle of it it's

11636
03:15:49,190 --> 03:15:49,200
so so we're in the middle of it it's
 

11637
03:15:49,200 --> 03:15:51,510
so so we're in the middle of it it's
really exciting um

11638
03:15:51,510 --> 03:15:51,520
really exciting um
 

11639
03:15:51,520 --> 03:15:53,349
really exciting um
it's not you know the be all on the end

11640
03:15:53,349 --> 03:15:53,359
it's not you know the be all on the end
 

11641
03:15:53,359 --> 03:15:54,790
it's not you know the be all on the end
or and there is like i say errors that

11642
03:15:54,790 --> 03:15:54,800
or and there is like i say errors that
 

11643
03:15:54,800 --> 03:15:57,030
or and there is like i say errors that
can creep in one day we might be able to

11644
03:15:57,030 --> 03:15:57,040
can creep in one day we might be able to
 

11645
03:15:57,040 --> 03:15:58,710
can creep in one day we might be able to
do it without human interaction you

11646
03:15:58,710 --> 03:15:58,720
do it without human interaction you
 

11647
03:15:58,720 --> 03:16:00,309
do it without human interaction you
simulate it and you'll know enough about

11648
03:16:00,309 --> 03:16:00,319
simulate it and you'll know enough about
 

11649
03:16:00,319 --> 03:16:03,110
simulate it and you'll know enough about
the simulation that will it the you know

11650
03:16:03,110 --> 03:16:03,120
the simulation that will it the you know
 

11651
03:16:03,120 --> 03:16:05,510
the simulation that will it the you know
i'm the lab won't catch fire but there

11652
03:16:05,510 --> 03:16:05,520
i'm the lab won't catch fire but there
 

11653
03:16:05,520 --> 03:16:06,950
i'm the lab won't catch fire but there
are so many safety issues right now that

11654
03:16:06,950 --> 03:16:06,960
are so many safety issues right now that
 

11655
03:16:06,960 --> 03:16:08,950
are so many safety issues right now that
we've got to really be very careful you

11656
03:16:08,950 --> 03:16:08,960
we've got to really be very careful you
 

11657
03:16:08,960 --> 03:16:11,269
we've got to really be very careful you
know protecting the user protecting the

environment protecting misuse i mean
 

11661
03:16:13,120 --> 03:16:14,710
environment protecting misuse i mean
there's lots to discuss

11662
03:16:14,710 --> 03:16:14,720
there's lots to discuss
 

11663
03:16:14,720 --> 03:16:15,990
there's lots to discuss
if you want to go down that route

11664
03:16:15,990 --> 03:16:16,000
if you want to go down that route
 

11665
03:16:16,000 --> 03:16:17,670
if you want to go down that route
because it's very very interesting you

11666
03:16:17,670 --> 03:16:17,680
because it's very very interesting you
 

11667
03:16:17,680 --> 03:16:18,870
because it's very very interesting you
don't want

11668
03:16:18,870 --> 03:16:18,880
don't want

about the future
 

11711
03:17:00,479 --> 03:17:02,870
about the future
or does it terrify you so

11712
03:17:02,870 --> 03:17:02,880
or does it terrify you so
 

11713
03:17:02,880 --> 03:17:05,190
or does it terrify you so
let's we mentioned that time is

11714
03:17:05,190 --> 03:17:05,200
let's we mentioned that time is
 

11715
03:17:05,200 --> 03:17:07,030
let's we mentioned that time is
fundamental

11716
03:17:07,030 --> 03:17:07,040
fundamental
 

11717
03:17:07,040 --> 03:17:08,950
fundamental
it seems like

11718
03:17:08,950 --> 03:17:08,960
it seems like
 

11719
03:17:08,960 --> 03:17:11,110
it seems like
you're at the cutting edge

11720
03:17:11,110 --> 03:17:11,120
you're at the cutting edge
 

11721
03:17:11,120 --> 03:17:13,990
you're at the cutting edge
of progress that will have to happen

11722
03:17:13,990 --> 03:17:14,000
of progress that will have to happen
 

11723
03:17:14,000 --> 03:17:15,590
of progress that will have to happen
that will happen

11724
03:17:15,590 --> 03:17:15,600
that will happen
 

11725
03:17:15,600 --> 03:17:18,550
that will happen
that there's no stopping it

11726
03:17:18,550 --> 03:17:18,560
that there's no stopping it
 

11727
03:17:18,560 --> 03:17:21,030
that there's no stopping it
and i as we've been talking about i see

11728
03:17:21,030 --> 03:17:21,040
and i as we've been talking about i see
 

11729
03:17:21,040 --> 03:17:23,269
and i as we've been talking about i see
obviously a huge number of exciting

11730
03:17:23,269 --> 03:17:23,279
obviously a huge number of exciting
 

11731
03:17:23,279 --> 03:17:24,630
obviously a huge number of exciting
possibilities

11732
03:17:24,630 --> 03:17:24,640
possibilities
 

11733
03:17:24,640 --> 03:17:27,590
possibilities
so whenever you automate

11734
03:17:27,590 --> 03:17:27,600
so whenever you automate
 

11735
03:17:27,600 --> 03:17:30,710
so whenever you automate
uh these kinds of things just the world

11736
03:17:30,710 --> 03:17:30,720
uh these kinds of things just the world
 

11737
03:17:30,720 --> 03:17:33,349
uh these kinds of things just the world
opens up it's like programming itself

11738
03:17:33,349 --> 03:17:33,359
opens up it's like programming itself
 

11739
03:17:33,359 --> 03:17:35,910
opens up it's like programming itself
and the computer a regular computer

11740
03:17:35,910 --> 03:17:35,920
and the computer a regular computer
 

11741
03:17:35,920 --> 03:17:37,190
and the computer a regular computer
has uh

11742
03:17:37,190 --> 03:17:37,200
has uh
 

11743
03:17:37,200 --> 03:17:39,750
has uh
created innumerable applications it made

11744
03:17:39,750 --> 03:17:39,760
created innumerable applications it made
 

11745
03:17:39,760 --> 03:17:41,510
created innumerable applications it made
the world

11746
03:17:41,510 --> 03:17:41,520
the world
 

11747
03:17:41,520 --> 03:17:43,670
the world
better in so many dimensions and it

11748
03:17:43,670 --> 03:17:43,680
better in so many dimensions and it
 

11749
03:17:43,680 --> 03:17:45,269
better in so many dimensions and it
created of course a lot of negative

11750
03:17:45,269 --> 03:17:45,279
created of course a lot of negative
 

11751
03:17:45,279 --> 03:17:47,510
created of course a lot of negative
things that we for some reason like to

11752
03:17:47,510 --> 03:17:47,520
things that we for some reason like to
 

11753
03:17:47,520 --> 03:17:48,870
things that we for some reason like to
focus on

11754
03:17:48,870 --> 03:17:48,880
focus on
 

11755
03:17:48,880 --> 03:17:50,790
focus on
using that very technology to tweet

11756
03:17:50,790 --> 03:17:50,800
using that very technology to tweet
 

11757
03:17:50,800 --> 03:17:52,229
using that very technology to tweet
about it

11758
03:17:52,229 --> 03:17:52,239
about it
 

11759
03:17:52,239 --> 03:17:53,030
about it
but

11760
03:17:53,030 --> 03:17:53,040
but
 

11761
03:17:53,040 --> 03:17:55,429
but
i think it made a much better world but

11762
03:17:55,429 --> 03:17:55,439
i think it made a much better world but
 

11763
03:17:55,439 --> 03:17:57,510
i think it made a much better world but
it created a lot of new dangers

11764
03:17:57,510 --> 03:17:57,520
it created a lot of new dangers
 

11765
03:17:57,520 --> 03:17:59,110
it created a lot of new dangers
so

11766
03:17:59,110 --> 03:17:59,120
so
 

11767
03:17:59,120 --> 03:18:00,790
so
maybe you can speak to

11768
03:18:00,790 --> 03:18:00,800
maybe you can speak to
 

11769
03:18:00,800 --> 03:18:02,469
maybe you can speak to
when you have

11770
03:18:02,469 --> 03:18:02,479
when you have
 

11771
03:18:02,479 --> 03:18:03,990
when you have
when you kind of

11772
03:18:03,990 --> 03:18:04,000
when you kind of
 

11773
03:18:04,000 --> 03:18:06,389
when you kind of
stand at the

11774
03:18:06,389 --> 03:18:06,399
stand at the
 

11775
03:18:06,399 --> 03:18:09,590
stand at the
end of the road for uh building a really

11776
03:18:09,590 --> 03:18:09,600
end of the road for uh building a really
 

11777
03:18:09,600 --> 03:18:13,830
end of the road for uh building a really
solid reliable universal computer

11778
03:18:13,830 --> 03:18:13,840
solid reliable universal computer
 

11779
03:18:13,840 --> 03:18:15,830
solid reliable universal computer
um what are the possibilities that are

11780
03:18:15,830 --> 03:18:15,840
um what are the possibilities that are
 

11781
03:18:15,840 --> 03:18:17,349
um what are the possibilities that are
positive what are the possibilities that

11782
03:18:17,349 --> 03:18:17,359
positive what are the possibilities that
 

11783
03:18:17,359 --> 03:18:19,349
positive what are the possibilities that
are negative how can we minimize the

11784
03:18:19,349 --> 03:18:19,359
are negative how can we minimize the
 

11785
03:18:19,359 --> 03:18:20,950
are negative how can we minimize the
chance of the negative

11786
03:18:20,950 --> 03:18:20,960
chance of the negative
 

11787
03:18:20,960 --> 03:18:22,710
chance of the negative
yeah that's a really good question so

11788
03:18:22,710 --> 03:18:22,720
yeah that's a really good question so
 

11789
03:18:22,720 --> 03:18:23,910
yeah that's a really good question so
there's so many positive things from

11790
03:18:23,910 --> 03:18:23,920
there's so many positive things from
 

11791
03:18:23,920 --> 03:18:26,870
there's so many positive things from
drug discovery from supply chain

11792
03:18:26,870 --> 03:18:26,880
drug discovery from supply chain
 

11793
03:18:26,880 --> 03:18:28,710
drug discovery from supply chain
um uh stress

11794
03:18:28,710 --> 03:18:28,720
um uh stress
 

11795
03:18:28,720 --> 03:18:30,710
um uh stress
for basically enabling chemists to

11796
03:18:30,710 --> 03:18:30,720
for basically enabling chemists to
 

11797
03:18:30,720 --> 03:18:31,990
for basically enabling chemists to
basically build more productive in the

11798
03:18:31,990 --> 03:18:32,000
basically build more productive in the
 

11799
03:18:32,000 --> 03:18:33,670
basically build more productive in the
lab right well this isn't the computer

11800
03:18:33,670 --> 03:18:33,680
lab right well this isn't the computer
 

11801
03:18:33,680 --> 03:18:35,110
lab right well this isn't the computer
is not going to replace the chemist

11802
03:18:35,110 --> 03:18:35,120
is not going to replace the chemist
 

11803
03:18:35,120 --> 03:18:36,389
is not going to replace the chemist
there's going to be a moore's law of

11804
03:18:36,389 --> 03:18:36,399
there's going to be a moore's law of
 

11805
03:18:36,399 --> 03:18:37,910
there's going to be a moore's law of
molecules right there's going to be so

11806
03:18:37,910 --> 03:18:37,920
molecules right there's going to be so
 

11807
03:18:37,920 --> 03:18:39,830
molecules right there's going to be so
many more molecules we can design so

11808
03:18:39,830 --> 03:18:39,840
many more molecules we can design so
 

11809
03:18:39,840 --> 03:18:41,590
many more molecules we can design so
many more diseases we can cure so

11810
03:18:41,590 --> 03:18:41,600
many more diseases we can cure so
 

11811
03:18:41,600 --> 03:18:43,269
many more diseases we can cure so
chemists in the lab as researchers

11812
03:18:43,269 --> 03:18:43,279
chemists in the lab as researchers
 

11813
03:18:43,279 --> 03:18:45,429
chemists in the lab as researchers
that's better for science so they can

11814
03:18:45,429 --> 03:18:45,439
that's better for science so they can
 

11815
03:18:45,439 --> 03:18:47,349
that's better for science so they can
build a bunch of um

11816
03:18:47,349 --> 03:18:47,359
build a bunch of um
 

11817
03:18:47,359 --> 03:18:49,269
build a bunch of um
uh like they could do science at a much

11818
03:18:49,269 --> 03:18:49,279
uh like they could do science at a much
 

11819
03:18:49,279 --> 03:18:50,790
uh like they could do science at a much
more accelerated pace so it's not just

11820
03:18:50,790 --> 03:18:50,800
more accelerated pace so it's not just
 

11821
03:18:50,800 --> 03:18:52,389
more accelerated pace so it's not just
the development of drugs it's actually

11822
03:18:52,389 --> 03:18:52,399
the development of drugs it's actually
 

11823
03:18:52,399 --> 03:18:54,229
the development of drugs it's actually
like doing the basic understanding of

11824
03:18:54,229 --> 03:18:54,239
like doing the basic understanding of
 

11825
03:18:54,239 --> 03:18:55,269
like doing the basic understanding of
the science of drugs and the

11826
03:18:55,269 --> 03:18:55,279
the science of drugs and the
 

11827
03:18:55,279 --> 03:18:56,950
the science of drugs and the
personalization the cost of drugs right

11828
03:18:56,950 --> 03:18:56,960
personalization the cost of drugs right
 

11829
03:18:56,960 --> 03:18:59,269
personalization the cost of drugs right
now we're all living longer we're all

11830
03:18:59,269 --> 03:18:59,279
now we're all living longer we're all
 

11831
03:18:59,279 --> 03:19:00,870
now we're all living longer we're all
having more and more we know more about

11832
03:19:00,870 --> 03:19:00,880
having more and more we know more about
 

11833
03:19:00,880 --> 03:19:02,790
having more and more we know more about
our genomic development we know about

11834
03:19:02,790 --> 03:19:02,800
our genomic development we know about
 

11835
03:19:02,800 --> 03:19:03,590
our genomic development we know about
our

11836
03:19:03,590 --> 03:19:03,600
our
 

11837
03:19:03,600 --> 03:19:05,429
our
you know pre-determination and we might

11838
03:19:05,429 --> 03:19:05,439
you know pre-determination and we might
 

11839
03:19:05,439 --> 03:19:07,830
you know pre-determination and we might
be able to one dream i've got is like

11840
03:19:07,830 --> 03:19:07,840
be able to one dream i've got is like
 

11841
03:19:07,840 --> 03:19:09,590
be able to one dream i've got is like
imagine you know

11842
03:19:09,590 --> 03:19:09,600
imagine you know
 

11843
03:19:09,600 --> 03:19:11,349
imagine you know
you you you can work your genome

11844
03:19:11,349 --> 03:19:11,359
you you you can work your genome
 

11845
03:19:11,359 --> 03:19:12,630
you you you can work your genome
assistant tells you you're going to get

11846
03:19:12,630 --> 03:19:12,640
assistant tells you you're going to get
 

11847
03:19:12,640 --> 03:19:14,550
assistant tells you you're going to get
cancer in seven years time

11848
03:19:14,550 --> 03:19:14,560
cancer in seven years time
 

11849
03:19:14,560 --> 03:19:16,630
cancer in seven years time
and uh you have your personal computer

11850
03:19:16,630 --> 03:19:16,640
and uh you have your personal computer
 

11851
03:19:16,640 --> 03:19:18,630
and uh you have your personal computer
that cooks up the right molecule just

11852
03:19:18,630 --> 03:19:18,640
that cooks up the right molecule just
 

11853
03:19:18,640 --> 03:19:20,870
that cooks up the right molecule just
for you to cure it right that's a really

11854
03:19:20,870 --> 03:19:20,880
for you to cure it right that's a really
 

11855
03:19:20,880 --> 03:19:23,990
for you to cure it right that's a really
positive idea yeah the other thing is um

11856
03:19:23,990 --> 03:19:24,000
positive idea yeah the other thing is um
 

11857
03:19:24,000 --> 03:19:26,469
positive idea yeah the other thing is um
is when drugs so right now i think it is

11858
03:19:26,469 --> 03:19:26,479
is when drugs so right now i think it is
 

11859
03:19:26,479 --> 03:19:28,469
is when drugs so right now i think it is
absolutely outrageous

11860
03:19:28,469 --> 03:19:28,479
absolutely outrageous
 

11861
03:19:28,479 --> 03:19:31,830
absolutely outrageous
that not all of humanity has access to

11862
03:19:31,830 --> 03:19:31,840
that not all of humanity has access to
 

11863
03:19:31,840 --> 03:19:33,030
that not all of humanity has access to
medicine

11864
03:19:33,030 --> 03:19:33,040
medicine
 

11865
03:19:33,040 --> 03:19:34,950
medicine
and i think the computer might be able

11866
03:19:34,950 --> 03:19:34,960
and i think the computer might be able
 

11867
03:19:34,960 --> 03:19:36,469
and i think the computer might be able
to change that fundamentally because it

11868
03:19:36,469 --> 03:19:36,479
to change that fundamentally because it
 

11869
03:19:36,479 --> 03:19:37,670
to change that fundamentally because it
will disrupt the way things are

11870
03:19:37,670 --> 03:19:37,680
will disrupt the way things are
 

11871
03:19:37,680 --> 03:19:39,670
will disrupt the way things are
manufactured so let's stop thinking

11872
03:19:39,670 --> 03:19:39,680
manufactured so let's stop thinking
 

11873
03:19:39,680 --> 03:19:41,190
manufactured so let's stop thinking
about manufacturing in different

11874
03:19:41,190 --> 03:19:41,200
about manufacturing in different
 

11875
03:19:41,200 --> 03:19:44,309
about manufacturing in different
factories let's say that computers

11876
03:19:44,309 --> 03:19:44,319
factories let's say that computers
 

11877
03:19:44,319 --> 03:19:46,389
factories let's say that computers
clinical grade computers or drug grade

11878
03:19:46,389 --> 03:19:46,399
clinical grade computers or drug grade
 

11879
03:19:46,399 --> 03:19:48,630
clinical grade computers or drug grade
computers will be in facilities all

11880
03:19:48,630 --> 03:19:48,640
computers will be in facilities all
 

11881
03:19:48,640 --> 03:19:51,349
computers will be in facilities all
around the world and they can make

11882
03:19:51,349 --> 03:19:51,359
around the world and they can make
 

11883
03:19:51,359 --> 03:19:53,429
around the world and they can make
things on demand as a function of the

11884
03:19:53,429 --> 03:19:53,439
things on demand as a function of the
 

11885
03:19:53,439 --> 03:19:55,110
things on demand as a function of the
cost you know maybe people won't be able

11886
03:19:55,110 --> 03:19:55,120
cost you know maybe people won't be able
 

11887
03:19:55,120 --> 03:19:57,030
cost you know maybe people won't be able
to afford the latest and greatest patent

11888
03:19:57,030 --> 03:19:57,040
to afford the latest and greatest patent
 

11889
03:19:57,040 --> 03:19:59,110
to afford the latest and greatest patent
but maybe they'll be up we get the next

11890
03:19:59,110 --> 03:19:59,120
but maybe they'll be up we get the next
 

11891
03:19:59,120 --> 03:20:01,030
but maybe they'll be up we get the next
best thing and we'll basically

11892
03:20:01,030 --> 03:20:01,040
best thing and we'll basically
 

11893
03:20:01,040 --> 03:20:02,469
best thing and we'll basically
democratize

11894
03:20:02,469 --> 03:20:02,479
democratize
 

11895
03:20:02,479 --> 03:20:05,269
democratize
um make available drugs to everybody

11896
03:20:05,269 --> 03:20:05,279
um make available drugs to everybody
 

11897
03:20:05,279 --> 03:20:07,030
um make available drugs to everybody
that they need you know and you know

11898
03:20:07,030 --> 03:20:07,040
that they need you know and you know
 

11899
03:20:07,040 --> 03:20:08,870
that they need you know and you know
there's lots of

11900
03:20:08,870 --> 03:20:08,880
there's lots of
 

11901
03:20:08,880 --> 03:20:10,630
there's lots of
really interesting things there so i

11902
03:20:10,630 --> 03:20:10,640
really interesting things there so i
 

11903
03:20:10,640 --> 03:20:12,389
really interesting things there so i
think that's going to happen

11904
03:20:12,389 --> 03:20:12,399
think that's going to happen
 

11905
03:20:12,399 --> 03:20:15,269
think that's going to happen
i think that now let's take

11906
03:20:15,269 --> 03:20:15,279
i think that now let's take
 

11907
03:20:15,279 --> 03:20:16,790
i think that now let's take
the the negative

11908
03:20:16,790 --> 03:20:16,800
the the negative
 

11909
03:20:16,800 --> 03:20:18,870
the the negative
before we do that let's imagine what

11910
03:20:18,870 --> 03:20:18,880
before we do that let's imagine what
 

11911
03:20:18,880 --> 03:20:20,710
before we do that let's imagine what
happened to go back to a really tragic

11912
03:20:20,710 --> 03:20:20,720
happened to go back to a really tragic
 

11913
03:20:20,720 --> 03:20:22,870
happened to go back to a really tragic
accident a few years ago or not accident

11914
03:20:22,870 --> 03:20:22,880
accident a few years ago or not accident
 

11915
03:20:22,880 --> 03:20:26,070
accident a few years ago or not accident
an act of murder by that pilot on the i

11916
03:20:26,070 --> 03:20:26,080
an act of murder by that pilot on the i
 

11917
03:20:26,080 --> 03:20:27,670
an act of murder by that pilot on the i
think it's euro wings or swiss swings

11918
03:20:27,670 --> 03:20:27,680
think it's euro wings or swiss swings
 

11919
03:20:27,680 --> 03:20:30,070
think it's euro wings or swiss swings
off but what he did is the plane took

11920
03:20:30,070 --> 03:20:30,080
off but what he did is the plane took
 

11921
03:20:30,080 --> 03:20:31,269
off but what he did is the plane took
off

11922
03:20:31,269 --> 03:20:31,279
off
 

11923
03:20:31,279 --> 03:20:32,870
off
um he went to his pilot went to the

11924
03:20:32,870 --> 03:20:32,880
um he went to his pilot went to the
 

11925
03:20:32,880 --> 03:20:34,710
um he went to his pilot went to the
toilet he was a co-pilot he locked the

11926
03:20:34,710 --> 03:20:34,720
toilet he was a co-pilot he locked the
 

11927
03:20:34,720 --> 03:20:35,510
toilet he was a co-pilot he locked the
door

11928
03:20:35,510 --> 03:20:35,520
door
 

11929
03:20:35,520 --> 03:20:38,150
door
and then set the the autopilot the the

11930
03:20:38,150 --> 03:20:38,160
and then set the the autopilot the the
 

11931
03:20:38,160 --> 03:20:40,309
and then set the the autopilot the the
the um above the alps so you set the

11932
03:20:40,309 --> 03:20:40,319
the um above the alps so you set the
 

11933
03:20:40,319 --> 03:20:43,030
the um above the alps so you set the
altimeter or the the the descend height

11934
03:20:43,030 --> 03:20:43,040
altimeter or the the the descend height
 

11935
03:20:43,040 --> 03:20:45,910
altimeter or the the the descend height
to zero so the computer just took the

11936
03:20:45,910 --> 03:20:45,920
to zero so the computer just took the
 

11937
03:20:45,920 --> 03:20:47,990
to zero so the computer just took the
plane into the alps

11938
03:20:47,990 --> 03:20:48,000
plane into the alps
 

11939
03:20:48,000 --> 03:20:49,030
plane into the alps
now

11940
03:20:49,030 --> 03:20:49,040
now
 

11941
03:20:49,040 --> 03:20:50,229
now
i mean

11942
03:20:50,229 --> 03:20:50,239
i mean
 

11943
03:20:50,239 --> 03:20:51,910
i mean
that was such a tragedy that obviously

11944
03:20:51,910 --> 03:20:51,920
that was such a tragedy that obviously
 

11945
03:20:51,920 --> 03:20:53,670
that was such a tragedy that obviously
the guy was mentally ill but it wasn't

11946
03:20:53,670 --> 03:20:53,680
the guy was mentally ill but it wasn't
 

11947
03:20:53,680 --> 03:20:55,349
the guy was mentally ill but it wasn't
just a tragedy for him it was for all

11948
03:20:55,349 --> 03:20:55,359
just a tragedy for him it was for all
 

11949
03:20:55,359 --> 03:20:57,830
just a tragedy for him it was for all
the people on board but what if and i

11950
03:20:57,830 --> 03:20:57,840
the people on board but what if and i
 

11951
03:20:57,840 --> 03:20:59,510
the people on board but what if and i
was inspired by this am i thinking what

11952
03:20:59,510 --> 03:20:59,520
was inspired by this am i thinking what
 

11953
03:20:59,520 --> 03:21:01,590
was inspired by this am i thinking what
can i do to do

11954
03:21:01,590 --> 03:21:01,600
can i do to do
 

11955
03:21:01,600 --> 03:21:04,070
can i do to do
to to anticipate problems like this in

11956
03:21:04,070 --> 03:21:04,080
to to anticipate problems like this in
 

11957
03:21:04,080 --> 03:21:06,710
to to anticipate problems like this in
the computer had the had the software

11958
03:21:06,710 --> 03:21:06,720
the computer had the had the software
 

11959
03:21:06,720 --> 03:21:08,790
the computer had the had the software
and i'm sure boeing and airbus will be

11960
03:21:08,790 --> 03:21:08,800
and i'm sure boeing and airbus will be
 

11961
03:21:08,800 --> 03:21:10,710
and i'm sure boeing and airbus will be
thinking ah maybe i can give the

11962
03:21:10,710 --> 03:21:10,720
thinking ah maybe i can give the
 

11963
03:21:10,720 --> 03:21:12,070
thinking ah maybe i can give the
computer a bit more situational

11964
03:21:12,070 --> 03:21:12,080
computer a bit more situational
 

11965
03:21:12,080 --> 03:21:14,229
computer a bit more situational
awareness and whenever one some tries to

11966
03:21:14,229 --> 03:21:14,239
awareness and whenever one some tries to
 

11967
03:21:14,239 --> 03:21:15,830
awareness and whenever one some tries to
drop the height of the plane and it

11968
03:21:15,830 --> 03:21:15,840
drop the height of the plane and it
 

11969
03:21:15,840 --> 03:21:17,349
drop the height of the plane and it
knows it's above the alps or just say oh

11970
03:21:17,349 --> 03:21:17,359
knows it's above the alps or just say oh
 

11971
03:21:17,359 --> 03:21:18,710
knows it's above the alps or just say oh
no computer says no we're not letting

11972
03:21:18,710 --> 03:21:18,720
no computer says no we're not letting
 

11973
03:21:18,720 --> 03:21:19,990
no computer says no we're not letting
you do that

11974
03:21:19,990 --> 03:21:20,000
you do that
 

11975
03:21:20,000 --> 03:21:21,510
you do that
um of course he would have been out of

11976
03:21:21,510 --> 03:21:21,520
um of course he would have been out of
 

11977
03:21:21,520 --> 03:21:23,110
um of course he would have been out of
fine another way maybe fly it until it

11978
03:21:23,110 --> 03:21:23,120
fine another way maybe fly it until it
 

11979
03:21:23,120 --> 03:21:24,630
fine another way maybe fly it until it
runs out of fuel or something but you

11980
03:21:24,630 --> 03:21:24,640
runs out of fuel or something but you
 

11981
03:21:24,640 --> 03:21:27,349
runs out of fuel or something but you
know keep anticipating all the

11982
03:21:27,349 --> 03:21:27,359
know keep anticipating all the
 

11983
03:21:27,359 --> 03:21:29,110
know keep anticipating all the
large number of trajectories that can go

11984
03:21:29,110 --> 03:21:29,120
large number of trajectories that can go
 

11985
03:21:29,120 --> 03:21:30,790
large number of trajectories that can go
negative all those kinds of running into

11986
03:21:30,790 --> 03:21:30,800
negative all those kinds of running into
 

11987
03:21:30,800 --> 03:21:34,150
negative all those kinds of running into
the alps and try to

11988
03:21:34,150 --> 03:21:34,160
the alps and try to
 

11989
03:21:34,160 --> 03:21:36,550
the alps and try to
at least make it easy for the engineers

11990
03:21:36,550 --> 03:21:36,560
at least make it easy for the engineers
 

11991
03:21:36,560 --> 03:21:38,389
at least make it easy for the engineers
to build systems that protecting us that

11992
03:21:38,389 --> 03:21:38,399
to build systems that protecting us that
 

11993
03:21:38,399 --> 03:21:40,550
to build systems that protecting us that
yeah and and let's just think so what

11994
03:21:40,550 --> 03:21:40,560
yeah and and let's just think so what
 

11995
03:21:40,560 --> 03:21:42,309
yeah and and let's just think so what
are in the computer world right now with

11996
03:21:42,309 --> 03:21:42,319
are in the computer world right now with
 

11997
03:21:42,319 --> 03:21:44,389
are in the computer world right now with
kydl's let's just not think about what

11998
03:21:44,389 --> 03:21:44,399
kydl's let's just not think about what
 

11999
03:21:44,399 --> 03:21:45,429
kydl's let's just not think about what
i'm doing right now what i'm doing right

12000
03:21:45,429 --> 03:21:45,439
i'm doing right now what i'm doing right
 

12001
03:21:45,439 --> 03:21:46,950
i'm doing right now what i'm doing right
now is it's completely open right

12002
03:21:46,950 --> 03:21:46,960
now is it's completely open right
 

12003
03:21:46,960 --> 03:21:48,309
now is it's completely open right
everyone's going to know kai dl's maybe

12004
03:21:48,309 --> 03:21:48,319
everyone's going to know kai dl's maybe
 

12005
03:21:48,319 --> 03:21:49,590
everyone's going to know kai dl's maybe
playing with them making them more

12006
03:21:49,590 --> 03:21:49,600
playing with them making them more
 

12007
03:21:49,600 --> 03:21:51,429
playing with them making them more
easier and easier and easier but what

12008
03:21:51,429 --> 03:21:51,439
easier and easier and easier but what
 

12009
03:21:51,439 --> 03:21:52,950
easier and easier and easier but what
we're going to start to do

12010
03:21:52,950 --> 03:21:52,960
we're going to start to do
 

12011
03:21:52,960 --> 03:21:54,950
we're going to start to do
it makes sense to

12012
03:21:54,950 --> 03:21:54,960
it makes sense to
 

12013
03:21:54,960 --> 03:21:56,309
it makes sense to
encrypt

12014
03:21:56,309 --> 03:21:56,319
encrypt
 

12015
03:21:56,319 --> 03:21:59,110
encrypt
the kydl's in such a way you you let's

12016
03:21:59,110 --> 03:21:59,120
the kydl's in such a way you you let's
 

12017
03:21:59,120 --> 03:22:00,710
the kydl's in such a way you you let's
say you work for a pharmaceutical

12018
03:22:00,710 --> 03:22:00,720
say you work for a pharmaceutical
 

12019
03:22:00,720 --> 03:22:02,389
say you work for a pharmaceutical
company and you have a license to make a

12020
03:22:02,389 --> 03:22:02,399
company and you have a license to make a
 

12021
03:22:02,399 --> 03:22:04,309
company and you have a license to make a
given molecule or you get issued with a

12022
03:22:04,309 --> 03:22:04,319
given molecule or you get issued with a
 

12023
03:22:04,319 --> 03:22:06,630
given molecule or you get issued with a
license by the fda or your local

03:22:06,630 --> 03:22:06,640
license by the fda or your local
 

12025
03:22:06,640 --> 03:22:07,990
license by the fda or your local
authority and they'll say right you're

12026
03:22:07,990 --> 03:22:08,000
authority and they'll say right you're
 

12027
03:22:08,000 --> 03:22:09,590
authority and they'll say right you're
licensed to do it here it is it's

12028
03:22:09,590 --> 03:22:09,600
licensed to do it here it is it's
 

12029
03:22:09,600 --> 03:22:12,389
licensed to do it here it is it's
encrypted and the kdl gets run so you

12030
03:22:12,389 --> 03:22:12,399
encrypted and the kdl gets run so you
 

12031
03:22:12,399 --> 03:22:14,469
encrypted and the kdl gets run so you
have a license for that instance of use

12032
03:22:14,469 --> 03:22:14,479
have a license for that instance of use
 

12033
03:22:14,479 --> 03:22:16,389
have a license for that instance of use
easy to do computer science has already

12034
03:22:16,389 --> 03:22:16,399
easy to do computer science has already
 

12035
03:22:16,399 --> 03:22:18,309
easy to do computer science has already
solved the problem so the fact that we

12036
03:22:18,309 --> 03:22:18,319
solved the problem so the fact that we
 

12037
03:22:18,319 --> 03:22:20,389
solved the problem so the fact that we
all trust online banking

12038
03:22:20,389 --> 03:22:20,399
all trust online banking
 

12039
03:22:20,399 --> 03:22:22,469
all trust online banking
right then right now then we can secure

12040
03:22:22,469 --> 03:22:22,479
right then right now then we can secure
 

12041
03:22:22,479 --> 03:22:25,190
right then right now then we can secure
it i'm 100 sure we can secure the

12042
03:22:25,190 --> 03:22:25,200
it i'm 100 sure we can secure the
 

12043
03:22:25,200 --> 03:22:26,469
it i'm 100 sure we can secure the
computer

12044
03:22:26,469 --> 03:22:26,479
computer
 

12045
03:22:26,479 --> 03:22:28,229
computer
and because of the way we have a many

12046
03:22:28,229 --> 03:22:28,239
and because of the way we have a many
 

12047
03:22:28,239 --> 03:22:30,790
and because of the way we have a many
you know it's like the same um

12048
03:22:30,790 --> 03:22:30,800
you know it's like the same um
 

12049

regulated medicine and actually people

12062
03:22:45,190 --> 03:22:45,200
regulated medicine and actually people
 

12063
03:22:45,200 --> 03:22:46,790
regulated medicine and actually people
aren't going to want to then

12064
03:22:46,790 --> 03:22:46,800
aren't going to want to then
 

12065
03:22:46,800 --> 03:22:49,269
aren't going to want to then
make their own fake pharmaceuticals

12066
03:22:49,269 --> 03:22:49,279
make their own fake pharmaceuticals
 

12067
03:22:49,279 --> 03:22:51,510
make their own fake pharmaceuticals
because it'll be so cheap to do it will

12068
03:22:51,510 --> 03:22:51,520
because it'll be so cheap to do it will
 

12069
03:22:51,520 --> 03:22:53,910
because it'll be so cheap to do it will
drop the cost of access to drugs now

12070
03:22:53,910 --> 03:22:53,920
drop the cost of access to drugs now
 

12071
03:22:53,920 --> 03:22:56,070
drop the cost of access to drugs now
what will happen recreational drugs

12072
03:22:56,070 --> 03:22:56,080
what will happen recreational drugs
 

12073
03:22:56,080 --> 03:22:57,750
what will happen recreational drugs
people start saying well i want access

12074
03:22:57,750 --> 03:22:57,760
people start saying well i want access
 

12075

well it's going to be up to it's going
 

12079
03:23:01,279 --> 03:23:03,750
well it's going to be up to it's going
to accelerate that social discussion

12080
03:23:03,750 --> 03:23:03,760
to accelerate that social discussion
 

12081
03:23:03,760 --> 03:23:05,590
to accelerate that social discussion
that's happening in the u.s and canada

12082
03:23:05,590 --> 03:23:05,600
that's happening in the u.s and canada
 

12083
03:23:05,600 --> 03:23:07,429
that's happening in the u.s and canada
and the uk everywhere right because cost

12084
03:23:07,429 --> 03:23:07,439
and the uk everywhere right because cost
 

12085
03:23:07,439 --> 03:23:08,950
and the uk everywhere right because cost
goes down yes

12086
03:23:08,950 --> 03:23:08,960
goes down yes
 

12087
03:23:08,960 --> 03:23:12,309
goes down yes
access goes up giving cannabis thc to

12088
03:23:12,309 --> 03:23:12,319
access goes up giving cannabis thc to

some people who've got epilepsy isn't

12090
03:23:13,910 --> 03:23:13,920
some people who've got epilepsy isn't
 

12091
03:23:13,920 --> 03:23:16,469
some people who've got epilepsy isn't
literally forgive the term a no-brainer

12092
03:23:16,469 --> 03:23:16,479
literally forgive the term a no-brainer
 

12093
03:23:16,479 --> 03:23:17,830
literally forgive the term a no-brainer
because these poor people go from

12094
03:23:17,830 --> 03:23:17,840
because these poor people go from
 

12095
03:23:17,840 --> 03:23:19,990
because these poor people go from
seizures like every day to maybe

12096
03:23:19,990 --> 03:23:20,000
seizures like every day to maybe
 

12097
03:23:20,000 --> 03:23:22,309
seizures like every day to maybe
seizures just once every few months

12098
03:23:22,309 --> 03:23:22,319
seizures just once every few months
 

12099
03:23:22,319 --> 03:23:23,990
seizures just once every few months
so that's that's an interesting idea to

12100
03:23:23,990 --> 03:23:24,000
so that's that's an interesting idea to
 

12101
03:23:24,000 --> 03:23:25,750
so that's that's an interesting idea to
try to minimize the chance that it can

12102
03:23:25,750 --> 03:23:25,760
try to minimize the chance that it can
 

12103
03:23:25,760 --> 03:23:28,870
try to minimize the chance that it can
get into like the hands of individuals

12104
03:23:28,870 --> 03:23:28,880
get into like the hands of individuals
 

12105
03:23:28,880 --> 03:23:29,750
get into like the hands of individuals
like

12106
03:23:29,750 --> 03:23:29,760
like
 

12107
03:23:29,760 --> 03:23:31,590
like
terrorists or people that want to do

harm
 

12111
03:23:33,040 --> 03:23:34,070
harm
now

12112
03:23:34,070 --> 03:23:34,080
now
 

12113
03:23:34,080 --> 03:23:36,150
now
with that kind of thing you're putting a

12114
03:23:36,150 --> 03:23:36,160
with that kind of thing you're putting a
 

12115
03:23:36,160 --> 03:23:38,389
with that kind of thing you're putting a
lot of power in the hands of

12116
03:23:38,389 --> 03:23:38,399
lot of power in the hands of
 

12117
03:23:38,399 --> 03:23:40,309
lot of power in the hands of
governments in the hands of institutions

12118
03:23:40,309 --> 03:23:40,319
governments in the hands of institutions
 

12119
03:23:40,319 --> 03:23:41,750
governments in the hands of institutions
and so then

12120
03:23:41,750 --> 03:23:41,760
and so then
 

12121
03:23:41,760 --> 03:23:44,150
and so then
emerge the kind of natural criticism you

12122
03:23:44,150 --> 03:23:44,160
emerge the kind of natural criticism you
 

12123
03:23:44,160 --> 03:23:46,070
emerge the kind of natural criticism you
might have with governments that

12124
03:23:46,070 --> 03:23:46,080
might have with governments that
 

12125
03:23:46,080 --> 03:23:48,710
might have with governments that
can sometimes use these for ill use them

12126
03:23:48,710 --> 03:23:48,720
can sometimes use these for ill use them
 

12127
03:23:48,720 --> 03:23:51,910
can sometimes use these for ill use them
as uh weapons of war not weapon not

12128
03:23:51,910 --> 03:23:51,920
as uh weapons of war not weapon not
 

12129
03:23:51,920 --> 03:23:54,710
as uh weapons of war not weapon not
uh tools of uh betterment

12130
03:23:54,710 --> 03:23:54,720
uh tools of uh betterment
 

12131
03:23:54,720 --> 03:23:56,469
uh tools of uh betterment
so um

12132
03:23:56,469 --> 03:23:56,479
so um
 

12133
03:23:56,479 --> 03:23:59,030
so um
and sometimes not just war against other

12134
03:23:59,030 --> 03:23:59,040
and sometimes not just war against other
 

12135
03:23:59,040 --> 03:24:01,429
and sometimes not just war against other
nations but war against its own people

12136
03:24:01,429 --> 03:24:01,439
nations but war against its own people
 

12137
03:24:01,439 --> 03:24:04,309
nations but war against its own people
as it has been done throughout history

12138
03:24:04,309 --> 03:24:04,319
as it has been done throughout history
 

12139
03:24:04,319 --> 03:24:05,670
as it has been done throughout history
well i'm thinking so there's another way

12140
03:24:05,670 --> 03:24:05,680
well i'm thinking so there's another way
 

12141
03:24:05,680 --> 03:24:08,150
well i'm thinking so there's another way
of doing a decentralized peer-to-peer

12142
03:24:08,150 --> 03:24:08,160
of doing a decentralized peer-to-peer
 

12143
03:24:08,160 --> 03:24:09,190
of doing a decentralized peer-to-peer
version

12144
03:24:09,190 --> 03:24:09,200
version
 

12145
03:24:09,200 --> 03:24:10,150
version
where

12146
03:24:10,150 --> 03:24:10,160
where
 

12147
03:24:10,160 --> 03:24:11,510
where
and what you have to do i'm not saying

12148
03:24:11,510 --> 03:24:11,520
and what you have to do i'm not saying
 

12149
03:24:11,520 --> 03:24:13,190
and what you have to do i'm not saying
you should adopt a blockchain but there

12150
03:24:13,190 --> 03:24:13,200
you should adopt a blockchain but there
 

12151
03:24:13,200 --> 03:24:15,030
you should adopt a blockchain but there
is a way of maybe taking kdl's and put

12152
03:24:15,030 --> 03:24:15,040
is a way of maybe taking kdl's and put
 

12153
03:24:15,040 --> 03:24:17,030
is a way of maybe taking kdl's and put
them on blockchain here's an idea let's

12154
03:24:17,030 --> 03:24:17,040
them on blockchain here's an idea let's
 

12155
03:24:17,040 --> 03:24:18,550
them on blockchain here's an idea let's
just say the way we do in my lab right

12156
03:24:18,550 --> 03:24:18,560
just say the way we do in my lab right
 

12157
03:24:18,560 --> 03:24:20,389
just say the way we do in my lab right
now is we we go to the literature we

12158
03:24:20,389 --> 03:24:20,399
now is we we go to the literature we
 

12159
03:24:20,399 --> 03:24:22,950
now is we we go to the literature we
take a uh a recipe to make a molecule

12160
03:24:22,950 --> 03:24:22,960
take a uh a recipe to make a molecule
 

12161
03:24:22,960 --> 03:24:26,070
take a uh a recipe to make a molecule
convert that to cardio and diligently

12162
03:24:26,070 --> 03:24:26,080
convert that to cardio and diligently
 

12163
03:24:26,080 --> 03:24:28,550
convert that to cardio and diligently
make it in the robot and validate it we

12164
03:24:28,550 --> 03:24:28,560
make it in the robot and validate it we
 

12165
03:24:28,560 --> 03:24:30,710
make it in the robot and validate it we
that so we that i would call mining

12166
03:24:30,710 --> 03:24:30,720
that so we that i would call mining
 

12167
03:24:30,720 --> 03:24:33,030
that so we that i would call mining
proof of work fruit of synthesis

12168
03:24:33,030 --> 03:24:33,040
proof of work fruit of synthesis
 

12169
03:24:33,040 --> 03:24:34,070
proof of work fruit of synthesis
right

12170
03:24:34,070 --> 03:24:34,080
right
 

12171
03:24:34,080 --> 03:24:35,590
right
for the synthesis yeah yeah but this is

12172
03:24:35,590 --> 03:24:35,600
for the synthesis yeah yeah but this is
 

12173
03:24:35,600 --> 03:24:37,830
for the synthesis yeah yeah but this is
cool because suddenly when you do when

12174
03:24:37,830 --> 03:24:37,840
cool because suddenly when you do when
 

12175
03:24:37,840 --> 03:24:39,190
cool because suddenly when you do when
you actually synthesize it you can get

12176
03:24:39,190 --> 03:24:39,200
you actually synthesize it you can get
 

12177
03:24:39,200 --> 03:24:40,630
you actually synthesize it you can get
the analytical data but there's also a

12178
03:24:40,630 --> 03:24:40,640
the analytical data but there's also a
 

12179
03:24:40,640 --> 03:24:42,150
the analytical data but there's also a
fingerprint in there of the impurities

12180
03:24:42,150 --> 03:24:42,160
fingerprint in there of the impurities
 

12181
03:24:42,160 --> 03:24:43,830
fingerprint in there of the impurities
that get carried across because you can

12182
03:24:43,830 --> 03:24:43,840
that get carried across because you can
 

12183
03:24:43,840 --> 03:24:46,550
that get carried across because you can
never make one something 100 pure that

12184
03:24:46,550 --> 03:24:46,560
never make one something 100 pure that
 

12185
03:24:46,560 --> 03:24:48,309
never make one something 100 pure that
fingerprint will allow you to secure

12186
03:24:48,309 --> 03:24:48,319
fingerprint will allow you to secure
 

12187
03:24:48,319 --> 03:24:50,550
fingerprint will allow you to secure
your kdl so what you do is encrypt those

12188
03:24:50,550 --> 03:24:50,560
your kdl so what you do is encrypt those
 

12189
03:24:50,560 --> 03:24:52,229
your kdl so what you do is encrypt those
two things so suddenly you can have

12190
03:24:52,229 --> 03:24:52,239
two things so suddenly you can have
 

12191
03:24:52,239 --> 03:24:54,389
two things so suddenly you can have
people out there mining and what you

12192
03:24:54,389 --> 03:24:54,399
people out there mining and what you
 

12193
03:24:54,399 --> 03:24:56,150
people out there mining and what you
could do perhaps

12194
03:24:56,150 --> 03:24:56,160
could do perhaps
 

12195
03:24:56,160 --> 03:24:58,550
could do perhaps
is do the type of thing we need to

12196
03:24:58,550 --> 03:24:58,560
is do the type of thing we need to
 

12197
03:24:58,560 --> 03:25:01,110
is do the type of thing we need to
basically look at the way that contact

12198
03:25:01,110 --> 03:25:01,120
basically look at the way that contact
 

12199
03:25:01,120 --> 03:25:03,030
basically look at the way that contact
tracing should have been done in covid

12200
03:25:03,030 --> 03:25:03,040
tracing should have been done in covid
 

12201
03:25:03,040 --> 03:25:05,349
tracing should have been done in covid
where people are given the information

12202
03:25:05,349 --> 03:25:05,359
where people are given the information
 

12203
03:25:05,359 --> 03:25:06,870
where people are given the information
so you've just been in contact with

12204
03:25:06,870 --> 03:25:06,880
so you've just been in contact with
 

12205
03:25:06,880 --> 03:25:09,429
so you've just been in contact with
someone covered you choose i'm not

12206
03:25:09,429 --> 03:25:09,439
someone covered you choose i'm not
 

12207
03:25:09,439 --> 03:25:11,349
someone covered you choose i'm not
telling you to stay at home you choose

12208
03:25:11,349 --> 03:25:11,359
telling you to stay at home you choose
 

12209
03:25:11,359 --> 03:25:13,510
telling you to stay at home you choose
right so now if we could imagine a

12210
03:25:13,510 --> 03:25:13,520
right so now if we could imagine a
 

12211
03:25:13,520 --> 03:25:15,750
right so now if we could imagine a
similar thing like you know you have got

12212
03:25:15,750 --> 03:25:15,760
similar thing like you know you have got
 

12213
03:25:15,760 --> 03:25:17,750
similar thing like you know you have got
access to these chemicals they will have

12214
03:25:17,750 --> 03:25:17,760
access to these chemicals they will have
 

12215
03:25:17,760 --> 03:25:20,710
access to these chemicals they will have
these effects you choose and publicize

12216
03:25:20,710 --> 03:25:20,720
these effects you choose and publicize
 

12217
03:25:20,720 --> 03:25:22,309
these effects you choose and publicize
it or maybe it's out somewhere i don't

12218
03:25:22,309 --> 03:25:22,319
it or maybe it's out somewhere i don't
 

12219
03:25:22,319 --> 03:25:25,269
it or maybe it's out somewhere i don't
know i'm not a policy maker on this and

12220
03:25:25,269 --> 03:25:25,279
know i'm not a policy maker on this and
 

12221
03:25:25,279 --> 03:25:28,070
know i'm not a policy maker on this and
what my job here is to not just make the

12222
03:25:28,070 --> 03:25:28,080
what my job here is to not just make the
 

12223
03:25:28,080 --> 03:25:30,150
what my job here is to not just make the
technology possible but to have it as

12224
03:25:30,150 --> 03:25:30,160
technology possible but to have it as
 

12225
03:25:30,160 --> 03:25:31,910
technology possible but to have it as
open as a discussion as possible with

12226
03:25:31,910 --> 03:25:31,920
open as a discussion as possible with
 

12227
03:25:31,920 --> 03:25:34,229
open as a discussion as possible with
people to say hey can we stop childhood

12228
03:25:34,229 --> 03:25:34,239
people to say hey can we stop childhood
 

12229
03:25:34,239 --> 03:25:37,030
people to say hey can we stop childhood
mortality of this technology and to

12230
03:25:37,030 --> 03:25:37,040
mortality of this technology and to
 

12231
03:25:37,040 --> 03:25:38,950
mortality of this technology and to
those benefits outweigh

12232
03:25:38,950 --> 03:25:38,960
those benefits outweigh
 

12233
03:25:38,960 --> 03:25:41,269
those benefits outweigh
the one-off where people might use it

12234
03:25:41,269 --> 03:25:41,279
the one-off where people might use it
 

12235
03:25:41,279 --> 03:25:43,830
the one-off where people might use it
for terrorism or people might use it for

12236
03:25:43,830 --> 03:25:43,840
for terrorism or people might use it for
 

12237
03:25:43,840 --> 03:25:46,389
for terrorism or people might use it for
recreational drugs chemify which is the

12238
03:25:46,389 --> 03:25:46,399
recreational drugs chemify which is the
 

12239
03:25:46,399 --> 03:25:48,389
recreational drugs chemify which is the
name of the entity will make this happen

12240
03:25:48,389 --> 03:25:48,399
name of the entity will make this happen
 

12241
03:25:48,399 --> 03:25:50,070
name of the entity will make this happen
i think we have we have some social

12242
03:25:50,070 --> 03:25:50,080
i think we have we have some social
 

12243
03:25:50,080 --> 03:25:51,830
i think we have we have some social
responsibilities as an entity to make

12244
03:25:51,830 --> 03:25:51,840
responsibilities as an entity to make
 

12245
03:25:51,840 --> 03:25:53,349
responsibilities as an entity to make
sure that we're not enabling people to

12246
03:25:53,349 --> 03:25:53,359
sure that we're not enabling people to
 

12247
03:25:53,359 --> 03:25:54,550
sure that we're not enabling people to
manufacture

12248
03:25:54,550 --> 03:25:54,560
manufacture
 

12249
03:25:54,560 --> 03:25:56,870
manufacture
personal drugs weapons at will and what

12250
03:25:56,870 --> 03:25:56,880
personal drugs weapons at will and what
 

12251
03:25:56,880 --> 03:25:58,229
personal drugs weapons at will and what
we have to do is have a discussion with

12252
03:25:58,229 --> 03:25:58,239
we have to do is have a discussion with
 

12253
03:25:58,239 --> 03:25:59,510
we have to do is have a discussion with
society

12254
03:25:59,510 --> 03:25:59,520
society
 

12255
03:25:59,520 --> 03:26:01,269
society
with the people invest in this with

12256
03:26:01,269 --> 03:26:01,279
with the people invest in this with
 

12257
03:26:01,279 --> 03:26:03,510
with the people invest in this with
people that are going to pay for this

12258
03:26:03,510 --> 03:26:03,520
people that are going to pay for this
 

12259
03:26:03,520 --> 03:26:05,590
people that are going to pay for this
to say well do you want to live longer

12260
03:26:05,590 --> 03:26:05,600
to say well do you want to live longer
 

12261
03:26:05,600 --> 03:26:07,349
to say well do you want to live longer
and you want to be healthier

12262
03:26:07,349 --> 03:26:07,359
and you want to be healthier
 

12263
03:26:07,359 --> 03:26:08,870
and you want to be healthier
and are you willing to accept some of

12264
03:26:08,870 --> 03:26:08,880
and are you willing to accept some of
 

12265
03:26:08,880 --> 03:26:10,309
and are you willing to accept some of
the risks and i think that's a

12266
03:26:10,309 --> 03:26:10,319
the risks and i think that's a
 

12267
03:26:10,319 --> 03:26:12,389
the risks and i think that's a
discussion to have so by the way when

12268
03:26:12,389 --> 03:26:12,399
discussion to have so by the way when
 

12269
03:26:12,399 --> 03:26:14,469
discussion to have so by the way when
you say personal drugs

12270
03:26:14,469 --> 03:26:14,479

distribution got it but you mentioned
 

12321
03:27:06,319 --> 03:27:08,710
distribution got it but you mentioned
recreational drugs and and the reason i

discussion sure um not sure but i know
 

12349
03:27:35,600 --> 03:27:37,590
discussion sure um not sure but i know
i'm so let me be the one that says like

12350
03:27:37,590 --> 03:27:37,600
i'm so let me be the one that says like
 

12351
03:27:37,600 --> 03:27:40,150
i'm so let me be the one that says like
there's nothing because you have said

12352
03:27:40,150 --> 03:27:40,160
there's nothing because you have said
 

12353
03:27:40,160 --> 03:27:42,870
there's nothing because you have said
recreational drugs and like terrorism in

12354
03:27:42,870 --> 03:27:42,880
recreational drugs and like terrorism in
 

12355
03:27:42,880 --> 03:27:44,950
recreational drugs and like terrorism in
the same sentence yeah yeah i think okay

12356
03:27:44,950 --> 03:27:44,960
the same sentence yeah yeah i think okay
 

12357
03:27:44,960 --> 03:27:47,590
the same sentence yeah yeah i think okay
i think let's make sure we draw a line

12358
03:27:47,590 --> 03:27:47,600
i think let's make sure we draw a line
 

12359
03:27:47,600 --> 03:27:48,790
i think let's make sure we draw a line
uh that there's

12360
03:27:48,790 --> 03:27:48,800
uh that there's
 

12361
03:27:48,800 --> 03:27:51,670
uh that there's
real dangers to the world of terrorists

12362
03:27:51,670 --> 03:27:51,680
real dangers to the world of terrorists
 

12363
03:27:51,680 --> 03:27:54,550
real dangers to the world of terrorists
of bio warfare and then there's a little

12364
03:27:54,550 --> 03:27:54,560
of bio warfare and then there's a little
 

12365
03:27:54,560 --> 03:27:56,550
of bio warfare and then there's a little
bit of weed so

12366
03:27:56,550 --> 03:27:56,560
bit of weed so
 

12367
03:27:56,560 --> 03:27:59,030
bit of weed so
i have i mean i i think it's up to the

12368
03:27:59,030 --> 03:27:59,040
i have i mean i i think it's up to the
 

12369
03:27:59,040 --> 03:28:02,309
i have i mean i i think it's up to the
society to yes to tell is governments

12370
03:28:02,309 --> 03:28:02,319
society to yes to tell is governments
 

12371
03:28:02,319 --> 03:28:04,550
society to yes to tell is governments
what it wants what's acceptable right

12372
03:28:04,550 --> 03:28:04,560
what it wants what's acceptable right
 

12373
03:28:04,560 --> 03:28:07,670
what it wants what's acceptable right
and if it becomes let's say that thcs

12374
03:28:07,670 --> 03:28:07,680
and if it becomes let's say that thcs
 

12375
03:28:07,680 --> 03:28:08,710
and if it becomes let's say that thcs
become

12376
03:28:08,710 --> 03:28:08,720
become
 

12377
03:28:08,720 --> 03:28:11,750
become
you know heavily acceptable and that you

12378
03:28:11,750 --> 03:28:11,760
you know heavily acceptable and that you
 

12379
03:28:11,760 --> 03:28:14,150
you know heavily acceptable and that you
can modify them so let's say there's

12380
03:28:14,150 --> 03:28:14,160
can modify them so let's say there's
 

12381
03:28:14,160 --> 03:28:15,750
can modify them so let's say there's
let's say it's like blood type there's a

12382
03:28:15,750 --> 03:28:15,760
let's say it's like blood type there's a
 

12383
03:28:15,760 --> 03:28:18,469
let's say it's like blood type there's a
particular type of thc that you that you

12384
03:28:18,469 --> 03:28:18,479
particular type of thc that you that you
 

12385
03:28:18,479 --> 03:28:20,150
particular type of thc that you that you
tolerate better than i do

12386
03:28:20,150 --> 03:28:20,160
tolerate better than i do
 

12387
03:28:20,160 --> 03:28:21,910
tolerate better than i do
then why not why not have a machine that

12388
03:28:21,910 --> 03:28:21,920
then why not why not have a machine that
 

12389
03:28:21,920 --> 03:28:23,910
then why not why not have a machine that
makes the one you like yeah and then and

12390
03:28:23,910 --> 03:28:23,920
makes the one you like yeah and then and
 

12391
03:28:23,920 --> 03:28:27,349
makes the one you like yeah and then and
why not the perfect brownie okay and i i

12392
03:28:27,349 --> 03:28:27,359
why not the perfect brownie okay and i i
 

12393
03:28:27,359 --> 03:28:29,429
why not the perfect brownie okay and i i
think that that's fine um

12394
03:28:29,429 --> 03:28:29,439
think that that's fine um
 

12395
03:28:29,439 --> 03:28:31,670
think that that's fine um
but i'm you know i we're so far away

12396
03:28:31,670 --> 03:28:31,680
but i'm you know i we're so far away
 

12397
03:28:31,680 --> 03:28:33,349
but i'm you know i we're so far away
from that i can barely get the thing to

12398
03:28:33,349 --> 03:28:33,359
from that i can barely get the thing to
 

12399
03:28:33,359 --> 03:28:34,950
from that i can barely get the thing to
work in the lab right i mean it's

12400
03:28:34,950 --> 03:28:34,960
work in the lab right i mean it's
 

12401
03:28:34,960 --> 03:28:37,269
work in the lab right i mean it's
reliability and all this other stuff but

12402
03:28:37,269 --> 03:28:37,279
reliability and all this other stuff but
 

12403
03:28:37,279 --> 03:28:38,469
reliability and all this other stuff but
what i think is going to happen in the

12404
03:28:38,469 --> 03:28:38,479
what i think is going to happen in the
 

12405
03:28:38,479 --> 03:28:41,349
what i think is going to happen in the
short term it's going to turbo charge

12406
03:28:41,349 --> 03:28:41,359
short term it's going to turbo charge
 

12407
03:28:41,359 --> 03:28:44,309
short term it's going to turbo charge
molecular discovery reliability and that

12408
03:28:44,309 --> 03:28:44,319
molecular discovery reliability and that
 

12409
03:28:44,319 --> 03:28:45,910
molecular discovery reliability and that
will change the world that's super

12410
03:28:45,910 --> 03:28:45,920
will change the world that's super
 

12411
03:28:45,920 --> 03:28:46,870
will change the world that's super
exciting

12412

how hard is this problem

12426
03:29:01,030 --> 03:29:01,040
how hard is this problem
 

12427
03:29:01,040 --> 03:29:03,190
how hard is this problem
and as we continue down this thread of

12428
03:29:03,190 --> 03:29:03,200
and as we continue down this thread of
 

12429
03:29:03,200 --> 03:29:04,790
and as we continue down this thread of
the positives

12430
03:29:04,790 --> 03:29:04,800
the positives
 

12431
03:29:04,800 --> 03:29:06,710
the positives
and the worrisome

12432
03:29:06,710 --> 03:29:06,720
and the worrisome
 

12433
03:29:06,720 --> 03:29:08,469
and the worrisome
what are the things we should be excited

12434
03:29:08,469 --> 03:29:08,479
what are the things we should be excited
 

12435
03:29:08,479 --> 03:29:09,590
what are the things we should be excited
about

12436
03:29:09,590 --> 03:29:09,600
about
 

12437
03:29:09,600 --> 03:29:11,190
about
and what are the things we should be

12438
03:29:11,190 --> 03:29:11,200
and what are the things we should be
 

12439
03:29:11,200 --> 03:29:13,349
and what are the things we should be
terrified about and how do we minimize

12440
03:29:13,349 --> 03:29:13,359
terrified about and how do we minimize
 

12441
03:29:13,359 --> 03:29:15,030
terrified about and how do we minimize
the chance of the

12442
03:29:15,030 --> 03:29:15,040
the chance of the
 

12443
03:29:15,040 --> 03:29:17,990
the chance of the
of the uh terrifying consequences

12444
03:29:17,990 --> 03:29:18,000
of the uh terrifying consequences
 

12445
03:29:18,000 --> 03:29:20,469
of the uh terrifying consequences
so in this robot the robot does all the

12446
03:29:20,469 --> 03:29:20,479
so in this robot the robot does all the
 

12447
03:29:20,479 --> 03:29:23,190
so in this robot the robot does all the
heavy lifting so the robot basically

12448
03:29:23,190 --> 03:29:23,200
heavy lifting so the robot basically
 

12449
03:29:23,200 --> 03:29:25,349
heavy lifting so the robot basically
is an embodied ai i really

12450
03:29:25,349 --> 03:29:25,359
is an embodied ai i really
 

12451
03:29:25,359 --> 03:29:28,389
is an embodied ai i really
i really like ai in in in a domain

12452
03:29:28,389 --> 03:29:28,399
i really like ai in in in a domain
 

12453
03:29:28,399 --> 03:29:30,630
i really like ai in in in a domain
specific way one that actually should

12454
03:29:30,630 --> 03:29:30,640
specific way one that actually should
 

12455
03:29:30,640 --> 03:29:32,389
specific way one that actually should
say at this point there was an attempt

12456
03:29:32,389 --> 03:29:32,399
say at this point there was an attempt
 

12457
03:29:32,399 --> 03:29:36,389
say at this point there was an attempt
in the 60s uh joshua ludenberg and some

12458
03:29:36,389 --> 03:29:36,399
in the 60s uh joshua ludenberg and some
 

12459
03:29:36,399 --> 03:29:37,750
in the 60s uh joshua ludenberg and some
really important people did this that

12460
03:29:37,750 --> 03:29:37,760
really important people did this that
 

12461
03:29:37,760 --> 03:29:39,030
really important people did this that
made an ai

12462
03:29:39,030 --> 03:29:39,040
made an ai
 

12463
03:29:39,040 --> 03:29:41,349
made an ai
to try and guess if organic molecules in

12464
03:29:41,349 --> 03:29:41,359
to try and guess if organic molecules in
 

12465
03:29:41,359 --> 03:29:43,590
to try and guess if organic molecules in
a mass spectrometer were alien or not

12466
03:29:43,590 --> 03:29:43,600
a mass spectrometer were alien or not
 

12467
03:29:43,600 --> 03:29:44,550
a mass spectrometer were alien or not
yes

12468
03:29:44,550 --> 03:29:44,560
yes
 

12469
03:29:44,560 --> 03:29:45,670
yes
and they did they failed because they

12470
03:29:45,670 --> 03:29:45,680
and they did they failed because they
 

12471
03:29:45,680 --> 03:29:48,229
and they did they failed because they
didn't have assembly theory

12472
03:29:48,229 --> 03:29:48,239
didn't have assembly theory
 

12473
03:29:48,239 --> 03:29:50,229
didn't have assembly theory
i think and when i and i and wait what

12474
03:29:50,229 --> 03:29:50,239
i think and when i and i and wait what
 

12475
03:29:50,239 --> 03:29:51,990
i think and when i and i and wait what
does assembly theory give you about

12476
03:29:51,990 --> 03:29:52,000
does assembly theory give you about
 

12477
03:29:52,000 --> 03:29:54,070
does assembly theory give you about
alien versus human life well no it just

12478
03:29:54,070 --> 03:29:54,080
alien versus human life well no it just
 

12479
03:29:54,080 --> 03:29:55,590
alien versus human life well no it just
they it tells you about unknown the

12480
03:29:55,590 --> 03:29:55,600
they it tells you about unknown the
 

12481
03:29:55,600 --> 03:29:57,110
they it tells you about unknown the
degree of unknowns you can fingerprint

12482
03:29:57,110 --> 03:29:57,120
degree of unknowns you can fingerprint
 

12483
03:29:57,120 --> 03:29:58,870
degree of unknowns you can fingerprint
stuff they weren't looking at um they

12484
03:29:58,870 --> 03:29:58,880
stuff they weren't looking at um they
 

12485
03:29:58,880 --> 03:30:00,550
stuff they weren't looking at um they
were trying to basically just look at

12486
03:30:00,550 --> 03:30:00,560
were trying to basically just look at
 

12487
03:30:00,560 --> 03:30:02,790
were trying to basically just look at
the corpus of or complex organic

12488
03:30:02,790 --> 03:30:02,800
the corpus of or complex organic
 

12489
03:30:02,800 --> 03:30:03,910
the corpus of or complex organic
molecules

12490
03:30:03,910 --> 03:30:03,920
molecules
 

12491
03:30:03,920 --> 03:30:05,429
molecules
so i when i was a bit down about

12492
03:30:05,429 --> 03:30:05,439
so i when i was a bit down about
 

12493
03:30:05,439 --> 03:30:06,710
so i when i was a bit down about
assembly theory because i couldn't

12494
03:30:06,710 --> 03:30:06,720
assembly theory because i couldn't
 

12495
03:30:06,720 --> 03:30:08,710
assembly theory because i couldn't
couldn't convince referees and couldn't

12496
03:30:08,710 --> 03:30:08,720
couldn't convince referees and couldn't
 

12497
03:30:08,720 --> 03:30:10,469
couldn't convince referees and couldn't
convince computational

12498
03:30:10,469 --> 03:30:10,479
convince computational
 

12499
03:30:10,479 --> 03:30:11,510
convince computational
um

12500
03:30:11,510 --> 03:30:11,520
um
 

12501
03:30:11,520 --> 03:30:13,269
um
people interested in computational

12502
03:30:13,269 --> 03:30:13,279
people interested in computational
 

12503
03:30:13,279 --> 03:30:15,670
people interested in computational
complexity i was really quite depressed

12504
03:30:15,670 --> 03:30:15,680
complexity i was really quite depressed
 

12505
03:30:15,680 --> 03:30:17,750
complexity i was really quite depressed
about it and i mean i've been working

12506
03:30:17,750 --> 03:30:17,760
about it and i mean i've been working
 

12507
03:30:17,760 --> 03:30:19,910
about it and i mean i've been working
with with sarah walker's team

12508
03:30:19,910 --> 03:30:19,920
with with sarah walker's team
 

12509
03:30:19,920 --> 03:30:21,830
with with sarah walker's team
and i think she you know i think she

12510
03:30:21,830 --> 03:30:21,840
and i think she you know i think she
 

12511
03:30:21,840 --> 03:30:23,349
and i think she you know i think she
also invented an assembly theory in some

12512
03:30:23,349 --> 03:30:23,359
also invented an assembly theory in some
 

12513
03:30:23,359 --> 03:30:25,030
also invented an assembly theory in some
way we talk about it later

12514
03:30:25,030 --> 03:30:25,040
way we talk about it later
 

12515
03:30:25,040 --> 03:30:28,950
way we talk about it later
when i found the ai not working for

12516
03:30:28,950 --> 03:30:28,960
when i found the ai not working for
 

12517
03:30:28,960 --> 03:30:30,870
when i found the ai not working for
the dendral project

12518
03:30:30,870 --> 03:30:30,880
the dendral project
 

12519
03:30:30,880 --> 03:30:33,590
the dendral project
i suddenly realized i wasn't it totally

12520
03:30:33,590 --> 03:30:33,600
i suddenly realized i wasn't it totally
 

12521
03:30:33,600 --> 03:30:34,550
i suddenly realized i wasn't it totally
insane

12522
03:30:34,550 --> 03:30:34,560
insane
 

12523
03:30:34,560 --> 03:30:36,469
insane
coming back to this nano

12524
03:30:36,469 --> 03:30:36,479
coming back to this nano
 

12525
03:30:36,479 --> 03:30:38,710
coming back to this nano
robot so what it does it's a basically a

12526
03:30:38,710 --> 03:30:38,720
robot so what it does it's a basically a
 

12527
03:30:38,720 --> 03:30:41,110
robot so what it does it's a basically a
like a computer but now what it does is

12528
03:30:41,110 --> 03:30:41,120
like a computer but now what it does is
 

12529
03:30:41,120 --> 03:30:42,309
like a computer but now what it does is
it squirts

12530
03:30:42,309 --> 03:30:42,319
it squirts
 

12531
03:30:42,319 --> 03:30:44,389
it squirts
a liquid with gold in it in the test

12532
03:30:44,389 --> 03:30:44,399
a liquid with gold in it in the test
 

12533
03:30:44,399 --> 03:30:45,269
a liquid with gold in it in the test
tube

12534
03:30:45,269 --> 03:30:45,279
tube
 

12535
03:30:45,279 --> 03:30:46,710
tube
and it adds

12536
03:30:46,710 --> 03:30:46,720
and it adds
 

12537
03:30:46,720 --> 03:30:48,389
and it adds
um some

12538
03:30:48,389 --> 03:30:48,399
um some
 

12539
03:30:48,399 --> 03:30:49,750
um some
uh reducing agents there's some

12540
03:30:49,750 --> 03:30:49,760
uh reducing agents there's some
 

12541
03:30:49,760 --> 03:30:51,990
uh reducing agents there's some
electrons to make the gold turn into a

12542
03:30:51,990 --> 03:30:52,000
electrons to make the gold turn into a
 

12543
03:30:52,000 --> 03:30:54,070
electrons to make the gold turn into a
nanoparticle now when gold becomes a

12544
03:30:54,070 --> 03:30:54,080
nanoparticle now when gold becomes a
 

12545
03:30:54,080 --> 03:30:55,510
nanoparticle now when gold becomes a
nanoparticle it gets a characteristic

12546
03:30:55,510 --> 03:30:55,520
nanoparticle it gets a characteristic
 

12547
03:30:55,520 --> 03:30:57,510
nanoparticle it gets a characteristic
color a plasmon so it's a bit like if

12548
03:30:57,510 --> 03:30:57,520
color a plasmon so it's a bit like if
 

12549
03:30:57,520 --> 03:30:59,510
color a plasmon so it's a bit like if
you look at the sheen on a gold wedding

12550
03:30:59,510 --> 03:30:59,520
you look at the sheen on a gold wedding
 

12551
03:30:59,520 --> 03:31:01,590
you look at the sheen on a gold wedding
ring or a gold bar or something those

12552
03:31:01,590 --> 03:31:01,600
ring or a gold bar or something those
 

12553
03:31:01,600 --> 03:31:02,950
ring or a gold bar or something those
those are the ways that conducting

12554
03:31:02,950 --> 03:31:02,960
those are the ways that conducting
 

12555
03:31:02,960 --> 03:31:05,670
those are the ways that conducting
electrons basically reflect light

12556
03:31:05,670 --> 03:31:05,680
electrons basically reflect light
 

12557
03:31:05,680 --> 03:31:08,070
electrons basically reflect light
what we did is we randomly squirt the

12558
03:31:08,070 --> 03:31:08,080
what we did is we randomly squirt the
 

12559
03:31:08,080 --> 03:31:09,990
what we did is we randomly squirt the
gold the gold particle and the reducing

12560
03:31:09,990 --> 03:31:10,000
gold the gold particle and the reducing
 

12561
03:31:10,000 --> 03:31:11,910
gold the gold particle and the reducing
agent in and we measure the uv we

12562
03:31:11,910 --> 03:31:11,920
agent in and we measure the uv we
 

12563
03:31:11,920 --> 03:31:13,349
agent in and we measure the uv we
measure the color

12564
03:31:13,349 --> 03:31:13,359
measure the color
 

12565
03:31:13,359 --> 03:31:15,590
measure the color
and so what we do is we've got the robot

12566
03:31:15,590 --> 03:31:15,600
and so what we do is we've got the robot
 

12567
03:31:15,600 --> 03:31:18,710
and so what we do is we've got the robot
has a mind so it has a mind where

12568
03:31:18,710 --> 03:31:18,720
has a mind so it has a mind where
 

12569
03:31:18,720 --> 03:31:20,229
has a mind so it has a mind where
in a simulation

12570
03:31:20,229 --> 03:31:20,239
in a simulation
 

12571
03:31:20,239 --> 03:31:22,950
in a simulation
it randomly generates nanoparticles and

12572
03:31:22,950 --> 03:31:22,960
it randomly generates nanoparticles and
 

12573
03:31:22,960 --> 03:31:24,630
it randomly generates nanoparticles and
the plasmon the color that comes out

12574
03:31:24,630 --> 03:31:24,640
the plasmon the color that comes out
 

12575
03:31:24,640 --> 03:31:27,190
the plasmon the color that comes out
randomly generally imagines in its head

12576
03:31:27,190 --> 03:31:27,200
randomly generally imagines in its head
 

12577
03:31:27,200 --> 03:31:28,550
randomly generally imagines in its head
it then or the other so that's the

12578
03:31:28,550 --> 03:31:28,560
it then or the other so that's the
 

12579
03:31:28,560 --> 03:31:29,830
it then or the other so that's the
imaginary side of the robot in the

12580
03:31:29,830 --> 03:31:29,840
imaginary side of the robot in the
 

12581
03:31:29,840 --> 03:31:31,910
imaginary side of the robot in the
physical side of the robot it squirts in

12582
03:31:31,910 --> 03:31:31,920
physical side of the robot it squirts in
 

12583
03:31:31,920 --> 03:31:34,630
physical side of the robot it squirts in
the chemicals and looks at the color and

12584
03:31:34,630 --> 03:31:34,640
the chemicals and looks at the color and
 

12585
03:31:34,640 --> 03:31:37,030
the chemicals and looks at the color and
it uses a genetic algorithm and a map

12586
03:31:37,030 --> 03:31:37,040
it uses a genetic algorithm and a map
 

12587
03:31:37,040 --> 03:31:39,429
it uses a genetic algorithm and a map
elite actually on it and it goes around

12588
03:31:39,429 --> 03:31:39,439
elite actually on it and it goes around
 

12589
03:31:39,439 --> 03:31:42,150
elite actually on it and it goes around
in cycles and refines

12590
03:31:42,150 --> 03:31:42,160
in cycles and refines
 

12591
03:31:42,160 --> 03:31:43,110
in cycles and refines
um

12592
03:31:43,110 --> 03:31:43,120
um
 

12593
03:31:43,120 --> 03:31:45,190
um
the color to the objective

12594
03:31:45,190 --> 03:31:45,200
the color to the objective
 

12595
03:31:45,200 --> 03:31:46,870
the color to the objective
now we use two different points we have

12596
03:31:46,870 --> 03:31:46,880
now we use two different points we have
 

12597
03:31:46,880 --> 03:31:48,469
now we use two different points we have
an exploration

12598
03:31:48,469 --> 03:31:48,479
an exploration
 

12599
03:31:48,479 --> 03:31:50,550
an exploration
and an optimization they're two

12600
03:31:50,550 --> 03:31:50,560
and an optimization they're two
 

12601
03:31:50,560 --> 03:31:52,550
and an optimization they're two
different so the exploration just says

12602
03:31:52,550 --> 03:31:52,560
different so the exploration just says
 

12603
03:31:52,560 --> 03:31:54,950
different so the exploration just says
just do random stuff and see how many

12604
03:31:54,950 --> 03:31:54,960
just do random stuff and see how many
 

12605
03:31:54,960 --> 03:31:56,070
just do random stuff and see how many
different things you can get and when

12606
03:31:56,070 --> 03:31:56,080
different things you can get and when
 

12607
03:31:56,080 --> 03:31:57,670
different things you can get and when
you get different things try and

12608
03:31:57,670 --> 03:31:57,680
you get different things try and
 

12609
03:31:57,680 --> 03:31:59,030
you get different things try and
optimize and make the peak sharper

12610
03:31:59,030 --> 03:31:59,040
optimize and make the peak sharper
 

12611
03:31:59,040 --> 03:32:00,550
optimize and make the peak sharper
sharper sharper

12612
03:32:00,550 --> 03:32:00,560
sharper sharper
 

12613
03:32:00,560 --> 03:32:02,550
sharper sharper
and what it does after a number of

12614
03:32:02,550 --> 03:32:02,560
and what it does after a number of
 

12615
03:32:02,560 --> 03:32:05,190
and what it does after a number of
cycles is it physically takes a sample

12616
03:32:05,190 --> 03:32:05,200
cycles is it physically takes a sample
 

12617
03:32:05,200 --> 03:32:07,750
cycles is it physically takes a sample
of the optimized nano material

12618
03:32:07,750 --> 03:32:07,760
of the optimized nano material
 

12619
03:32:07,760 --> 03:32:10,070
of the optimized nano material
resets all the round bottom flasks

12620
03:32:10,070 --> 03:32:10,080
resets all the round bottom flasks
 

12621
03:32:10,080 --> 03:32:12,630
resets all the round bottom flasks
cleans them and puts the seed physical

12622
03:32:12,630 --> 03:32:12,640
cleans them and puts the seed physical
 

12623
03:32:12,640 --> 03:32:14,389
cleans them and puts the seed physical
seed back in

03:32:14,399 --> 03:32:16,389
seed back in
and what this robot is able to do is is

12626
03:32:16,389 --> 03:32:16,399
and what this robot is able to do is is
 

12627
03:32:16,399 --> 03:32:19,190
and what this robot is able to do is is
search a space of 10 to the 23 possible

12628
03:32:19,190 --> 03:32:19,200
search a space of 10 to the 23 possible

and it makes five generations of
 

12637
03:32:25,600 --> 03:32:27,670
and it makes five generations of
nanoparticles which get nicer and nicer

12638
03:32:27,670 --> 03:32:27,680
nanoparticles which get nicer and nicer

03:32:28,950 --> 03:32:28,960
in terms of shape and color and
 

12641
03:32:28,960 --> 03:32:30,870
in terms of shape and color and
definition and then at the end it

12642
03:32:30,870 --> 03:32:30,880
definition and then at the end it
 

12643
03:32:30,880 --> 03:32:32,870
definition and then at the end it
outputs like ideal code

12644
03:32:32,870 --> 03:32:32,880
outputs like ideal code
 

12645
03:32:32,880 --> 03:32:35,110
outputs like ideal code
that could then be wow just doing the

12646
03:32:35,110 --> 03:32:35,120
that could then be wow just doing the
 

12647
03:32:35,120 --> 03:32:36,790
that could then be wow just doing the

for programs in the physical space yeah

12650
03:32:39,590 --> 03:32:39,600
for programs in the physical space yeah
 

12651
03:32:39,600 --> 03:32:41,590
for programs in the physical space yeah
so it's doing a kind of reinforcement

12652
03:32:41,590 --> 03:32:41,600
so it's doing a kind of reinforcement
 

12653
03:32:41,600 --> 03:32:42,469
so it's doing a kind of reinforcement
learning

03:32:44,389 --> 03:32:44,399
yeah yeah in the physical space with the
 

12657
03:32:44,399 --> 03:32:46,630
yeah yeah in the physical space with the
exploration and the optimization and

12658
03:32:46,630 --> 03:32:46,640
exploration and the optimization and
 

12659
03:32:46,640 --> 03:32:48,790

that cardio will work on any computer or
 

12661
03:32:48,800 --> 03:32:51,429
that cardio will work on any computer or
any qualified hub now that's it that's

03:32:51,429 --> 03:32:51,439
any qualified hub now that's it that's
 

12663
03:32:51,439 --> 03:32:53,190
any qualified hub now that's it that's
now that's a general piece of code that

12664
03:32:53,190 --> 03:32:53,200
now that's a general piece of code that
 

12665
03:32:53,200 --> 03:32:54,710
now that's a general piece of code that
can

12666
03:32:54,710 --> 03:32:54,720
can

what it created that's amazing that's

12670
03:32:59,830 --> 03:32:59,840
what it created that's amazing that's
 

12671
03:32:59,840 --> 03:33:01,190
what it created that's amazing that's
incredible but the nanoparticles

12672
03:33:01,190 --> 03:33:01,200
incredible but the nanoparticles
 

12673
03:33:01,200 --> 03:33:02,870
incredible but the nanoparticles
themselves are dumb the robot has all

12674
03:33:02,870 --> 03:33:02,880
themselves are dumb the robot has all
 

12675
03:33:02,880 --> 03:33:04,950
themselves are dumb the robot has all
the thinking so we don't try and apply

12676
03:33:04,950 --> 03:33:04,960
the thinking so we don't try and apply
 

12677
03:33:04,960 --> 03:33:08,150
the thinking so we don't try and apply
any self-replication or try and get the

12678
03:33:08,150 --> 03:33:08,160
any self-replication or try and get the
 

12679
03:33:08,160 --> 03:33:09,510
any self-replication or try and get the
the particles to make themselves

12680
03:33:09,510 --> 03:33:09,520
the particles to make themselves
 

12681
03:33:09,520 --> 03:33:12,150
the particles to make themselves
although it would be cool to try so well

12682
03:33:12,150 --> 03:33:12,160
although it would be cool to try so well
 

12683
03:33:12,160 --> 03:33:13,830
although it would be cool to try so well
there you go that's that those are

12684
03:33:13,830 --> 03:33:13,840
there you go that's that those are
 

12685
03:33:13,840 --> 03:33:15,510
there you go that's that those are
famous last words for the end of human

12686
03:33:15,510 --> 03:33:15,520
famous last words for the end of human
 

12687
03:33:15,520 --> 03:33:18,309
famous last words for the end of human
civilization would be cool to try so is

12688
03:33:18,309 --> 03:33:18,319
civilization would be cool to try so is
 

12689
03:33:18,319 --> 03:33:20,550
civilization would be cool to try so is
it possible to create

12690
03:33:20,550 --> 03:33:20,560
it possible to create
 

12691
03:33:20,560 --> 03:33:23,510
it possible to create
molecules that start approaching this

12692
03:33:23,510 --> 03:33:23,520
molecules that start approaching this
 

12693
03:33:23,520 --> 03:33:24,710
molecules that start approaching this
question

12694
03:33:24,710 --> 03:33:24,720
question
 

12695
03:33:24,720 --> 03:33:27,269
question
that we started this conversation which

12696
03:33:27,269 --> 03:33:27,279
that we started this conversation which
 

12697
03:33:27,279 --> 03:33:29,910
that we started this conversation which
which is the origin of life so to start

12698
03:33:29,910 --> 03:33:29,920
which is the origin of life so to start
 

12699
03:33:29,920 --> 03:33:32,550
which is the origin of life so to start
to create molecules that have

12700
03:33:32,550 --> 03:33:32,560
to create molecules that have
 

12701
03:33:32,560 --> 03:33:34,950
to create molecules that have
life-like qualities so

12702
03:33:34,950 --> 03:33:34,960
life-like qualities so
 

12703
03:33:34,960 --> 03:33:37,670
life-like qualities so
have the replication have like complex

12704
03:33:37,670 --> 03:33:37,680
have the replication have like complex
 

12705
03:33:37,680 --> 03:33:40,469
have the replication have like complex
start to create complex organisms so we

12706
03:33:40,469 --> 03:33:40,479
start to create complex organisms so we
 

12707
03:33:40,479 --> 03:33:42,229
start to create complex organisms so we
have done this with the oxides i talked

12708
03:33:42,229 --> 03:33:42,239
have done this with the oxides i talked
 

12709
03:33:42,239 --> 03:33:43,830
have done this with the oxides i talked
about earlier the molybdenum oxides and

12710
03:33:43,830 --> 03:33:43,840
about earlier the molybdenum oxides and
 

12711
03:33:43,840 --> 03:33:45,590
about earlier the molybdenum oxides and
the rings and the bulls

12712
03:33:45,590 --> 03:33:45,600
the rings and the bulls
 

12713
03:33:45,600 --> 03:33:47,670
the rings and the bulls
and the problem is that well they are

12714
03:33:47,670 --> 03:33:47,680
and the problem is that well they are
 

12715
03:33:47,680 --> 03:33:49,190
and the problem is that well they are
they do

12716
03:33:49,190 --> 03:33:49,200
they do
 

12717
03:33:49,200 --> 03:33:51,590
they do
they auto catalytically enhance one

12718
03:33:51,590 --> 03:33:51,600
they auto catalytically enhance one
 

12719
03:33:51,600 --> 03:33:53,110
they auto catalytically enhance one
another so they would

12720
03:33:53,110 --> 03:33:53,120
another so they would
 

12721
03:33:53,120 --> 03:33:54,110
another so they would
i guess you would call it

12722
03:33:54,110 --> 03:33:54,120
i guess you would call it
 

12723
03:33:54,120 --> 03:33:56,389
i guess you would call it
self-replication but because there's

12724
03:33:56,389 --> 03:33:56,399
self-replication but because there's
 

12725
03:33:56,399 --> 03:33:57,590
self-replication but because there's
limited

12726
03:33:57,590 --> 03:33:57,600
limited
 

12727
03:33:57,600 --> 03:33:58,830
limited
um

12728
03:33:58,830 --> 03:33:58,840
um
 

12729
03:33:58,840 --> 03:34:01,750
um
function and mutation

12730
03:34:01,750 --> 03:34:01,760
function and mutation
 

12731
03:34:01,760 --> 03:34:03,349
function and mutation
they're pretty dumb so don't do very

12732
03:34:03,349 --> 03:34:03,359
they're pretty dumb so don't do very
 

12733
03:34:03,359 --> 03:34:04,469
they're pretty dumb so don't do very
much

12734
03:34:04,469 --> 03:34:04,479
much
 

12735
03:34:04,479 --> 03:34:05,269
much
so

12736
03:34:05,269 --> 03:34:05,279
so
 

12737
03:34:05,279 --> 03:34:06,550
so
i think

12738
03:34:06,550 --> 03:34:06,560
i think
 

12739
03:34:06,560 --> 03:34:08,790
i think
the prospect of us being able to

12740
03:34:08,790 --> 03:34:08,800
the prospect of us being able to
 

12741
03:34:08,800 --> 03:34:10,229
the prospect of us being able to
engineer

a nano material a nanomaterial life form

12744
03:34:12,870 --> 03:34:12,880
a nano material a nanomaterial life form
 

12745
03:34:12,880 --> 03:34:14,950
a nano material a nanomaterial life form
in the short term like i said earlier my

12746
03:34:14,950 --> 03:34:14,960
in the short term like i said earlier my
 

12747
03:34:14,960 --> 03:34:16,950
in the short term like i said earlier my
aim is to do this of course i mean i'm

12748
03:34:16,950 --> 03:34:16,960
aim is to do this of course i mean i'm
 

12749
03:34:16,960 --> 03:34:17,990
aim is to do this of course i mean i'm
you know on one hand i'm saying it's

12750
03:34:17,990 --> 03:34:18,000
you know on one hand i'm saying it's
 

12751
03:34:18,000 --> 03:34:19,030
you know on one hand i'm saying it's
impossible on the other hand saying i'm

12752
03:34:19,030 --> 03:34:19,040
impossible on the other hand saying i'm
 

12753
03:34:19,040 --> 03:34:20,469
impossible on the other hand saying i'm
doing it so which is it lee you know

12754
03:34:20,469 --> 03:34:20,479
doing it so which is it lee you know
 

12755
03:34:20,479 --> 03:34:21,349
doing it so which is it lee you know
it's like

12756
03:34:21,349 --> 03:34:21,359
it's like
 

12757
03:34:21,359 --> 03:34:23,750
it's like
uh well like i think we can do it but

12758
03:34:23,750 --> 03:34:23,760
uh well like i think we can do it but
 

12759
03:34:23,760 --> 03:34:25,750
uh well like i think we can do it but
only in the robot so the causal chain

12760
03:34:25,750 --> 03:34:25,760
only in the robot so the causal chain
 

12761
03:34:25,760 --> 03:34:27,429
only in the robot so the causal chain
that's gonna allow it's in the robot

12762
03:34:27,429 --> 03:34:27,439
that's gonna allow it's in the robot
 

12763
03:34:27,439 --> 03:34:29,190
that's gonna allow it's in the robot
these particles if they do start to

12764
03:34:29,190 --> 03:34:29,200
these particles if they do start to
 

12765
03:34:29,200 --> 03:34:30,790
these particles if they do start to
self-replicate the systems can be so

12766
03:34:30,790 --> 03:34:30,800
self-replicate the systems can be so
 

12767
03:34:30,800 --> 03:34:32,070
self-replicate the systems can be so
fragile

12768
03:34:32,070 --> 03:34:32,080
fragile
 

12769
03:34:32,080 --> 03:34:34,790
fragile
that i don't think anything

12770
03:34:34,790 --> 03:34:34,800
that i don't think anything
 

12771
03:34:34,800 --> 03:34:36,389
that i don't think anything
dangerous will come out it doesn't mean

12772
03:34:36,389 --> 03:34:36,399
dangerous will come out it doesn't mean
 

12773
03:34:36,399 --> 03:34:38,950
dangerous will come out it doesn't mean
we shouldn't treat them as potentially

12774
03:34:38,950 --> 03:34:38,960
we shouldn't treat them as potentially
 

12775
03:34:38,960 --> 03:34:39,830
we shouldn't treat them as potentially
you know

12776
03:34:39,830 --> 03:34:39,840
you know
 

12777
03:34:39,840 --> 03:34:40,870
you know
um

12778
03:34:40,870 --> 03:34:40,880
um
 

12779
03:34:40,880 --> 03:34:42,389
um
i mean i don't want to scare people like

12780
03:34:42,389 --> 03:34:42,399
i mean i don't want to scare people like
 

12781
03:34:42,399 --> 03:34:43,750
i mean i don't want to scare people like
gain a function we're going to produce

12782
03:34:43,750 --> 03:34:43,760
gain a function we're going to produce
 

12783
03:34:43,760 --> 03:34:46,070
gain a function we're going to produce
stuff that comes out our number one kill

12784
03:34:46,070 --> 03:34:46,080
stuff that comes out our number one kill
 

12785
03:34:46,080 --> 03:34:49,670
stuff that comes out our number one kill
switch is that we always try to search

12786
03:34:49,670 --> 03:34:49,680
switch is that we always try to search
 

12787
03:34:49,680 --> 03:34:51,670
switch is that we always try to search
a space of

12788
03:34:51,670 --> 03:34:51,680
a space of
 

12789
03:34:51,680 --> 03:34:53,110
a space of
objects that

12790
03:34:53,110 --> 03:34:53,120
objects that
 

12791
03:34:53,120 --> 03:34:55,030
objects that
don't exist in our reaction don't exist

12792
03:34:55,030 --> 03:34:55,040
don't exist in our reaction don't exist
 

12793
03:34:55,040 --> 03:34:56,309
don't exist in our reaction don't exist
in the environment so even if something

12794
03:34:56,309 --> 03:34:56,319
in the environment so even if something
 

12795
03:34:56,319 --> 03:34:58,389
in the environment so even if something
got out it just would die immediately

12796
03:34:58,389 --> 03:34:58,399
got out it just would die immediately
 

12797
03:34:58,399 --> 03:35:00,309
got out it just would die immediately
it's like making a silicon life form or

12798
03:35:00,309 --> 03:35:00,319
it's like making a silicon life form or
 

12799
03:35:00,319 --> 03:35:01,990
it's like making a silicon life form or
something or you know

12800
03:35:01,990 --> 03:35:02,000
something or you know
 

12801
03:35:02,000 --> 03:35:04,150
something or you know
which is the opposite of uh oftentimes

12802
03:35:04,150 --> 03:35:04,160
which is the opposite of uh oftentimes
 

12803
03:35:04,160 --> 03:35:05,910
which is the opposite of uh oftentimes
gain and function research just focused

12804
03:35:05,910 --> 03:35:05,920
gain and function research just focused
 

12805
03:35:05,920 --> 03:35:09,190
gain and function research just focused
on like how do you get a dangerous thing

12806
03:35:09,190 --> 03:35:09,200
on like how do you get a dangerous thing
 

12807
03:35:09,200 --> 03:35:11,110
on like how do you get a dangerous thing
to be closer to something that works

12808
03:35:11,110 --> 03:35:11,120
to be closer to something that works
 

12809
03:35:11,120 --> 03:35:12,950
to be closer to something that works
with humans yeah so have it jump to

12810
03:35:12,950 --> 03:35:12,960
with humans yeah so have it jump to
 

12811
03:35:12,960 --> 03:35:15,429
with humans yeah so have it jump to
humans so that's the one that's one good

12812
03:35:15,429 --> 03:35:15,439
humans so that's the one that's one good
 

12813
03:35:15,439 --> 03:35:17,510
humans so that's the one that's one good
mode to operate on is

12814
03:35:17,510 --> 03:35:17,520
mode to operate on is
 

12815
03:35:17,520 --> 03:35:20,950
mode to operate on is
always try to operate on

12816
03:35:20,950 --> 03:35:20,960
always try to operate on
 

12817
03:35:20,960 --> 03:35:22,550
always try to operate on
chemical entities that are very

12818
03:35:22,550 --> 03:35:22,560
chemical entities that are very
 

12819
03:35:22,560 --> 03:35:24,630
chemical entities that are very
different than the the kind of chemical

12820
03:35:24,630 --> 03:35:24,640
different than the the kind of chemical
 

12821
03:35:24,640 --> 03:35:26,469
different than the the kind of chemical
environment that humans operate in yeah

12822
03:35:26,469 --> 03:35:26,479
environment that humans operate in yeah
 

12823
03:35:26,479 --> 03:35:28,309
environment that humans operate in yeah
and also i mean i'll say something

12824
03:35:28,309 --> 03:35:28,319
and also i mean i'll say something
 

12825
03:35:28,319 --> 03:35:29,349
and also i mean i'll say something
dramatic

12826
03:35:29,349 --> 03:35:29,359
dramatic
 

12827
03:35:29,359 --> 03:35:31,269
dramatic
which may not be

12828
03:35:31,269 --> 03:35:31,279
which may not be
 

12829
03:35:31,279 --> 03:35:35,030
which may not be
may not be true so i should be careful

12830
03:35:35,030 --> 03:35:35,040
may not be true so i should be careful
 

12831
03:35:35,040 --> 03:35:37,830
may not be true so i should be careful
if let's say we did discover a new

12832
03:35:37,830 --> 03:35:37,840
if let's say we did discover a new
 

12833
03:35:37,840 --> 03:35:40,389
if let's say we did discover a new
living system but it was made out of a

12834
03:35:40,389 --> 03:35:40,399
living system but it was made out of a
 

12835
03:35:40,399 --> 03:35:42,710
living system but it was made out of a
shadow biosphere

12836
03:35:42,710 --> 03:35:42,720
shadow biosphere
 

12837
03:35:42,720 --> 03:35:43,830
shadow biosphere
and we just released it in the

12838
03:35:43,830 --> 03:35:43,840
and we just released it in the
 

12839
03:35:43,840 --> 03:35:45,750
and we just released it in the
environment who cares it's going to use

12840
03:35:45,750 --> 03:35:45,760
environment who cares it's going to use
 

12841
03:35:45,760 --> 03:35:48,070
environment who cares it's going to use
different stuff

12842
03:35:48,070 --> 03:35:48,080
different stuff
 

12843
03:35:48,080 --> 03:35:50,150
different stuff
it'll just live

12844
03:35:50,150 --> 03:35:50,160
it'll just live
 

12845
03:35:50,160 --> 03:35:52,790
it'll just live
just live yeah i i found one of my

12846
03:35:52,790 --> 03:35:52,800
just live yeah i i found one of my
 

12847
03:35:52,800 --> 03:35:54,710
just live yeah i i found one of my
biggest fantasies is actually is like a

12848
03:35:54,710 --> 03:35:54,720
biggest fantasies is actually is like a
 

12849
03:35:54,720 --> 03:35:55,590
biggest fantasies is actually is like a
planet

12850
03:35:55,590 --> 03:35:55,600
planet
 

12851
03:35:55,600 --> 03:35:57,190
planet
that's basically half in the sun it

12852
03:35:57,190 --> 03:35:57,200
that's basically half in the sun it
 

12853
03:35:57,200 --> 03:35:58,950
that's basically half in the sun it
doesn't rotate right and

12854
03:35:58,950 --> 03:35:58,960
doesn't rotate right and
 

12855
03:35:58,960 --> 03:35:59,910
doesn't rotate right and
and

12856
03:35:59,910 --> 03:35:59,920
and
 

12857
03:35:59,920 --> 03:36:01,429
and
you have two different origins of life

12858
03:36:01,429 --> 03:36:01,439
you have two different origins of life
 

12859
03:36:01,439 --> 03:36:03,110
you have two different origins of life
on that planet

12860
03:36:03,110 --> 03:36:03,120
on that planet
 

12861
03:36:03,120 --> 03:36:04,950
on that planet
and they don't share the same chemistry

12862
03:36:04,950 --> 03:36:04,960
and they don't share the same chemistry
 

12863
03:36:04,960 --> 03:36:07,190
and they don't share the same chemistry
yeah and then they only wait time they

12864
03:36:07,190 --> 03:36:07,200
yeah and then they only wait time they
 

12865
03:36:07,200 --> 03:36:08,389
yeah and then they only wait time they
recognize each other when they become

12866
03:36:08,389 --> 03:36:08,399
recognize each other when they become
 

12867
03:36:08,399 --> 03:36:09,990
recognize each other when they become
intelligent they go well what's that

12868
03:36:09,990 --> 03:36:10,000
intelligent they go well what's that
 

12869
03:36:10,000 --> 03:36:11,990
intelligent they go well what's that
moving yeah

12870
03:36:11,990 --> 03:36:12,000
moving yeah
 

12871
03:36:12,000 --> 03:36:13,910
moving yeah
i i wanted to co-evolve and that's

12872
03:36:13,910 --> 03:36:13,920
i i wanted to co-evolve and that's
 

12873
03:36:13,920 --> 03:36:16,469
i i wanted to co-evolve and that's
fascinating i mean so one fascinating

12874
03:36:16,469 --> 03:36:16,479
fascinating i mean so one fascinating
 

12875
03:36:16,479 --> 03:36:18,469
fascinating i mean so one fascinating
thing to do is exactly what you were

12876
03:36:18,469 --> 03:36:18,479
thing to do is exactly what you were
 

12877
03:36:18,479 --> 03:36:20,710
thing to do is exactly what you were
saying which is a life bomb

12878
03:36:20,710 --> 03:36:20,720
saying which is a life bomb
 

12879
03:36:20,720 --> 03:36:22,790
saying which is a life bomb
which is like

12880
03:36:22,790 --> 03:36:22,800
which is like
 

12881
03:36:22,800 --> 03:36:27,030
which is like
try to focus on atmospheres or

12882
03:36:27,030 --> 03:36:27,040
try to focus on atmospheres or
 

12883
03:36:27,040 --> 03:36:29,750
try to focus on atmospheres or
chemical conditions of other planets and

12884
03:36:29,750 --> 03:36:29,760
chemical conditions of other planets and
 

12885
03:36:29,760 --> 03:36:31,269
chemical conditions of other planets and
try within

12886
03:36:31,269 --> 03:36:31,279
try within
 

12887
03:36:31,279 --> 03:36:32,830
try within
this kind of

12888
03:36:32,830 --> 03:36:32,840
this kind of
 

12889
03:36:32,840 --> 03:36:36,150
this kind of
uh exploration optimization system try

12890
03:36:36,150 --> 03:36:36,160
uh exploration optimization system try
 

12891
03:36:36,160 --> 03:36:38,710
uh exploration optimization system try
to discover

12892
03:36:38,710 --> 03:36:38,720
to discover
 

12893
03:36:38,720 --> 03:36:40,070
to discover
life forms

12894
03:36:40,070 --> 03:36:40,080
life forms
 

12895
03:36:40,080 --> 03:36:41,750
life forms
that can work in those conditions and

12896
03:36:41,750 --> 03:36:41,760
that can work in those conditions and
 

12897
03:36:41,760 --> 03:36:43,990
that can work in those conditions and
then you send those life forms over

12898
03:36:43,990 --> 03:36:44,000
then you send those life forms over
 

12899
03:36:44,000 --> 03:36:44,710
then you send those life forms over
there

12900
03:36:44,710 --> 03:36:44,720
there
 

12901
03:36:44,720 --> 03:36:46,150
there
see what kind of stuff they build up

12902
03:36:46,150 --> 03:36:46,160
see what kind of stuff they build up
 

12903
03:36:46,160 --> 03:36:48,630
see what kind of stuff they build up
like you can do like a large scale

12904
03:36:48,630 --> 03:36:48,640
like you can do like a large scale
 

12905
03:36:48,640 --> 03:36:50,630
like you can do like a large scale
it's kind of a safe

12906
03:36:50,630 --> 03:36:50,640
it's kind of a safe
 

12907
03:36:50,640 --> 03:36:52,550
it's kind of a safe
physical environment to do large-scale

12908
03:36:52,550 --> 03:36:52,560
physical environment to do large-scale
 

12909
03:36:52,560 --> 03:36:55,030
physical environment to do large-scale
experiments it's another planet yeah so

12910
03:36:55,030 --> 03:36:55,040
experiments it's another planet yeah so
 

12911
03:36:55,040 --> 03:36:56,550
experiments it's another planet yeah so
look i'm gonna say something quite

12912
03:36:56,550 --> 03:36:56,560
look i'm gonna say something quite
 

12913
03:36:56,560 --> 03:36:58,550
look i'm gonna say something quite
contentious i mean elon wants to go to

12914
03:36:58,550 --> 03:36:58,560
contentious i mean elon wants to go to
 

12915
03:36:58,560 --> 03:36:59,990
contentious i mean elon wants to go to
mars i think it's brilliant wants to go

12916
03:36:59,990 --> 03:37:00,000
mars i think it's brilliant wants to go
 

12917
03:37:00,000 --> 03:37:02,389
mars i think it's brilliant wants to go
mars but i would counter that and say

12918
03:37:02,389 --> 03:37:02,399
mars but i would counter that and say
 

12919
03:37:02,399 --> 03:37:04,070
mars but i would counter that and say
is elon just obsessed with getting

12920
03:37:04,070 --> 03:37:04,080
is elon just obsessed with getting
 

12921
03:37:04,080 --> 03:37:06,870
is elon just obsessed with getting
humanity off earth or what about just

12922
03:37:06,870 --> 03:37:06,880
humanity off earth or what about just
 

12923
03:37:06,880 --> 03:37:09,830
humanity off earth or what about just
technology so if we do technology so so

12924
03:37:09,830 --> 03:37:09,840
technology so if we do technology so so
 

12925
03:37:09,840 --> 03:37:11,429
technology so if we do technology so so
elon either needs to take a computer to

12926
03:37:11,429 --> 03:37:11,439
elon either needs to take a computer to
 

12927
03:37:11,439 --> 03:37:13,110
elon either needs to take a computer to
mars he needs to manufacture drugs right

12928
03:37:13,110 --> 03:37:13,120
mars he needs to manufacture drugs right
 

12929
03:37:13,120 --> 03:37:15,269
mars he needs to manufacture drugs right
on demand right because zero cost

12930
03:37:15,269 --> 03:37:15,279
on demand right because zero cost
 

12931
03:37:15,279 --> 03:37:17,269
on demand right because zero cost
payload and all that stuff is just code

12932
03:37:17,269 --> 03:37:17,279
payload and all that stuff is just code
 

12933
03:37:17,279 --> 03:37:19,910
payload and all that stuff is just code
or what we do is we actually say hang on

12934
03:37:19,910 --> 03:37:19,920
or what we do is we actually say hang on
 

12935
03:37:19,920 --> 03:37:21,590
or what we do is we actually say hang on
it's quite hard for humans to survive on

12936
03:37:21,590 --> 03:37:21,600
it's quite hard for humans to survive on
 

12937
03:37:21,600 --> 03:37:22,469
it's quite hard for humans to survive on
mars

12938
03:37:22,469 --> 03:37:22,479
mars
 

12939
03:37:22,479 --> 03:37:24,389
mars
why don't we write a series of origin

12940
03:37:24,389 --> 03:37:24,399
why don't we write a series of origin
 

12941
03:37:24,399 --> 03:37:26,550
why don't we write a series of origin
life algorithms where we put our embed

12942
03:37:26,550 --> 03:37:26,560
life algorithms where we put our embed
 

12943
03:37:26,560 --> 03:37:27,830
life algorithms where we put our embed
our culture in it right this is a very

12944
03:37:27,830 --> 03:37:27,840
our culture in it right this is a very
 

12945
03:37:27,840 --> 03:37:30,229
our culture in it right this is a very
ridley spot prometheus right yeah which

12946
03:37:30,229 --> 03:37:30,239
ridley spot prometheus right yeah which
 

12947
03:37:30,239 --> 03:37:33,190
ridley spot prometheus right yeah which
is a terrible film by the way but anyway

12948
03:37:33,190 --> 03:37:33,200
is a terrible film by the way but anyway
 

12949
03:37:33,200 --> 03:37:35,830
is a terrible film by the way but anyway
um and dump it on mars and just

12950
03:37:35,830 --> 03:37:35,840
um and dump it on mars and just
 

12951
03:37:35,840 --> 03:37:37,830
um and dump it on mars and just
terraform mars and what we do is we

12952
03:37:37,830 --> 03:37:37,840
terraform mars and what we do is we
 

12953
03:37:37,840 --> 03:37:40,469
terraform mars and what we do is we
evolve life on mars that is suited to

12954
03:37:40,469 --> 03:37:40,479
evolve life on mars that is suited to
 

12955
03:37:40,479 --> 03:37:42,790
evolve life on mars that is suited to
life on mars yeah rather than brute

12956
03:37:42,790 --> 03:37:42,800
life on mars yeah rather than brute
 

12957
03:37:42,800 --> 03:37:45,110
life on mars yeah rather than brute
forcing human life on mars so one of the

12958
03:37:45,110 --> 03:37:45,120
forcing human life on mars so one of the
 

12959
03:37:45,120 --> 03:37:46,790
forcing human life on mars so one of the
questions is

12960
03:37:46,790 --> 03:37:46,800
questions is
 

12961
03:37:46,800 --> 03:37:48,630
questions is
you know what what is human culture what

12962
03:37:48,630 --> 03:37:48,640
you know what what is human culture what
 

12963
03:37:48,640 --> 03:37:50,630
you know what what is human culture what
is the things you encode some of it is

12964
03:37:50,630 --> 03:37:50,640
is the things you encode some of it is
 

12965
03:37:50,640 --> 03:37:52,630
is the things you encode some of it is
knowledge some of it is information

12966
03:37:52,630 --> 03:37:52,640
knowledge some of it is information
 

12967
03:37:52,640 --> 03:37:55,590
knowledge some of it is information
but the thing that elon talks about and

12968
03:37:55,590 --> 03:37:55,600
but the thing that elon talks about and
 

12969
03:37:55,600 --> 03:37:57,590
but the thing that elon talks about and
i think the thing i think about i think

12970
03:37:57,590 --> 03:37:57,600
i think the thing i think about i think
 

12971
03:37:57,600 --> 03:37:59,990
i think the thing i think about i think
you think about as well is

12972
03:37:59,990 --> 03:38:00,000
you think about as well is
 

12973
03:38:00,000 --> 03:38:03,030
you think about as well is
some of the more unique aspects of

12974
03:38:03,030 --> 03:38:03,040
some of the more unique aspects of
 

12975
03:38:03,040 --> 03:38:06,550
some of the more unique aspects of
human nature of what makes us human

12976
03:38:06,550 --> 03:38:06,560
human nature of what makes us human
 

12977
03:38:06,560 --> 03:38:08,469
human nature of what makes us human
which is our particular kind of

12978
03:38:08,469 --> 03:38:08,479
which is our particular kind of
 

12979
03:38:08,479 --> 03:38:10,469
which is our particular kind of
consciousness so he talks about the

12980
03:38:10,469 --> 03:38:10,479
consciousness so he talks about the
 

12981
03:38:10,479 --> 03:38:12,550
consciousness so he talks about the
flame of human consciousness

12982
03:38:12,550 --> 03:38:12,560
flame of human consciousness
 

12983
03:38:12,560 --> 03:38:15,190
flame of human consciousness
yeah that's one of the questions is can

12984
03:38:15,190 --> 03:38:15,200
yeah that's one of the questions is can
 

12985
03:38:15,200 --> 03:38:18,150
yeah that's one of the questions is can
we um

12986
03:38:18,150 --> 03:38:18,160

 

12987
03:38:18,160 --> 03:38:21,990

instill consciousness into other beings

12988
03:38:21,990 --> 03:38:22,000
instill consciousness into other beings
 

12989
03:38:22,000 --> 03:38:24,229
instill consciousness into other beings
because that's a sad thought

12990
03:38:24,229 --> 03:38:24,239
because that's a sad thought
 

12991
03:38:24,239 --> 03:38:27,349
because that's a sad thought
that whatever this thing inside our

12992
03:38:27,349 --> 03:38:27,359
that whatever this thing inside our
 

12993
03:38:27,359 --> 03:38:29,910
that whatever this thing inside our
minds that hopes and dreams and fears

12994
03:38:29,910 --> 03:38:29,920
minds that hopes and dreams and fears
 

12995
03:38:29,920 --> 03:38:31,590
minds that hopes and dreams and fears
and loves

12996
03:38:31,590 --> 03:38:31,600
and loves
 

12997
03:38:31,600 --> 03:38:33,830
and loves
can all die

12998
03:38:33,830 --> 03:38:33,840
can all die
 

12999
03:38:33,840 --> 03:38:35,269
can all die
yeah but i think you already know the

13000
03:38:35,269 --> 03:38:35,279
yeah but i think you already know the
 

13001
03:38:35,279 --> 03:38:36,870
yeah but i think you already know the
answer to that question

13002
03:38:36,870 --> 03:38:36,880
answer to that question
 

13003
03:38:36,880 --> 03:38:40,229
answer to that question
um i have a robot lawnmower at home my

13004
03:38:40,229 --> 03:38:40,239
um i have a robot lawnmower at home my
 

13005
03:38:40,239 --> 03:38:43,110
um i have a robot lawnmower at home my
kids call it cc call cutter it's a

13006
03:38:43,110 --> 03:38:43,120
kids call it cc call cutter it's a
 

13007
03:38:43,120 --> 03:38:44,550
kids call it cc call cutter it's a
robomow

13008
03:38:44,550 --> 03:38:44,560
robomow
 

13009
03:38:44,560 --> 03:38:46,309
robomow
and it the way it works it has an

13010
03:38:46,309 --> 03:38:46,319
and it the way it works it has an
 

13011
03:38:46,319 --> 03:38:47,990
and it the way it works it has an
electric field around the perimeter and

13012
03:38:47,990 --> 03:38:48,000
electric field around the perimeter and
 

13013
03:38:48,000 --> 03:38:50,630
electric field around the perimeter and
it just tell it the area and it

13014
03:38:50,630 --> 03:38:50,640
it just tell it the area and it
 

13015
03:38:50,640 --> 03:38:52,309
it just tell it the area and it
it goes out and goes from its base

13016
03:38:52,309 --> 03:38:52,319
it goes out and goes from its base
 

13017
03:38:52,319 --> 03:38:54,469
it goes out and goes from its base
station just mows a bit gets to the

13018
03:38:54,469 --> 03:38:54,479
station just mows a bit gets to the
 

13019
03:38:54,479 --> 03:38:56,389
station just mows a bit gets to the
perimeter detects and then chooses a

13020
03:38:56,389 --> 03:38:56,399
perimeter detects and then chooses a
 

13021
03:38:56,399 --> 03:38:58,790
perimeter detects and then chooses a
random angle rotates around and goes on

13022
03:38:58,790 --> 03:38:58,800
random angle rotates around and goes on
 

13023
03:38:58,800 --> 03:38:59,670
random angle rotates around and goes on
yeah

13024
03:38:59,670 --> 03:38:59,680
yeah
 

13025
03:38:59,680 --> 03:39:02,229
yeah
but my kids call it call cutter it's a

13026
03:39:02,229 --> 03:39:02,239
but my kids call it call cutter it's a
 

13027
03:39:02,239 --> 03:39:03,750
but my kids call it call cutter it's a
she i don't know why it's a she they

13028
03:39:03,750 --> 03:39:03,760
she i don't know why it's a she they
 

13029
03:39:03,760 --> 03:39:05,030
she i don't know why it's a she they
just they when they were like quite

13030
03:39:05,030 --> 03:39:05,040
just they when they were like quite
 

13031
03:39:05,040 --> 03:39:06,309
just they when they were like quite
young they called it

13032
03:39:06,309 --> 03:39:06,319
young they called it
 

13033
03:39:06,319 --> 03:39:08,309
young they called it
um i don't want to be sexist there it

13034
03:39:08,309 --> 03:39:08,319
um i don't want to be sexist there it
 

13035
03:39:08,319 --> 03:39:11,269
um i don't want to be sexist there it
could be but they liked um

13036
03:39:11,269 --> 03:39:11,279
could be but they liked um
 

13037
03:39:11,279 --> 03:39:13,110
could be but they liked um
they they gendered the lawnmower they

13038
03:39:13,110 --> 03:39:13,120
they they gendered the lawnmower they
 

13039
03:39:13,120 --> 03:39:15,349
they they gendered the lawnmower they
gendered the lawnmower okay yeah why not

13040
03:39:15,349 --> 03:39:15,359
gendered the lawnmower okay yeah why not
 

13041
03:39:15,359 --> 03:39:17,670
gendered the lawnmower okay yeah why not
but i was thinking this lawnmower

13042
03:39:17,670 --> 03:39:17,680
but i was thinking this lawnmower
 

13043
03:39:17,680 --> 03:39:19,189
but i was thinking this lawnmower
if you apply integrated information

13044
03:39:19,189 --> 03:39:19,199
if you apply integrated information
 

13045
03:39:19,199 --> 03:39:21,189
if you apply integrated information
theory to lawmaker the lawnmower is

13046
03:39:21,189 --> 03:39:21,199
theory to lawmaker the lawnmower is
 

13047
03:39:21,199 --> 03:39:22,550
theory to lawmaker the lawnmower is
conscious

13048
03:39:22,550 --> 03:39:22,560
conscious
 

13049
03:39:22,560 --> 03:39:24,389
conscious
now information integrated information

13050
03:39:24,389 --> 03:39:24,399
now information integrated information
 

13051
03:39:24,399 --> 03:39:25,429
now information integrated information
theory

13052
03:39:25,429 --> 03:39:25,439
theory
 

13053
03:39:25,439 --> 03:39:27,269
theory
um is that people say as a flawed way of

13054
03:39:27,269 --> 03:39:27,279
um is that people say as a flawed way of
 

13055
03:39:27,279 --> 03:39:28,469
um is that people say as a flawed way of
measuring consciousness but i don't

13056
03:39:28,469 --> 03:39:28,479
measuring consciousness but i don't
 

13057
03:39:28,479 --> 03:39:30,070
measuring consciousness but i don't
think it is i think assembly theory

13058
03:39:30,070 --> 03:39:30,080
think it is i think assembly theory
 

13059
03:39:30,080 --> 03:39:32,229
think it is i think assembly theory
actually measures consciousness in the

13060
03:39:32,229 --> 03:39:32,239
actually measures consciousness in the
 

13061
03:39:32,239 --> 03:39:35,030
actually measures consciousness in the
same way consciousness is something that

13062
03:39:35,030 --> 03:39:35,040
same way consciousness is something that
 

13063
03:39:35,040 --> 03:39:37,030
same way consciousness is something that
has generated over a population of

13064
03:39:37,030 --> 03:39:37,040
has generated over a population of
 

13065
03:39:37,040 --> 03:39:38,710
has generated over a population of
objects of humans

13066
03:39:38,710 --> 03:39:38,720
objects of humans
 

13067
03:39:38,720 --> 03:39:40,870
objects of humans
consciousness didn't suddenly spring in

13068
03:39:40,870 --> 03:39:40,880
consciousness didn't suddenly spring in
 

13069
03:39:40,880 --> 03:39:42,550
consciousness didn't suddenly spring in
our consciousness has evolved together

13070
03:39:42,550 --> 03:39:42,560
our consciousness has evolved together
 

13071
03:39:42,560 --> 03:39:44,469
our consciousness has evolved together
right the fact we're here and the robots

13072
03:39:44,469 --> 03:39:44,479
right the fact we're here and the robots
 

13073
03:39:44,479 --> 03:39:45,990
right the fact we're here and the robots
we leave behind

13074
03:39:45,990 --> 03:39:46,000
we leave behind
 

13075
03:39:46,000 --> 03:39:47,429
we leave behind
they all have some of that so we won't

13076
03:39:47,429 --> 03:39:47,439
they all have some of that so we won't
 

13077
03:39:47,439 --> 03:39:49,030
they all have some of that so we won't
lose it all

13078
03:39:49,030 --> 03:39:49,040
lose it all
 

13079
03:39:49,040 --> 03:39:51,429
lose it all
sure consciousness requires that we have

13080
03:39:51,429 --> 03:39:51,439
sure consciousness requires that we have
 

13081
03:39:51,439 --> 03:39:52,950
sure consciousness requires that we have
many models being generated there's not

13082
03:39:52,950 --> 03:39:52,960
many models being generated there's not
 

13083
03:39:52,960 --> 03:39:55,110
many models being generated there's not
just one domain specific ai right i

13084
03:39:55,110 --> 03:39:55,120
just one domain specific ai right i
 

13085
03:39:55,120 --> 03:39:56,229
just one domain specific ai right i
think that the way it created

13086
03:39:56,229 --> 03:39:56,239
think that the way it created
 

13087
03:39:56,239 --> 03:39:57,830
think that the way it created
consciousness i'm going to say

13088
03:39:57,830 --> 03:39:57,840
consciousness i'm going to say
 

13089
03:39:57,840 --> 03:40:00,389
consciousness i'm going to say
unashamedly the best way chemical to

13090
03:40:00,389 --> 03:40:00,399
unashamedly the best way chemical to
 

13091
03:40:00,399 --> 03:40:01,910
unashamedly the best way chemical to
make a consciousness is in a chemical

13092
03:40:01,910 --> 03:40:01,920
make a consciousness is in a chemical
 

13093
03:40:01,920 --> 03:40:03,830
make a consciousness is in a chemical
system because you just have access to

13094
03:40:03,830 --> 03:40:03,840
system because you just have access to
 

13095
03:40:03,840 --> 03:40:05,189
system because you just have access to
many more states

13096
03:40:05,189 --> 03:40:05,199
many more states
 

13097
03:40:05,199 --> 03:40:06,550
many more states
and the problem right now we're making

13098
03:40:06,550 --> 03:40:06,560
and the problem right now we're making
 

13099
03:40:06,560 --> 03:40:08,389
and the problem right now we're making
silicon consciousness

13100
03:40:08,389 --> 03:40:08,399
silicon consciousness
 

13101
03:40:08,399 --> 03:40:10,870
silicon consciousness
is you just don't have enough states so

13102
03:40:10,870 --> 03:40:10,880
is you just don't have enough states so
 

13103
03:40:10,880 --> 03:40:12,950
is you just don't have enough states so
there are more possible states or sorry

13104
03:40:12,950 --> 03:40:12,960
there are more possible states or sorry
 

13105
03:40:12,960 --> 03:40:14,469
there are more possible states or sorry
there are more possible configurations

13106
03:40:14,469 --> 03:40:14,479
there are more possible configurations
 

13107
03:40:14,479 --> 03:40:16,309
there are more possible configurations
possible in your brain than there are

13108
03:40:16,309 --> 03:40:16,319
possible in your brain than there are
 

13109
03:40:16,319 --> 03:40:18,469
possible in your brain than there are
atoms in the universe and you can you

13110
03:40:18,469 --> 03:40:18,479
atoms in the universe and you can you
 

13111
03:40:18,479 --> 03:40:20,309
atoms in the universe and you can you
can switch between them

13112
03:40:20,309 --> 03:40:20,319
can switch between them
 

13113
03:40:20,319 --> 03:40:22,550
can switch between them
you can't do that on a core i10 it's got

13114
03:40:22,550 --> 03:40:22,560
you can't do that on a core i10 it's got
 

13115
03:40:22,560 --> 03:40:24,150
you can't do that on a core i10 it's got
it's got 10 billion 12 billion 40

13116
03:40:24,150 --> 03:40:24,160
it's got 10 billion 12 billion 40
 

13117
03:40:24,160 --> 03:40:25,990
it's got 10 billion 12 billion 40
billion transistors but you can't you

13118
03:40:25,990 --> 03:40:26,000
billion transistors but you can't you
 

13119
03:40:26,000 --> 03:40:28,229
billion transistors but you can't you
can't reconfigure them as dynamically

13120
03:40:28,229 --> 03:40:28,239
can't reconfigure them as dynamically
 

13121
03:40:28,239 --> 03:40:30,710
can't reconfigure them as dynamically
well you've shared this intuition a few

13122
03:40:30,710 --> 03:40:30,720
well you've shared this intuition a few
 

13123
03:40:30,720 --> 03:40:33,349
well you've shared this intuition a few
times already that the larger number of

13124
03:40:33,349 --> 03:40:33,359
times already that the larger number of
 

13125
03:40:33,359 --> 03:40:34,550
times already that the larger number of
states

13126
03:40:34,550 --> 03:40:34,560
states
 

13127
03:40:34,560 --> 03:40:36,950
states
somehow correlates to greater

13128
03:40:36,950 --> 03:40:36,960
somehow correlates to greater
 

13129
03:40:36,960 --> 03:40:39,670
somehow correlates to greater
possibility of life but

13130
03:40:39,670 --> 03:40:39,680
possibility of life but
 

13131
03:40:39,680 --> 03:40:41,429
possibility of life but
it's also possible that constraints are

13132
03:40:41,429 --> 03:40:41,439
it's also possible that constraints are
 

13133
03:40:41,439 --> 03:40:44,070
it's also possible that constraints are
essential here yeah yeah i mean but but

13134
03:40:44,070 --> 03:40:44,080
essential here yeah yeah i mean but but
 

13135
03:40:44,080 --> 03:40:45,990
essential here yeah yeah i mean but but
coming back to the you worry that

13136
03:40:45,990 --> 03:40:46,000
coming back to the you worry that
 

13137
03:40:46,000 --> 03:40:48,469
coming back to the you worry that
something's lost i agree um

13138
03:40:48,469 --> 03:40:48,479
something's lost i agree um
 

13139
03:40:48,479 --> 03:40:50,630
something's lost i agree um
but i think that um

13140
03:40:50,630 --> 03:40:50,640
but i think that um
 

13141
03:40:50,640 --> 03:40:53,590
but i think that um
you know we will get to an agi

13142
03:40:53,590 --> 03:40:53,600
you know we will get to an agi
 

13143
03:40:53,600 --> 03:40:56,070
you know we will get to an agi
but i wonder if it's if it's not

13144
03:40:56,070 --> 03:40:56,080
but i wonder if it's if it's not
 

13145
03:40:56,080 --> 03:40:58,389
but i wonder if it's if it's not
it can't be separate from human it can't

13146
03:40:58,389 --> 03:40:58,399
it can't be separate from human it can't
 

13147
03:40:58,399 --> 03:40:59,990
it can't be separate from human it can't
be separate from human consciousness

13148
03:40:59,990 --> 03:41:00,000
be separate from human consciousness
 

13149
03:41:00,000 --> 03:41:01,510
be separate from human consciousness
because the causal chain that produced

13150
03:41:01,510 --> 03:41:01,520
because the causal chain that produced
 

13151
03:41:01,520 --> 03:41:03,830
because the causal chain that produced
it came from humans so the people what i

13152
03:41:03,830 --> 03:41:03,840
it came from humans so the people what i
 

13153
03:41:03,840 --> 03:41:06,389
it came from humans so the people what i
kind of try and suggest heavily to

13154
03:41:06,389 --> 03:41:06,399
kind of try and suggest heavily to
 

13155
03:41:06,399 --> 03:41:07,830
kind of try and suggest heavily to
people worry about

13156
03:41:07,830 --> 03:41:07,840
people worry about
 

13157
03:41:07,840 --> 03:41:11,269
people worry about
um the existential threat of ai saying

13158
03:41:11,269 --> 03:41:11,279
um the existential threat of ai saying
 

13159
03:41:11,279 --> 03:41:12,950
um the existential threat of ai saying
i mean you put it much more elegantly

13160
03:41:12,950 --> 03:41:12,960
i mean you put it much more elegantly
 

13161
03:41:12,960 --> 03:41:14,950
i mean you put it much more elegantly
earlier like we should worry about

13162
03:41:14,950 --> 03:41:14,960
earlier like we should worry about
 

13163
03:41:14,960 --> 03:41:17,110
earlier like we should worry about
algorithms on dumb algorithms written by

13164
03:41:17,110 --> 03:41:17,120
algorithms on dumb algorithms written by
 

13165
03:41:17,120 --> 03:41:19,189
algorithms on dumb algorithms written by
human beings on twitter driving us

13166
03:41:19,189 --> 03:41:19,199
human beings on twitter driving us
 

13167
03:41:19,199 --> 03:41:21,030
human beings on twitter driving us
insane right

13168
03:41:21,030 --> 03:41:21,040
insane right
 

13169
03:41:21,040 --> 03:41:23,110
insane right
and doing acting in odd ways

13170
03:41:23,110 --> 03:41:23,120
and doing acting in odd ways
 

13171
03:41:23,120 --> 03:41:25,830
and doing acting in odd ways
yeah i think intelligence this is what i

13172
03:41:25,830 --> 03:41:25,840
yeah i think intelligence this is what i
 

13173
03:41:25,840 --> 03:41:27,510
yeah i think intelligence this is what i
have been ineloquent in trying to

13174
03:41:27,510 --> 03:41:27,520
have been ineloquent in trying to
 

13175
03:41:27,520 --> 03:41:30,070
have been ineloquent in trying to
describe it

13176
03:41:30,070 --> 03:41:30,080
describe it
 

13177
03:41:30,080 --> 03:41:31,990
describe it
partially because

13178
03:41:31,990 --> 03:41:32,000
partially because
 

13179
03:41:32,000 --> 03:41:33,590
partially because
i try not to think

13180
03:41:33,590 --> 03:41:33,600
i try not to think
 

13181
03:41:33,600 --> 03:41:35,030
i try not to think
too deeply through this stuff because

13182
03:41:35,030 --> 03:41:35,040
too deeply through this stuff because
 

13183
03:41:35,040 --> 03:41:36,710
too deeply through this stuff because
then you become a philosopher i still

13184
03:41:36,710 --> 03:41:36,720
then you become a philosopher i still
 

13185
03:41:36,720 --> 03:41:39,110
then you become a philosopher i still
aspire to actually building a bunch of

13186
03:41:39,110 --> 03:41:39,120
aspire to actually building a bunch of
 

13187
03:41:39,120 --> 03:41:40,309
aspire to actually building a bunch of
stuff

13188
03:41:40,309 --> 03:41:40,319
stuff
 

13189
03:41:40,319 --> 03:41:43,990
stuff
but my sense is super intelligence

13190
03:41:43,990 --> 03:41:44,000
but my sense is super intelligence
 

13191
03:41:44,000 --> 03:41:46,710
but my sense is super intelligence
leads to um

13192
03:41:46,710 --> 03:41:46,720
leads to um
 

13193
03:41:46,720 --> 03:41:48,790
leads to um
deep integration into human society so

13194
03:41:48,790 --> 03:41:48,800
deep integration into human society so
 

13195
03:41:48,800 --> 03:41:49,590
deep integration into human society so
like

13196
03:41:49,590 --> 03:41:49,600
like
 

13197
03:41:49,600 --> 03:41:52,070
like
intelligence is strongly correlated like

13198
03:41:52,070 --> 03:41:52,080
intelligence is strongly correlated like
 

13199
03:41:52,080 --> 03:41:52,950
intelligence is strongly correlated like
uh

13200
03:41:52,950 --> 03:41:52,960
uh
 

13201
03:41:52,960 --> 03:41:55,590
uh
intelligence the way we conceive of

13202
03:41:55,590 --> 03:41:55,600
intelligence the way we conceive of
 

13203
03:41:55,600 --> 03:41:56,990
intelligence the way we conceive of
intelligence

13204
03:41:56,990 --> 03:41:57,000
intelligence
 

13205
03:41:57,000 --> 03:41:59,830
intelligence
materializes as a thing

13206
03:41:59,830 --> 03:41:59,840
materializes as a thing
 

13207
03:41:59,840 --> 03:42:02,710
materializes as a thing
that becomes a fun

13208
03:42:02,710 --> 03:42:02,720
that becomes a fun
 

13209
03:42:02,720 --> 03:42:05,349
that becomes a fun
entity to have at a party and

13210
03:42:05,349 --> 03:42:05,359
entity to have at a party and
 

13211
03:42:05,359 --> 03:42:08,550
entity to have at a party and
with humans so like uh it's a mix of wit

13212
03:42:08,550 --> 03:42:08,560
with humans so like uh it's a mix of wit
 

13213
03:42:08,560 --> 03:42:10,550

and i think that when you get people to
outrage they take sides

03:43:18,309 --> 03:43:18,319
outrage they take sides
 

13277

03:43:20,160 --> 03:43:21,670
and taking sides is really bad but i
think that we're all beginning to see

03:43:21,670 --> 03:43:21,680
think that we're all beginning to see
 

13281
03:43:21,680 --> 03:43:23,590
think that we're all beginning to see
this and i think that actually

13282
03:43:23,590 --> 03:43:23,600
this and i think that actually
 

13283
03:43:23,600 --> 03:43:25,349
this and i think that actually
i'm very optimistic about how things

13284
03:43:25,349 --> 03:43:25,359
i'm very optimistic about how things
 

13285
03:43:25,359 --> 03:43:27,110

will evolve because

13286
03:43:27,110 --> 03:43:27,120
will evolve because
 

13287
03:43:27,120 --> 03:43:28,389
will evolve because
you know

13288
03:43:28,389 --> 03:43:28,399
you know
 

13289
03:43:28,399 --> 03:43:30,150
you know
i wonder how much

13305
03:43:44,080 --> 03:43:46,550
some degree
but i wonder how much

13306

but i wonder how much
 

13307
03:43:46,560 --> 03:43:48,389
but i wonder how much
voice does it give to

it's fascinating to think about all the
 

13463
03:46:20,640 --> 03:46:22,389
it's fascinating to think about all the

different ways that
 

13465
03:46:22,399 --> 03:46:25,030
different ways that
hybridization that merger can happen i

13466

hybridization that merger can happen i
 

13467
03:46:25,040 --> 03:46:26,630
hybridization that merger can happen i
mean we have currently have the

13468
03:46:26,630 --> 03:46:26,640
mean we have currently have the
 

13469
03:46:26,640 --> 03:46:28,389
mean we have currently have the
smartphone so there's already a hybrid

13470
03:46:28,389 --> 03:46:28,399
smartphone so there's already a hybrid
 

13471
03:46:28,399 --> 03:46:29,990

but there's all kinds of ways that
 

13473
03:46:30,000 --> 03:46:32,710
but there's all kinds of ways that
hybrid happens how we and other

13474
03:46:32,710 --> 03:46:32,720
hybrid happens how we and other
 

13475
03:46:32,720 --> 03:46:35,590
hybrid happens how we and other

um he tweeted dinner with lee cronin we
 

13543
03:47:48,319 --> 03:47:50,790
um he tweeted dinner with lee cronin we
discussed that while we can translate

03:47:50,790 --> 03:47:50,800
discussed that while we can translate
 

13545
03:47:50,800 --> 03:47:52,950

the structure of the universe might be

03:47:56,309 --> 03:47:56,319
the structure of the universe might be
 

13551
03:47:56,319 --> 03:47:58,630
the structure of the universe might be
given by wakes of non-existence in a

13557
03:48:05,680 --> 03:48:07,910

and then he followed on saying face to

13558
03:48:07,910 --> 03:48:07,920
and then he followed on saying face to
 

13559
03:48:07,920 --> 03:48:09,750
and then he followed on saying face to
face is the best

13560
03:48:09,750 --> 03:48:09,760
face is the best
 

13561
03:48:09,760 --> 03:48:12,229
face is the best
so the the dinner was face to face what

13562
03:48:12,229 --> 03:48:12,239
so the the dinner was face to face what
 

13563
03:48:12,239 --> 03:48:15,910
so the the dinner was face to face what
is joshua talking about uh in wakes

13564
03:48:15,910 --> 03:48:15,920
is joshua talking about uh in wakes
 

13565
03:48:15,920 --> 03:48:18,630
is joshua talking about uh in wakes
quote wakes of non-existence in a

13566
03:48:18,630 --> 03:48:18,640

which exists by default

which exists by default
 

13573
03:48:25,439 --> 03:48:26,550
which exists by default
so

13574
03:48:26,550 --> 03:48:26,560
so
 

13575
03:48:26,560 --> 03:48:28,389
so
automa exists by default

13576
03:48:28,389 --> 03:48:28,399
automa exists by default
 

13577
03:48:28,399 --> 03:48:29,670
automa exists by default
apparently

apparently
 

13579
03:48:29,680 --> 03:48:31,590
apparently
and then there's wakes of non-existence

13580
03:48:31,590 --> 03:48:31,600
and then there's wakes of non-existence
 

13581
03:48:31,600 --> 03:48:33,990
and then there's wakes of non-existence
what the hell is the non-existence in

13582
03:48:33,990 --> 03:48:34,000
what the hell is the non-existence in
 

13583
03:48:34,000 --> 03:48:37,030

i would argue

13674
03:50:15,269 --> 03:50:15,279
i would argue
 

13675
03:50:15,279 --> 03:50:17,429
i would argue
um and i think um this is not

13676
03:50:17,429 --> 03:50:17,439
um and i think um this is not
 

13677
03:50:17,439 --> 03:50:19,349

biology is not even a turing machine
 

13683
03:50:22,560 --> 03:50:24,550
biology is not even a turing machine
right and because turing machines don't

13684
03:50:24,550 --> 03:50:24,560
right and because turing machines don't
 

13685

right and because turing machines don't
evolve right there's a there is this

03:50:28,160 --> 03:50:30,070
problem that people see chewing machines
everywhere but isn't it interesting the

13690
03:50:30,070 --> 03:50:30,080
everywhere but isn't it interesting the
 

13691
03:50:30,080 --> 03:50:31,830
everywhere but isn't it interesting the
universe gave rise to biology that gave

13692
03:50:31,830 --> 03:50:31,840
universe gave rise to biology that gave
 

13693
03:50:31,840 --> 03:50:33,269
universe gave rise to biology that gave
rise to intelligence that gave rise to

13694
03:50:33,269 --> 03:50:33,279
rise to intelligence that gave rise to
 

13695
03:50:33,279 --> 03:50:35,510
rise to intelligence that gave rise to
alan turing who invented the abstraction

13696
03:50:35,510 --> 03:50:35,520
alan turing who invented the abstraction
 

13697
03:50:35,520 --> 03:50:38,070
alan turing who invented the abstraction
of the turing machine and allowed us to

13698
03:50:38,070 --> 03:50:38,080
of the turing machine and allowed us to
 

13699
03:50:38,080 --> 03:50:39,510
of the turing machine and allowed us to
digitize

13700
03:50:39,510 --> 03:50:39,520
digitize
 

13701
03:50:39,520 --> 03:50:40,469
digitize
and

13702
03:50:40,469 --> 03:50:40,479
and
 

13703
03:50:40,479 --> 03:50:41,590
and
and so

13704
03:50:41,590 --> 03:50:41,600
and so
 

13705
03:50:41,600 --> 03:50:43,429
and so
i've been looking for the mystery at the

13706
03:50:43,429 --> 03:50:43,439
i've been looking for the mystery at the
 

13707
03:50:43,439 --> 03:50:44,790
i've been looking for the mystery at the
origin of life the origin of

13708
03:50:44,790 --> 03:50:44,800
origin of life the origin of
 

13709
03:50:44,800 --> 03:50:46,389
origin of life the origin of
intelligence and the origin of this and

13710
03:50:46,389 --> 03:50:46,399
intelligence and the origin of this and
 

13711
03:50:46,399 --> 03:50:49,269
intelligence and the origin of this and
i when i discuss with yasha i think

13712
03:50:49,269 --> 03:50:49,279
i when i discuss with yasha i think
 

13713
03:50:49,279 --> 03:50:51,269
i when i discuss with yasha i think
yoshi he was saying well the universe of

13714
03:50:51,269 --> 03:50:51,279
yoshi he was saying well the universe of
 

13715
03:50:51,279 --> 03:50:53,189
yoshi he was saying well the universe of
course the universe is a turing machine

13716
03:50:53,189 --> 03:50:53,199
course the universe is a turing machine
 

13717
03:50:53,199 --> 03:50:54,710
course the universe is a turing machine
of course there's a there's a hyper

13718
03:50:54,710 --> 03:50:54,720
of course there's a there's a hyper
 

13719
03:50:54,720 --> 03:50:56,630
of course there's a there's a hyper
computer there and i've and i think we

13720
03:50:56,630 --> 03:50:56,640
computer there and i've and i think we
 

13721
03:50:56,640 --> 03:50:58,630
computer there and i've and i think we
got kind of trapped in our words and

13722
03:50:58,630 --> 03:50:58,640
got kind of trapped in our words and
 

13723
03:50:58,640 --> 03:50:59,750
got kind of trapped in our words and
terms

13724
03:50:59,750 --> 03:50:59,760
terms
 

13725
03:50:59,760 --> 03:51:01,429
terms
because of course it's possible for a

13726
03:51:01,429 --> 03:51:01,439
because of course it's possible for a
 

13727
03:51:01,439 --> 03:51:03,429
because of course it's possible for a
turing machine or computers to exist in

13728
03:51:03,429 --> 03:51:03,439
turing machine or computers to exist in
 

13729
03:51:03,439 --> 03:51:05,269
turing machine or computers to exist in
the universe we have them

13730
03:51:05,269 --> 03:51:05,279
the universe we have them
 

13731
03:51:05,279 --> 03:51:07,670
the universe we have them
but what i'm trying to understand is

13732
03:51:07,670 --> 03:51:07,680
but what i'm trying to understand is
 

13733
03:51:07,680 --> 03:51:09,429
but what i'm trying to understand is
where did the transition continuous to

13734
03:51:09,429 --> 03:51:09,439
where did the transition continuous to
 

13735
03:51:09,439 --> 03:51:11,189
where did the transition continuous to
discrete occur

13736
03:51:11,189 --> 03:51:11,199
discrete occur
 

13737
03:51:11,199 --> 03:51:13,590
discrete occur
and i've been this is because of my

13738
03:51:13,590 --> 03:51:13,600
and i've been this is because of my
 

13739
03:51:13,600 --> 03:51:16,950
and i've been this is because of my
my general foolishness of understanding

13740
03:51:16,950 --> 03:51:16,960
my general foolishness of understanding
 

13741
03:51:16,960 --> 03:51:17,830
my general foolishness of understanding
um

13742
03:51:17,830 --> 03:51:17,840
um
 

13743
03:51:17,840 --> 03:51:19,349
um
the continuous

13744
03:51:19,349 --> 03:51:19,359
the continuous
 

13745
03:51:19,359 --> 03:51:20,229
the continuous
but

13746
03:51:20,229 --> 03:51:20,239
but
 

13747
03:51:20,239 --> 03:51:21,750
but
i guess what i'm

13748
03:51:21,750 --> 03:51:21,760
i guess what i'm
 

13749
03:51:21,760 --> 03:51:23,429
i guess what i'm
trying to say is

13750
03:51:23,429 --> 03:51:23,439
trying to say is
 

13751
03:51:23,439 --> 03:51:25,349
trying to say is
there were constructors before they were

13752
03:51:25,349 --> 03:51:25,359
there were constructors before they were
 

13753
03:51:25,359 --> 03:51:26,630
there were constructors before they were
abstractors

13754
03:51:26,630 --> 03:51:26,640
abstractors
 

13755
03:51:26,640 --> 03:51:27,830
abstractors
because

13756
03:51:27,830 --> 03:51:27,840
because
 

13757
03:51:27,840 --> 03:51:29,590
because
how did the universe abstract itself

13758
03:51:29,590 --> 03:51:29,600
how did the universe abstract itself
 

13759
03:51:29,600 --> 03:51:31,349
how did the universe abstract itself
into existence

13760
03:51:31,349 --> 03:51:31,359
into existence
 

13761
03:51:31,359 --> 03:51:32,870
into existence
and it goes back to earlier saying could

13762
03:51:32,870 --> 03:51:32,880
and it goes back to earlier saying could
 

13763
03:51:32,880 --> 03:51:34,630
and it goes back to earlier saying could
the universe intelligence have come

13764
03:51:34,630 --> 03:51:34,640
the universe intelligence have come
 

13765
03:51:34,640 --> 03:51:36,309
the universe intelligence have come
first what's the constructor what's an

13766
03:51:36,309 --> 03:51:36,319
first what's the constructor what's an
 

13767
03:51:36,319 --> 03:51:38,550
first what's the constructor what's an
abstractor so the abstractor is the

13768
03:51:38,550 --> 03:51:38,560
abstractor so the abstractor is the
 

13769
03:51:38,560 --> 03:51:40,469
abstractor so the abstractor is the
ability of say

13770
03:51:40,469 --> 03:51:40,479
ability of say
 

13771
03:51:40,479 --> 03:51:43,670
ability of say
of alan turing and goodall and very and

to in to think about the mathematical

13776
03:51:47,670 --> 03:51:47,680
to in to think about the mathematical
 

13777
03:51:47,680 --> 03:51:48,790
to in to think about the mathematical
universe

13778
03:51:48,790 --> 03:51:48,800
universe
 

13779
03:51:48,800 --> 03:51:50,630
universe
and to label things

13780
03:51:50,630 --> 03:51:50,640
and to label things
 

13781
03:51:50,640 --> 03:51:52,229
and to label things
and then from those labels to come up

13782
03:51:52,229 --> 03:51:52,239
and then from those labels to come up
 

13783
03:51:52,239 --> 03:51:54,309
and then from those labels to come up
with a set of axioms

13784
03:51:54,309 --> 03:51:54,319
with a set of axioms
 

13785
03:51:54,319 --> 03:51:55,990
with a set of axioms
with those labels

13786
03:51:55,990 --> 03:51:56,000
with those labels
 

13787
03:51:56,000 --> 03:51:57,990
with those labels
and to basically understand the universe

13788
03:51:57,990 --> 03:51:58,000
and to basically understand the universe
 

13789
03:51:58,000 --> 03:52:00,070
and to basically understand the universe
mathematically and say okay i can label

13790
03:52:00,070 --> 03:52:00,080
mathematically and say okay i can label
 

13791
03:52:00,080 --> 03:52:00,950
mathematically and say okay i can label
things

13792
03:52:00,950 --> 03:52:00,960
things
 

13793
03:52:00,960 --> 03:52:03,030
things
but where did the labeler come from

13794
03:52:03,030 --> 03:52:03,040
but where did the labeler come from
 

13795
03:52:03,040 --> 03:52:05,590
but where did the labeler come from
where is the prime labeler even if the

13796
03:52:05,590 --> 03:52:05,600
where is the prime labeler even if the
 

13797
03:52:05,600 --> 03:52:07,110
where is the prime labeler even if the
universe

13798
03:52:07,110 --> 03:52:07,120
universe
 

13799
03:52:07,120 --> 03:52:08,710
universe
is not

13800
03:52:08,710 --> 03:52:08,720
is not
 

13801
03:52:08,720 --> 03:52:12,309
is not
a touring computer

13802
03:52:12,309 --> 03:52:12,319
a touring computer
 

13803
03:52:12,319 --> 03:52:14,070
a touring computer
does that negate the possibility that a

13804
03:52:14,070 --> 03:52:14,080
does that negate the possibility that a
 

13805
03:52:14,080 --> 03:52:15,349
does that negate the possibility that a
touring computer can simulate the

13806
03:52:15,349 --> 03:52:15,359
touring computer can simulate the
 

13807
03:52:15,359 --> 03:52:17,189
touring computer can simulate the
universe like just because the

13808
03:52:17,189 --> 03:52:17,199
universe like just because the
 

13809
03:52:17,199 --> 03:52:20,870
universe like just because the
abstraction was formed at a later time

13810
03:52:20,870 --> 03:52:20,880
abstraction was formed at a later time
 

13811
03:52:20,880 --> 03:52:22,790
abstraction was formed at a later time
does that mean that abstraction this is

13812
03:52:22,790 --> 03:52:22,800
does that mean that abstraction this is
 

13813
03:52:22,800 --> 03:52:24,790
does that mean that abstraction this is
to our cellular automata conversation

13814
03:52:24,790 --> 03:52:24,800
to our cellular automata conversation
 

13815
03:52:24,800 --> 03:52:26,150
to our cellular automata conversation
yeah you were taking away some of the

13816
03:52:26,150 --> 03:52:26,160
yeah you were taking away some of the
 

13817
03:52:26,160 --> 03:52:28,389
yeah you were taking away some of the
magic from the cellular automata because

13818
03:52:28,389 --> 03:52:28,399
magic from the cellular automata because
 

13819
03:52:28,399 --> 03:52:30,469
magic from the cellular automata because
very intelligent biological systems came

13820
03:52:30,469 --> 03:52:30,479
very intelligent biological systems came
 

13821
03:52:30,479 --> 03:52:32,550
very intelligent biological systems came
up with that cellular automata well this

13822
03:52:32,550 --> 03:52:32,560
up with that cellular automata well this
 

13823
03:52:32,560 --> 03:52:34,070
up with that cellular automata well this
is where the existence is the default

13824
03:52:34,070 --> 03:52:34,080
is where the existence is the default
 

13825
03:52:34,080 --> 03:52:36,150
is where the existence is the default
right is it does the fact that we exist

13826
03:52:36,150 --> 03:52:36,160
right is it does the fact that we exist
 

13827
03:52:36,160 --> 03:52:37,990
right is it does the fact that we exist
and we can come up with a turing machine

13828
03:52:37,990 --> 03:52:38,000
and we can come up with a turing machine
 

13829
03:52:38,000 --> 03:52:39,510
and we can come up with a turing machine
does that mean the universe

13830
03:52:39,510 --> 03:52:39,520
does that mean the universe
 

13831
03:52:39,520 --> 03:52:41,830
does that mean the universe
has to be a turing machine as well

13832
03:52:41,830 --> 03:52:41,840
has to be a turing machine as well
 

13833
03:52:41,840 --> 03:52:42,710
has to be a turing machine as well
but

13834
03:52:42,710 --> 03:52:42,720
but
 

13835
03:52:42,720 --> 03:52:43,910
but
can it be a touring machine though

13836
03:52:43,910 --> 03:52:43,920
can it be a touring machine though
 

13837
03:52:43,920 --> 03:52:44,870
can it be a touring machine though
that's a

13838
03:52:44,870 --> 03:52:44,880
that's a
 

13839
03:52:44,880 --> 03:52:47,830
that's a
that has to be in the canopy can it be

13840
03:52:47,830 --> 03:52:47,840
that has to be in the canopy can it be
 

13841
03:52:47,840 --> 03:52:49,030
that has to be in the canopy can it be
sure

13842
03:52:49,030 --> 03:52:49,040
sure
 

13843
03:52:49,040 --> 03:52:50,150
sure
um

13844
03:52:50,150 --> 03:52:50,160
um
 

13845
03:52:50,160 --> 03:52:52,630
um
i don't know i don't understand if it

13846
03:52:52,630 --> 03:52:52,640
i don't know i don't understand if it
 

13847
03:52:52,640 --> 03:52:54,630
i don't know i don't understand if it
has to be or not can it be

13848
03:52:54,630 --> 03:52:54,640
has to be or not can it be
 

13849
03:52:54,640 --> 03:52:56,790
has to be or not can it be
but can the universe have

13850
03:52:56,790 --> 03:52:56,800
but can the universe have
 

13851
03:52:56,800 --> 03:52:59,510
but can the universe have
turing machines in it sure they do exist

13852
03:52:59,510 --> 03:52:59,520
turing machines in it sure they do exist
 

13853
03:52:59,520 --> 03:53:00,870
turing machines in it sure they do exist
now

13854
03:53:00,870 --> 03:53:00,880
now
 

13855
03:53:00,880 --> 03:53:03,750
now
i'm wondering though

13856
03:53:03,750 --> 03:53:03,760
i'm wondering though
 

13857
03:53:03,760 --> 03:53:05,429
i'm wondering though
maybe and this is this is written if

13858
03:53:05,429 --> 03:53:05,439
maybe and this is this is written if
 

13859
03:53:05,439 --> 03:53:07,269
maybe and this is this is written if
things get really hairy

13860
03:53:07,269 --> 03:53:07,279
things get really hairy
 

13861
03:53:07,279 --> 03:53:08,870
things get really hairy
is i think the universe maybe in the

13862
03:53:08,870 --> 03:53:08,880
is i think the universe maybe in the
 

13863
03:53:08,880 --> 03:53:11,429
is i think the universe maybe in the
past did not have the computational

13864
03:53:11,429 --> 03:53:11,439
past did not have the computational
 

13865
03:53:11,439 --> 03:53:16,229
past did not have the computational
power that it has now

13866
03:53:16,229 --> 03:53:16,239

 

13867
03:53:16,239 --> 03:53:17,670

this

13868
03:53:17,670 --> 03:53:17,680
this
 

13869
03:53:17,680 --> 03:53:19,670
this
this is almost like a

13870
03:53:19,670 --> 03:53:19,680
this is almost like a
 

13871
03:53:19,680 --> 03:53:21,510
this is almost like a
law of physics kind of

13872
03:53:21,510 --> 03:53:21,520
law of physics kind of
 

13873
03:53:21,520 --> 03:53:22,389
law of physics kind of
so the

13874
03:53:22,389 --> 03:53:22,399
so the
 

13875
03:53:22,399 --> 03:53:26,950
so the
computational power is not

13876
03:53:26,950 --> 03:53:26,960

 

13877
03:53:26,960 --> 03:53:29,269

you can get some free lunch yeah i mean

13878
03:53:29,269 --> 03:53:29,279
you can get some free lunch yeah i mean
 

13879
03:53:29,279 --> 03:53:31,269
you can get some free lunch yeah i mean
with the fact that we now we sit here in

13880
03:53:31,269 --> 03:53:31,279
with the fact that we now we sit here in
 

13881
03:53:31,279 --> 03:53:33,110
with the fact that we now we sit here in
this period in time and we can imagine

13882
03:53:33,110 --> 03:53:33,120
this period in time and we can imagine
 

13883
03:53:33,120 --> 03:53:34,550
this period in time and we can imagine
all these robots and all these machines

13884
03:53:34,550 --> 03:53:34,560
all these robots and all these machines
 

13885
03:53:34,560 --> 03:53:36,870
all these robots and all these machines
and we built them and so we can easily

13886
03:53:36,870 --> 03:53:36,880
and we built them and so we can easily
 

13887
03:53:36,880 --> 03:53:38,389
and we built them and so we can easily
imagine going back in time that the

13888
03:53:38,389 --> 03:53:38,399
imagine going back in time that the
 

13889
03:53:38,399 --> 03:53:40,150
imagine going back in time that the
universe was capable of having them but

13890
03:53:40,150 --> 03:53:40,160
universe was capable of having them but
 

13891
03:53:40,160 --> 03:53:41,830
universe was capable of having them but
i don't think it can

13892
03:53:41,830 --> 03:53:41,840
i don't think it can
 

13893
03:53:41,840 --> 03:53:43,269
i don't think it can
so the universe may have been a lot

13894
03:53:43,269 --> 03:53:43,279
so the universe may have been a lot
 

13895
03:53:43,279 --> 03:53:45,670
so the universe may have been a lot
dumber computationally and i think

13896
03:53:45,670 --> 03:53:45,680
dumber computationally and i think
 

13897
03:53:45,680 --> 03:53:47,590
dumber computationally and i think
that's why i don't want to go back to

13898
03:53:47,590 --> 03:53:47,600
that's why i don't want to go back to
 

13899
03:53:47,600 --> 03:53:49,030
that's why i don't want to go back to
the time discussion but i think it has

13900
03:53:49,030 --> 03:53:49,040
the time discussion but i think it has
 

13901
03:53:49,040 --> 03:53:51,189
the time discussion but i think it has
some relationship with it the universe

13902
03:53:51,189 --> 03:53:51,199
some relationship with it the universe
 

13903
03:53:51,199 --> 03:53:53,110
some relationship with it the universe
is basically smarter now than it used to

13904
03:53:53,110 --> 03:53:53,120
is basically smarter now than it used to
 

13905
03:53:53,120 --> 03:53:54,469
is basically smarter now than it used to
be and it's going to continue getting

13906
03:53:54,469 --> 03:53:54,479
be and it's going to continue getting
 

13907
03:53:54,479 --> 03:53:57,349
be and it's going to continue getting
smart smarter over time because of

13908
03:53:57,349 --> 03:53:57,359
smart smarter over time because of
 

13909
03:53:57,359 --> 03:54:00,070
smart smarter over time because of
novelty generation and the ability to

13910
03:54:00,070 --> 03:54:00,080
novelty generation and the ability to
 

13911
03:54:00,080 --> 03:54:01,670
novelty generation and the ability to
create objects within objects within

13912
03:54:01,670 --> 03:54:01,680
create objects within objects within
 

13913
03:54:01,680 --> 03:54:04,150
create objects within objects within
objects you know there's a perhaps it's

13914
03:54:04,150 --> 03:54:04,160
objects you know there's a perhaps it's
 

13915
03:54:04,160 --> 03:54:05,670
objects you know there's a perhaps it's
grounded in physics there's this

13916
03:54:05,670 --> 03:54:05,680
grounded in physics there's this
 

13917
03:54:05,680 --> 03:54:07,750
grounded in physics there's this
intuition of conservation

13918
03:54:07,750 --> 03:54:07,760
intuition of conservation
 

13919
03:54:07,760 --> 03:54:09,830
intuition of conservation
yeah that stuff is conserved like like

13920
03:54:09,830 --> 03:54:09,840
yeah that stuff is conserved like like
 

13921
03:54:09,840 --> 03:54:12,389
yeah that stuff is conserved like like
you're not you've always had all

13922
03:54:12,389 --> 03:54:12,399
you're not you've always had all
 

13923
03:54:12,399 --> 03:54:13,590
you're not you've always had all
everything

13924
03:54:13,590 --> 03:54:13,600
everything
 

13925
03:54:13,600 --> 03:54:15,349
everything
you're just rearranging books on the

13926
03:54:15,349 --> 03:54:15,359
you're just rearranging books on the
 

13927
03:54:15,359 --> 03:54:17,189
you're just rearranging books on the
bookshelf

13928
03:54:17,189 --> 03:54:17,199
bookshelf
 

13929
03:54:17,199 --> 03:54:18,469
bookshelf
through time

13930
03:54:18,469 --> 03:54:18,479
through time
 

13931
03:54:18,479 --> 03:54:20,630
through time
so you're saying like new books are

13932
03:54:20,630 --> 03:54:20,640
so you're saying like new books are
 

13933
03:54:20,640 --> 03:54:22,389
so you're saying like new books are
being written which laws you want to

13934
03:54:22,389 --> 03:54:22,399
being written which laws you want to
 

13935
03:54:22,399 --> 03:54:24,469
being written which laws you want to
break the origin of the origin of the

13936
03:54:24,469 --> 03:54:24,479
break the origin of the origin of the
 

13937
03:54:24,479 --> 03:54:25,670
break the origin of the origin of the
big bang

13938
03:54:25,670 --> 03:54:25,680
big bang
 

13939
03:54:25,680 --> 03:54:27,349
big bang
you had to break the second law because

13940
03:54:27,349 --> 03:54:27,359
you had to break the second law because
 

13941
03:54:27,359 --> 03:54:29,349
you had to break the second law because
we got order for free yeah

13942
03:54:29,349 --> 03:54:29,359
we got order for free yeah
 

13943
03:54:29,359 --> 03:54:30,630
we got order for free yeah
well what i'm telling now is that the

13944
03:54:30,630 --> 03:54:30,640
well what i'm telling now is that the
 

13945
03:54:30,640 --> 03:54:33,269
well what i'm telling now is that the
energy isn't conserved in the universe

13946
03:54:33,269 --> 03:54:33,279
energy isn't conserved in the universe
 

13947
03:54:33,279 --> 03:54:35,510
energy isn't conserved in the universe
oh it's the second law okay i got you so

13948
03:54:35,510 --> 03:54:35,520
oh it's the second law okay i got you so
 

13949
03:54:35,520 --> 03:54:40,710
oh it's the second law okay i got you so
because but not in a mad way okay so

13950
03:54:40,710 --> 03:54:40,720

 

13951
03:54:40,720 --> 03:54:42,790

computation

13952
03:54:42,790 --> 03:54:42,800
computation
 

13953
03:54:42,800 --> 03:54:44,950
computation
potentially is not conserved which is a

13954
03:54:44,950 --> 03:54:44,960
potentially is not conserved which is a
 

13955
03:54:44,960 --> 03:54:46,389
potentially is not conserved which is a
fascinating idea

13956
03:54:46,389 --> 03:54:46,399
fascinating idea
 

13957
03:54:46,399 --> 03:54:47,830
fascinating idea
intelligence

13958
03:54:47,830 --> 03:54:47,840
intelligence
 

13959
03:54:47,840 --> 03:54:50,229
intelligence
is not conserved

13960
03:54:50,229 --> 03:54:50,239
is not conserved
 

13961
03:54:50,239 --> 03:54:54,469
is not conserved
complexity is not conserved

13962
03:54:54,469 --> 03:54:54,479

 

13963
03:54:54,479 --> 03:54:58,790

i suppose that's deeply connected to uh

13964
03:54:58,790 --> 03:54:58,800
i suppose that's deeply connected to uh
 

13965
03:54:58,800 --> 03:55:00,950
i suppose that's deeply connected to uh
time being fundamental

13966
03:55:00,950 --> 03:55:00,960
time being fundamental
 

13967
03:55:00,960 --> 03:55:03,030
time being fundamental
the natural consequence of that

13968
03:55:03,030 --> 03:55:03,040
the natural consequence of that
 

13969
03:55:03,040 --> 03:55:05,110
the natural consequence of that
is if time is fundamental

13970
03:55:05,110 --> 03:55:05,120
is if time is fundamental
 

13971
03:55:05,120 --> 03:55:08,150
is if time is fundamental
and the universe is inflating in time

13972
03:55:08,150 --> 03:55:08,160
and the universe is inflating in time
 

13973
03:55:08,160 --> 03:55:09,510
and the universe is inflating in time
if you like

13974
03:55:09,510 --> 03:55:09,520
if you like
 

13975
03:55:09,520 --> 03:55:11,429
if you like
then there are one or two conservation

13976
03:55:11,429 --> 03:55:11,439
then there are one or two conservation
 

13977
03:55:11,439 --> 03:55:14,309
then there are one or two conservation
laws that we need to have a look at and

13978
03:55:14,309 --> 03:55:14,319
laws that we need to have a look at and
 

13979
03:55:14,319 --> 03:55:16,070
laws that we need to have a look at and
i wonder if that means the total energy

13980
03:55:16,070 --> 03:55:16,080
i wonder if that means the total energy
 

13981
03:55:16,080 --> 03:55:17,590
i wonder if that means the total energy
of the universe is actually increasing

13982
03:55:17,590 --> 03:55:17,600
of the universe is actually increasing
 

13983
03:55:17,600 --> 03:55:18,790
of the universe is actually increasing
over time

13984
03:55:18,790 --> 03:55:18,800
over time
 

13985
03:55:18,800 --> 03:55:20,469
over time
and i might this may be completely

13986
03:55:20,469 --> 03:55:20,479
and i might this may be completely
 

13987
03:55:20,479 --> 03:55:21,830
and i might this may be completely
ludicrous but

13988
03:55:21,830 --> 03:55:21,840
ludicrous but
 

13989
03:55:21,840 --> 03:55:24,469
ludicrous but
um we do have all this dark energy

13990
03:55:24,469 --> 03:55:24,479
um we do have all this dark energy
 

13991
03:55:24,479 --> 03:55:27,030
um we do have all this dark energy
that's we we have some anomalies let's

13992
03:55:27,030 --> 03:55:27,040
that's we we have some anomalies let's
 

13993
03:55:27,040 --> 03:55:29,510
that's we we have some anomalies let's
say dark matter and dark energy if we

13994
03:55:29,510 --> 03:55:29,520
say dark matter and dark energy if we
 

13995
03:55:29,520 --> 03:55:30,790
say dark matter and dark energy if we
don't add them in

13996
03:55:30,790 --> 03:55:30,800
don't add them in
 

13997
03:55:30,800 --> 03:55:33,590
don't add them in
galaxies so dark matter i think doesn't

13998
03:55:33,590 --> 03:55:33,600
galaxies so dark matter i think doesn't
 

13999
03:55:33,600 --> 03:55:35,189
galaxies so dark matter i think doesn't
doesn't hold

14000
03:55:35,189 --> 03:55:35,199
doesn't hold
 

14001
03:55:35,199 --> 03:55:36,550
doesn't hold
you know you need to hold the galaxies

14002
03:55:36,550 --> 03:55:36,560
you know you need to hold the galaxies
 

14003
03:55:36,560 --> 03:55:37,429
you know you need to hold the galaxies
together and there's some other

14004
03:55:37,429 --> 03:55:37,439
together and there's some other
 

14005
03:55:37,439 --> 03:55:39,670
together and there's some other
observational issues could dark energy

14006
03:55:39,670 --> 03:55:39,680
observational issues could dark energy
 

14007
03:55:39,680 --> 03:55:42,070
observational issues could dark energy
just be time

14008
03:55:42,070 --> 03:55:42,080
just be time
 

14009
03:55:42,080 --> 03:55:44,389
just be time
so figuring out what dark energy is

14010
03:55:44,389 --> 03:55:44,399
so figuring out what dark energy is
 

14011
03:55:44,399 --> 03:55:45,830
so figuring out what dark energy is
might give us some

14012
03:55:45,830 --> 03:55:45,840
might give us some
 

14013
03:55:45,840 --> 03:55:49,990
might give us some
uh deep clues about this

14014
03:55:49,990 --> 03:55:50,000

 

14015
03:55:50,000 --> 03:55:52,229

not just time but the consequences of

14016
03:55:52,229 --> 03:55:52,239
not just time but the consequences of
 

14017
03:55:52,239 --> 03:55:55,429
not just time but the consequences of
time so it could be that i mean i'm not

14018
03:55:55,429 --> 03:55:55,439
time so it could be that i mean i'm not
 

14019
03:55:55,439 --> 03:55:57,030
time so it could be that i mean i'm not
saying there's perpetual motions allowed

14020
03:55:57,030 --> 03:55:57,040
saying there's perpetual motions allowed
 

14021
03:55:57,040 --> 03:55:58,950
saying there's perpetual motions allowed
in this free lunch but i'm saying

14022
03:55:58,950 --> 03:55:58,960
in this free lunch but i'm saying
 

14023
03:55:58,960 --> 03:56:01,110
in this free lunch but i'm saying
if the universe is intrinsically

14024
03:56:01,110 --> 03:56:01,120
if the universe is intrinsically
 

14025
03:56:01,120 --> 03:56:02,710
if the universe is intrinsically
asymmetric

14026
03:56:02,710 --> 03:56:02,720
asymmetric
 

14027
03:56:02,720 --> 03:56:04,790
asymmetric
and it appears to be

14028
03:56:04,790 --> 03:56:04,800
and it appears to be
 

14029
03:56:04,800 --> 03:56:05,750
and it appears to be
um

14030
03:56:05,750 --> 03:56:05,760
um
 

14031
03:56:05,760 --> 03:56:07,670
um
and it's generating novelty and it

14032
03:56:07,670 --> 03:56:07,680
and it's generating novelty and it
 

14033
03:56:07,680 --> 03:56:09,189
and it's generating novelty and it
appears to

14034
03:56:09,189 --> 03:56:09,199
appears to
 

14035
03:56:09,199 --> 03:56:10,550
appears to
um couldn't that just be a

14036
03:56:10,550 --> 03:56:10,560
um couldn't that just be a
 

14037
03:56:10,560 --> 03:56:13,349
um couldn't that just be a
mechanistically how reality works

14038
03:56:13,349 --> 03:56:13,359
mechanistically how reality works
 

14039
03:56:13,359 --> 03:56:14,630
mechanistically how reality works
and therefore

14040
03:56:14,630 --> 03:56:14,640
and therefore
 

14041
03:56:14,640 --> 03:56:16,150
and therefore
um i don't

14042
03:56:16,150 --> 03:56:16,160
um i don't
 

14043
03:56:16,160 --> 03:56:18,950
um i don't
really like this idea that the and so i

14044
03:56:18,950 --> 03:56:18,960
really like this idea that the and so i
 

14045
03:56:18,960 --> 03:56:21,750
really like this idea that the and so i
want to live in a deterministic universe

14046
03:56:21,750 --> 03:56:21,760
want to live in a deterministic universe
 

14047
03:56:21,760 --> 03:56:22,830
want to live in a deterministic universe
that is

14048
03:56:22,830 --> 03:56:22,840
that is
 

14049
03:56:22,840 --> 03:56:25,510
that is
undetermined yeah right the only way i

14050
03:56:25,510 --> 03:56:25,520
undetermined yeah right the only way i
 

14051
03:56:25,520 --> 03:56:28,389
undetermined yeah right the only way i
can do that so time is fundamental

14052
03:56:28,389 --> 03:56:28,399
can do that so time is fundamental
 

14053
03:56:28,399 --> 03:56:29,750
can do that so time is fundamental
because otherwise it's all the rest of

14054
03:56:29,750 --> 03:56:29,760
because otherwise it's all the rest of
 

14055
03:56:29,760 --> 03:56:31,830
because otherwise it's all the rest of
us just it's just slight of hand because

14056
03:56:31,830 --> 03:56:31,840
us just it's just slight of hand because
 

14057
03:56:31,840 --> 03:56:33,830
us just it's just slight of hand because
the physicist will say yes everything's

14058
03:56:33,830 --> 03:56:33,840
the physicist will say yes everything's
 

14059
03:56:33,840 --> 03:56:35,189
the physicist will say yes everything's
deterministic

14060
03:56:35,189 --> 03:56:35,199
deterministic
 

14061
03:56:35,199 --> 03:56:36,469
deterministic
newton is

14062
03:56:36,469 --> 03:56:36,479
newton is
 

14063
03:56:36,479 --> 03:56:38,389
newton is
newtonian mechanics it's deterministic

14064
03:56:38,389 --> 03:56:38,399
newtonian mechanics it's deterministic
 

14065
03:56:38,399 --> 03:56:40,630
newtonian mechanics it's deterministic
quantum mechanics is deterministic let's

14066
03:56:40,630 --> 03:56:40,640
quantum mechanics is deterministic let's
 

14067
03:56:40,640 --> 03:56:42,309
quantum mechanics is deterministic let's
take the everedian view

14068
03:56:42,309 --> 03:56:42,319
take the everedian view
 

14069
03:56:42,319 --> 03:56:43,910
take the everedian view
and then basically we can just draw out

14070
03:56:43,910 --> 03:56:43,920
and then basically we can just draw out
 

14071
03:56:43,920 --> 03:56:46,229
and then basically we can just draw out
this massive universe branching but it

14072
03:56:46,229 --> 03:56:46,239
this massive universe branching but it
 

14073
03:56:46,239 --> 03:56:47,990
this massive universe branching but it
closes again we get it all back and

14074
03:56:47,990 --> 03:56:48,000
closes again we get it all back and
 

14075
03:56:48,000 --> 03:56:49,990
closes again we get it all back and
don't worry your feeling of free will is

14076
03:56:49,990 --> 03:56:50,000
don't worry your feeling of free will is
 

14077
03:56:50,000 --> 03:56:51,990
don't worry your feeling of free will is
effective

14078
03:56:51,990 --> 03:56:52,000
effective
 

14079
03:56:52,000 --> 03:56:53,429
effective
what the physicists are actually saying

14080
03:56:53,429 --> 03:56:53,439
what the physicists are actually saying
 

14081
03:56:53,439 --> 03:56:55,590
what the physicists are actually saying
is the entire future is mapped out and

14082
03:56:55,590 --> 03:56:55,600
is the entire future is mapped out and
 

14083
03:56:55,600 --> 03:56:57,990
is the entire future is mapped out and
that is clearly

14084
03:56:57,990 --> 03:56:58,000
that is clearly
 

14085
03:56:58,000 --> 03:56:59,990
that is clearly
problematical

14086
03:56:59,990 --> 03:57:00,000
problematical
 

14087
03:57:00,000 --> 03:57:01,910
problematical
and clearly

14088
03:57:01,910 --> 03:57:01,920
and clearly
 

14089
03:57:01,920 --> 03:57:03,590
and clearly
um

14090
03:57:03,590 --> 03:57:03,600
um
 

14091
03:57:03,600 --> 03:57:06,070
um
that's not so clear yeah it's just it's

14092
03:57:06,070 --> 03:57:06,080
that's not so clear yeah it's just it's
 

14093
03:57:06,080 --> 03:57:08,469
that's not so clear yeah it's just it's
just problematic it well

14094
03:57:08,469 --> 03:57:08,479
just problematic it well
 

14095
03:57:08,479 --> 03:57:10,710
just problematic it well
yeah yeah so it's it's okay because that

14096
03:57:10,710 --> 03:57:10,720
yeah yeah so it's it's okay because that
 

14097
03:57:10,720 --> 03:57:12,150
yeah yeah so it's it's okay because that
maybe is just the way it is it's

14098
03:57:12,150 --> 03:57:12,160
maybe is just the way it is it's
 

14099
03:57:12,160 --> 03:57:14,309
maybe is just the way it is it's
problematic to you well creature along

14100
03:57:14,309 --> 03:57:14,319
problematic to you well creature along
 

14101
03:57:14,319 --> 03:57:15,750
problematic to you well creature along
this timeline i want to reduce the

14102
03:57:15,750 --> 03:57:15,760
this timeline i want to reduce the
 

14103
03:57:15,760 --> 03:57:17,110
this timeline i want to reduce the
number of beliefs i need to understand

14104
03:57:17,110 --> 03:57:17,120
number of beliefs i need to understand
 

14105
03:57:17,120 --> 03:57:18,309
number of beliefs i need to understand
the universe

14106
03:57:18,309 --> 03:57:18,319
the universe
 

14107
03:57:18,319 --> 03:57:21,110
the universe
so if time is fundamental i don't need

14108
03:57:21,110 --> 03:57:21,120
so if time is fundamental i don't need
 

14109
03:57:21,120 --> 03:57:23,990
so if time is fundamental i don't need
to have magic order at the beginning and

14110
03:57:23,990 --> 03:57:24,000
to have magic order at the beginning and
 

14111
03:57:24,000 --> 03:57:26,070
to have magic order at the beginning and
i don't need a second law but you do

14112
03:57:26,070 --> 03:57:26,080
i don't need a second law but you do
 

14113
03:57:26,080 --> 03:57:27,750
i don't need a second law but you do
need the magical belief that time is

14114
03:57:27,750 --> 03:57:27,760
need the magical belief that time is
 

14115
03:57:27,760 --> 03:57:30,150
need the magical belief that time is
fundamental well i need the i need the

14116
03:57:30,150 --> 03:57:30,160
fundamental well i need the i need the
 

14117
03:57:30,160 --> 03:57:32,630
fundamental well i need the i need the
observation that i'm seeing to be just

14118
03:57:32,630 --> 03:57:32,640
observation that i'm seeing to be just
 

14119
03:57:32,640 --> 03:57:34,469
observation that i'm seeing to be just
like how it is all the way down but the

14120
03:57:34,469 --> 03:57:34,479
like how it is all the way down but the
 

14121
03:57:34,479 --> 03:57:37,110
like how it is all the way down but the
earth also looks flat

14122
03:57:37,110 --> 03:57:37,120
earth also looks flat
 

14123
03:57:37,120 --> 03:57:39,110
earth also looks flat
if you cut if you agree

14124
03:57:39,110 --> 03:57:39,120
if you cut if you agree
 

14125
03:57:39,120 --> 03:57:41,429
if you cut if you agree
with your observation so we can't

14126
03:57:41,429 --> 03:57:41,439
with your observation so we can't
 

14127
03:57:41,439 --> 03:57:43,590
with your observation so we can't
necessarily trust our observation i know

14128
03:57:43,590 --> 03:57:43,600
necessarily trust our observation i know
 

14129
03:57:43,600 --> 03:57:45,189
necessarily trust our observation i know
the earth isn't flat because i can send

14130
03:57:45,189 --> 03:57:45,199
the earth isn't flat because i can send
 

14131
03:57:45,199 --> 03:57:51,110
the earth isn't flat because i can send
a satellite into space

14132
03:57:51,110 --> 03:57:51,120

 

14133
03:57:51,120 --> 03:57:52,309

but i'm saying i'm going to do

14134
03:57:52,309 --> 03:57:52,319
but i'm saying i'm going to do
 

14135
03:57:52,319 --> 03:57:54,950
but i'm saying i'm going to do
experiments that start to show

14136
03:57:54,950 --> 03:57:54,960
experiments that start to show
 

14137
03:57:54,960 --> 03:57:58,070
experiments that start to show
i mean i i think that it's worth so

14138
03:57:58,070 --> 03:57:58,080
i mean i i think that it's worth so
 

14139
03:57:58,080 --> 03:58:00,150
i mean i i think that it's worth so
if you can't so if i cannot do an

14140
03:58:00,150 --> 03:58:00,160
if you can't so if i cannot do an
 

14141
03:58:00,160 --> 03:58:02,469
if you can't so if i cannot do an
experiment or a thought experiment

14142
03:58:02,469 --> 03:58:02,479
experiment or a thought experiment
 

14143
03:58:02,479 --> 03:58:04,790
experiment or a thought experiment
that will test this assumption then the

14144
03:58:04,790 --> 03:58:04,800
that will test this assumption then the
 

14145
03:58:04,800 --> 03:58:06,550
that will test this assumption then the
assumption is without merit really in

14146
03:58:06,550 --> 03:58:06,560
assumption is without merit really in
 

14147
03:58:06,560 --> 03:58:07,590
assumption is without merit really in
the end

14148
03:58:07,590 --> 03:58:07,600
the end
 

14149
03:58:07,600 --> 03:58:10,389
the end
you know that's it's fine yeah so that's

14150
03:58:10,389 --> 03:58:10,399
you know that's it's fine yeah so that's
 

14151
03:58:10,399 --> 03:58:12,150
you know that's it's fine yeah so that's
a beautiful idea you hold yourself to

14152
03:58:12,150 --> 03:58:12,160
a beautiful idea you hold yourself to
 

14153
03:58:12,160 --> 03:58:14,630
a beautiful idea you hold yourself to
that's that's uh that's

14154
03:58:14,630 --> 03:58:14,640
that's that's uh that's
 

14155
03:58:14,640 --> 03:58:17,030
that's that's uh that's
given that you think deeply in a

14156
03:58:17,030 --> 03:58:17,040
given that you think deeply in a
 

14157
03:58:17,040 --> 03:58:18,630
given that you think deeply in a
philosophical way

14158
03:58:18,630 --> 03:58:18,640
philosophical way
 

14159
03:58:18,640 --> 03:58:20,070
philosophical way
you think about some of these really

14160
03:58:20,070 --> 03:58:20,080
you think about some of these really
 

14161
03:58:20,080 --> 03:58:21,269
you think about some of these really
important

14162
03:58:21,269 --> 03:58:21,279
important
 

14163
03:58:21,279 --> 03:58:22,630
important
issues and you have theoretical

14164
03:58:22,630 --> 03:58:22,640
issues and you have theoretical
 

14165
03:58:22,640 --> 03:58:24,229
issues and you have theoretical
frameworks like

14166
03:58:24,229 --> 03:58:24,239
frameworks like
 

14167
03:58:24,239 --> 03:58:27,030
frameworks like
uh assembly theory

14168
03:58:27,030 --> 03:58:27,040
uh assembly theory
 

14169
03:58:27,040 --> 03:58:28,830
uh assembly theory
it's really nice that you're always

14170
03:58:28,830 --> 03:58:28,840
it's really nice that you're always
 

14171
03:58:28,840 --> 03:58:31,189
it's really nice that you're always
grounded with experiment

14172
03:58:31,189 --> 03:58:31,199
grounded with experiment
 

14173
03:58:31,199 --> 03:58:33,110
grounded with experiment
that's what i have that's so refreshing

14174
03:58:33,110 --> 03:58:33,120
that's what i have that's so refreshing
 

14175
03:58:33,120 --> 03:58:35,349
that's what i have that's so refreshing
that's so beautifully refreshing

14176
03:58:35,349 --> 03:58:35,359
that's so beautifully refreshing
 

14177
03:58:35,359 --> 03:58:36,469
that's so beautifully refreshing
now

14178
03:58:36,469 --> 03:58:36,479
now
 

14179
03:58:36,479 --> 03:58:39,269
now
that we're holding you to the ground in

14180
03:58:39,269 --> 03:58:39,279
that we're holding you to the ground in
 

14181
03:58:39,279 --> 03:58:41,590
that we're holding you to the ground in
an experiment to the harsh truth of

14182
03:58:41,590 --> 03:58:41,600
an experiment to the harsh truth of
 

14183
03:58:41,600 --> 03:58:43,510
an experiment to the harsh truth of
reality let me ask the the big

14184
03:58:43,510 --> 03:58:43,520
reality let me ask the the big
 

14185
03:58:43,520 --> 03:58:45,189
reality let me ask the the big
ridiculous question

14186
03:58:45,189 --> 03:58:45,199
ridiculous question
 

14187
03:58:45,199 --> 03:58:47,269
ridiculous question
what is the meaning of this whole thing

14188
03:58:47,269 --> 03:58:47,279
what is the meaning of this whole thing
 

14189
03:58:47,279 --> 03:58:49,750
what is the meaning of this whole thing
what's the meaning of life why

14190
03:58:49,750 --> 03:58:49,760
what's the meaning of life why
 

14191
03:58:49,760 --> 03:58:50,950
what's the meaning of life why
this uh

14192
03:58:50,950 --> 03:58:50,960
this uh
 

14193
03:58:50,960 --> 03:58:53,189
this uh
time is fundamental it's marching

14194
03:58:53,189 --> 03:58:53,199
time is fundamental it's marching
 

14195
03:58:53,199 --> 03:58:54,710
time is fundamental it's marching
forward

14196
03:58:54,710 --> 03:58:54,720
forward
 

14197
03:58:54,720 --> 03:58:56,710
forward
and along this

14198
03:58:56,710 --> 03:58:56,720
and along this
 

14199
03:58:56,720 --> 03:58:58,870
and along this
long timeline come along a bunch of

14200
03:58:58,870 --> 03:58:58,880
long timeline come along a bunch of
 

14201
03:58:58,880 --> 03:59:01,670
long timeline come along a bunch of
descendants of apes

14202
03:59:01,670 --> 03:59:01,680
descendants of apes
 

14203
03:59:01,680 --> 03:59:03,830
descendants of apes
that uh have come up with cellular

14204
03:59:03,830 --> 03:59:03,840
that uh have come up with cellular
 

14205
03:59:03,840 --> 03:59:07,429
that uh have come up with cellular
automata and computers and now computers

14206
03:59:07,429 --> 03:59:07,439
automata and computers and now computers
 

14207
03:59:07,439 --> 03:59:09,750
automata and computers and now computers
why

14208
03:59:09,750 --> 03:59:09,760
why
 

14209
03:59:09,760 --> 03:59:11,269
why
i have so many different answers to this

14210
03:59:11,269 --> 03:59:11,279
i have so many different answers to this
 

14211
03:59:11,279 --> 03:59:13,670
i have so many different answers to this
question it depends on on what day

14212
03:59:13,670 --> 03:59:13,680
question it depends on on what day
 

14213
03:59:13,680 --> 03:59:15,429
question it depends on on what day
i would say that given the way of the

14214
03:59:15,429 --> 03:59:15,439
i would say that given the way of the
 

14215
03:59:15,439 --> 03:59:16,790
i would say that given the way of the
conversation we had today i'd say the

14216
03:59:16,790 --> 03:59:16,800
conversation we had today i'd say the
 

14217
03:59:16,800 --> 03:59:18,389
conversation we had today i'd say the
meaning

14218
03:59:18,389 --> 03:59:18,399
meaning
 

14219
03:59:18,399 --> 03:59:19,990
meaning
well we make our own meaning i think

14220
03:59:19,990 --> 03:59:20,000
well we make our own meaning i think
 

14221
03:59:20,000 --> 03:59:22,150
well we make our own meaning i think
that's fine but i think the universe

14222
03:59:22,150 --> 03:59:22,160
that's fine but i think the universe
 

14223
03:59:22,160 --> 03:59:23,750
that's fine but i think the universe
wants to

14224
03:59:23,750 --> 03:59:23,760
wants to
 

14225
03:59:23,760 --> 03:59:26,150
wants to
explore every possible configuration

14226
03:59:26,150 --> 03:59:26,160
explore every possible configuration
 

14227
03:59:26,160 --> 03:59:28,469
explore every possible configuration
that this allows us to explore

14228
03:59:28,469 --> 03:59:28,479
that this allows us to explore
 

14229
03:59:28,479 --> 03:59:29,830
that this allows us to explore
and this goes back to the kind of

14230
03:59:29,830 --> 03:59:29,840
and this goes back to the kind of
 

14231
03:59:29,840 --> 03:59:31,910
and this goes back to the kind of
question that we were asking about yasha

14232
03:59:31,910 --> 03:59:31,920
question that we were asking about yasha
 

14233
03:59:31,920 --> 03:59:34,070
question that we were asking about yasha
and the existence and non-existence of

14234
03:59:34,070 --> 03:59:34,080
and the existence and non-existence of
 

14235
03:59:34,080 --> 03:59:36,309
and the existence and non-existence of
things right so if the universe is a

14236
03:59:36,309 --> 03:59:36,319
things right so if the universe is a
 

14237
03:59:36,319 --> 03:59:37,590
things right so if the universe is a
turing machine it's churning through a

14238
03:59:37,590 --> 03:59:37,600
turing machine it's churning through a
 

14239
03:59:37,600 --> 03:59:39,990
turing machine it's churning through a
load of states

14240
03:59:39,990 --> 03:59:40,000
load of states
 

14241
03:59:40,000 --> 03:59:41,990
load of states
and you think about combinatorial theory

14242
03:59:41,990 --> 03:59:42,000
and you think about combinatorial theory
 

14243
03:59:42,000 --> 03:59:43,750
and you think about combinatorial theory
before assembly theory so everything is

14244
03:59:43,750 --> 03:59:43,760
before assembly theory so everything is
 

14245
03:59:43,760 --> 03:59:45,030
before assembly theory so everything is
possible

14246
03:59:45,030 --> 03:59:45,040
possible
 

14247
03:59:45,040 --> 03:59:47,349
possible
what yahshua and i were saying is

14248
03:59:47,349 --> 03:59:47,359
what yahshua and i were saying is
 

14249
03:59:47,359 --> 03:59:49,830
what yahshua and i were saying is
well not everything is potent

14250
03:59:49,830 --> 03:59:49,840
well not everything is potent
 

14251
03:59:49,840 --> 03:59:52,070
well not everything is potent
we don't see the commentary explosion we

14252
03:59:52,070 --> 03:59:52,080
we don't see the commentary explosion we
 

14253
03:59:52,080 --> 03:59:53,590
we don't see the commentary explosion we
see something else

14254
03:59:53,590 --> 03:59:53,600
see something else
 

14255
03:59:53,600 --> 03:59:55,990
see something else
and what we see is um

14256
03:59:55,990 --> 03:59:56,000
and what we see is um
 

14257
03:59:56,000 --> 03:59:57,590
and what we see is um
evidence of memory

14258
03:59:57,590 --> 03:59:57,600
evidence of memory
 

14259
03:59:57,600 --> 03:59:59,429
evidence of memory
so there's there clearly seems to be

14260
03:59:59,429 --> 03:59:59,439
so there's there clearly seems to be
 

14261
03:59:59,439 --> 04:00:01,670
so there's there clearly seems to be
some interference between

14262
04:00:01,670 --> 04:00:01,680
some interference between
 

14263
04:00:01,680 --> 04:00:04,150
some interference between
the commentary explosion of things and

14264
04:00:04,150 --> 04:00:04,160
the commentary explosion of things and
 

14265
04:00:04,160 --> 04:00:05,990
the commentary explosion of things and
what the universe allows

14266
04:00:05,990 --> 04:00:06,000
what the universe allows
 

14267
04:00:06,000 --> 04:00:08,070
what the universe allows
and it's like this kind of constructive

14268
04:00:08,070 --> 04:00:08,080
and it's like this kind of constructive
 

14269
04:00:08,080 --> 04:00:10,469
and it's like this kind of constructive
destructive interference

14270
04:00:10,469 --> 04:00:10,479
destructive interference
 

14271
04:00:10,479 --> 04:00:13,590
destructive interference
so maybe the universe is not just about

14272
04:00:13,590 --> 04:00:13,600
so maybe the universe is not just about
 

14273
04:00:13,600 --> 04:00:14,790
so maybe the universe is not just about
um

14274
04:00:14,790 --> 04:00:14,800
um
 

14275
04:00:14,800 --> 04:00:17,269
um
it is assembling objects in space and

14276
04:00:17,269 --> 04:00:17,279
it is assembling objects in space and
 

14277
04:00:17,279 --> 04:00:19,830
it is assembling objects in space and
time and those objects are able to

14278
04:00:19,830 --> 04:00:19,840
time and those objects are able to
 

14279
04:00:19,840 --> 04:00:21,030
time and those objects are able to
search more

14280
04:00:21,030 --> 04:00:21,040
search more
 

14281
04:00:21,040 --> 04:00:22,790
search more
um space and time and the universe is

14282
04:00:22,790 --> 04:00:22,800
um space and time and the universe is
 

14283
04:00:22,800 --> 04:00:25,510
um space and time and the universe is
just infinitely creative and i guess

14284
04:00:25,510 --> 04:00:25,520
just infinitely creative and i guess
 

14285
04:00:25,520 --> 04:00:27,349
just infinitely creative and i guess
i'm searching for why the universe is

14286
04:00:27,349 --> 04:00:27,359
i'm searching for why the universe is
 

14287
04:00:27,359 --> 04:00:28,950
i'm searching for why the universe is
infinitely creative or is it infinitely

14288
04:00:28,950 --> 04:00:28,960
infinitely creative or is it infinitely
 

14289
04:00:28,960 --> 04:00:30,469
infinitely creative or is it infinitely
creative and maybe the meaning is just

14290
04:00:30,469 --> 04:00:30,479
creative and maybe the meaning is just
 

14291
04:00:30,479 --> 04:00:33,030
creative and maybe the meaning is just
simply to make as many objects create as

14292
04:00:33,030 --> 04:00:33,040
simply to make as many objects create as
 

14293
04:00:33,040 --> 04:00:34,630
simply to make as many objects create as
many things as possible

14294
04:00:34,630 --> 04:00:34,640
many things as possible
 

14295
04:00:34,640 --> 04:00:36,309
many things as possible
and i and i see a future of the universe

14296
04:00:36,309 --> 04:00:36,319
and i and i see a future of the universe
 

14297
04:00:36,319 --> 04:00:37,750
and i and i see a future of the universe
that doesn't result in the heat death of

14298
04:00:37,750 --> 04:00:37,760
that doesn't result in the heat death of
 

14299
04:00:37,760 --> 04:00:39,429
that doesn't result in the heat death of
the universe the universe is going to

14300
04:00:39,429 --> 04:00:39,439
the universe the universe is going to
 

14301
04:00:39,439 --> 04:00:43,189
the universe the universe is going to
extract every ounce of creativity it can

14302
04:00:43,189 --> 04:00:43,199
extract every ounce of creativity it can
 

14303
04:00:43,199 --> 04:00:44,950
extract every ounce of creativity it can
out of it because that's what we see on

14304
04:00:44,950 --> 04:00:44,960
out of it because that's what we see on
 

14305
04:00:44,960 --> 04:00:47,750
out of it because that's what we see on
nerf right and if you think that

14306
04:00:47,750 --> 04:00:47,760
nerf right and if you think that
 

14307
04:00:47,760 --> 04:00:49,189
nerf right and if you think that
almost like intelligence is not

14308
04:00:49,189 --> 04:00:49,199
almost like intelligence is not
 

14309
04:00:49,199 --> 04:00:51,830
almost like intelligence is not
conserved that maybe creativity isn't

14310
04:00:51,830 --> 04:00:51,840
conserved that maybe creativity isn't
 

14311
04:00:51,840 --> 04:00:55,349
conserved that maybe creativity isn't
either maybe like

14312
04:00:55,349 --> 04:00:55,359

 

14313
04:00:55,359 --> 04:00:57,830

it's an infinite well so like creativity

14314
04:00:57,830 --> 04:00:57,840
it's an infinite well so like creativity
 

14315
04:00:57,840 --> 04:01:00,309
it's an infinite well so like creativity
is ultimately tied to novelty

14316
04:01:00,309 --> 04:01:00,319
is ultimately tied to novelty
 

14317
04:01:00,319 --> 04:01:02,229
is ultimately tied to novelty
you're coming up with cool new

14318
04:01:02,229 --> 04:01:02,239
you're coming up with cool new
 

14319
04:01:02,239 --> 04:01:04,150
you're coming up with cool new
configurations of things and maybe that

14320
04:01:04,150 --> 04:01:04,160
configurations of things and maybe that
 

14321
04:01:04,160 --> 04:01:06,229
configurations of things and maybe that
just can continue indefinitely

14322
04:01:06,229 --> 04:01:06,239
just can continue indefinitely
 

14323
04:01:06,239 --> 04:01:08,790
just can continue indefinitely
and uh this human species that was

14324
04:01:08,790 --> 04:01:08,800
and uh this human species that was
 

14325
04:01:08,800 --> 04:01:12,309
and uh this human species that was
created along the way is probably just

14326
04:01:12,309 --> 04:01:12,319
created along the way is probably just
 

14327
04:01:12,319 --> 04:01:15,030
created along the way is probably just
one method like that's able to ask

14328
04:01:15,030 --> 04:01:15,040
one method like that's able to ask
 

14329
04:01:15,040 --> 04:01:17,670
one method like that's able to ask
the universe about itself it's just one

way to explore creativity maybe there's

14332
04:01:19,910 --> 04:01:19,920
way to explore creativity maybe there's
 

14333
04:01:19,920 --> 04:01:22,550
way to explore creativity maybe there's
other meta levels on top of that

14334
04:01:22,550 --> 04:01:22,560
other meta levels on top of that
 

14335
04:01:22,560 --> 04:01:24,229
other meta levels on top of that
like obviously as a collective

14336
04:01:24,229 --> 04:01:24,239
like obviously as a collective

intelligence will create organisms maybe

14338
04:01:26,309 --> 04:01:26,319

questions about the humans and then
 

14353
04:01:40,000 --> 04:01:41,750

i've discussed this stacking a lot with

i've discussed this stacking a lot with

because there's simply a missing

14389
04:02:17,120 --> 04:02:19,030
understanding right now we don't we
don't understand how the universe we

14390
04:02:19,030 --> 04:02:19,040
don't understand how the universe we
 

14391
04:02:19,040 --> 04:02:21,189
don't understand how the universe we
don't know what rules the universe has

14392
04:02:21,189 --> 04:02:21,199
don't know what rules the universe has
 

14393
04:02:21,199 --> 04:02:22,550
don't know what rules the universe has
to allow the universe to contemplate

14394
04:02:22,550 --> 04:02:22,560
to allow the universe to contemplate
 

14395
04:02:22,560 --> 04:02:24,950
to allow the universe to contemplate
itself so asking the meaning of it

14396
04:02:24,950 --> 04:02:24,960
itself so asking the meaning of it
 

14397
04:02:24,960 --> 04:02:26,630
itself so asking the meaning of it
before we know even know what those

14398
04:02:26,630 --> 04:02:26,640
before we know even know what those
 

14399
04:02:26,640 --> 04:02:29,030
before we know even know what those
rules are is premature but my guess is

14400
04:02:29,030 --> 04:02:29,040
rules are is premature but my guess is
 

14401
04:02:29,040 --> 04:02:30,950
rules are is premature but my guess is
that it's not meaningless and it isn't

14402
04:02:30,950 --> 04:02:30,960
that it's not meaningless and it isn't
 

14403
04:02:30,960 --> 04:02:32,870
that it's not meaningless and it isn't
just about that and there's there are

14404
04:02:32,870 --> 04:02:32,880
just about that and there's there are
 

14405
04:02:32,880 --> 04:02:34,150
just about that and there's there are
three levels of meanings obviously the

14406
04:02:34,150 --> 04:02:34,160
three levels of meanings obviously the
 

14407
04:02:34,160 --> 04:02:35,910
three levels of meanings obviously the
universe wants us to do stuff we're

14408
04:02:35,910 --> 04:02:35,920
universe wants us to do stuff we're
 

14409
04:02:35,920 --> 04:02:37,269
universe wants us to do stuff we're
interacting with each other so we create

14410
04:02:37,269 --> 04:02:37,279
interacting with each other so we create
 

14411
04:02:37,279 --> 04:02:38,870
interacting with each other so we create
meaning in our own society and our own

14412
04:02:38,870 --> 04:02:38,880
meaning in our own society and our own
 

14413
04:02:38,880 --> 04:02:41,670
meaning in our own society and our own
interactions for human humanity but i do

14414
04:02:41,670 --> 04:02:41,680
interactions for human humanity but i do
 

14415
04:02:41,680 --> 04:02:44,309

think there is something else going on

14416
04:02:44,309 --> 04:02:44,319
think there is something else going on
 

14417
04:02:44,319 --> 04:02:47,590
think there is something else going on
but because reality is so weird

14418
04:02:47,590 --> 04:02:47,600
but because reality is so weird
 

14419
04:02:47,600 --> 04:02:50,229
but because reality is so weird
we're just scratching at that and i

14420
04:02:50,229 --> 04:02:50,239
we're just scratching at that and i
 

14421
04:02:50,239 --> 04:02:51,349
we're just scratching at that and i
think that we have to make the

14422
04:02:51,349 --> 04:02:51,359
think that we have to make the
 

14423
04:02:51,359 --> 04:02:54,150
think that we have to make the
experiments better and we have to

14424
04:02:54,150 --> 04:02:54,160
experiments better and we have to
 

14425
04:02:54,160 --> 04:02:55,750
experiments better and we have to
perhaps

14426
04:02:55,750 --> 04:02:55,760
perhaps
 

14427
04:02:55,760 --> 04:02:57,189
perhaps
join across not just for the

14428
04:02:57,189 --> 04:02:57,199
join across not just for the
 

14429
04:02:57,199 --> 04:02:59,349
join across not just for the
computational lists and what i try to do

14430
04:02:59,349 --> 04:02:59,359
computational lists and what i try to do
 

14431
04:02:59,359 --> 04:03:01,429
computational lists and what i try to do
with yahshua is meet him halfway so what

14432
04:03:01,429 --> 04:03:01,439
with yahshua is meet him halfway so what
 

14433
04:03:01,439 --> 04:03:03,030
with yahshua is meet him halfway so what
happens if i become a computationalist

14434
04:03:03,030 --> 04:03:03,040
happens if i become a computationalist
 

14435
04:03:03,040 --> 04:03:05,510
happens if i become a computationalist
what do i gain a lot it turns out

14436
04:03:05,510 --> 04:03:05,520
what do i gain a lot it turns out
 

14437
04:03:05,520 --> 04:03:07,110
what do i gain a lot it turns out
because i can make turing machines in

14438
04:03:07,110 --> 04:03:07,120
because i can make turing machines in
 

14439
04:03:07,120 --> 04:03:08,870
because i can make turing machines in
the universe because on the one hand i'm

14440
04:03:08,870 --> 04:03:08,880
the universe because on the one hand i'm
 

14441
04:03:08,880 --> 04:03:10,229
the universe because on the one hand i'm
making computers which are state

14442
04:03:10,229 --> 04:03:10,239
making computers which are state
 

14443
04:03:10,239 --> 04:03:12,229
making computers which are state
machines inspired by turing on the other

14444
04:03:12,229 --> 04:03:12,239
machines inspired by turing on the other
 

14445
04:03:12,239 --> 04:03:14,389
machines inspired by turing on the other
hand i'm saying they can't exist

14446
04:03:14,389 --> 04:03:14,399
hand i'm saying they can't exist
 

14447
04:03:14,399 --> 04:03:16,150
hand i'm saying they can't exist
well clearly that's that i can't have my

14448
04:03:16,150 --> 04:03:16,160
well clearly that's that i can't have my
 

14449
04:03:16,160 --> 04:03:17,349
well clearly that's that i can't have my
cake and eat it so there's something

14450
04:03:17,349 --> 04:03:17,359
cake and eat it so there's something
 

14451
04:03:17,359 --> 04:03:19,510
cake and eat it so there's something
that weird going on there so then did

14452
04:03:19,510 --> 04:03:19,520
that weird going on there so then did
 

14453
04:03:19,520 --> 04:03:21,189
that weird going on there so then did
the universe have to make a continuous

14454
04:03:21,189 --> 04:03:21,199
the universe have to make a continuous
 

14455
04:03:21,199 --> 04:03:22,710
the universe have to make a continuous
to a discrete transition or is the

14456
04:03:22,710 --> 04:03:22,720
to a discrete transition or is the
 

14457
04:03:22,720 --> 04:03:23,990
to a discrete transition or is the
universe just discrete it's probably

14458
04:03:23,990 --> 04:03:24,000
universe just discrete it's probably
 

14459
04:03:24,000 --> 04:03:25,189
universe just discrete it's probably
just discrete

14460
04:03:25,189 --> 04:03:25,199
just discrete
 

14461
04:03:25,199 --> 04:03:27,349
just discrete
so if it's just discrete then there are

14462
04:03:27,349 --> 04:03:27,359
so if it's just discrete then there are
 

14463
04:03:27,359 --> 04:03:29,910
so if it's just discrete then there are
i will then give yasha his

04:03:29,910 --> 04:03:29,920
i will then give yasha his
 

14465
04:03:29,920 --> 04:03:32,070
i will then give yasha his
turing-like property in the universe but

14466
04:03:32,070 --> 04:03:32,080
turing-like property in the universe but
 

14467
04:03:32,080 --> 04:03:33,510
turing-like property in the universe but
maybe there's something else below it

14468
04:03:33,510 --> 04:03:33,520
maybe there's something else below it
 

14469
04:03:33,520 --> 04:03:35,349
maybe there's something else below it
which is the constructor that constructs

a turing machine that then constructs
 

14473
04:03:37,760 --> 04:03:40,229
a turing machine that then constructs
you know it's a bit like the

04:03:40,229 --> 04:03:40,239
you know it's a bit like the
 

14475
04:03:40,239 --> 04:03:42,710
you know it's a bit like the
you you generate an a computing system

14476
04:03:42,710 --> 04:03:42,720
you you generate an a computing system
 

14477
04:03:42,720 --> 04:03:43,910
you you generate an a computing system
that then is able to build an

that then is able to build an

04:03:43,920 --> 04:03:46,469
that then is able to build an

04:03:46,469 --> 04:03:46,479
abstraction that then recognizes
 

14481
04:03:46,479 --> 04:03:48,389
abstraction that then recognizes
it can make a generalizable abstraction

and build physical computers if that
 

14489
04:03:55,359 --> 04:03:56,870

makes any sense
 

14491
04:03:56,880 --> 04:03:58,309

and i think that's the meaning i think
 

14493
04:03:58,319 --> 04:04:00,870
and i think that's the meaning i think
that's you know as far as we can the

14494
04:04:00,870 --> 04:04:00,880
that's you know as far as we can the
 

14495
04:04:00,880 --> 04:04:02,389
that's you know as far as we can the
meaning will be further elucidated with

14496
04:04:02,389 --> 04:04:02,399
meaning will be further elucidated with
 

14497
04:04:02,399 --> 04:04:06,710
meaning will be further elucidated with
further experiments
