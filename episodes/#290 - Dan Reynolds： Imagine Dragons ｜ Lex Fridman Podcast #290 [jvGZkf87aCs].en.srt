that i built that and made it do that
 

143
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,470
that i built that and made it do that
is

167
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,030
yeah so i couldn't say i'm at a level
where i've done anything beautiful at

168
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:05,040
where i've done anything beautiful at
 

169
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,790
where i've done anything beautiful at
all in code but you're also interested

170
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:06,800
all in code but you're also interested
 

171
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,550
all in code but you're also interested
in potentially

172
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:08,560
in potentially
 

173
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,309
in potentially
like your heart is drawn to creating

174
00:03:10,309 --> 00:03:10,319
like your heart is drawn to creating
 

175
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,149
like your heart is drawn to creating
games

176
00:03:12,149 --> 00:03:12,159
games
 

177
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:15,350
games
creating anything um and completing it

178
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:15,360
creating anything um and completing it
 

179
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,430
creating anything um and completing it
yeah that's the good the feel good is

180
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:17,440
yeah that's the good the feel good is
 

181
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,630
yeah that's the good the feel good is
this done

182
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:18,640
this done
 

183
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,470
this done
yeah i've i mean i've been working over

184
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:20,480
yeah i've i mean i've been working over
 

185
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,949
yeah i've i mean i've been working over
the last two years um

186
00:03:22,949 --> 00:03:22,959
the last two years um
 

187
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:24,949
the last two years um
with actually a team out of kiev

188
00:03:24,949 --> 00:03:24,959
with actually a team out of kiev
 

189
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,869
with actually a team out of kiev
uh on

190
00:03:26,869 --> 00:03:26,879
uh on
 

191
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:28,309
uh on
and and we can get into that as whole

192
00:03:28,309 --> 00:03:28,319
and and we can get into that as whole
 

193
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,830
and and we can get into that as whole
another story but on a computer game

194
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:30,840
another story but on a computer game
 

195
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,350
another story but on a computer game
and really have kept that kind of under

196
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:33,360
and really have kept that kind of under
 

197
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,670
and really have kept that kind of under
under wraps but

198
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:35,680
under wraps but
 

199
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,030
under wraps but
yeah we're kind of getting to a point

200
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:37,040
yeah we're kind of getting to a point
 

201
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,630
yeah we're kind of getting to a point
now where we have a prototype that we

202
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:38,640
now where we have a prototype that we
 

203
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,190
now where we have a prototype that we
can play and it's a lot of fun and and

204
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:41,200
can play and it's a lot of fun and and
 

205
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,190
can play and it's a lot of fun and and
uh thankfully all the team members are

206
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:43,200
uh thankfully all the team members are
 

207
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,190
uh thankfully all the team members are
in safe places now

208
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:45,200
in safe places now
 

209
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,550
in safe places now
things have obviously been on hold for a

210
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:46,560
things have obviously been on hold for a
 

211
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,670
things have obviously been on hold for a
little bit but

212
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:47,680
little bit but
 

213
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,110
little bit but
you know when that started is when i

214
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:49,120
you know when that started is when i
 

215
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,910
you know when that started is when i
really

216
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:49,920
really
 

217
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,309
really
decided okay i need to understand

218
00:03:52,309 --> 00:03:52,319
decided okay i need to understand
 

219
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,149
decided okay i need to understand
base level coding in c sharp so i'm not

220
00:03:54,149 --> 00:03:54,159
base level coding in c sharp so i'm not
 

221
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,630
base level coding in c sharp so i'm not
an idiot talking to these people and

222
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:56,640
an idiot talking to these people and
 

223
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,229
an idiot talking to these people and
and uh so it's you know we've been doing

224
00:03:58,229 --> 00:03:58,239
and uh so it's you know we've been doing
 

225
00:03:58,239 --> 00:03:59,509
and uh so it's you know we've been doing
that for a couple years is there any

226
00:03:59,509 --> 00:03:59,519
that for a couple years is there any
 

227
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,350
that for a couple years is there any
parallels between

228
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:01,360
parallels between
 

229
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,910
parallels between
the final completion that you feel with

230
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:03,920
the final completion that you feel with
 

231
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,509
the final completion that you feel with
programming which i think is a little

232
00:04:05,509 --> 00:04:05,519
programming which i think is a little
 

233
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,350
programming which i think is a little
bit more definitive like there's

234
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:07,360
bit more definitive like there's
 

235
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,949
bit more definitive like there's
debugging the code doesn't work it's

236
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:08,959
debugging the code doesn't work it's
 

237
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:10,789
debugging the code doesn't work it's
messy and so on there's the early design

238
00:04:10,789 --> 00:04:10,799
messy and so on there's the early design
 

239
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,470
messy and so on there's the early design
stages you're not sure

240
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:12,480
stages you're not sure
 

241
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,149
stages you're not sure
like how to have functions in classes

242
00:04:14,149 --> 00:04:14,159
like how to have functions in classes
 

243
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:15,429
like how to have functions in classes
how it's all going to work and then it

244
00:04:15,429 --> 00:04:15,439
how it's all going to work and then it
 

245
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,670
how it's all going to work and then it
comes together and it's really done

246
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:17,680
comes together and it's really done
 

247
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,110
comes together and it's really done
because it works and there's a cube

248
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:19,120
because it works and there's a cube
 

249
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,110
because it works and there's a cube
moving on the screen right right uh is

250
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:21,120
moving on the screen right right uh is
 

251
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,790
moving on the screen right right uh is
there any parallels between that and

252
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:22,800
there any parallels between that and
 

253
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,749
there any parallels between that and
music

254
00:04:23,749 --> 00:04:23,759
music
 

255
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,469
music
because are you really ever done done

256
00:04:26,469 --> 00:04:26,479
because are you really ever done done
 

257
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,950
because are you really ever done done
with a song it's

258
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:28,960
with a song it's
 

259
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,110
with a song it's
it's exactly the same thing for me just

260
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:31,120
it's exactly the same thing for me just
 

261
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:31,990
it's exactly the same thing for me just
in that

262
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:32,000
in that
 

263
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,909
in that
it's art um i really believe that

264
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:35,919
it's art um i really believe that
 

265
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:37,270
it's art um i really believe that
we have not

266
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:37,280
we have not
 

267
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,150
we have not
fully encapsulated artists like when we

268
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:40,160
fully encapsulated artists like when we
 

269
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,790
fully encapsulated artists like when we
say art i think most people think

270
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:42,800
say art i think most people think
 

271
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,710
say art i think most people think
okay the medium must be

272
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:44,720
okay the medium must be
 

273
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,629
okay the medium must be
painting or drawing

274
00:04:46,629 --> 00:04:46,639
painting or drawing
 

275
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,390
painting or drawing
or music

276
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:48,400
or music
 

277
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,230
or music
or writing

278
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:50,240
or writing
 

279
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,909
or writing
but i really believe anytime you're

280
00:04:51,909 --> 00:04:51,919
but i really believe anytime you're
 

281
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:54,830
but i really believe anytime you're
creating some things

282
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:54,840
creating some things
 

283
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,510
creating some things
engineers instance you're creating

284
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:57,520
engineers instance you're creating
 

285
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,749
engineers instance you're creating
something with tools that you have and

286
00:04:59,749 --> 00:04:59,759
something with tools that you have and
 

287
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,230
something with tools that you have and
it can be incredibly beautiful

288
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:02,240
it can be incredibly beautiful
 

289
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,270
it can be incredibly beautiful
um

290
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:03,280
um
 

291
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,230
um
and

292
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:04,240
and
 

293
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,830
and
so yeah i think

294
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:05,840
so yeah i think
 

295
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,830
so yeah i think
and it's never done

296
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:07,840
and it's never done
 

297
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,350
and it's never done
i feel like i look at songs that i've

298
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:09,360
i feel like i look at songs that i've
 

299
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,150
i feel like i look at songs that i've
done and i never felt

300
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:12,160
done and i never felt
 

301
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,670
done and i never felt
it you have to let

302
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:13,680
it you have to let
 

303
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,990
it you have to let
go or i have to let go and that's all

304
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:16,000
go or i have to let go and that's all
 

305
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,390
go or i have to let go and that's all
i've i'm just continually making myself

306
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:18,400
i've i'm just continually making myself
 

307
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,909
i've i'm just continually making myself
let go but i look at songs that i've

308
00:05:19,909 --> 00:05:19,919
let go but i look at songs that i've
 

309
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,110
let go but i look at songs that i've
done and

310
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:21,120
done and
 

311
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,230
done and
wish

312
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:22,240
wish
 

313

wish
i had done more or kept going down that

314
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:25,120
i had done more or kept going down that
 

315
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,790
i had done more or kept going down that
road and what would have happened and

316
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:26,800
road and what would have happened and
 

317
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,710
road and what would have happened and
i'm really contained to

318
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:28,720
i'm really contained to
 

319
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,029
i'm really contained to
because of what our band is and and what

320
00:05:31,029 --> 00:05:31,039
because of what our band is and and what
 

321
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,870
because of what our band is and and what
our fans expect and

322
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:32,880
our fans expect and
 

323
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,469
our fans expect and
there's so much more to it that it's

324
00:05:34,469 --> 00:05:34,479
there's so much more to it that it's
 

325
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,390
there's so much more to it that it's
like

326
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:36,400
like
 

327
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,629
like
i'm fitting in a box always

328
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:38,639
i'm fitting in a box always
 

329
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,310
i'm fitting in a box always
um you know it's like this song

330
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:40,320

that that's the difference maker
and i think you can perceive and i'm

[Music]

1072
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:37,280
[Music]
 

1073
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:43,270
[Music]
i should let you know

1074
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:43,280

 

1075
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,270

and then the course is i can't live if

1076
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:45,280
and then the course is i can't live if
 

1077
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,830
and then the course is i can't live if
living is without you can't live i can't

1078
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:47,840
living is without you can't live i can't
 

1079
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:48,990
living is without you can't live i can't
give any more

1080
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:49,000
give any more
 

1081
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,750
give any more
[Music]

1082
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:51,760
[Music]
 

1083
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,789
[Music]
he's got a voice on him yeah he does and

1084
00:18:54,789 --> 00:18:54,799
he's got a voice on him yeah he does and
 

1085
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:57,110
he's got a voice on him yeah he does and
if you really there's been some

1086
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:57,120
if you really there's been some
 

1087
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,270
if you really there's been some
incredible documentation on his life and

1088
00:18:59,270 --> 00:18:59,280
incredible documentation on his life and
 

1089
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,630
incredible documentation on his life and
the end of his life and

1090
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:02,640
the end of his life and
 

1091
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,630
the end of his life and
so my answer to this is probably skewed

1092
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:04,640
so my answer to this is probably skewed
 

1093
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,549
so my answer to this is probably skewed
based on what i've seen about his life

1094
00:19:06,549 --> 00:19:06,559
based on what i've seen about his life
 

1095
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:09,190
based on what i've seen about his life
too but he he was a real alcoholic at

1096
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:09,200
too but he he was a real alcoholic at
 

1097
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,390
too but he he was a real alcoholic at
the end of his life

1098
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:10,400
the end of his life
 

1099
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,789
the end of his life
and it destroyed his voice

1100
00:19:12,789 --> 00:19:12,799
and it destroyed his voice
 

1101
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:16,950
and it destroyed his voice
and ended up killing him as well

1102
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:16,960

 

1103
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,630

um

1104
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:18,640
um
 

1105
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,150
um
and

1106
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:20,160
and
 

1107
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:25,190
and
so when i hear that i perceive it as

1108
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:25,200

 

1109
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,350

someone who is destructive and in a

1110
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:27,360
someone who is destructive and in a
 

1111
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,350
someone who is destructive and in a
destructive place in life and can't love

1112
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:29,360
destructive place in life and can't love
 

1113
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,590
destructive place in life and can't love
someone properly and so they can't live

1114
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:31,600
someone properly and so they can't live
 

1115
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,870
someone properly and so they can't live
with them but they can't live without

1116
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:32,880
with them but they can't live without
 

1117
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,710
with them but they can't live without
them type thing which is really

1121
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:38,470
something i i really identify with and i
think

1122
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:38,480

1123
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,470

1124
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:40,480

00:54:07,990 --> 00:54:08,000

 

3137
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,390

you're now you're lex and you're what

3138
00:54:10,390 --> 00:54:10,400

3139
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:13,190
you're now you're lex and you're what
everybody's perception is that lex is

00:54:13,190 --> 00:54:13,200
everybody's perception is that lex is
 

3141
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:15,190

00:54:15,190 --> 00:54:15,200
and that's what you are
 

3143
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:16,390

3145
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:19,190
now
lex is probably a lot more complex and

3146
00:54:19,190 --> 00:54:19,200

00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:22,549
lex is probably a lot more complex and
complicated and has a lot more to lex

3148
00:54:22,549 --> 00:54:22,559
complicated and has a lot more to lex
 

3149
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:25,430
complicated and has a lot more to lex
than the lex that is the celebrity yeah

of just understanding that you don't
understand someone else's situation

6363
01:48:16,480 --> 01:48:17,990
and there's truth to both sides
like there's truth to what the father is

01:53:38,239 --> 01:53:40,629
on the hardest for the last few years
is to not be overly critical

6690
01:53:40,629 --> 01:53:40,639

he wasn't
 

6739
01:54:24,320 --> 01:54:26,950
he wasn't
and that did a lot so yeah

6740
01:54:26,950 --> 01:54:26,960
and that did a lot so yeah
 

6741
01:54:26,960 --> 01:54:29,109
and that did a lot so yeah
but is that is that a huge

6742
01:54:29,109 --> 01:54:29,119
but is that is that a huge
 

6743
01:54:29,119 --> 01:54:31,030
but is that is that a huge
is not what makes the artist it's the

is not what makes the artist it's the
 

6745
01:54:31,040 --> 01:54:32,550
is not what makes the artist it's the
fragility of it

6746
01:54:32,550 --> 01:54:32,560
fragility of it
 

6747
01:54:32,560 --> 01:54:33,430
fragility of it
that

6748
01:54:33,430 --> 01:54:33,440
that
 

6749
01:54:33,440 --> 01:54:37,669
that
like uh would you have it any other way

6750
01:54:37,669 --> 01:54:37,679
like uh would you have it any other way
 

6751
01:54:37,679 --> 01:54:40,390
like uh would you have it any other way
no no i i agree with you i think that

6752
01:54:40,390 --> 01:54:40,400
no no i i agree with you i think that
 

6753
01:54:40,400 --> 01:54:41,910
no no i i agree with you i think that
that's what

6754
01:54:41,910 --> 01:54:41,920
that's what
 

6755
01:54:41,920 --> 01:54:44,390
that's what
that uh

6756
01:54:44,390 --> 01:54:44,400
that uh
 

6757
01:54:44,400 --> 01:54:46,550
that uh
that's the beauty of art but i think

6758
01:54:46,550 --> 01:54:46,560
that's the beauty of art but i think
 

6759
01:54:46,560 --> 01:54:51,430
that's the beauty of art but i think
also on the same token it's like

6760
01:54:51,430 --> 01:54:51,440

 

6761
01:54:51,440 --> 01:54:54,310

aspiring artists or artists who've had

6776
01:55:07,510 --> 01:55:07,520
aspiring artists or artists who've had
 

6777
01:55:07,520 --> 01:55:09,430
aspiring artists or artists who've had
drug issues and like there's a lot that

6778
01:55:09,430 --> 01:55:09,440
drug issues and like there's a lot that
 

6779
01:55:09,440 --> 01:55:11,350
drug issues and like there's a lot that
they do but and there was a statistic

6780
01:55:11,350 --> 01:55:11,360
they do but and there was a statistic
 

6781
01:55:11,360 --> 01:55:12,629
they do but and there was a statistic
that they told it was staggering to me

6782
01:55:12,629 --> 01:55:12,639
that they told it was staggering to me
 

6783
01:55:12,639 --> 01:55:15,430
that they told it was staggering to me
which is i think it was 75 percent

6784
01:55:15,430 --> 01:55:15,440
which is i think it was 75 percent
 

6785
01:55:15,440 --> 01:55:17,750
which is i think it was 75 percent
of artists musicians

6786
01:55:17,750 --> 01:55:17,760
of artists musicians
 

6787
01:55:17,760 --> 01:55:20,470
of artists musicians
say they struggle with severe depression

6788
01:55:20,470 --> 01:55:20,480
say they struggle with severe depression
 

6789
01:55:20,480 --> 01:55:22,470
say they struggle with severe depression
that's really high i don't know what the

6790
01:55:22,470 --> 01:55:22,480
that's really high i don't know what the
 

6791
01:55:22,480 --> 01:55:24,229
that's really high i don't know what the
national average is

6792
01:55:24,229 --> 01:55:24,239
national average is
 

6793
01:55:24,239 --> 01:55:26,229
national average is
but i would guess that that's higher

6794
01:55:26,229 --> 01:55:26,239
but i would guess that that's higher
 

6795
01:55:26,239 --> 01:55:29,109
but i would guess that that's higher
than national average per occupation

6796
01:55:29,109 --> 01:55:29,119
than national average per occupation
 

6797
01:55:29,119 --> 01:55:30,790
than national average per occupation
so i just think

6798
01:55:30,790 --> 01:55:30,800
so i just think
 

6799
01:55:30,800 --> 01:55:32,790
so i just think
there's a tricky balance

6800
01:55:32,790 --> 01:55:32,800
there's a tricky balance
 

6801
01:55:32,800 --> 01:55:35,430
there's a tricky balance
there's a tricky balance in

6802
01:55:35,430 --> 01:55:35,440
there's a tricky balance in
 

6803
01:55:35,440 --> 01:55:37,830
there's a tricky balance in
in art um

6804
01:55:37,830 --> 01:55:37,840
in art um
 

6805
01:55:37,840 --> 01:55:39,589
in art um
so yeah of course

6806
01:55:39,589 --> 01:55:39,599
so yeah of course
 

6807
01:55:39,599 --> 01:55:41,990
so yeah of course
like it's it's a necessary thing the

6808
01:55:41,990 --> 01:55:42,000
like it's it's a necessary thing the
 

6809
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:43,830
like it's it's a necessary thing the
fragility of it all

6810
01:55:43,830 --> 01:55:43,840
fragility of it all
 

6811
01:55:43,840 --> 01:55:44,830
fragility of it all
but

6812
01:55:44,830 --> 01:55:44,840
but
 

6813
01:55:44,840 --> 01:55:48,390
but
um yeah i i wonder because i'm extremely

6814
01:55:48,390 --> 01:55:48,400
um yeah i i wonder because i'm extremely
 

6815
01:55:48,400 --> 01:55:51,030
um yeah i i wonder because i'm extremely
self-critical and i sometimes ask myself

6816
01:55:51,030 --> 01:55:51,040
self-critical and i sometimes ask myself
 

6817
01:55:51,040 --> 01:55:53,350
self-critical and i sometimes ask myself
the question

6818
01:55:53,350 --> 01:55:53,360
the question
 

6819
01:55:53,360 --> 01:55:56,790
the question
i've romanticized it or rather

6820
01:55:56,790 --> 01:55:56,800
i've romanticized it or rather
 

6821
01:55:56,800 --> 01:55:58,310
i've romanticized it or rather
i've learned to be

6822
01:55:58,310 --> 01:55:58,320
i've learned to be
 

6823
01:55:58,320 --> 01:56:00,149
i've learned to be
for it to be productive to channel into

6824
01:56:00,149 --> 01:56:00,159
for it to be productive to channel into
 

6825
01:56:00,159 --> 01:56:01,669
for it to be productive to channel into
productivity

6826
01:56:01,669 --> 01:56:01,679
productivity
 

6827
01:56:01,679 --> 01:56:03,430
productivity
but i i wonder

6828
01:56:03,430 --> 01:56:03,440
but i i wonder
 

6829
01:56:03,440 --> 01:56:05,510
but i i wonder
if there's better ways to do that and i

6830
01:56:05,510 --> 01:56:05,520
if there's better ways to do that and i
 

6831
01:56:05,520 --> 01:56:07,510
if there's better ways to do that and i
also wonder if it's eventually the thing

6832
01:56:07,510 --> 01:56:07,520
also wonder if it's eventually the thing
 

6833
01:56:07,520 --> 01:56:10,229
also wonder if it's eventually the thing
that destroys me like if long term

6834
01:56:10,229 --> 01:56:10,239
that destroys me like if long term
 

6835
01:56:10,239 --> 01:56:11,830
that destroys me like if long term
if it's a healthy thing it might be

6836
01:56:11,830 --> 01:56:11,840
if it's a healthy thing it might be
 

6837
01:56:11,840 --> 01:56:13,270
if it's a healthy thing it might be
useful

6838
01:56:13,270 --> 01:56:13,280
useful
 

6839
01:56:13,280 --> 01:56:17,189
useful
when you're in sort of

6840
01:56:17,189 --> 01:56:17,199

 

6841
01:56:17,199 --> 01:56:18,870

actively

6842
01:56:18,870 --> 01:56:18,880
