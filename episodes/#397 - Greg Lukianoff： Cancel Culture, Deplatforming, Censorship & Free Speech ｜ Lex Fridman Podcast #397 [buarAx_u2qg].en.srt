it's found to be kind of more defensible
 

485
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:01,910
it's found to be kind of more defensible
and I think this makes sense that if if

486
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:01,920
and I think this makes sense that if if
 

487
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,410
and I think this makes sense that if if
you set up a forum and like we're only

488
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:03,420
you set up a forum and like we're only
 

489
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:05,509
you set up a forum and like we're only
going to talk about economics to exclude

490
00:09:05,509 --> 00:09:05,519
going to talk about economics to exclude
 

491
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:06,710
going to talk about economics to exclude
people who want to talk about a

492
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:06,720
people who want to talk about a
 

493
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,630
people who want to talk about a
different topic but it's considered

494
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:08,640
different topic but it's considered
 

495
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,889
different topic but it's considered
rightfully

496
00:09:09,889 --> 00:09:09,899
rightfully
 

497
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:12,230
rightfully
um a bigger deal if you've set up a

498
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:12,240
um a bigger deal if you've set up a
 

499
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,970
um a bigger deal if you've set up a
forum from economics but we're not going

500
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:13,980
forum from economics but we're not going
 

501
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,470
forum from economics but we're not going
to let people talk about that kind of

502
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:15,480
to let people talk about that kind of
 

503
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,750
to let people talk about that kind of
Economics or have that opinion on

Economics or have that opinion on
 

505

Amendment law actually make a lot of
 

511
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,970
Amendment law actually make a lot of

for when like what is protected and

514
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:29,040
for when like what is protected and
 

515
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,710
for when like what is protected and
unprotected speech what should get you

unprotected speech what should get you
 

517
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,290
unprotected speech what should get you
in trouble how you actually analyze it

518
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:33,300
in trouble how you actually analyze it
 

519
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,389
in trouble how you actually analyze it
which is why we actually try and our

520
00:09:35,389 --> 00:09:35,399
which is why we actually try and our
 

521
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:37,370
which is why we actually try and our
definition of cancel culture to work in

522
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:37,380
definition of cancel culture to work in
 

523
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:38,990
definition of cancel culture to work in
some of the First Amendment Norms just

524
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:39,000
some of the First Amendment Norms just
 

525
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,490
some of the First Amendment Norms just
in the definition so we don't have to

526
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:40,500
in the definition so we don't have to
 

527
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,710
in the definition so we don't have to
bog down on them as well you're saying

528
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:42,720
bog down on them as well you're saying
 

529
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,790
bog down on them as well you're saying
so many interesting things but if you

530
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:43,800
so many interesting things but if you
 

531
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,130
so many interesting things but if you
can link on the Viewpoint discrimination

533
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:49,250
can link on the Viewpoint discrimination
is there any gray area of discussion

534
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:49,260
is there any gray area of discussion
 

535
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:51,110
is there any gray area of discussion
there like what isn't isn't economics

536
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:51,120
there like what isn't isn't economics
 

537
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,350
there like what isn't isn't economics
for the example you gave yeah is it is

538
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:54,360
for the example you gave yeah is it is
 

539
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,050
for the example you gave yeah is it is
there uh I mean is it a science does it

540
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:57,060
there uh I mean is it a science does it
 

541
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:59,210
there uh I mean is it a science does it
or is it an R to draw lines of what is

542
00:09:59,210 --> 00:09:59,220
or is it an R to draw lines of what is
 

543
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:01,070
or is it an R to draw lines of what is
and isn't allowed yeah you know if

544
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:01,080
and isn't allowed yeah you know if
 

545
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,630
and isn't allowed yeah you know if
you're saying that something is or is

546
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:02,640
you're saying that something is or is
 

547
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,769
you're saying that something is or is
not economics well you can say

548
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:03,779
not economics well you can say
 

549
00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:05,269
not economics well you can say
everything's economics and therefore I

550
00:10:05,269 --> 00:10:05,279
everything's economics and therefore I
 

551

553
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:08,810
want to talk about poetry there'd be
some line drawing exercise in there but

554
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:08,820
some line drawing exercise in there but
 

555
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,970
some line drawing exercise in there but
let's say you at once you decide to open

otherwise open Forum that would
 

573
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:29,810
otherwise open Forum that would
immediately at an intuitive level strike

574
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:29,820
immediately at an intuitive level strike
 

575
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:32,030
immediately at an intuitive level strike
people as a bigger problem than just

576
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:32,040
people as a bigger problem than just
 

577

579
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,790
saying that poetry isn't economics yeah
I mean that intuitive level that you

580
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:37,800
I mean that intuitive level that you
 

581
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,590
I mean that intuitive level that you
speak to

582
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:39,600
speak to
 

583
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,329
speak to
I hope

584
00:10:41,329 --> 00:10:41,339
I hope
 

585
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:43,550
I hope
that all of us have that kind of basic

586
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:43,560
that all of us have that kind of basic
 

587
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,590
that all of us have that kind of basic
intuition when the line is crossed it's

588
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:45,600
intuition when the line is crossed it's
 

589
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,569
intuition when the line is crossed it's
the same thing for like pornography yeah

590
00:10:47,569 --> 00:10:47,579
the same thing for like pornography yeah
 

591
00:10:47,579 --> 00:10:49,370
the same thing for like pornography yeah
you know when you see it I I think

592
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:49,380
you know when you see it I I think
 

593
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:52,550
you know when you see it I I think
there's the same level of intuition that

594
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:52,560
there's the same level of intuition that
 

595
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,250
there's the same level of intuition that
should be applied across the board here

596
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:55,260
should be applied across the board here
 

597
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:58,310
should be applied across the board here
um and it's when that intuition becomes

598
00:10:58,310 --> 00:10:58,320
um and it's when that intuition becomes
 

599
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,230
um and it's when that intuition becomes
deformed by whatever forces of society

600
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:00,240
deformed by whatever forces of society
 

601
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,970
deformed by whatever forces of society
that's when it starts to feel like

602
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:01,980
that's when it starts to feel like
 

603
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:04,610
that's when it starts to feel like
censorship yeah I mean people find it a

604
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:04,620
censorship yeah I mean people find it a
 

605
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,110
censorship yeah I mean people find it a
different thing um you know if someone

606
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:06,120
different thing um you know if someone
 

607
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,550
different thing um you know if someone
loses their job simply for their

608
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:07,560
loses their job simply for their
 

609
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,829
loses their job simply for their
political opinion even if that employer

610
00:11:09,829 --> 00:11:09,839
political opinion even if that employer
 

611
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:11,389
political opinion even if that employer
has every right in the world to fire you

612
00:11:11,389 --> 00:11:11,399
has every right in the world to fire you
 

613
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:13,430

645

if you think through the implications of

if you think through the implications of

that would be a disaster for democracy

654
00:11:54,889 --> 00:11:54,899
that would be a disaster for democracy
 

655
00:11:54,899 --> 00:11:56,389
that would be a disaster for democracy
because you would end up in a situation

because you would end up in a situation

00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,310
because you would end up in a situation
where people would actually be saying to

believe I can keep my job and that's
 

665
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,350
believe I can keep my job and that's
where I was worried I felt like we were

00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:06,360
where I was worried I felt like we were
 

667
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,790
where I was worried I felt like we were
headed because a lot of the initial

00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:07,800
headed because a lot of the initial
 

669
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,970
headed because a lot of the initial
response to people getting canceled

response to people getting canceled
 

671
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,610
response to people getting canceled
um was uh very simply

end and be beginning and end of the
 

681
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,310
end and be beginning and end of the
discussion and I thought that was a

682
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:22,320
discussion and I thought that was a
 

683
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,110
discussion and I thought that was a
Dodge I thought that wasn't actually a

Dodge I thought that wasn't actually a
 

685
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,269
Dodge I thought that wasn't actually a
very serious way of that if you care

686
00:12:26,269 --> 00:12:26,279
very serious way of that if you care
 

687
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:28,009
very serious way of that if you care
about both the First Amendment and

688
00:12:28,009 --> 00:12:28,019
about both the First Amendment and
 

689

about both the First Amendment and
freedom of speech of thinking it through

freedom of speech of thinking it through
so to you just uh

692
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:32,160
so to you just uh
 

693
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,690
so to you just uh
clarify the first amendment is kind of

694
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:35,700
clarify the first amendment is kind of
 

695
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:39,230
clarify the first amendment is kind of
a legal embodiment of the ideal of

00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:58,550
philosophical ideal of what it of the
value of uh people being able to speak

712
00:12:58,550 --> 00:12:58,560
value of uh people being able to speak
 

713
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,430
value of uh people being able to speak
their mind yeah it's an older Bolder

714
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:01,440
their mind yeah it's an older Bolder
 

715
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,210
their mind yeah it's an older Bolder
more expansive idea and you can have a

716
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:05,220
more expansive idea and you can have a
 

717
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:07,129
more expansive idea and you can have a
situation uh and I talk about countries

718
00:13:07,129 --> 00:13:07,139
situation uh and I talk about countries
 

719
00:13:07,139 --> 00:13:08,990
situation uh and I talk about countries
that have good free speech law but not

720
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:09,000
that have good free speech law but not
 

721
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,610
that have good free speech law but not
necessarily great Free Speech culture

722
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:10,620
necessarily great Free Speech culture
 

723
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:13,490
necessarily great Free Speech culture
and I talk about how when we sometimes

724
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:13,500
and I talk about how when we sometimes
 

725
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,990
and I talk about how when we sometimes
make this distinction between Free

726
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:15,000
make this distinction between Free
 

727
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,509
make this distinction between Free
Speech law and Free Speech culture we're

728
00:13:17,509 --> 00:13:17,519
Speech law and Free Speech culture we're
 

729
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,690
Speech law and Free Speech culture we're
thinking in a very cloudy kind of way

730
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:20,700
thinking in a very cloudy kind of way
 

731
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:23,870
thinking in a very cloudy kind of way
um and what I mean by that is that laws

732
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:23,880
um and what I mean by that is that laws
 

733
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,129
um and what I mean by that is that laws
generally particularly in a common law

734
00:13:25,129 --> 00:13:25,139
generally particularly in a common law
 

735
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:28,730
generally particularly in a common law
country it's the reflection of norms

736
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:28,740
country it's the reflection of norms
 

737
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:31,430
country it's the reflection of norms
those you know judges are people too and

738
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:31,440
those you know judges are people too and
 

739
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,930
those you know judges are people too and
in a lot of cases common law is supposed

740
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:32,940
in a lot of cases common law is supposed
 

741
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,970
in a lot of cases common law is supposed
to actually take our intuitive ideas of

742
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:34,980
to actually take our intuitive ideas of
 

743
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,069
to actually take our intuitive ideas of
fairness and and place them you know

744
00:13:37,069 --> 00:13:37,079
fairness and and place them you know
 

745
00:13:37,079 --> 00:13:40,009
fairness and and place them you know
into the law so if you actually have a

746
00:13:40,009 --> 00:13:40,019
into the law so if you actually have a
 

747
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:41,569
into the law so if you actually have a
culture that doesn't appreciate free

748
00:13:41,569 --> 00:13:41,579
culture that doesn't appreciate free
 

749
00:13:41,579 --> 00:13:43,970
culture that doesn't appreciate free
sweet from a philosophical standpoint

750
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:43,980
sweet from a philosophical standpoint
 

751
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:45,410
sweet from a philosophical standpoint
um it's not going to be able to protect

752
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:45,420
um it's not going to be able to protect
 

753
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:47,210
um it's not going to be able to protect
free speech for the Long Haul even in

754
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:47,220
free speech for the Long Haul even in
 

755
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:49,190
free speech for the Long Haul even in
the law because eventually that's one of

756
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:49,200
the law because eventually that's one of
 

757
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,210
the law because eventually that's one of
the reasons why I worry so much about

758
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:50,220
the reasons why I worry so much about
 

759
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:51,710
the reasons why I worry so much about
some of these terrible cases coming out

760
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:51,720
some of these terrible cases coming out
 

761
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,269
some of these terrible cases coming out
of law schools

762
00:13:53,269 --> 00:13:53,279
of law schools
 

763
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,610
of law schools
um because I I fear that even though

764
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:55,620
um because I I fear that even though
 

765
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:57,470
um because I I fear that even though
sure American First Amendment law is

766
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:57,480
sure American First Amendment law is
 

767
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,850
sure American First Amendment law is
very strongly protective of First

768
00:13:58,850 --> 00:13:58,860
very strongly protective of First
 

769
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:01,370
very strongly protective of First
Amendment for now it's not going to stay

770
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:01,380
Amendment for now it's not going to stay
 

771
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:03,530
Amendment for now it's not going to stay
that way if you have generations of law

772
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:03,540
that way if you have generations of law
 

773
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:04,550
that way if you have generations of law
students

774
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:04,560
students
 

775
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,829
students
um graduating who actually think there's

776
00:14:06,829 --> 00:14:06,839
um graduating who actually think there's
 

777
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:08,629
um graduating who actually think there's
nothing there's no higher goal than

778
00:14:08,629 --> 00:14:08,639
nothing there's no higher goal than
 

779
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,150
nothing there's no higher goal than
shouting down you're an opponent yeah so

780
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:11,160
shouting down you're an opponent yeah so
 

781
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,790
shouting down you're an opponent yeah so
that's why so much of your focus

782
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:13,800
that's why so much of your focus
 

783
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,250
that's why so much of your focus
uh or a large fraction of your focus is

784
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:16,260
uh or a large fraction of your focus is
 

785
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:18,230
uh or a large fraction of your focus is
on the higher education or education

786

on the higher education or education
 

787
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,930
on the higher education or education
period is because education

Speech in higher education

1124
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:30,840
Speech in higher education
 

1125
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,930
Speech in higher education
and so I've been trying to think of

1126
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:32,940
and so I've been trying to think of
 

1127
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,270
and so I've been trying to think of
positive ways to take on some of the

1128
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:35,280
positive ways to take on some of the
 

1129
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,370
positive ways to take on some of the
some of the problems that I see in K-12

1130
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:37,380
some of the problems that I see in K-12
 

1131
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:39,070
some of the problems that I see in K-12
I thought that the attempt to just

1132
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:39,080
I thought that the attempt to just
 

1133
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,570
I thought that the attempt to just
dictate you you won't teach the

1134
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:41,580
dictate you you won't teach the
 

1135
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:44,270
dictate you you won't teach the
following 10 books you know or 20 books

1136
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:44,280
following 10 books you know or 20 books
 

1137
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,250
following 10 books you know or 20 books
or 200 books was the wrong way to do it

1138
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:46,260
or 200 books was the wrong way to do it
 

1139
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:48,350
or 200 books was the wrong way to do it
now when it comes to deciding what books

1140
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:48,360
now when it comes to deciding what books
 

1141
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,610
now when it comes to deciding what books
are in the curriculum again that's

1142
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:49,620
are in the curriculum again that's
 

1143
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:51,230
are in the curriculum again that's
something the legislature actually you

1144
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:51,240
something the legislature actually you
 

1145
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,270
something the legislature actually you
know can have some say in and that's

1146
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:53,280
know can have some say in and that's
 

1147
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,250
know can have some say in and that's
pretty uncontroversial um in terms of

1148
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:55,260
pretty uncontroversial um in terms of
 

1149
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:57,230
pretty uncontroversial um in terms of
the law but when it comes to how you

they're both exactly right and I think
 

1447
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,390
they're both exactly right and I think
sometimes the right gets very excited of

1448
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:08,400
sometimes the right gets very excited of
 

1449
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,250
sometimes the right gets very excited of
the free exercise clause and the left

1450
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:10,260

1453
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:14,149

and I like the fact that we have we have
both of them together now how does this

actually teach it so it's probably
better that you you know learn learn

00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,370
hundreds of attempts to get this one
particular

1744
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:31,380
particular
 

1745
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:33,529
particular
um conservative student uh student group

1746
00:31:33,529 --> 00:31:33,539
um conservative student uh student group
 

1747
00:31:33,539 --> 00:31:36,889
um conservative student uh student group
uh de-recognized or not recognized and

1748
00:31:36,889 --> 00:31:36,899
uh de-recognized or not recognized and
 

1749
00:31:36,899 --> 00:31:40,370
uh de-recognized or not recognized and
so we told them like listen this like we

1750
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:40,380
so we told them like listen this like we
 

1751
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:42,409
so we told them like listen this like we
told them at fire that uh you know we

1752
00:31:42,409 --> 00:31:42,419
told them at fire that uh you know we
 

1753
00:31:42,419 --> 00:31:44,210
told them at fire that uh you know we
consider this serious and they wouldn't

1754
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:44,220
consider this serious and they wouldn't
 

1755
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:46,730
consider this serious and they wouldn't
recognize the group so that that's a

1756
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:46,740
recognize the group so that that's a
 

1757
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:49,130
recognize the group so that that's a
that that's a point down in our ranking

1758
00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:49,140
that that's a point down in our ranking
 

1759
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:50,570
that that's a point down in our ranking
and it was enough to knock them from

1760
00:31:50,570 --> 00:31:50,580
and it was enough to knock them from
 

1761
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:52,310
and it was enough to knock them from
they probably would have been number two

1762
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:52,320
they probably would have been number two
 

1763
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,529
they probably would have been number two
in the rankings uh but now they're 13

1764
00:31:54,529 --> 00:31:54,539
in the rankings uh but now they're 13
 

1765
00:31:54,539 --> 00:31:56,930
in the rankings uh but now they're 13
out of 248 they're still one of the best

1766
00:31:56,930 --> 00:31:56,940
out of 248 they're still one of the best
 

1767
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:58,490
out of 248 they're still one of the best
schools in the country I have no problem

1768
00:31:58,490 --> 00:31:58,500
schools in the country I have no problem
 

1769
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:01,250
schools in the country I have no problem
uh saying that the school that did not

1770
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:01,260
uh saying that the school that did not
 

1771
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:03,110
uh saying that the school that did not
do so well

1772
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:03,120
do so well
 

1773
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:07,669
do so well
um at a negative 10.69 and negative

1774
00:32:07,669 --> 00:32:07,679
um at a negative 10.69 and negative
 

1775
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:10,850
um at a negative 10.69 and negative
10.69 and we rounded up to zero was

1776
00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:10,860
10.69 and we rounded up to zero was
 

1777
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:14,210
10.69 and we rounded up to zero was
Harvard and Harvard uh has been not very

1778
00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:14,220
Harvard and Harvard uh has been not very
 

1779
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:16,250
Harvard and Harvard uh has been not very
happy with that result the only school

1780
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:16,260
happy with that result the only school
 

1781
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:18,769
happy with that result the only school
to receive the abysmal ranking yeah and

1782
00:32:18,769 --> 00:32:18,779
to receive the abysmal ranking yeah and
 

1783
00:32:18,779 --> 00:32:21,350
to receive the abysmal ranking yeah and
there are a couple oh Harvard oh Harvard

1784
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:21,360
there are a couple oh Harvard oh Harvard
 

1785
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,610
there are a couple oh Harvard oh Harvard
and there are a couple people who have

1786
00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:22,620
and there are a couple people who have
 

1787
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:24,649
and there are a couple people who have
actually been really I think making a

1788
00:32:24,649 --> 00:32:24,659
actually been really I think making a
 

1789
00:32:24,659 --> 00:32:27,529
actually been really I think making a
mistake by getting very Harvard

1790
00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:27,539
mistake by getting very Harvard
 

1791
00:32:27,539 --> 00:32:29,269
mistake by getting very Harvard
um sounding by being like I've had

1792
00:32:29,269 --> 00:32:29,279
um sounding by being like I've had
 

1793
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:30,889
um sounding by being like I've had
statisticians look at this and they they

1794
00:32:30,889 --> 00:32:30,899
statisticians look at this and they they
 

1795
00:32:30,899 --> 00:32:33,289
statisticians look at this and they they
think your methodology is a joke and uh

1796
00:32:33,289 --> 00:32:33,299
think your methodology is a joke and uh
 

1797
00:32:33,299 --> 00:32:34,789
think your methodology is a joke and uh
and like pointing out in this case

1798
00:32:34,789 --> 00:32:34,799
and like pointing out in this case
 

1799
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:36,289
and like pointing out in this case
wasn't that important and that scholar

1800
00:32:36,289 --> 00:32:36,299
wasn't that important and that scholar
 

1801
00:32:36,299 --> 00:32:38,570
wasn't that important and that scholar
wasn't that scholar like one of the

1802
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:38,580
wasn't that scholar like one of the
 

1803
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:39,710
wasn't that scholar like one of the
arguments against one of the scholars

1804
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:39,720
arguments against one of the scholars
 

1805
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,990
arguments against one of the scholars
that we counted against them for uh

1806
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:42,000
that we counted against them for uh
 

1807
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,149
that we counted against them for uh
punishing was that that wasn't a very

1808
00:32:44,149 --> 00:32:44,159
punishing was that that wasn't a very
 

1809
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:46,250
punishing was that that wasn't a very
you know famous or influential scholar

1810
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:46,260
you know famous or influential scholar
 

1811
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:49,070
you know famous or influential scholar
and I'm kind of like so your argument

1812
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:49,080
and I'm kind of like so your argument
 

1813
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:52,130
and I'm kind of like so your argument
seems to be snobbery like essentially

1814
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:52,140
seems to be snobbery like essentially
 

1815
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:54,470
seems to be snobbery like essentially
that like you you're not understanding

1816
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:54,480
that like you you're not understanding
 

1817
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,570
that like you you're not understanding
our methodology for one thing and then

1818
00:32:56,570 --> 00:32:56,580
our methodology for one thing and then
 

1819
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:58,909
our methodology for one thing and then
you're saying that actually that scholar

1820
00:32:58,909 --> 00:32:58,919
you're saying that actually that scholar
 

1821
00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:00,590
you're saying that actually that scholar
wasn't important enough to count and by

1822
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:00,600
wasn't important enough to count and by
 

1823
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,870
wasn't important enough to count and by

of your arguments as true even if we
 

1831
00:33:12,299 --> 00:33:13,789
of your arguments as true even if we
decided to get rid of those two

1832
00:33:13,789 --> 00:33:13,799
decided to get rid of those two
 

1833
00:33:13,799 --> 00:33:15,049
decided to get rid of those two
professors

1834

professors
 

1835
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:16,730
professors
um you would still be in negative

1836
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:16,740
um you would still be in negative
 

1837
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:18,950
um you would still be in negative
numbers you would still be dead last you

1838
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:18,960
numbers you would still be dead last you
 

1839
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,810
numbers you would still be dead last you
would still be after Georgetown and Penn

1840
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:20,820
would still be after Georgetown and Penn
 

1841
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:22,549
would still be after Georgetown and Penn
and neither of those schools are good

1842

very well earned that they have so many
bad cases at all of those schools what's

00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:36,960
bad cases at all of those schools what's
 

1857
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,110
bad cases at all of those schools what's
the best way to find yourself in the

what's what's the fastest way to that
 

1863
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,210
what's what's the fastest way to that
negative to that zero a lot of

1864
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:44,220
negative to that zero a lot of
 

1865
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:45,649
negative to that zero a lot of
de-platforming

1866
00:33:45,649 --> 00:33:45,659
de-platforming
 

1867
00:33:45,659 --> 00:33:48,169
de-platforming
um that uh when we looked at the bottom

1868
00:33:48,169 --> 00:33:48,179
um that uh when we looked at the bottom
 

1869
00:33:48,179 --> 00:33:51,470
um that uh when we looked at the bottom
five uh 81 of attempts to get speakers

1870
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:51,480
five uh 81 of attempts to get speakers
 

1871
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,930
five uh 81 of attempts to get speakers
de-platformed were successful at the

1872
00:33:53,930 --> 00:33:53,940
de-platformed were successful at the
 

1873
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:55,610
de-platformed were successful at the
bottom five um there were a couple

1874
00:33:55,610 --> 00:33:55,620
bottom five um there were a couple
 

1875
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:57,230
bottom five um there were a couple
schools I think Penn included where

1876
00:33:57,230 --> 00:33:57,240
schools I think Penn included where
 

1877
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,690
schools I think Penn included where
every single attempt every time a

1878
00:33:59,690 --> 00:33:59,700
every single attempt every time a
 

1879
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,850
every single attempt every time a
student like objected a student group

1880
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:01,860
student like objected a student group
 

1881
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:03,529
student like objected a student group
objected to that speaker coming they

1882
00:34:03,529 --> 00:34:03,539
objected to that speaker coming they
 

1883
00:34:03,539 --> 00:34:05,810
objected to that speaker coming they
canceled this the speech and I think I

1884
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:05,820
canceled this the speech and I think I
 

1885
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:07,730
canceled this the speech and I think I
think Georgetown was 100 success right I

1886
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:07,740
think Georgetown was 100 success right I
 

1887
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:10,430
think Georgetown was 100 success right I
think Penn had 100 success rate I think

1888
00:34:10,430 --> 00:34:10,440
think Penn had 100 success rate I think
 

1889
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:12,710
think Penn had 100 success rate I think
Harvard did stand up for a couple but

1890
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:12,720
Harvard did stand up for a couple but
 

1891
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:15,349
Harvard did stand up for a couple but
mostly uh people got D platform there as

1892
00:34:15,349 --> 00:34:15,359
mostly uh people got D platform there as
 

1893
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:17,210
mostly uh people got D platform there as
well so how do you push back on

1894
00:34:17,210 --> 00:34:17,220
well so how do you push back on
 

1895
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:19,849
well so how do you push back on
de-platforming well who who would do it

1896
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:19,859
de-platforming well who who would do it
 

1897
00:34:19,859 --> 00:34:22,970
de-platforming well who who would do it

seeing the administrators be so uh so

2212
00:39:51,589 --> 00:39:51,599
seeing the administrators be so uh so
 

2213
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:53,270
seeing the administrators be so uh so
Brazen that they recorded the fact that

2214
00:39:53,270 --> 00:39:53,280
Brazen that they recorded the fact that
 

2215
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,589
Brazen that they recorded the fact that
they bought them tickets and sent them

2216
00:39:54,589 --> 00:39:54,599
they bought them tickets and sent them
 

2217
00:39:54,599 --> 00:39:57,470
they bought them tickets and sent them
but I think a lot of that stuff is is

2218
00:39:57,470 --> 00:39:57,480
but I think a lot of that stuff is is
 

2219
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:00,290
but I think a lot of that stuff is is
going on and I think it's the it's a

2220
00:40:00,290 --> 00:40:00,300
going on and I think it's the it's a
 

2221
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:01,970
going on and I think it's the it's a
good excuse to cut down on one of the

2222
00:40:01,970 --> 00:40:01,980
good excuse to cut down on one of the
 

2223
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:03,349
good excuse to cut down on one of the
big problems in higher education today

2224
00:40:03,349 --> 00:40:03,359
big problems in higher education today
 

2225
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:05,450
big problems in higher education today
which is hyper bureaucratization

2226
00:40:05,450 --> 00:40:05,460
which is hyper bureaucratization
 

2227
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:06,770
which is hyper bureaucratization
the new experience does their

2228
00:40:06,770 --> 00:40:06,780
the new experience does their
 

2229
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:08,450
the new experience does their
distinction between administrators and

2230
00:40:08,450 --> 00:40:08,460
distinction between administrators and
 

2231
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:11,750
distinction between administrators and
faculty in terms of uh perpetrators of

2232
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:11,760
faculty in terms of uh perpetrators of
 

2233
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:14,270
faculty in terms of uh perpetrators of
this of these kinds of things so if if

2234
00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:14,280
this of these kinds of things so if if
 

2235
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:16,370
this of these kinds of things so if if
we got rid of all like Harvey's talked

2236
00:40:16,370 --> 00:40:16,380
we got rid of all like Harvey's talked
 

2237
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:18,230
we got rid of all like Harvey's talked
about uh getting rid of a large

2238
00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:18,240
about uh getting rid of a large
 

2239
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,790
about uh getting rid of a large
percentage of the administration does

2240
00:40:19,790 --> 00:40:19,800
percentage of the administration does
 

2241
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,950
percentage of the administration does
that help fix the problem or is the

2242
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:21,960
that help fix the problem or is the
 

2243
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:25,069
that help fix the problem or is the
faculty also yeah small

2244
00:40:25,069 --> 00:40:25,079
faculty also yeah small
 

2245
00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:27,230
faculty also yeah small
percent of the faculty also part of the

2246
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:27,240
percent of the faculty also part of the
 

2247
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,970
percent of the faculty also part of the
encouraging in the organization of these

2248
00:40:28,970 --> 00:40:28,980
encouraging in the organization of these

kind of cancel yeah and and that's
 

2251
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,990
kind of cancel yeah and and that's
something that has been profoundly

2252
00:40:32,990 --> 00:40:33,000
something that has been profoundly
 

2253
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,910
something that has been profoundly
disappointing um is that when you look

2254
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:34,920
disappointing um is that when you look
 

2255
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:37,609
disappointing um is that when you look
at the huge uptick in attempts to get

2256
00:40:37,609 --> 00:40:37,619
at the huge uptick in attempts to get
 

2257
00:40:37,619 --> 00:40:39,109
at the huge uptick in attempts to get
professors fired that we've seen over

2258
00:40:39,109 --> 00:40:39,119
professors fired that we've seen over
 

2259
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:40,910
professors fired that we've seen over
the last 10 years

2260
00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:40,920
the last 10 years
 

2261
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:43,190
the last 10 years
and actually over the last 22 years as

2262
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:43,200
and actually over the last 22 years as
 

2263
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:46,430
and actually over the last 22 years as
far back as our records go

2264
00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:46,440
far back as our records go
 

2265
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,150
far back as our records go
um

2266
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:47,160
um
 

2267
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:49,310
um
at first they were overwhelmingly led by

2268
00:40:49,310 --> 00:40:49,320
at first they were overwhelmingly led by
 

2269
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:51,470
at first they were overwhelmingly led by
administrators attempts to get

2270
00:40:51,470 --> 00:40:51,480
administrators attempts to get
 

2271
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:53,150

um and that was most you know I'd say
 

2275
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,650
um and that was most you know I'd say
that was my career up until 2013 was was

2276
00:40:57,650 --> 00:40:57,660
that was my career up until 2013 was was
 

2277
00:40:57,660 --> 00:41:00,230
that was my career up until 2013 was was
fighting back at administrative excesses

2278
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:00,240
fighting back at administrative excesses

um then you start having the problem in
 

2281
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:04,069
um then you start having the problem in
2014 of students trying to get people

2282
00:41:04,069 --> 00:41:04,079
2014 of students trying to get people

00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:09,109
canceled um and that really accelerated
in 2017 and the number so one way that

00:41:09,109 --> 00:41:09,119
in 2017 and the number so one way that
 

2287
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:10,670
in 2017 and the number so one way that
one one thing that makes it easier to

that's so interesting because I feel
 

2567
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:17,210
that's so interesting because I feel
like that comes into play on social

2568

carrot question is almost more
 

2577

all of these tactics and start using
 

2761
00:49:56,579 --> 00:49:59,030
all of these tactics and start using
them on X all the time because they are

2762
00:49:59,030 --> 00:49:59,040
them on X all the time because they are
 

2763

put first for a reason you know it'd be
an interesting idea to actually

2768
00:50:04,910 --> 00:50:04,920
an interesting idea to actually
 

2769
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:08,030
an interesting idea to actually
integrate that into Twitter X where

2770
00:50:08,030 --> 00:50:08,040
integrate that into Twitter X where
 

2771

fascinating it works really really well
 

2787
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:28,250
fascinating it works really really well
but to give it a little more structure

2788

but to give it a little more structure
 

2789
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:30,050

yeah that's a really interesting method
 

2791
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:31,910

actually yeah I actually when I was

2792
00:50:31,910 --> 00:50:31,920
actually yeah I actually when I was
 

2793
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:33,950
actually yeah I actually when I was
thinking about ways that X could be used

2794
00:50:33,950 --> 00:50:33,960
thinking about ways that X could be used
 

2795
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:36,230
thinking about ways that X could be used
for to argue towards truth I wouldn't

2796
00:50:36,230 --> 00:50:36,240
for to argue towards truth I wouldn't
 

2797
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:37,790
for to argue towards truth I wouldn't
want to have it so that you know

2798

want to have it so that you know
 

2799
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:40,010
want to have it so that you know
everybody would be bound to that but I

2800
00:50:40,010 --> 00:50:40,020
everybody would be bound to that but I
 

2801
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:42,710
everybody would be bound to that but I
think that I imagine almost being like a

2802
00:50:42,710 --> 00:50:42,720
think that I imagine almost being like a
 

2803
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:45,230
think that I imagine almost being like a
stream within X that was truth focused

2804
00:50:45,230 --> 00:50:45,240
stream within X that was truth focused
 

2805
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:47,510
stream within X that was truth focused
that that agrees to some additional

2806
00:50:47,510 --> 00:50:47,520
that that agrees to some additional
 

2807
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:49,670
that that agrees to some additional
rules on how they would argue man I

2808
00:50:49,670 --> 00:50:49,680
rules on how they would argue man I

2811
00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:54,470
would love that where like there's in
terms of streams that intersect and can

2812
00:50:54,470 --> 00:50:54,480
terms of streams that intersect and can
 

2813
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:57,410
terms of streams that intersect and can
be separated the talking one where

2814

3843
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:32,510
being a hypocrite is not a good tactic
for truth but by the way it tends to

3844
01:09:32,510 --> 01:09:32,520
for truth but by the way it tends to
 

3845
01:09:32,520 --> 01:09:34,070

so that hence the projection but

3852
01:09:39,349 --> 01:09:39,359
so that hence the projection but
 

3853
01:09:39,359 --> 01:09:41,269
so that hence the projection but
basically not doing the research about

3854
01:09:41,269 --> 01:09:41,279
basically not doing the research about
 

3855
01:09:41,279 --> 01:09:43,070
basically not doing the research about
whether the person is or isn't a

3856
01:09:43,070 --> 01:09:43,080
whether the person is or isn't a
 

3857
01:09:43,080 --> 01:09:46,070
whether the person is or isn't a
hypocrite and assuming others are a

3858
01:09:46,070 --> 01:09:46,080
hypocrite and assuming others are a
 

3859
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:48,650
hypocrite and assuming others are a
large fraction of others reading it uh

3860
01:09:48,650 --> 01:09:48,660
large fraction of others reading it uh
 

3861
01:09:48,660 --> 01:09:50,570
large fraction of others reading it uh
will also not do the research and

3862
01:09:50,570 --> 01:09:50,580
will also not do the research and
 

3863
01:09:50,580 --> 01:09:52,249
will also not do the research and
therefore this kind of

3864
01:09:52,249 --> 01:09:52,259
therefore this kind of
 

3865
01:09:52,259 --> 01:09:54,650
therefore this kind of
statement becomes a kind of truthiness

3866
01:09:54,650 --> 01:09:54,660
statement becomes a kind of truthiness
 

3867
01:09:54,660 --> 01:09:56,630
statement becomes a kind of truthiness
without a grounding in actual reality

3868

without a grounding in actual reality
 

3869
01:09:56,640 --> 01:09:58,669
without a grounding in actual reality
yeah it breaks down that barrier between

01:09:58,669 --> 01:09:58,679
yeah it breaks down that barrier between
 

3871
01:09:58,679 --> 01:10:01,189
yeah it breaks down that barrier between

4169
01:15:30,900 --> 01:15:32,270
biggest study that was done of what was
going on is I think this came out in

01:15:32,270 --> 01:15:32,280
going on is I think this came out in
 

4171
01:15:32,280 --> 01:15:36,229
going on is I think this came out in
like 55 and the evaluation was that

4172
01:15:36,229 --> 01:15:36,239
like 55 and the evaluation was that
 

4173
01:15:36,239 --> 01:15:39,530
like 55 and the evaluation was that
there was about 62 professors fired for

4180
01:15:47,090 --> 01:15:47,100
views overall
 

4181
01:15:47,100 --> 01:15:49,610
views overall
um that usually is it is reported as

4182
01:15:49,610 --> 01:15:49,620
um that usually is it is reported as
 

4183
01:15:49,620 --> 01:15:52,070
um that usually is it is reported as
being about 100.

4184
01:15:52,070 --> 01:15:52,080
being about 100.
 

4185
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:54,830
being about 100.
um so 60 90 100 depending on how you

4186
01:15:54,830 --> 01:15:54,840
um so 60 90 100 depending on how you
 

4187
01:15:54,840 --> 01:15:56,090
um so 60 90 100 depending on how you
look at it I think the number is

4188
01:15:56,090 --> 01:15:56,100
look at it I think the number is
 

4189
01:15:56,100 --> 01:15:57,590
look at it I think the number is
actually higher

4190
01:15:57,590 --> 01:15:57,600
actually higher
 

4191
01:15:57,600 --> 01:15:59,689
actually higher
um but that's only because of hindsight

4192
01:15:59,689 --> 01:15:59,699
um but that's only because of hindsight
 

4193
01:15:59,699 --> 01:16:01,610
um but that's only because of hindsight
like what I mean by hindsight is we can

4194
01:16:01,610 --> 01:16:01,620
like what I mean by hindsight is we can
 

4195
01:16:01,620 --> 01:16:03,290
like what I mean by hindsight is we can
look back and we actually find there are

4196
01:16:03,290 --> 01:16:03,300
look back and we actually find there are
 

4197
01:16:03,300 --> 01:16:05,810
look back and we actually find there are
more professors who who were fired as

4198
01:16:05,810 --> 01:16:05,820
more professors who who were fired as
 

4199

in the nine and a half years of Castle

4208
01:16:14,810 --> 01:16:14,820
in the nine and a half years of Castle
 

4209

4215
01:16:23,159 --> 01:16:25,850
probably you know somewhere around 100
maybe probably more it's got the number

4216
01:16:25,850 --> 01:16:25,860
maybe probably more it's got the number
 

4217
01:16:25,860 --> 01:16:28,430
maybe probably more it's got the number
is going to keep going up um but unlike

4218
01:16:28,430 --> 01:16:28,440
is going to keep going up um but unlike
 

4219
01:16:28,440 --> 01:16:29,750
is going to keep going up um but unlike
during the Red Scare where people could

4220
01:16:29,750 --> 01:16:29,760
during the Red Scare where people could
 

4221

so I'm still dealing with people who are
saying this isn't happening at all and

4228
01:16:36,350 --> 01:16:36,360
saying this isn't happening at all and
 

4229
01:16:36,360 --> 01:16:38,870
saying this isn't happening at all and
it hasn't been subtle on campus and we

01:16:38,870 --> 01:16:38,880
it hasn't been subtle on campus and we
 

4231
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:40,310
it hasn't been subtle on campus and we
know that's a wild undercount by the way

4232
01:16:40,310 --> 01:16:40,320
know that's a wild undercount by the way
 

4233
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:41,689
know that's a wild undercount by the way
because when we when we surveyed

4234
01:16:41,689 --> 01:16:41,699

Seventeen percent of them said that they
 

4239
01:16:46,020 --> 01:16:48,530
Seventeen percent of them said that they
had been threatened with uh threatened

4240
01:16:48,530 --> 01:16:48,540
had been threatened with uh threatened
 

4241
01:16:48,540 --> 01:16:49,850
had been threatened with uh threatened
with investigation or actually

4242
01:16:49,850 --> 01:16:49,860
with investigation or actually
 

4243
01:16:49,860 --> 01:16:52,490
with investigation or actually
investigated for what they taught said

4244
01:16:52,490 --> 01:16:52,500
investigated for what they taught said
 

4245
01:16:52,500 --> 01:16:55,610
investigated for what they taught said
or or their research and one-third of

4246
01:16:55,610 --> 01:16:55,620
or or their research and one-third of
 

4247
01:16:55,620 --> 01:16:57,709
or or their research and one-third of
them said that they were told by

4248
01:16:57,709 --> 01:16:57,719
them said that they were told by
 

4249
01:16:57,719 --> 01:16:59,270
them said that they were told by
administrators not to take on

4250
01:16:59,270 --> 01:16:59,280
administrators not to take on
 

4251
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:01,610
administrators not to take on
controversial research so like

4252
01:17:01,610 --> 01:17:01,620
controversial research so like
 

4253
01:17:01,620 --> 01:17:03,770
controversial research so like
extrapolating that out that's a huge

4254
01:17:03,770 --> 01:17:03,780
extrapolating that out that's a huge
 

4255
01:17:03,780 --> 01:17:04,970
extrapolating that out that's a huge
number and the reason why you're not

4256
01:17:04,970 --> 01:17:04,980
number and the reason why you're not
 

4257
01:17:04,980 --> 01:17:06,530
number and the reason why you're not
going to hear about a lot of these cases

4258
01:17:06,530 --> 01:17:06,540
going to hear about a lot of these cases
 

4259
01:17:06,540 --> 01:17:08,090
going to hear about a lot of these cases
is because there are so many different

4260
01:17:08,090 --> 01:17:08,100
is because there are so many different
 

4261
01:17:08,100 --> 01:17:10,550
is because there are so many different
Conformity inducing mechanisms in the

4262
01:17:10,550 --> 01:17:10,560
Conformity inducing mechanisms in the
 

4263
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:12,350
Conformity inducing mechanisms in the
whole thing yeah and that's one of the

4264
01:17:12,350 --> 01:17:12,360
whole thing yeah and that's one of the
 

4265
01:17:12,360 --> 01:17:14,090
whole thing yeah and that's one of the
reasons why the idea that you'd add

4266
01:17:14,090 --> 01:17:14,100
reasons why the idea that you'd add
 

4267
01:17:14,100 --> 01:17:16,490
reasons why the idea that you'd add
something like a d like requiring a Dei

4268
01:17:16,490 --> 01:17:16,500
something like a d like requiring a Dei
 

4269
01:17:16,500 --> 01:17:18,770
something like a d like requiring a Dei
statement to be hired or to get into a

4270
01:17:18,770 --> 01:17:18,780

4271
01:17:18,780 --> 01:17:20,810

school Under the current environment is
 

4273
01:17:20,820 --> 01:17:23,870
school Under the current environment is
so completely nuts we have had a genuine

4274
01:17:23,870 --> 01:17:23,880
so completely nuts we have had a genuine
 

4275
01:17:23,880 --> 01:17:25,669
so completely nuts we have had a genuine
crisis of academic freedom over the last

4276
01:17:25,669 --> 01:17:25,679
crisis of academic freedom over the last
 

4277
01:17:25,679 --> 01:17:28,430
crisis of academic freedom over the last
you know particularly since 2017 on

4278
01:17:28,430 --> 01:17:28,440
you know particularly since 2017 on
 

4279
01:17:28,440 --> 01:17:30,770
you know particularly since 2017 on
campuses we have very low Viewpoint

4280
01:17:30,770 --> 01:17:30,780
campuses we have very low Viewpoint
 

4281
01:17:30,780 --> 01:17:33,590
campuses we have very low Viewpoint
diversity to begin with and under these

4282
01:17:33,590 --> 01:17:33,600
diversity to begin with and under these
 

4283
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:35,450
diversity to begin with and under these
circumstances administrators to start

4284
01:17:35,450 --> 01:17:35,460
circumstances administrators to start
 

4285
01:17:35,460 --> 01:17:37,669
circumstances administrators to start
saying you know what the problem is we

4286
01:17:37,669 --> 01:17:37,679
saying you know what the problem is we
 

4287
01:17:37,679 --> 01:17:40,310
saying you know what the problem is we
have too much heterogeneous thought we

4288
01:17:40,310 --> 01:17:40,320
have too much heterogeneous thought we
 

4289
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:41,930
have too much heterogeneous thought we
have we're not homogeneous enough we

4290
01:17:41,930 --> 01:17:41,940
have we're not homogeneous enough we
 

4291
01:17:41,940 --> 01:17:44,330
have we're not homogeneous enough we
actually need in we need another

4292
01:17:44,330 --> 01:17:44,340
actually need in we need another
 

4293
01:17:44,340 --> 01:17:47,270
actually need in we need another
political litmus test which is nuts and

4294
01:17:47,270 --> 01:17:47,280
political litmus test which is nuts and
 

4295
01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:48,890
political litmus test which is nuts and
that's what a Dei statement effectively

4296
01:17:48,890 --> 01:17:48,900
that's what a Dei statement effectively
 

4297
01:17:48,900 --> 01:17:50,870
that's what a Dei statement effectively
is because there's no way to actually

4298
01:17:50,870 --> 01:17:50,880
is because there's no way to actually
 

4299
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:52,550
is because there's no way to actually
fill out a dais statement without

4300
01:17:52,550 --> 01:17:52,560
fill out a dais statement without
 

4301
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:54,890
fill out a dais statement without
someone evaluating you on your politics

4302
01:17:54,890 --> 01:17:54,900
someone evaluating you on your politics
 

4303
01:17:54,900 --> 01:17:57,410
someone evaluating you on your politics
it's CR it's Crystal Clear we even did

4304
01:17:57,410 --> 01:17:57,420
it's CR it's Crystal Clear we even did
 

4305
01:17:57,420 --> 01:18:00,410
it's CR it's Crystal Clear we even did
an experiment on this uh Nate Honeycutt

4306
01:18:00,410 --> 01:18:00,420
an experiment on this uh Nate Honeycutt
 

4307
01:18:00,420 --> 01:18:02,810
an experiment on this uh Nate Honeycutt
he got something like almost like 3 000

4308
01:18:02,810 --> 01:18:02,820
he got something like almost like 3 000
 

4309
01:18:02,820 --> 01:18:05,570
he got something like almost like 3 000
professors to participate evaluating

4310
01:18:05,570 --> 01:18:05,580
professors to participate evaluating
 

4311
01:18:05,580 --> 01:18:09,229
professors to participate evaluating
different kinds of Dei statements

4312
01:18:09,229 --> 01:18:09,239
different kinds of Dei statements
 

4313
01:18:09,239 --> 01:18:11,209
different kinds of Dei statements
um and one was basically like the

4314
01:18:11,209 --> 01:18:11,219
um and one was basically like the
 

4315
01:18:11,219 --> 01:18:13,250
um and one was basically like the
standard kind of identity politics

4316
01:18:13,250 --> 01:18:13,260
standard kind of identity politics
 

4317
01:18:13,260 --> 01:18:15,890
standard kind of identity politics
intersectionality one one was about

4318
01:18:15,890 --> 01:18:15,900
intersectionality one one was about
 

4319
01:18:15,900 --> 01:18:17,990
intersectionality one one was about
Viewpoint diversity one was about

4320
01:18:17,990 --> 01:18:18,000
Viewpoint diversity one was about
 

4321
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,110
Viewpoint diversity one was about
religious diversity and one was about

4322
01:18:20,110 --> 01:18:20,120
religious diversity and one was about
 

4323
01:18:20,120 --> 01:18:22,490
religious diversity and one was about
socioeconomic diversity as far as where

4324
01:18:22,490 --> 01:18:22,500
socioeconomic diversity as far as where
 

4325
01:18:22,500 --> 01:18:24,649
socioeconomic diversity as far as where
my heart really is it's that we have too

4326
01:18:24,649 --> 01:18:24,659
my heart really is it's that we have too
 

4327
01:18:24,659 --> 01:18:26,090
my heart really is it's that we have too
little socioeconomic diversity

4328
01:18:26,090 --> 01:18:26,100
little socioeconomic diversity
 

4329
01:18:26,100 --> 01:18:27,709
little socioeconomic diversity
particularly in Elite higher ed but also

4330
01:18:27,709 --> 01:18:27,719
particularly in Elite higher ed but also
 

4331
01:18:27,719 --> 01:18:31,490
particularly in Elite higher ed but also
in education period so we the experiment

4332
01:18:31,490 --> 01:18:31,500
in education period so we the experiment
 

4333
01:18:31,500 --> 01:18:32,330
in education period so we the experiment
was

4334
01:18:32,330 --> 01:18:32,340
was
 

4335
01:18:32,340 --> 01:18:34,550
was
a large participation really

4336
01:18:34,550 --> 01:18:34,560
a large participation really
 

4337
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:36,470
a large participation really
interestingly set up and it tried to

4338
01:18:36,470 --> 01:18:36,480
interestingly set up and it tried to
 

4339
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:37,910
interestingly set up and it tried to
model the way a lot of these Dei

4340
01:18:37,910 --> 01:18:37,920
model the way a lot of these Dei
 

4341
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:40,189
model the way a lot of these Dei
policies were actually implemented and

4342
01:18:40,189 --> 01:18:40,199
policies were actually implemented and
 

4343
01:18:40,199 --> 01:18:41,510
policies were actually implemented and
one of the ways these have been

4344
01:18:41,510 --> 01:18:41,520
one of the ways these have been
 

4345
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:43,010
one of the ways these have been
implemented and I think in some of the

4346
01:18:43,010 --> 01:18:43,020
implemented and I think in some of the
 

4347
01:18:43,020 --> 01:18:44,450
implemented and I think in some of the
California schools is that

4348
01:18:44,450 --> 01:18:44,460
California schools is that
 

4349
01:18:44,460 --> 01:18:47,330
California schools is that
administrators and go through the Dei

4350
01:18:47,330 --> 01:18:47,340
administrators and go through the Dei
 

4351
01:18:47,340 --> 01:18:49,310
administrators and go through the Dei
statements before

4352
01:18:49,310 --> 01:18:49,320
statements before
 

4353
01:18:49,320 --> 01:18:51,110
statements before
anyone else looks at them and then

4354
01:18:51,110 --> 01:18:51,120
anyone else looks at them and then
 

4355
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:52,910
anyone else looks at them and then
eliminates people off the top depending

4356
01:18:52,910 --> 01:18:52,920
eliminates people off the top depending
 

4357
01:18:52,920 --> 01:18:53,870
eliminates people off the top depending
on how

4358
01:18:53,870 --> 01:18:53,880
on how
 

4359
01:18:53,880 --> 01:18:57,890
on how
they feel about their Dei statements and

4360
01:18:57,890 --> 01:18:57,900
they feel about their Dei statements and
 

4361
01:18:57,900 --> 01:18:59,930
they feel about their Dei statements and
the one on

4362
01:18:59,930 --> 01:18:59,940
the one on
 

4363
01:18:59,940 --> 01:19:02,750
the one on
um Viewpoint diversity I think like half

4364
01:19:02,750 --> 01:19:02,760
um Viewpoint diversity I think like half
 

4365
01:19:02,760 --> 01:19:04,130
um Viewpoint diversity I think like half
of the people who reviewed it would

4366
01:19:04,130 --> 01:19:04,140
of the people who reviewed it would
 

4367
01:19:04,140 --> 01:19:06,410
of the people who reviewed it would
eliminate it right out

4368
01:19:06,410 --> 01:19:06,420
eliminate it right out
 

4369
01:19:06,420 --> 01:19:07,790
eliminate it right out
um and I think it was basically the same

4370
01:19:07,790 --> 01:19:07,800
um and I think it was basically the same
 

4371
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:10,490
um and I think it was basically the same
for religious diversity it was slightly

4372
01:19:10,490 --> 01:19:10,500
for religious diversity it was slightly
 

4373
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:12,709
for religious diversity it was slightly
better like 40

4374
01:19:12,709 --> 01:19:12,719
better like 40
 

4375
01:19:12,719 --> 01:19:15,290
better like 40
um for socioeconomic diversity but that

4376
01:19:15,290 --> 01:19:15,300
um for socioeconomic diversity but that
 

4377
01:19:15,300 --> 01:19:16,910
um for socioeconomic diversity but that
kills me like the idea that kind of like

4378
01:19:16,910 --> 01:19:16,920
kills me like the idea that kind of like
 

4379
01:19:16,920 --> 01:19:18,290
kills me like the idea that kind of like
yeah that actually is the kind of

4380
01:19:18,290 --> 01:19:18,300
yeah that actually is the kind of
 

4381
01:19:18,300 --> 01:19:19,550
yeah that actually is the kind of
diversity that I think we need a great

4382
01:19:19,550 --> 01:19:19,560
diversity that I think we need a great
 

4383
01:19:19,560 --> 01:19:21,470
diversity that I think we need a great
deal more of in in higher education you

4384
01:19:21,470 --> 01:19:21,480
deal more of in in higher education you
 

4385
01:19:21,480 --> 01:19:23,810
deal more of in in higher education you
can agree with it's not hostile to the

4386
01:19:23,810 --> 01:19:23,820
can agree with it's not hostile to the
 

4387
01:19:23,820 --> 01:19:25,850
can agree with it's not hostile to the
other kinds by the way um but the idea

4388
01:19:25,850 --> 01:19:25,860
other kinds by the way um but the idea
 

4389
01:19:25,860 --> 01:19:27,890
other kinds by the way um but the idea
that we need more people from the bottom

4390
01:19:27,890 --> 01:19:27,900
that we need more people from the bottom
 

4391
01:19:27,900 --> 01:19:30,229
that we need more people from the bottom
you know of three quarters of American

4392
01:19:30,229 --> 01:19:30,239
you know of three quarters of American
 

4393
01:19:30,239 --> 01:19:32,810
you know of three quarters of American
society like in uh higher education I

4394
01:19:32,810 --> 01:19:32,820
society like in uh higher education I
 

4395
01:19:32,820 --> 01:19:33,890
society like in uh higher education I
think should be something we could all

4396
01:19:33,890 --> 01:19:33,900
think should be something we could all
 

4397
01:19:33,900 --> 01:19:35,570

01:19:35,570 --> 01:19:35,580
get around that the only one that really

01:19:35,580 --> 01:19:37,189
get around that the only one that really
succeeded was the one that's that

okay
there's no way this couldn't be a

there's no way this couldn't be a
 

4411
01:19:45,900 --> 01:19:48,229
there's no way this couldn't be a
political litmus test we've proved that

4412
01:19:48,229 --> 01:19:48,239
political litmus test we've proved that
 

4413
01:19:48,239 --> 01:19:49,910
political litmus test we've proved that
it's a political litmus test and still

4414
01:19:49,910 --> 01:19:49,920
it's a political litmus test and still
 

4415
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:52,490
it's a political litmus test and still
school after school it is adding these

4416
01:19:52,490 --> 01:19:52,500
school after school it is adding these
 

4417
01:19:52,500 --> 01:19:54,290
school after school it is adding these

schools still more ideologically
 

4421
01:19:56,760 --> 01:19:58,790
schools still more ideologically

01:19:58,790 --> 01:19:58,800
homogeneous why does that have a
 

4423
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:01,010
homogeneous why does that have a
negative effect is it because

4424
01:20:01,010 --> 01:20:01,020
negative effect is it because
 

4425
01:20:01,020 --> 01:20:04,189
negative effect is it because
it enforces a kind of group think where

yeah there's some element of it that
 

4497
01:21:24,420 --> 01:21:26,209
yeah there's some element of it that
creates this

4498
01:21:26,209 --> 01:21:26,219
creates this
 

4499
01:21:26,219 --> 01:21:28,970

the firing the thing I wanted to say is
 

4503
01:21:31,199 --> 01:21:33,430
the firing the thing I wanted to say is
firing a hundred people or 200 people

4504
01:21:33,430 --> 01:21:33,440
firing a hundred people or 200 people
 

4505
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:36,590
firing a hundred people or 200 people
the point is even firing one person I've

4506
01:21:36,590 --> 01:21:36,600
the point is even firing one person I've
 

4507
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:39,050
the point is even firing one person I've
just seen it it can create this quiet

4508
01:21:39,050 --> 01:21:39,060
just seen it it can create this quiet
 

4509
01:21:39,060 --> 01:21:42,229
just seen it it can create this quiet
ripple effect of fear of course that

4510
01:21:42,229 --> 01:21:42,239
ripple effect of fear of course that
 

4511
01:21:42,239 --> 01:21:44,870
ripple effect of fear of course that
single firing of a fact oh absolutely

4512

single firing of a fact oh absolutely
 

4513
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:48,290
single firing of a fact oh absolutely
has a ripple effect across tens of

01:21:48,290 --> 01:21:48,300
has a ripple effect across tens of
 

4515
01:21:48,300 --> 01:21:51,169
has a ripple effect across tens of
thousands of people of educators of of

01:21:51,179 --> 01:21:53,330
thousands of people of educators of of
uh who's hired what kind of

01:21:53,330 --> 01:21:53,340
uh who's hired what kind of
 

4519
01:21:53,340 --> 01:21:55,550
uh who's hired what kind of
conversations are being had had what

4520

conversations are being had had what
 

4521
01:21:55,560 --> 01:21:57,770
conversations are being had had what
kind of textbooks are chosen what kind

4522
01:21:57,770 --> 01:21:57,780
kind of textbooks are chosen what kind
 

4523
01:21:57,780 --> 01:21:59,390

of sell censorship and different flavors
 

4525
01:21:59,400 --> 01:22:01,490
of sell censorship and different flavors
of that is happening it's hard to

4526
01:22:01,490 --> 01:22:01,500
of that is happening it's hard to
 

4527
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:04,070
of that is happening it's hard to
measure that yeah I mean when you ask

4528
01:22:04,070 --> 01:22:04,080
measure that yeah I mean when you ask
 

4529
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:05,810
measure that yeah I mean when you ask
professors about you know are they

likely to self-censor on campus now
 

4567
01:22:42,719 --> 01:22:46,370
likely to self-censor on campus now
at the time they were surveyed then they

4568
01:22:46,370 --> 01:22:46,380
at the time they were surveyed then they
 

4569
01:22:46,380 --> 01:22:48,110
at the time they were surveyed then they
were when they first started college so

4570
01:22:48,110 --> 01:22:48,120
were when they first started college so
 

4571
01:22:48,120 --> 01:22:50,930
were when they first started college so
sort of college is kind of instilling

4572
01:22:50,930 --> 01:22:50,940
sort of college is kind of instilling
 

4573
01:22:50,940 --> 01:22:53,750
sort of college is kind of instilling
this idea of of censorship of

4574
01:22:53,750 --> 01:22:53,760
this idea of of censorship of
 

4575
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:55,070
this idea of of censorship of

Square comparison and this is one of the
 

4579
01:22:56,820 --> 01:22:58,010
Square comparison and this is one of the
interesting things about the data as

4580
01:22:58,010 --> 01:22:58,020
interesting things about the data as
 

4581
01:22:58,020 --> 01:23:01,010
interesting things about the data as
well is that that same study that I was

4582
01:23:01,010 --> 01:23:01,020
well is that that same study that I was
 

4583
01:23:01,020 --> 01:23:02,149
well is that that same study that I was
talking about the most comprehensive

4584
01:23:02,149 --> 01:23:02,159
talking about the most comprehensive
 

4585
01:23:02,159 --> 01:23:04,130
talking about the most comprehensive
study of the of the Red Scare there was

4586
01:23:04,130 --> 01:23:04,140
study of the of the Red Scare there was
 

4587
01:23:04,140 --> 01:23:06,050
study of the of the Red Scare there was
polling about whether or not professors

4588
01:23:06,050 --> 01:23:06,060
polling about whether or not professors
 

4589
01:23:06,060 --> 01:23:08,090
polling about whether or not professors
were self-censoring due to the fear of

4590
01:23:08,090 --> 01:23:08,100
were self-censoring due to the fear of
 

4591
01:23:08,100 --> 01:23:09,169
were self-censoring due to the fear of
the environment

4592
01:23:09,169 --> 01:23:09,179
the environment
 

4593
01:23:09,179 --> 01:23:11,510
the environment
and nine percent of professors said that

4594
01:23:11,510 --> 01:23:11,520
and nine percent of professors said that
 

4595
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:13,490
and nine percent of professors said that
they were self-censoring their research

4596
01:23:13,490 --> 01:23:13,500
they were self-censoring their research
 

4597
01:23:13,500 --> 01:23:15,830
they were self-censoring their research
and what they were saying nine percent

4598
01:23:15,830 --> 01:23:15,840
and what they were saying nine percent
 

4599
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:17,689
and what they were saying nine percent
is really bad

4600
01:23:17,689 --> 01:23:17,699
is really bad
 

4601
01:23:17,699 --> 01:23:19,729
is really bad
um that's almost a tenth of professors

4602
01:23:19,729 --> 01:23:19,739
um that's almost a tenth of professors
 

4603
01:23:19,739 --> 01:23:21,410
um that's almost a tenth of professors
saying that they were actually their

4604
01:23:21,410 --> 01:23:21,420
saying that they were actually their
 

4605
01:23:21,420 --> 01:23:23,870
saying that they were actually their
speech was chilled when we did this

4606
01:23:23,870 --> 01:23:23,880
speech was chilled when we did this
 

4607
01:23:23,880 --> 01:23:26,270
speech was chilled when we did this
question for professors on our latest

4608
01:23:26,270 --> 01:23:26,280
question for professors on our latest
 

4609
01:23:26,280 --> 01:23:29,209
question for professors on our latest
faculty survey when you factor together

4610
01:23:29,209 --> 01:23:29,219
faculty survey when you factor together
 

4611
01:23:29,219 --> 01:23:31,130
faculty survey when you factor together
if they're we ask them are they

4612
01:23:31,130 --> 01:23:31,140
if they're we ask them are they
 

4613
01:23:31,140 --> 01:23:32,330
if they're we ask them are they
self-censoring in their research are

4614
01:23:32,330 --> 01:23:32,340
self-censoring in their research are
 

4615
01:23:32,340 --> 01:23:33,530
self-censoring in their research are
they self-centering in class are they

4616
01:23:33,530 --> 01:23:33,540
they self-centering in class are they
 

4617
01:23:33,540 --> 01:23:37,310
they self-centering in class are they
still censoring online Etc it's 90 of

4618
01:23:37,310 --> 01:23:37,320
still censoring online Etc it's 90 of
 

4619
01:23:37,320 --> 01:23:39,530
still censoring online Etc it's 90 of
professors so the the idea that we're

4620
01:23:39,530 --> 01:23:39,540
professors so the the idea that we're
 

4621
01:23:39,540 --> 01:23:41,330
professors so the the idea that we're
actually in an environment that is

4622
01:23:41,330 --> 01:23:41,340
actually in an environment that is
 

4623
01:23:41,340 --> 01:23:44,270
actually in an environment that is
historic um in terms of like how scared

4624
01:23:44,270 --> 01:23:44,280
historic um in terms of like how scared
 

4625
01:23:44,280 --> 01:23:46,130
historic um in terms of like how scared
people are actually of expressing

4626
01:23:46,130 --> 01:23:46,140
people are actually of expressing
 

4627
01:23:46,140 --> 01:23:48,169
people are actually of expressing
controversial views I think that it's

4628
01:23:48,169 --> 01:23:48,179
controversial views I think that it's
 

4629
01:23:48,179 --> 01:23:49,850
controversial views I think that it's
it's the reason why we're going to

4630
01:23:49,850 --> 01:23:49,860
it's the reason why we're going to
 

4631
01:23:49,860 --> 01:23:52,250
it's the reason why we're going to
actually be studying this in 50 years

4632
01:23:52,250 --> 01:23:52,260
actually be studying this in 50 years
 

4633
01:23:52,260 --> 01:23:54,229
actually be studying this in 50 years
the same the the same way we study the

4634
01:23:54,229 --> 01:23:54,239
the same the the same way we study the
 

4635
01:23:54,239 --> 01:23:56,990
the same the the same way we study the
Red Scare um it's not the idea that this

4636
01:23:56,990 --> 01:23:57,000
Red Scare um it's not the idea that this
 

4637
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:58,490
Red Scare um it's not the idea that this
isn't happening is will just be

4638
01:23:58,490 --> 01:23:58,500
isn't happening is will just be
 

4639
01:23:58,500 --> 01:24:01,310
isn't happening is will just be
correctly viewed as insane so maybe we

4640
01:24:01,310 --> 01:24:01,320
correctly viewed as insane so maybe we
 

4641
01:24:01,320 --> 01:24:03,830
correctly viewed as insane so maybe we
can just uh discuss the Leaning the

4642
01:24:03,830 --> 01:24:03,840
can just uh discuss the Leaning the
 

4643
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:06,050
can just uh discuss the Leaning the
current leaning of Academia towards the

4644
01:24:06,050 --> 01:24:06,060
current leaning of Academia towards the
 

4645
01:24:06,060 --> 01:24:08,090
current leaning of Academia towards the
left which you describe in various

4646
01:24:08,090 --> 01:24:08,100
left which you describe in various
 

4647
01:24:08,100 --> 01:24:10,130
left which you describe in various
different perspectives so one there's a

4648
01:24:10,130 --> 01:24:10,140
different perspectives so one there's a
 

4649
01:24:10,140 --> 01:24:13,070
different perspectives so one there's a
voter registration ratio chart that you

4650
01:24:13,070 --> 01:24:13,080
voter registration ratio chart that you
 

4651
01:24:13,080 --> 01:24:14,570
voter registration ratio chart that you
have by Department which I think is

4652
01:24:14,570 --> 01:24:14,580
have by Department which I think is
 

4653
01:24:14,580 --> 01:24:15,530
have by Department which I think is
interesting

4654
01:24:15,530 --> 01:24:15,540
interesting
 

4655
01:24:15,540 --> 01:24:17,570
interesting
can you explain this chart and can you

4656
01:24:17,570 --> 01:24:17,580
can you explain this chart and can you
 

4657
01:24:17,580 --> 01:24:19,850
can you explain this chart and can you
explain what it shows yeah when I

4658
01:24:19,850 --> 01:24:19,860
explain what it shows yeah when I
 

4659
01:24:19,860 --> 01:24:22,430
explain what it shows yeah when I
started fire in 2001 I didn't take the

4660
01:24:22,430 --> 01:24:22,440
started fire in 2001 I didn't take the
 

4661
01:24:22,440 --> 01:24:25,010
started fire in 2001 I didn't take the
Viewpoint diversity issue as seriously I

4662
01:24:25,010 --> 01:24:25,020
Viewpoint diversity issue as seriously I
 

4663
01:24:25,020 --> 01:24:25,850
Viewpoint diversity issue as seriously I
thought it was just something that right

4664
01:24:25,850 --> 01:24:25,860
thought it was just something that right
 

4665
01:24:25,860 --> 01:24:28,189
thought it was just something that right
Wingers complained about

4666
01:24:28,189 --> 01:24:28,199
Wingers complained about
 

4667
01:24:28,199 --> 01:24:30,290
Wingers complained about
um but I really started to get what

4668
01:24:30,290 --> 01:24:30,300
um but I really started to get what
 

4669
01:24:30,300 --> 01:24:32,810
um but I really started to get what
happens when you have a community with

4670
01:24:32,810 --> 01:24:32,820
happens when you have a community with
 

4671
01:24:32,820 --> 01:24:34,130
happens when you have a community with
low

4672
01:24:34,130 --> 01:24:34,140
low
 

4673
01:24:34,140 --> 01:24:37,010
low
um with low uh Viewpoint diversity and

4674
01:24:37,010 --> 01:24:37,020
um with low uh Viewpoint diversity and
 

4675
01:24:37,020 --> 01:24:38,270
um with low uh Viewpoint diversity and
actually a lot of the research that I

4676
01:24:38,270 --> 01:24:38,280
actually a lot of the research that I
 

4677
01:24:38,280 --> 01:24:41,750
actually a lot of the research that I
got most interested in was uh done in

4678
01:24:41,750 --> 01:24:41,760
got most interested in was uh done in
 

4679
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:43,970
got most interested in was uh done in
conjunction with the great cast sunstein

4680
01:24:43,970 --> 01:24:43,980
conjunction with the great cast sunstein
 

4681
01:24:43,980 --> 01:24:45,709
conjunction with the great cast sunstein
um who writes a lot about group

4682
01:24:45,709 --> 01:24:45,719
um who writes a lot about group
 

4683
01:24:45,719 --> 01:24:46,910
um who writes a lot about group
polarization

4684
01:24:46,910 --> 01:24:46,920
polarization
 

4685
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:48,830
polarization
um because as and the research on this

4686
01:24:48,830 --> 01:24:48,840
um because as and the research on this
 

4687
01:24:48,840 --> 01:24:50,810
um because as and the research on this
is very strong that essentially when you

4688
01:24:50,810 --> 01:24:50,820
is very strong that essentially when you
 

4689
01:24:50,820 --> 01:24:54,410
is very strong that essentially when you
have groups with um political diversity

4690
01:24:54,410 --> 01:24:54,420
have groups with um political diversity
 

4691
01:24:54,420 --> 01:24:55,910
have groups with um political diversity
and you can see this actually in judges

4692
01:24:55,910 --> 01:24:55,920
and you can see this actually in judges
 

4693
01:24:55,920 --> 01:24:58,130
and you can see this actually in judges
for example it tends to produce you know

4694
01:24:58,130 --> 01:24:58,140
for example it tends to produce you know
 

4695
01:24:58,140 --> 01:25:00,470
for example it tends to produce you know
reliably more moderate you know outcomes

4696
01:25:00,470 --> 01:25:00,480
reliably more moderate you know outcomes
 

4697
01:25:00,480 --> 01:25:03,110
reliably more moderate you know outcomes
whereas groups that are that have low

4698
01:25:03,110 --> 01:25:03,120
whereas groups that are that have low
 

4699
01:25:03,120 --> 01:25:04,669
whereas groups that are that have low
political diversity tend to sort of

4700
01:25:04,669 --> 01:25:04,679
political diversity tend to sort of
 

4701
01:25:04,679 --> 01:25:06,830
political diversity tend to sort of
spiral Spiral off in their own Direction

4702
01:25:06,830 --> 01:25:06,840
spiral Spiral off in their own Direction
 

4703
01:25:06,840 --> 01:25:09,709
spiral Spiral off in their own Direction
and when you have a super majority of

4704
01:25:09,709 --> 01:25:09,719
and when you have a super majority of
 

4705
01:25:09,719 --> 01:25:11,330
and when you have a super majority of
people from just one political

4706
01:25:11,330 --> 01:25:11,340
people from just one political
 

4707
01:25:11,340 --> 01:25:13,130
people from just one political
perspective that's a problem for the

4708
01:25:13,130 --> 01:25:13,140
perspective that's a problem for the
 

4709
01:25:13,140 --> 01:25:14,450
perspective that's a problem for the
production of ideas it creates a

4710
01:25:14,450 --> 01:25:14,460
production of ideas it creates a
 

4711
01:25:14,460 --> 01:25:17,330
production of ideas it creates a

three percent conservatives but when you
look at different departments there are

4724
01:25:27,530 --> 01:25:27,540
look at different departments there are
 

4725
01:25:27,540 --> 01:25:29,930

is definitely worse
 

4735
01:25:38,219 --> 01:25:39,770
is definitely worse
um as you get more Elite uh we

4736

um as you get more Elite uh we
 

4737
01:25:39,780 --> 01:25:42,470

um it's something that I do think is
 

4761
01:26:03,480 --> 01:26:05,870
um it's something that I do think is
underappreciated but when it comes to

4762
01:26:05,870 --> 01:26:05,880
underappreciated but when it comes to
 

4763
01:26:05,880 --> 01:26:07,970
underappreciated but when it comes to
the low Viewpoint diversity it's you

4764
01:26:07,970 --> 01:26:07,980
the low Viewpoint diversity it's you
 

4765
01:26:07,980 --> 01:26:09,649
the low Viewpoint diversity it's you
know it works out kind of like you'd

4766
01:26:09,649 --> 01:26:09,659
know it works out kind of like you'd
 

4767
01:26:09,659 --> 01:26:12,169
know it works out kind of like you'd
expect to a degree you know economics is

01:26:16,669 --> 01:26:16,679
it's not as bad but then when you start
 

4773
01:26:16,679 --> 01:26:18,350
it's not as bad but then when you start
getting into some of the humanities you

4774

height and I remember him being kind of
like I don't don't include the actual

in different ways
um so we put in the numbers and we talk

4902
01:28:34,970 --> 01:28:34,980
um so we put in the numbers and we talk

not they're minority and then we get to
 

4925
01:28:56,159 --> 01:28:58,010
not they're minority and then we get to
I think it's like layer six and we're

arguments is about running out the clock

5040
01:30:58,250 --> 01:30:58,260
arguments is about running out the clock
 

5041
01:30:58,260 --> 01:31:00,229
arguments is about running out the clock
because by the time you get down to the

01:31:00,229 --> 01:31:00,239
because by the time you get down to the
 

5043

bottom of the uh of the or actually even
to get a couple steps into the perfect

5046
01:31:04,729 --> 01:31:04,739
to get a couple steps into the perfect
 

5047
01:31:04,739 --> 01:31:06,890
to get a couple steps into the perfect
rhetorical Fortress and you know where

5048
01:31:06,890 --> 01:31:06,900
rhetorical Fortress and you know where
 

5049
01:31:06,900 --> 01:31:08,709
rhetorical Fortress and you know where
has the time gone you know like it

5050
01:31:08,709 --> 01:31:08,719
has the time gone you know like it
 

5051
01:31:08,719 --> 01:31:12,229
has the time gone you know like it
you're you you probably just give up uh

5052
01:31:12,229 --> 01:31:12,239
you're you you probably just give up uh
 

5053
01:31:12,239 --> 01:31:13,729
you're you you probably just give up uh
trying to uh you know trying to actually

5054
01:31:13,729 --> 01:31:13,739
trying to uh you know trying to actually
 

5055
01:31:13,739 --> 01:31:15,110
trying to uh you know trying to actually
have the argument and you never get to

5056
01:31:15,110 --> 01:31:15,120
have the argument and you never get to
 

5057
01:31:15,120 --> 01:31:16,430
have the argument and you never get to
the argument in the first place and all

5058
01:31:16,430 --> 01:31:16,440
the argument in the first place and all
 

5059
01:31:16,440 --> 01:31:18,830
the argument in the first place and all
of these things are pretty sticky on

5060
01:31:18,830 --> 01:31:18,840
of these things are pretty sticky on
 

5061
01:31:18,840 --> 01:31:20,090
of these things are pretty sticky on
social media social media and

5062
01:31:20,090 --> 01:31:20,100
social media social media and
 

5063
01:31:20,100 --> 01:31:21,229
social media social media and
practically invented the perfect

5064
01:31:21,229 --> 01:31:21,239
practically invented the perfect
 

5065
01:31:21,239 --> 01:31:23,330
practically invented the perfect
rhetorical Fortress so the each one of

5066
01:31:23,330 --> 01:31:23,340
rhetorical Fortress so the each one of
 

5067
01:31:23,340 --> 01:31:25,669
rhetorical Fortress so the each one of
those stages has a virality to it yeah

5068
01:31:25,669 --> 01:31:25,679
those stages has a virality to it yeah
 

5069
01:31:25,679 --> 01:31:28,070
those stages has a virality to it yeah
so it can it could stick and it can get

5070
01:31:28,070 --> 01:31:28,080
so it can it could stick and it can get
 

5071
01:31:28,080 --> 01:31:29,870
so it can it could stick and it can get
people really excited it allows you feel

5072
01:31:29,870 --> 01:31:29,880
people really excited it allows you feel
 

5073
01:31:29,880 --> 01:31:32,450
people really excited it allows you feel
outraged and superiority yeah because of

5074
01:31:32,450 --> 01:31:32,460
outraged and superiority yeah because of
 

5075
01:31:32,460 --> 01:31:34,729
outraged and superiority yeah because of
that that at the scale of the virality

5076
01:31:34,729 --> 01:31:34,739
that that at the scale of the virality
 

5077
01:31:34,739 --> 01:31:36,290
that that at the scale of the virality
allows you to never get to the actual

5078
01:31:36,290 --> 01:31:36,300
allows you to never get to the actual
 

5079
01:31:36,300 --> 01:31:38,149
allows you to never get to the actual
discussion of the point

5080
01:31:38,149 --> 01:31:38,159
discussion of the point
 

5081
01:31:38,159 --> 01:31:39,830
discussion of the point
um so but you know it's not just the

5082
01:31:39,830 --> 01:31:39,840
um so but you know it's not just the
 

5083
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:41,810
um so but you know it's not just the
left it's the right sure also so the

5084
01:31:41,810 --> 01:31:41,820
left it's the right sure also so the
 

5085
01:31:41,820 --> 01:31:43,669
left it's the right sure also so the
efficient rhetorical Fortress

5086
01:31:43,669 --> 01:31:43,679
efficient rhetorical Fortress
 

5087
01:31:43,679 --> 01:31:46,669
efficient rhetorical Fortress
uh so there something to be proud of on

5088

uh so there something to be proud of on
 

5089
01:31:46,679 --> 01:31:49,910
uh so there something to be proud of on
the right it's more efficient yeah uh so

5090
01:31:49,910 --> 01:31:49,920
the right it's more efficient yeah uh so
 

5091
01:31:49,920 --> 01:31:51,830
the right it's more efficient yeah uh so

pro-trump yeah and we call it efficient

5122
01:32:24,110 --> 01:32:24,120
pro-trump yeah and we call it efficient
 

5123
01:32:24,120 --> 01:32:26,870
pro-trump yeah and we call it efficient
because it it eliminates a lot of people

5124
01:32:26,870 --> 01:32:26,880
because it it eliminates a lot of people
 

5125
01:32:26,880 --> 01:32:28,370
because it it eliminates a lot of people
you probably should listen to at least

5126
01:32:28,370 --> 01:32:28,380
you probably should listen to at least
 

5127
01:32:28,380 --> 01:32:30,229
you probably should listen to at least
sometimes you know like we we point out

5128
01:32:30,229 --> 01:32:30,239
sometimes you know like we we point out
 

5129
01:32:30,239 --> 01:32:31,850
sometimes you know like we we point out
sometimes like how cancel culture can

5130
01:32:31,850 --> 01:32:31,860
sometimes like how cancel culture can
 

5131
01:32:31,860 --> 01:32:34,250
sometimes like how cancel culture can
interfere with faith and expertise so we

5132
01:32:34,250 --> 01:32:34,260
interfere with faith and expertise so we
 

5133
01:32:34,260 --> 01:32:36,290
interfere with faith and expertise so we
get kind of being a little suspicious of

5134
01:32:36,290 --> 01:32:36,300
get kind of being a little suspicious of
 

5135
01:32:36,300 --> 01:32:38,689
get kind of being a little suspicious of
experts but at the same time if you

5136
01:32:38,689 --> 01:32:38,699
experts but at the same time if you
 

5137
01:32:38,699 --> 01:32:39,770
experts but at the same time if you
follow that and you follow it

5138
01:32:39,770 --> 01:32:39,780
follow that and you follow it
 

5139
01:32:39,780 --> 01:32:41,689
follow that and you follow it
mechanically and I definitely you know I

5140
01:32:41,689 --> 01:32:41,699
mechanically and I definitely you know I
 

5141
01:32:41,699 --> 01:32:44,149
mechanically and I definitely you know I
think everybody in the US probably has

5142
01:32:44,149 --> 01:32:44,159
think everybody in the US probably has
 

5143
01:32:44,159 --> 01:32:48,290
think everybody in the US probably has
some older Uncle who exercises some of

5144
01:32:48,290 --> 01:32:48,300
some older Uncle who exercises some of
 

5145
01:32:48,300 --> 01:32:51,770
some older Uncle who exercises some of
these it is a really efficient way to

5146
01:32:51,770 --> 01:32:51,780
these it is a really efficient way to
 

5147
01:32:51,780 --> 01:32:53,930
these it is a really efficient way to
sort of saw your uh to wall yourself off

5148
01:32:53,930 --> 01:32:53,940
sort of saw your uh to wall yourself off
 

5149
01:32:53,940 --> 01:32:55,129
sort of saw your uh to wall yourself off
from the rest of the world and dismiss

5150
01:32:55,129 --> 01:32:55,139
from the rest of the world and dismiss
 

5151
01:32:55,139 --> 01:32:56,930
from the rest of the world and dismiss
you know at least some people you really

5152
01:32:56,930 --> 01:32:56,940
you know at least some people you really
 

5153
01:32:56,940 --> 01:32:59,030
you know at least some people you really
should be listening to the way you laid

5154
01:32:59,030 --> 01:32:59,040
should be listening to the way you laid
 

5155
01:32:59,040 --> 01:33:01,310
should be listening to the way you laid
it out it made me realize that we just

5156
01:33:01,310 --> 01:33:01,320
it out it made me realize that we just
 

5157
01:33:01,320 --> 01:33:04,030
it out it made me realize that we just
take up so much of our brain power

5158
01:33:04,030 --> 01:33:04,040
take up so much of our brain power
 

5159
01:33:04,040 --> 01:33:06,530
take up so much of our brain power
these things it's literally time we

5160
01:33:06,530 --> 01:33:06,540
these things it's literally time we
 

5161
01:33:06,540 --> 01:33:08,390
these things it's literally time we
could be solving things and you get like

5162
01:33:08,390 --> 01:33:08,400
could be solving things and you get like
 

5163
01:33:08,400 --> 01:33:10,490
could be solving things and you get like
you kind of exhaust yourself through

5164
01:33:10,490 --> 01:33:10,500
you kind of exhaust yourself through
 

5165
01:33:10,500 --> 01:33:13,129
you kind of exhaust yourself through
this process of being outraged based on

5166
01:33:13,129 --> 01:33:13,139
this process of being outraged based on
 

5167
01:33:13,139 --> 01:33:14,330
this process of being outraged based on
these labels and you never get to

5168
01:33:14,330 --> 01:33:14,340
these labels and you never get to
 

5169
01:33:14,340 --> 01:33:15,410
these labels and you never get to
actually

5170
01:33:15,410 --> 01:33:15,420
actually
 

5171
01:33:15,420 --> 01:33:17,030
actually
there's almost not enough time for

5172
01:33:17,030 --> 01:33:17,040
there's almost not enough time for
 

5173
01:33:17,040 --> 01:33:18,830
there's almost not enough time for
empathy for like looking at a person

5174
01:33:18,830 --> 01:33:18,840
empathy for like looking at a person
 

5175
01:33:18,840 --> 01:33:20,270
empathy for like looking at a person
thinking well maybe they're right

5176
01:33:20,270 --> 01:33:20,280
thinking well maybe they're right
 

5177
01:33:20,280 --> 01:33:22,030
thinking well maybe they're right
because you're so busy

5178
01:33:22,030 --> 01:33:22,040
because you're so busy
 

5179
01:33:22,040 --> 01:33:24,590
because you're so busy
categorizing them and it's what's the

5180
01:33:24,590 --> 01:33:24,600
categorizing them and it's what's the
 

5181
01:33:24,600 --> 01:33:26,390
categorizing them and it's what's the
fun and empathy and I mean what's so

5182
01:33:26,390 --> 01:33:26,400
fun and empathy and I mean what's so
 

5183
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:28,310
fun and empathy and I mean what's so
interesting about this is that

5184
01:33:28,310 --> 01:33:28,320
interesting about this is that
 

5185
01:33:28,320 --> 01:33:29,810
interesting about this is that
so much

5186
01:33:29,810 --> 01:33:29,820
so much
 

5187
01:33:29,820 --> 01:33:32,270
so much
um societal energy seems to be spent on

5188
01:33:32,270 --> 01:33:32,280
um societal energy seems to be spent on
 

5189
01:33:32,280 --> 01:33:35,330
um societal energy seems to be spent on
these nasty Primal desires where

5190
01:33:35,330 --> 01:33:35,340
these nasty Primal desires where
 

5191
01:33:35,340 --> 01:33:37,070
these nasty Primal desires where
essentially a lot of it's like please

5192
01:33:37,070 --> 01:33:37,080
essentially a lot of it's like please
 

5193
01:33:37,080 --> 01:33:38,830
essentially a lot of it's like please
tell me who I'm allowed to hate

5194
01:33:38,830 --> 01:33:38,840
tell me who I'm allowed to hate
 

5195
01:33:38,840 --> 01:33:41,870
tell me who I'm allowed to hate
where can I legitimately be cruel where

5196
01:33:41,870 --> 01:33:41,880
where can I legitimately be cruel where
 

5197
01:33:41,880 --> 01:33:43,970
where can I legitimately be cruel where
can I actually exercise some aggression

5198
01:33:43,970 --> 01:33:43,980
can I actually exercise some aggression
 

5199
01:33:43,980 --> 01:33:45,709
can I actually exercise some aggression
against somebody

5200
01:33:45,709 --> 01:33:45,719
against somebody
 

5201
01:33:45,719 --> 01:33:47,570
against somebody
um and it seems to sometimes be just

5202
01:33:47,570 --> 01:33:47,580
um and it seems to sometimes be just
 

5203
01:33:47,580 --> 01:33:50,510
um and it seems to sometimes be just
finding new justifications for that and

5204
01:33:50,510 --> 01:33:50,520
finding new justifications for that and
 

5205
01:33:50,520 --> 01:33:52,189
finding new justifications for that and
it's an understandable you know human

5206
01:33:52,189 --> 01:33:52,199
it's an understandable you know human
 

5207
01:33:52,199 --> 01:33:54,110
it's an understandable you know human
failing

5208
01:33:54,110 --> 01:33:54,120
failing
 

5209
01:33:54,120 --> 01:33:56,390
failing
um that sometimes can be used to defend

5210
01:33:56,390 --> 01:33:56,400
um that sometimes can be used to defend
 

5211
01:33:56,400 --> 01:33:58,610
um that sometimes can be used to defend
justice but again it will never get you

5212
01:33:58,610 --> 01:33:58,620
justice but again it will never get you
 

5213
01:33:58,620 --> 01:34:00,350
justice but again it will never get you
anywhere near the truth

5214
01:34:00,350 --> 01:34:00,360
anywhere near the truth
 

5215
01:34:00,360 --> 01:34:02,629
anywhere near the truth
uh one interesting case that you cover

5216
01:34:02,629 --> 01:34:02,639
uh one interesting case that you cover
 

5217
01:34:02,639 --> 01:34:06,290
uh one interesting case that you cover
about expertises with covid yeah so how

5218
01:34:06,290 --> 01:34:06,300
about expertises with covid yeah so how
 

5219
01:34:06,300 --> 01:34:08,510
about expertises with covid yeah so how
did cancer culture come into play on the

5220
01:34:08,510 --> 01:34:08,520
did cancer culture come into play on the
 

5221
01:34:08,520 --> 01:34:11,990
did cancer culture come into play on the
topic of covid yeah I think that covid

5222
01:34:11,990 --> 01:34:12,000
topic of covid yeah I think that covid
 

5223
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,689
topic of covid yeah I think that covid
was a big blow to people's faith and

5224
01:34:14,689 --> 01:34:14,699
was a big blow to people's faith and
 

5225
01:34:14,699 --> 01:34:16,790
was a big blow to people's faith and
expertise and cancel culture played a

5226
01:34:16,790 --> 01:34:16,800
expertise and cancel culture played a
 

5227
01:34:16,800 --> 01:34:18,350
expertise and cancel culture played a
big role in that

5228
01:34:18,350 --> 01:34:18,360
big role in that
 

5229
01:34:18,360 --> 01:34:19,790
big role in that
um I think one of the best examples of

5230
01:34:19,790 --> 01:34:19,800
um I think one of the best examples of
 

5231
01:34:19,800 --> 01:34:22,490
um I think one of the best examples of
this is Jennifer say at Levi's

01:34:30,050 --> 01:34:30,060
actually potentially could be the
 

5239
01:34:30,060 --> 01:34:31,910
actually potentially could be the
president of Levi's jeans

5240
01:34:31,910 --> 01:34:31,920
president of Levi's jeans
 

5241

the poor and disadvantaged kids the most

5250
01:34:47,209 --> 01:34:47,219
the poor and disadvantaged kids the most
 

5251

the schools back up and that was such a
 

5255
01:34:52,020 --> 01:34:54,470
the schools back up and that was such a
heretical point of view and the typical

5256
01:34:54,470 --> 01:34:54,480
heretical point of view and the typical
 

5257
01:34:54,480 --> 01:34:57,050
heretical point of view and the typical
kind of cancel culture uh wave took over

5258
01:34:57,050 --> 01:34:57,060
kind of cancel culture uh wave took over
 

5259
01:34:57,060 --> 01:34:58,430
kind of cancel culture uh wave took over

and you know she was offered I think
like in a million dollar Severance which

5270
01:35:07,250 --> 01:35:07,260
like in a million dollar Severance which
 

5271
01:35:07,260 --> 01:35:08,750
like in a million dollar Severance which
you wouldn't take because she wanted to

tell the world what she thought about
this and and that she wanted to continue

5276
01:35:12,410 --> 01:35:12,420
this and and that she wanted to continue
 

5277
01:35:12,420 --> 01:35:14,450
this and and that she wanted to continue
saying

5278
01:35:14,450 --> 01:35:14,460
saying
 

5279
01:35:14,460 --> 01:35:16,250
saying
um that she hadn't changed her mind that

5280
01:35:16,250 --> 01:35:16,260
um that she hadn't changed her mind that
 

5281
01:35:16,260 --> 01:35:18,709
um that she hadn't changed her mind that
this was a disaster for young people and

5282
01:35:18,709 --> 01:35:18,719
this was a disaster for young people and
 

5283
01:35:18,719 --> 01:35:20,990
this was a disaster for young people and
now that's kind of the conventional

5284
01:35:20,990 --> 01:35:21,000
now that's kind of the conventional
 

5285
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,450
now that's kind of the conventional
wisdom and the research is pretty it is

5286
01:35:23,450 --> 01:35:23,460
wisdom and the research is pretty it is
 

5287
01:35:23,460 --> 01:35:26,570
wisdom and the research is pretty it is
quite clear that this was devastating to

5288
01:35:26,570 --> 01:35:26,580
quite clear that this was devastating to
 

5289
01:35:26,580 --> 01:35:28,729
quite clear that this was devastating to
to particularly disadvantaged youth like

5290
01:35:28,729 --> 01:35:28,739
to particularly disadvantaged youth like
 

5291
01:35:28,739 --> 01:35:30,890
to particularly disadvantaged youth like
people understand this now as being okay

5292
01:35:30,890 --> 01:35:30,900
people understand this now as being okay
 

5293
01:35:30,900 --> 01:35:32,930
people understand this now as being okay
and she was probably right but one of

5294
01:35:32,930 --> 01:35:32,940
and she was probably right but one of
 

5295
01:35:32,940 --> 01:35:34,550
and she was probably right but one of
the one of the really sad aspects of

5296
01:35:34,550 --> 01:35:34,560
the one of the really sad aspects of
 

5297
01:35:34,560 --> 01:35:37,550
the one of the really sad aspects of
cancel culture is people forget why you

5298
01:35:37,550 --> 01:35:37,560
cancel culture is people forget why you
 

5299
01:35:37,560 --> 01:35:39,709
cancel culture is people forget why you
were canceled and they just know they

5300
01:35:39,709 --> 01:35:39,719
were canceled and they just know they
 

5301
01:35:39,719 --> 01:35:41,030
were canceled and they just know they
hate you

5302
01:35:41,030 --> 01:35:41,040
hate you
 

5303
01:35:41,040 --> 01:35:42,590
hate you

01:35:42,590 --> 01:35:42,600
um there's this lingering kind of like
 

5305
01:35:42,600 --> 01:35:43,970
um there's this lingering kind of like
well I don't have to take them seriously

5306
01:35:43,970 --> 01:35:43,980
well I don't have to take them seriously
 

5307
01:35:43,980 --> 01:35:45,410
well I don't have to take them seriously
anymore but by the way did you notice

5308
01:35:45,410 --> 01:35:45,420
anymore but by the way did you notice
 

5309
01:35:45,420 --> 01:35:46,970
anymore but by the way did you notice
they happen to be right on something

5310
01:35:46,970 --> 01:35:46,980
they happen to be right on something
 

5311
01:35:46,980 --> 01:35:49,729
they happen to be right on something
very important now one funny thing about

5312
01:35:49,729 --> 01:35:49,739
very important now one funny thing about
 

5313
01:35:49,739 --> 01:35:51,050
very important now one funny thing about
freedom of speech

5314
01:35:51,050 --> 01:35:51,060
freedom of speech
 

5315
01:35:51,060 --> 01:35:52,850
freedom of speech
freedom of speech wouldn't exist if you

5316
01:35:52,850 --> 01:35:52,860
freedom of speech wouldn't exist if you
 

5317
01:35:52,860 --> 01:35:54,830
freedom of speech wouldn't exist if you
didn't also have the the right to say

5318
01:35:54,830 --> 01:35:54,840
didn't also have the the right to say
 

5319
01:35:54,840 --> 01:35:56,629
didn't also have the the right to say
things that were wrong because if you

5320
01:35:56,629 --> 01:35:56,639
things that were wrong because if you
 

5321
01:35:56,639 --> 01:35:59,390
things that were wrong because if you
can't you know engage an idea for you if

5322
01:35:59,390 --> 01:35:59,400
can't you know engage an idea for you if
 

5323
01:35:59,400 --> 01:36:01,370
can't you know engage an idea for you if
you can't actually speculate you'll

5324
01:36:01,370 --> 01:36:01,380
you can't actually speculate you'll
 

5325
01:36:01,380 --> 01:36:02,570
you can't actually speculate you'll
never actually get to something that's

5326
01:36:02,570 --> 01:36:02,580
never actually get to something that's
 

5327
01:36:02,580 --> 01:36:04,430
never actually get to something that's
right in the first place but it's

5328
01:36:04,430 --> 01:36:04,440
right in the first place but it's
 

5329
01:36:04,440 --> 01:36:06,649
right in the first place but it's
especially galling when people who are

5330
01:36:06,649 --> 01:36:06,659
especially galling when people who are
 

5331
01:36:06,659 --> 01:36:10,490
especially galling when people who are
right were censored and you uh and never

5332
01:36:10,490 --> 01:36:10,500
right were censored and you uh and never
 

5333
01:36:10,500 --> 01:36:11,510
right were censored and you uh and never
actually get the credit that they

5334
01:36:11,510 --> 01:36:11,520
actually get the credit that they
 

5335
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:13,129
actually get the credit that they
deserve

5336
01:36:13,129 --> 01:36:13,139
deserve
 

5337
01:36:13,139 --> 01:36:15,410

be really really bad it can actually
 

5587
01:40:39,120 --> 01:40:40,790
be really really bad it can actually
make all these things worse and one

5588
01:40:40,790 --> 01:40:40,800
make all these things worse and one
 

5589
01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:42,770
make all these things worse and one
which we talk about in the book one very

5590
01:40:42,770 --> 01:40:42,780
which we talk about in the book one very
 

5591
01:40:42,780 --> 01:40:44,930
which we talk about in the book one very
real practical way it makes things worse

5592
01:40:44,930 --> 01:40:44,940
real practical way it makes things worse
 

5593
01:40:44,940 --> 01:40:47,810
real practical way it makes things worse
is when you censor people it doesn't

them to not share it with people who
 

5599
01:40:52,440 --> 01:40:54,530
them to not share it with people who
will get them in trouble so it leads

5600
01:40:54,530 --> 01:40:54,540
will get them in trouble so it leads
 

5601
01:40:54,540 --> 01:40:55,970

01:41:01,250 --> 01:41:01,260
off so we have some interesting data in
 

5607
01:41:01,260 --> 01:41:02,030
off so we have some interesting data in

um you know in 2017 and then again I
 

5615
01:41:09,420 --> 01:41:12,410
um you know in 2017 and then again I
think in 2020 driving people to gab led

think in 2020 driving people to gab led
 

5617
01:41:12,420 --> 01:41:14,990
think in 2020 driving people to gab led
to you know greater radicalization among

5618
01:41:14,990 --> 01:41:15,000
to you know greater radicalization among
 

5619
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:16,910
to you know greater radicalization among
those people it's a very predictable

5620
01:41:16,910 --> 01:41:16,920
those people it's a very predictable

01:41:20,940 --> 01:41:22,370
people's minds and it pushes them in
directions that actually

5626
01:41:22,370 --> 01:41:22,380
directions that actually
 

5627
01:41:22,380 --> 01:41:25,070
directions that actually
by very you know solid research will

5628
01:41:25,070 --> 01:41:25,080
by very you know solid research will
 

5629
01:41:25,080 --> 01:41:27,050
by very you know solid research will
actually make them more radicalized so

5630
01:41:27,050 --> 01:41:27,060
actually make them more radicalized so
 

5631
01:41:27,060 --> 01:41:29,450
actually make them more radicalized so
yeah I think that the I think that the

5647
01:41:43,860 --> 01:41:46,910
is there a ways to sort of to look at
extreme cases to test this idea out a

5648
01:41:46,910 --> 01:41:46,920
extreme cases to test this idea out a
 

5649
01:41:46,920 --> 01:41:48,729
extreme cases to test this idea out a
little bit so if you look on campus yeah

5650
01:41:48,729 --> 01:41:48,739
little bit so if you look on campus yeah
 

5651

own safety it's probably more important
 

5719
01:43:05,880 --> 01:43:07,070

5721
01:43:07,080 --> 01:43:08,689

Society actually think I personally I

5722
01:43:08,689 --> 01:43:08,699
Society actually think I personally I
 

5723
01:43:08,699 --> 01:43:09,410
Society actually think I personally I
don't know

5724
01:43:09,410 --> 01:43:09,420
don't know
 

5725
01:43:09,420 --> 01:43:11,149
don't know
what you think about that but I

5726
01:43:11,149 --> 01:43:11,159
what you think about that but I
 

5727
01:43:11,159 --> 01:43:12,649
what you think about that but I
personally think that freedom of speech

5728
01:43:12,649 --> 01:43:12,659
personally think that freedom of speech
 

5729
01:43:12,659 --> 01:43:14,629
personally think that freedom of speech
in cases like that like KKK and campus

5730
01:43:14,629 --> 01:43:14,639
in cases like that like KKK and campus
 

5731
01:43:14,639 --> 01:43:18,250
in cases like that like KKK and campus
can do more harm in the short term

5732
01:43:18,250 --> 01:43:18,260
can do more harm in the short term
 

5733
01:43:18,260 --> 01:43:21,229
can do more harm in the short term
but much more benefit in the long term

5734
01:43:21,229 --> 01:43:21,239
but much more benefit in the long term
 

5735
01:43:21,239 --> 01:43:23,990
but much more benefit in the long term
because you can sometimes argue for like

5736
01:43:23,990 --> 01:43:24,000
because you can sometimes argue for like
 

5737
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,390
because you can sometimes argue for like
this is going to hurt yeah in the short

5738
01:43:26,390 --> 01:43:26,400
this is going to hurt yeah in the short
 

5739
01:43:26,400 --> 01:43:29,510
this is going to hurt yeah in the short
term but I mean Harvey said this is like

5740
01:43:29,510 --> 01:43:29,520
term but I mean Harvey said this is like
 

5741
01:43:29,520 --> 01:43:31,669
term but I mean Harvey said this is like
consider the alternative yeah because

5742
01:43:31,669 --> 01:43:31,679
consider the alternative yeah because
 

5743
01:43:31,679 --> 01:43:33,530
consider the alternative yeah because
you've just kind of made the case for

5744
01:43:33,530 --> 01:43:33,540
you've just kind of made the case for
 

5745
01:43:33,540 --> 01:43:35,510
you've just kind of made the case for
like this potentially would be a good

5746
01:43:35,510 --> 01:43:35,520
like this potentially would be a good
 

5747
01:43:35,520 --> 01:43:37,550
like this potentially would be a good
thing even in the short term and it

5748
01:43:37,550 --> 01:43:37,560
thing even in the short term and it
 

5749
01:43:37,560 --> 01:43:39,770
thing even in the short term and it
often is I think especially in a stable

5750
01:43:39,770 --> 01:43:39,780
often is I think especially in a stable
 

5751
01:43:39,780 --> 01:43:42,470
often is I think especially in a stable
Society like ours uh with a strong

5761
01:43:50,400 --> 01:43:52,370
um but you know to me it's like even if
it hurts in the short term even if it

5762
01:43:52,370 --> 01:43:52,380
it hurts in the short term even if it
 

5763
01:43:52,380 --> 01:43:53,810
it hurts in the short term even if it
does create more hate in the short term

5764
01:43:53,810 --> 01:43:53,820
does create more hate in the short term

printing press come uh came out to be a
 

6661
02:00:19,199 --> 02:00:21,589
printing press come uh came out to be a
non-disruptive non-crazy period other

adding I think you know several million
 

6675
02:00:35,820 --> 02:00:37,550
adding I think you know several million
people to the European conversation and

people to the European conversation and
 

6677
02:00:37,560 --> 02:00:38,810
people to the European conversation and
then eventually the global conversation

6678
02:00:38,810 --> 02:00:38,820
then eventually the global conversation
 

6679
02:00:38,820 --> 02:00:42,109
then eventually the global conversation
but eventually it became the best tool

6680
02:00:42,109 --> 02:00:42,119
but eventually it became the best tool
 

6681
02:00:42,119 --> 02:00:44,330
but eventually it became the best tool
for discomformation

6682
02:00:44,330 --> 02:00:44,340
for discomformation
 

6683
02:00:44,340 --> 02:00:46,129
for discomformation
um for getting rid of falsity for

spotting bad ideas and it's the benefits
 

6687
02:00:49,980 --> 02:00:52,669
spotting bad ideas and it's the benefits
the long-term benefits of the printing

6688
02:00:52,669 --> 02:00:52,679
the long-term benefits of the printing
 

6689
02:00:52,679 --> 02:00:56,209
the long-term benefits of the printing
press are incalculally great

press are incalculally great
um and that's what gives me some

6692
02:00:57,649 --> 02:00:57,659
um and that's what gives me some
 

6693
02:00:57,659 --> 02:00:59,510
um and that's what gives me some
optimism for where we are now with

6694
02:00:59,510 --> 02:00:59,520
optimism for where we are now with
 

6695
02:00:59,520 --> 02:01:01,129
optimism for where we are now with
social media because we are in that

social media because we are in that
 

6697
02:01:01,139 --> 02:01:03,169
social media because we are in that
unavoidably anarchical period And I do

unavoidably anarchical period And I do
 

6699
02:01:03,179 --> 02:01:06,109

to be able to fix it we have to

6718
02:01:26,510 --> 02:01:26,520
to be able to fix it we have to
 

6719
02:01:26,520 --> 02:01:30,189
to be able to fix it we have to
culturally adapt to the fact of it

6720
02:01:30,189 --> 02:01:30,199
culturally adapt to the fact of it
 

6721
02:01:30,199 --> 02:01:34,010
culturally adapt to the fact of it
in ways that make us wiser that actually

in ways that make us wiser that actually
 

6723
02:01:34,020 --> 02:01:37,430
in ways that make us wiser that actually
um and allow it potentially to be that

02:01:44,450 --> 02:01:44,460
but think about it additional millions
 

6731
02:01:44,460 --> 02:01:47,149
but think about it additional millions
of eyes on problems um thanks to the

6732
02:01:47,149 --> 02:01:47,159
of eyes on problems um thanks to the
 

6733
02:01:47,159 --> 02:01:48,830
of eyes on problems um thanks to the
printing press helped create the

6734
02:01:48,830 --> 02:01:48,840
printing press helped create the
 

6735
02:01:48,840 --> 02:01:50,570

02:04:59,810 --> 02:04:59,820
absolutely I I think it's possible to
 

6899
02:04:59,820 --> 02:05:02,270
absolutely I I think it's possible to
create social media that makes a huge

Rich Human Experience I think it's just
 

6925
02:05:31,020 --> 02:05:33,470
Rich Human Experience I think it's just
a machine learning problem it's like

6926
02:05:33,470 --> 02:05:33,480
a machine learning problem it's like
 

6927
02:05:33,480 --> 02:05:36,649
a machine learning problem it's like
it's not easy to create a feed so the

6928
02:05:36,649 --> 02:05:36,659
it's not easy to create a feed so the
 

6929
02:05:36,659 --> 02:05:38,209
it's not easy to create a feed so the
easiest feed you could do is like

6930
02:05:38,209 --> 02:05:38,219
easiest feed you could do is like
 

6931
02:05:38,219 --> 02:05:40,189
easiest feed you could do is like
maximize engagement yeah but that's just

6932
02:05:40,189 --> 02:05:40,199
maximize engagement yeah but that's just
 

6933
02:05:40,199 --> 02:05:42,830
maximize engagement yeah but that's just
like a really dumb algorithm yeah it's

6934
02:05:42,830 --> 02:05:42,840
like a really dumb algorithm yeah it's
 

6935
02:05:42,840 --> 02:05:45,770
like a really dumb algorithm yeah it's
like for the for the algorithm to learn

6936
02:05:45,770 --> 02:05:45,780
like for the for the algorithm to learn
 

6937
02:05:45,780 --> 02:05:49,430
like for the for the algorithm to learn
enough about you to understand what will

6938
02:05:49,430 --> 02:05:49,440
enough about you to understand what will
 

6939
02:05:49,440 --> 02:05:51,589
enough about you to understand what will
make you truly happy as a human being to

6940
02:05:51,589 --> 02:05:51,599
make you truly happy as a human being to
 

6941
02:05:51,599 --> 02:05:53,689
make you truly happy as a human being to
grow long term that's just a very

6942
02:05:53,689 --> 02:05:53,699
grow long term that's just a very
 

6943
02:05:53,699 --> 02:05:55,970
grow long term that's just a very
difficult problem to solve you ever

6944
02:05:55,970 --> 02:05:55,980
difficult problem to solve you ever
 

6945
02:05:55,980 --> 02:05:58,609

experts out there I know there's
 

6983
02:06:35,940 --> 02:06:37,550
experts out there I know there's
knowledge out there I know there's an

6984

knowledge out there I know there's an
 

6985
02:06:37,560 --> 02:06:40,370
knowledge out there I know there's an
optimal way to live my life so why can't

6986
02:06:40,370 --> 02:06:40,380
optimal way to live my life so why can't
 

6987
02:06:40,380 --> 02:06:42,709
optimal way to live my life so why can't
someone just tell me what to do and and

6988
02:06:42,709 --> 02:06:42,719
someone just tell me what to do and and
 

6989
02:06:42,719 --> 02:06:46,550
someone just tell me what to do and and
it's this wonderfully like

6990
02:06:46,550 --> 02:06:46,560
it's this wonderfully like
 

6991
02:06:46,560 --> 02:06:47,390
it's this wonderfully like
um

6992
02:06:47,390 --> 02:06:47,400
um
 

6993
02:06:47,400 --> 02:06:50,330
um
accurate I think uh aspect of human

6994
02:06:50,330 --> 02:06:50,340
accurate I think uh aspect of human
 

6995
02:06:50,340 --> 02:06:52,189
accurate I think uh aspect of human
desire that what if something could

6996
02:06:52,189 --> 02:06:52,199
desire that what if something could
 

6997
02:06:52,199 --> 02:06:54,589
desire that what if something could
actually tell me the optimal way to go

6998
02:06:54,589 --> 02:06:54,599
actually tell me the optimal way to go
 

6999
02:06:54,599 --> 02:06:57,050
actually tell me the optimal way to go
because I think there is a desire to

7000
02:06:57,050 --> 02:06:57,060
because I think there is a desire to
 

7001
02:06:57,060 --> 02:06:59,510
because I think there is a desire to
give up some amount of your own freedom

7002
02:06:59,510 --> 02:06:59,520
give up some amount of your own freedom
 

7003
02:06:59,520 --> 02:07:02,689
give up some amount of your own freedom
and discretion in order to be told to do

7004
02:07:02,689 --> 02:07:02,699
and discretion in order to be told to do
 

7005
02:07:02,699 --> 02:07:05,470
and discretion in order to be told to do
the optimally right thing but that path

7006
02:07:05,470 --> 02:07:05,480
the optimally right thing but that path
 

7007
02:07:05,480 --> 02:07:08,390
the optimally right thing but that path
scares me to death yeah we see the way

7008
02:07:08,390 --> 02:07:08,400
scares me to death yeah we see the way
 

7009
02:07:08,400 --> 02:07:10,490
scares me to death yeah we see the way
you phrase it that's it miscares me too

7010
02:07:10,490 --> 02:07:10,500
you phrase it that's it miscares me too
 

7011
02:07:10,500 --> 02:07:12,830
you phrase it that's it miscares me too
so there's several things one you could

7012
02:07:12,830 --> 02:07:12,840
so there's several things one you could
 

7013
02:07:12,840 --> 02:07:15,050
so there's several things one you could
be constantly distracted in a tick tock

7014
02:07:15,050 --> 02:07:15,060
be constantly distracted in a tick tock
 

7015
02:07:15,060 --> 02:07:17,750
be constantly distracted in a tick tock
Way by things that keep you engaged yeah

7016
02:07:17,750 --> 02:07:17,760
Way by things that keep you engaged yeah
 

7017
02:07:17,760 --> 02:07:21,050
Way by things that keep you engaged yeah
so removing that and giving you a bunch

7018
02:07:21,050 --> 02:07:21,060
so removing that and giving you a bunch
 

7019
02:07:21,060 --> 02:07:24,649
so removing that and giving you a bunch
of options constantly and learning from

7020
02:07:24,649 --> 02:07:24,659
of options constantly and learning from
 

7021
02:07:24,659 --> 02:07:28,189
of options constantly and learning from
long term what results in your actual

7022

long term what results in your actual
 

7023
02:07:28,199 --> 02:07:30,770
long term what results in your actual
long-term happiness so like which

long-term happiness so like which
 

7025
02:07:30,780 --> 02:07:33,649
long-term happiness so like which
amounts of challenging ideas are good

7026
02:07:33,649 --> 02:07:33,659
amounts of challenging ideas are good
 

7027
02:07:33,659 --> 02:07:36,470
amounts of challenging ideas are good
for you uh that you know for somebody

7028
02:07:36,470 --> 02:07:36,480
for you uh that you know for somebody

higher integrity and it can create

7208
02:10:48,709 --> 02:10:48,719
higher integrity and it can create
 

7209
02:10:48,719 --> 02:10:51,410
higher integrity and it can create
Integrity as a value to strive for yeah

7210
02:10:51,410 --> 02:10:51,420
Integrity as a value to strive for yeah
 

7211
02:10:51,420 --> 02:10:53,570
Integrity as a value to strive for yeah
and like you know there's been projects

7212
02:10:53,570 --> 02:10:53,580
and like you know there's been projects
 

7213
02:10:53,580 --> 02:10:56,570
and like you know there's been projects
throughout the internet that have done

7214
02:10:56,570 --> 02:10:56,580
throughout the internet that have done
 

7215
02:10:56,580 --> 02:10:58,250
throughout the internet that have done
an incredible job of that but have been

7216
02:10:58,250 --> 02:10:58,260
an incredible job of that but have been
 

7217
02:10:58,260 --> 02:11:00,530
an incredible job of that but have been
also very flawed like Wikipedia is an

7218
02:11:00,530 --> 02:11:00,540
also very flawed like Wikipedia is an
 

7219
02:11:00,540 --> 02:11:03,530
also very flawed like Wikipedia is an
example of a big leap forward in doing

7220
02:11:03,530 --> 02:11:03,540
example of a big leap forward in doing
 

7221
02:11:03,540 --> 02:11:05,330
example of a big leap forward in doing
that it's pretty damn impressive what's

7222
02:11:05,330 --> 02:11:05,340
that it's pretty damn impressive what's
 

7223
02:11:05,340 --> 02:11:07,370
that it's pretty damn impressive what's
your overall take I mean I I'm mostly

7224
02:11:07,370 --> 02:11:07,380
your overall take I mean I I'm mostly
 

7225
02:11:07,380 --> 02:11:09,830
your overall take I mean I I'm mostly
impressed so there's a few really

7226
02:11:09,830 --> 02:11:09,840
impressed so there's a few really
 

7227
02:11:09,840 --> 02:11:12,890
impressed so there's a few really
powerful ideas for the people who edit

7228
02:11:12,890 --> 02:11:12,900
powerful ideas for the people who edit
 

7229
02:11:12,900 --> 02:11:16,070
powerful ideas for the people who edit
Wikipedia one of which is each editor

7230
02:11:16,070 --> 02:11:16,080
Wikipedia one of which is each editor
 

7231
02:11:16,080 --> 02:11:18,770
Wikipedia one of which is each editor
kind of for themselves declares

7232
02:11:18,770 --> 02:11:18,780
kind of for themselves declares
 

7233
02:11:18,780 --> 02:11:22,370
kind of for themselves declares
you know I'm into politics and I really

7234
02:11:22,370 --> 02:11:22,380
you know I'm into politics and I really
 

7235
02:11:22,380 --> 02:11:25,430
you know I'm into politics and I really
kind of a left-leaning guy so I really

7236
02:11:25,430 --> 02:11:25,440
kind of a left-leaning guy so I really
 

7237
02:11:25,440 --> 02:11:28,070
kind of a left-leaning guy so I really
shouldn't be editing political articles

7238
02:11:28,070 --> 02:11:28,080
shouldn't be editing political articles
 

7239
02:11:28,080 --> 02:11:30,109
shouldn't be editing political articles
because I have bias so they're great

7240
02:11:30,109 --> 02:11:30,119
because I have bias so they're great
 

7241
02:11:30,119 --> 02:11:31,970
because I have bias so they're great
they declare their biases and they often

7242
02:11:31,970 --> 02:11:31,980
they declare their biases and they often
 

7243
02:11:31,980 --> 02:11:33,649
they declare their biases and they often
do a good job of actually declaring the

7244
02:11:33,649 --> 02:11:33,659
do a good job of actually declaring the
 

7245
02:11:33,659 --> 02:11:37,430
do a good job of actually declaring the
biases but there will still like they'll

7246
02:11:37,430 --> 02:11:37,440
biases but there will still like they'll
 

7247
02:11:37,440 --> 02:11:39,410
biases but there will still like they'll
find a way to justify themselves like

7248
02:11:39,410 --> 02:11:39,420
find a way to justify themselves like
 

7249
02:11:39,420 --> 02:11:41,270
find a way to justify themselves like
something will piss them off yeah and

7250
02:11:41,270 --> 02:11:41,280
something will piss them off yeah and
 

7251
02:11:41,280 --> 02:11:43,129
something will piss them off yeah and
they want to correct it because they

7252
02:11:43,129 --> 02:11:43,139
they want to correct it because they
 

7253
02:11:43,139 --> 02:11:46,310
they want to correct it because they
they love correcting untruth into truth

7254
02:11:46,310 --> 02:11:46,320
they love correcting untruth into truth
 

7255
02:11:46,320 --> 02:11:48,470
they love correcting untruth into truth
but the perspective of what is true or

7256
02:11:48,470 --> 02:11:48,480
but the perspective of what is true or
 

7257
02:11:48,480 --> 02:11:50,689
but the perspective of what is true or
not is affected by their bias Ruth is

7258
02:11:50,689 --> 02:11:50,699
not is affected by their bias Ruth is
 

7259
02:11:50,699 --> 02:11:53,870
not is affected by their bias Ruth is
hard to know and I and and it is true

7260
02:11:53,870 --> 02:11:53,880
hard to know and I and and it is true
 

7261
02:11:53,880 --> 02:11:55,790
hard to know and I and and it is true
that there is a left-leaning bias on the

7262
02:11:55,790 --> 02:11:55,800
that there is a left-leaning bias on the
 

7263
02:11:55,800 --> 02:11:59,270
that there is a left-leaning bias on the
editors of Wikipedia so for that what

7264
02:11:59,270 --> 02:11:59,280
editors of Wikipedia so for that what
 

7265
02:11:59,280 --> 02:12:01,790
editors of Wikipedia so for that what
happens is on articles which I mostly

7266
02:12:01,790 --> 02:12:01,800
happens is on articles which I mostly
 

7267
02:12:01,800 --> 02:12:04,510
happens is on articles which I mostly
appreciate that don't have a political

7268
02:12:04,510 --> 02:12:04,520
appreciate that don't have a political
 

7269
02:12:04,520 --> 02:12:07,669
appreciate that don't have a political
aspect to them you know

um scientific articles or uh technical
 

7273
02:12:10,739 --> 02:12:13,370
um scientific articles or uh technical
articles they can be really strong even

7274
02:12:13,370 --> 02:12:13,380
articles they can be really strong even
 

7275
02:12:13,380 --> 02:12:15,290
articles they can be really strong even
history just describing the facts of

7276

7283
02:12:24,239 --> 02:12:25,430

02:12:25,440 --> 02:12:27,410
uh you know if it's something about
January 6th or something like this I

7286
02:12:27,410 --> 02:12:27,420
January 6th or something like this I
 

7287
02:12:27,420 --> 02:12:29,089
January 6th or something like this I
know I'm going to be like I'm not

7288
02:12:29,089 --> 02:12:29,099
know I'm going to be like I'm not
 

7289

whatever's going on here I'm gonna kinda
 

7291
02:12:31,679 --> 02:12:33,950
whatever's going on here I'm gonna kinda
read it but most I'm gonna look to other

7292
02:12:33,950 --> 02:12:33,960
read it but most I'm gonna look to other
 

7293
02:12:33,960 --> 02:12:35,450
read it but most I'm gonna look to other
source I'm going to look to a bunch of

7294
02:12:35,450 --> 02:12:35,460
source I'm going to look to a bunch of
 

7295
02:12:35,460 --> 02:12:37,129
source I'm going to look to a bunch of
different perspectives on it's going to

7296
02:12:37,129 --> 02:12:37,139
different perspectives on it's going to
 

7297
02:12:37,139 --> 02:12:38,990
different perspectives on it's going to
be very tense there's probably going to

7298
02:12:38,990 --> 02:12:39,000
be very tense there's probably going to
 

7299
02:12:39,000 --> 02:12:41,689
be very tense there's probably going to
be some kind of bias maybe some

7300
02:12:41,689 --> 02:12:41,699
be some kind of bias maybe some
 

7301
02:12:41,699 --> 02:12:44,450
be some kind of bias maybe some
wording will be such which is one where

02:12:47,040 --> 02:12:50,030
this is where Wikipedia does its thing
the way they word stuff uh will be

7306
02:12:50,030 --> 02:12:50,040
the way they word stuff uh will be
 

7307
02:12:50,040 --> 02:12:53,330
the way they word stuff uh will be
biased the choice of words but the what

7308
02:12:53,330 --> 02:12:53,340
biased the choice of words but the what

Wikipedia editors themselves are so

7310
02:12:55,669 --> 02:12:55,679
Wikipedia editors themselves are so
 

7311
02:12:55,679 --> 02:12:57,109
Wikipedia editors themselves are so
self-reflective they literally have

7312
02:12:57,109 --> 02:12:57,119
self-reflective they literally have
 

7313
02:12:57,119 --> 02:12:59,629
self-reflective they literally have
articles describing these very effects

7314
02:12:59,629 --> 02:12:59,639
articles describing these very effects
 

7315
02:12:59,639 --> 02:13:02,870
articles describing these very effects
of how you can use words to inject bias

7316
02:13:02,870 --> 02:13:02,880
of how you can use words to inject bias
 

7317
02:13:02,880 --> 02:13:05,510
of how you can use words to inject bias
yeah in in all the ways that you talk

7318
02:13:05,510 --> 02:13:05,520
yeah in in all the ways that you talk
 

7319
02:13:05,520 --> 02:13:07,069
yeah in in all the ways that you talk
about it that's not healthier than most

7320
02:13:07,069 --> 02:13:07,079
about it that's not healthier than most
 

7321
02:13:07,079 --> 02:13:09,530
about it that's not healthier than most
environments it's incredibly healthy but

7322
02:13:09,530 --> 02:13:09,540
environments it's incredibly healthy but
 

7323
02:13:09,540 --> 02:13:11,330
environments it's incredibly healthy but
I think you could do better one of the

7324
02:13:11,330 --> 02:13:11,340
I think you could do better one of the
 

7325
02:13:11,340 --> 02:13:13,550
I think you could do better one of the
big flaws of Wikipedia to me that

big flaws of Wikipedia to me that
 

7327
02:13:13,560 --> 02:13:17,149
big flaws of Wikipedia to me that
Community uh notes on X does better is

Community uh notes on X does better is
 

7329
02:13:17,159 --> 02:13:20,149
Community uh notes on X does better is
the accessibility of becoming an editor

7330
02:13:20,149 --> 02:13:20,159
the accessibility of becoming an editor
 

7331
02:13:20,159 --> 02:13:22,310
the accessibility of becoming an editor
um is it's difficult to become an editor

7332
02:13:22,310 --> 02:13:22,320
um is it's difficult to become an editor
 

7333
02:13:22,320 --> 02:13:25,250
um is it's difficult to become an editor

7353
02:13:46,199 --> 02:13:49,250

hard to access but and I've also seen

7354
02:13:49,250 --> 02:13:49,260
hard to access but and I've also seen
 

7355
02:13:49,260 --> 02:13:52,370
hard to access but and I've also seen
how they will use certain articles like

7356
02:13:52,370 --> 02:13:52,380
how they will use certain articles like
 

7357
02:13:52,380 --> 02:13:54,770
how they will use certain articles like
on certain people like articles about

use those to make personal attacks and
 

7365
02:14:01,380 --> 02:14:02,470
use those to make personal attacks and
this is something you write about

7366
02:14:02,470 --> 02:14:02,480
this is something you write about
 

7367
02:14:02,480 --> 02:14:05,510
this is something you write about
they'll use uh descriptions of different

7368
02:14:05,510 --> 02:14:05,520
they'll use uh descriptions of different
 

7369
02:14:05,520 --> 02:14:07,790
they'll use uh descriptions of different
controversies to paint a picture of a

7370
02:14:07,790 --> 02:14:07,800
controversies to paint a picture of a
 

7371
02:14:07,800 --> 02:14:09,470
controversies to paint a picture of a
person that's

that doesn't to me at least feel like an
 

7375
02:14:11,579 --> 02:14:13,669
that doesn't to me at least feel like an
accurate representation of the person

7376
02:14:13,669 --> 02:14:13,679
accurate representation of the person
 

7377
02:14:13,679 --> 02:14:15,729
accurate representation of the person
it's like writing an article about

controversy you know yeah he is Feynman
 

7387
02:14:27,239 --> 02:14:29,330

human in terms of women but like there's
 

7393
02:14:34,800 --> 02:14:37,129
human in terms of women but like there's
other aspects to this human and to

02:14:37,129 --> 02:14:37,139
other aspects to this human and to
 

7395
02:14:37,139 --> 02:14:39,890
other aspects to this human and to
capture that human properly there's a

7396
02:14:39,890 --> 02:14:39,900
capture that human properly there's a
 

7397
02:14:39,900 --> 02:14:41,870
capture that human properly there's a
certain way to do it I think Wikipedia

7398
02:14:41,870 --> 02:14:41,880
certain way to do it I think Wikipedia
 

7399
02:14:41,880 --> 02:14:44,689
certain way to do it I think Wikipedia
will often lean they really try to be

7400
02:14:44,689 --> 02:14:44,699
will often lean they really try to be
 

7401
02:14:44,699 --> 02:14:46,669
will often lean they really try to be
self-reflective and

7402
02:14:46,669 --> 02:14:46,679
self-reflective and
 

7403
02:14:46,679 --> 02:14:48,890
self-reflective and
try to stop this but they will lean into

7404
02:14:48,890 --> 02:14:48,900
try to stop this but they will lean into
 

7405
02:14:48,900 --> 02:14:52,430
try to stop this but they will lean into
the drama if it matches the bias yeah

7406
02:14:52,430 --> 02:14:52,440
the drama if it matches the bias yeah
 

7407
02:14:52,440 --> 02:14:53,569
the drama if it matches the bias yeah
but again

7408
02:14:53,569 --> 02:14:53,579
but again
 

7409
02:14:53,579 --> 02:14:56,450
but again
much better than the world I believe is

7410
02:14:56,450 --> 02:14:56,460
much better than the world I believe is
 

7411
02:14:56,460 --> 02:14:58,129
much better than the world I believe is
much better

7412
02:14:58,129 --> 02:14:58,139
much better
 

7413
02:14:58,139 --> 02:15:00,950
much better
uh because Wikipedia exists but

7414
02:15:00,950 --> 02:15:00,960
uh because Wikipedia exists but
 

7415
02:15:00,960 --> 02:15:03,350

dangerous and that led to calling the
American mind and all that stuff

um we and I think that and this may
 

8153
02:28:01,439 --> 02:28:04,309
um we and I think that and this may
sound like it's an unrelated problem I

8154
02:28:04,309 --> 02:28:04,319
sound like it's an unrelated problem I
 

8155
02:28:04,319 --> 02:28:05,990
sound like it's an unrelated problem I
think if there were

8156
02:28:05,990 --> 02:28:06,000
think if there were
 

8157
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:09,050
think if there were
highly respected let's say extremely

8158
02:28:09,050 --> 02:28:09,060
highly respected let's say extremely
 

8159
02:28:09,060 --> 02:28:11,510
highly respected let's say extremely
difficult ways to prove that you're

8160
02:28:11,510 --> 02:28:11,520
difficult ways to prove that you're
 

8161
02:28:11,520 --> 02:28:13,010
difficult ways to prove that you're
extremely smart and hardworking that

8162
02:28:13,010 --> 02:28:13,020
extremely smart and hardworking that
 

8163
02:28:13,020 --> 02:28:14,990
extremely smart and hardworking that
cost little or nothing

8164
02:28:14,990 --> 02:28:15,000
cost little or nothing
 

8165
02:28:15,000 --> 02:28:17,450
cost little or nothing
that actually can give

8166
02:28:17,450 --> 02:28:17,460
that actually can give
 

8167
02:28:17,460 --> 02:28:19,790
that actually can give
the harvards and the yales of the world

8168
02:28:19,790 --> 02:28:19,800
the harvards and the yales of the world
 

8169
02:28:19,800 --> 02:28:21,410
the harvards and the yales of the world
to run for their money I think that

8170
02:28:21,410 --> 02:28:21,420
to run for their money I think that
 

8171
02:28:21,420 --> 02:28:22,849
to run for their money I think that
might be the most positive thing we

8172
02:28:22,849 --> 02:28:22,859
might be the most positive thing we
 

8173
02:28:22,859 --> 02:28:24,770
might be the most positive thing we
could do to to deal with a lot of these

8174
02:28:24,770 --> 02:28:24,780
could do to to deal with a lot of these
 

8175
02:28:24,780 --> 02:28:26,389
could do to to deal with a lot of these
problems and why

8176
02:28:26,389 --> 02:28:26,399
problems and why
 

8177
02:28:26,399 --> 02:28:29,929
problems and why
I think the fact that we have become a

8178
02:28:29,929 --> 02:28:29,939
I think the fact that we have become a
 

8179
02:28:29,939 --> 02:28:32,630
I think the fact that we have become a
weird America with a great anti-elitist

8180
02:28:32,630 --> 02:28:32,640
weird America with a great anti-elitist
 

8181
02:28:32,640 --> 02:28:35,030
weird America with a great anti-elitist
tradition has become weirdly elitist in

8182
02:28:35,030 --> 02:28:35,040
tradition has become weirdly elitist in
 

8183
02:28:35,040 --> 02:28:37,610
tradition has become weirdly elitist in
this in in the respect that we not only

8184
02:28:37,610 --> 02:28:37,620
this in in the respect that we not only
 

8185
02:28:37,620 --> 02:28:39,889
this in in the respect that we not only
again are our leadership coming from

8186
02:28:39,889 --> 02:28:39,899
again are our leadership coming from
 

8187
02:28:39,899 --> 02:28:43,010
again are our leadership coming from
these few fancy schools we actually have

8188
02:28:43,010 --> 02:28:43,020
these few fancy schools we actually have
 

8189
02:28:43,020 --> 02:28:44,750
these few fancy schools we actually have
like great admiration for them we kind

8190
02:28:44,750 --> 02:28:44,760
like great admiration for them we kind
 

8191
02:28:44,760 --> 02:28:47,150
like great admiration for them we kind
of look up to them but I think we'd have

8192
02:28:47,150 --> 02:28:47,160
of look up to them but I think we'd have
 

8193
02:28:47,160 --> 02:28:48,950
of look up to them but I think we'd have
a lot healthier of a society If people

8194
02:28:48,950 --> 02:28:48,960
a lot healthier of a society If people
 

8195
02:28:48,960 --> 02:28:51,650
a lot healthier of a society If people
could prove you know their excellence in

8196
02:28:51,650 --> 02:28:51,660
could prove you know their excellence in
 

8197
02:28:51,660 --> 02:28:53,270
could prove you know their excellence in
ways that are coming from completely

8198
02:28:53,270 --> 02:28:53,280
ways that are coming from completely
 

8199
02:28:53,280 --> 02:28:55,610
ways that are coming from completely
different streams and and that that are

8200
02:28:55,610 --> 02:28:55,620
different streams and and that that are
 

8201
02:28:55,620 --> 02:28:56,929
different streams and and that that are
highly respected I sometimes talk about

8202
02:28:56,929 --> 02:28:56,939
highly respected I sometimes talk about
 

8203
02:28:56,939 --> 02:28:59,330

hundred people can pass some other way
 

8219
02:29:15,720 --> 02:29:17,030
hundred people can pass some other way
of actually

8220
02:29:17,030 --> 02:29:17,040
of actually
 

8221
02:29:17,040 --> 02:29:19,070
of actually
um uh of not going through these massive

8222
02:29:19,070 --> 02:29:19,080
um uh of not going through these massive
 

8223
02:29:19,080 --> 02:29:20,929
um uh of not going through these massive
bloated expensive institutions that

8224
02:29:20,929 --> 02:29:20,939
bloated expensive institutions that
 

8225
02:29:20,939 --> 02:29:22,490
bloated expensive institutions that
people can raise their hands and say I'm

8226
02:29:22,490 --> 02:29:22,500
people can raise their hands and say I'm
 

8227
02:29:22,500 --> 02:29:24,590
people can raise their hands and say I'm
smart and hardworking I think that could

8228
02:29:24,590 --> 02:29:24,600
smart and hardworking I think that could
 

8229
02:29:24,600 --> 02:29:26,809
smart and hardworking I think that could
be an incredibly healthy uh way I think

8230
02:29:26,809 --> 02:29:26,819
be an incredibly healthy uh way I think
 

8231
02:29:26,819 --> 02:29:28,490
be an incredibly healthy uh way I think
we need additional streams for Creative

8232
02:29:28,490 --> 02:29:28,500
we need additional streams for Creative
 

8233
02:29:28,500 --> 02:29:29,990
we need additional streams for Creative
people to be solving problems whether

8234
02:29:29,990 --> 02:29:30,000
people to be solving problems whether
 

8235
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:32,270
people to be solving problems whether
that's on X or someplace else

8236
02:29:32,270 --> 02:29:32,280
that's on X or someplace else
 

8237
02:29:32,280 --> 02:29:33,530
that's on X or someplace else
um I think that there's lots of things

8238
02:29:33,530 --> 02:29:33,540
um I think that there's lots of things
 

8239
02:29:33,540 --> 02:29:35,389
um I think that there's lots of things
that technology could do to really help

8240
02:29:35,389 --> 02:29:35,399
that technology could do to really help
 

8241
02:29:35,399 --> 02:29:37,130
that technology could do to really help
with this I think some of the stuff that

8242
02:29:37,130 --> 02:29:37,140
with this I think some of the stuff that
 

8243
02:29:37,140 --> 02:29:39,170
with this I think some of the stuff that
Sal Khan is working on uh at Khan

8244
02:29:39,170 --> 02:29:39,180
Sal Khan is working on uh at Khan
 

8245
02:29:39,180 --> 02:29:40,849
Sal Khan is working on uh at Khan
Academy could really help

8246
02:29:40,849 --> 02:29:40,859
Academy could really help
 

8247
02:29:40,859 --> 02:29:42,650
Academy could really help
um so I think there's a lot of ways but

8248
02:29:42,650 --> 02:29:42,660
um so I think there's a lot of ways but
 

8249
02:29:42,660 --> 02:29:44,750
um so I think there's a lot of ways but
they exist largely around coming up with

8250
02:29:44,750 --> 02:29:44,760
they exist largely around coming up with
 

8251
02:29:44,760 --> 02:29:46,550
they exist largely around coming up with
new ways of doing things not just

8252
02:29:46,550 --> 02:29:46,560
new ways of doing things not just
 

8253
02:29:46,560 --> 02:29:49,969
new ways of doing things not just
expecting the old things that have say

8254
02:29:49,969 --> 02:29:49,979
expecting the old things that have say
 

8255
02:29:49,979 --> 02:29:52,790
expecting the old things that have say
40 billion dollars in the bank that

8256
02:29:52,790 --> 02:29:52,800
